I'm the kind of person who likes to read the book before the movie. I was struck by the grit that Hogan portrays when describing this section of Boston. While comparisons can be made to Dennis Lehane, I think Hogan brings a unique view to this story. On the surface, it appears to be a run of the mill action/heist story, but at its core, this novel is a riveting tale of forbidden love and the struggle to overcome the limitations of class and family."},{"rating":"2","title":"DeWalt's 2 hp Plunge Router","review":"DeWalt's 2 hp Plunge Router is the best choice for a middle of the road place for the plunge router. It's both basic and heavy duty for most tasks. The dust collection port is a added plus improvement over DeWalt's version of the Elu plunge routers. This is a plunge router that defintely has a significant place in my shop but, in my opinion, the plunge router is really not the best router to use for router table use if that's how you plan to use it.

It's a wonderful little compendium of prayers and devotions including those of St. Bridget of Sweden and the 15 Miraculous prayers given to her. As if the dozens of prayers themselves were not enough, this booklet also includes the promises that are attached to them. Amazingly, there are even promises attached to carrying the booklet around itself! I cannot vouch for the authenticity of the promises, but most of the prayers are quite common and can easily found in other prayer books. Included are prayers to St. Michael, prayers said for the dying, spiritual communion, for souls in purgatory, and much more. It's perfect size allows me to carry it anywhere for reflection when I have a few moments during the day. Don't hesitate to purchase this book. I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sound , sexy and stylish . Nice to have a usb.","review":"I love this stereo , best purchase I have made in a long time.

I took it to a local shop, and was told the whole CD system was broken, and the part would cost him 180.00, without labor. This unit cost my daughter 170.00, which is no small amount of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Romance, not science fiction","review":"If a way I should be happy I bought this book, because it gives me hope that, bad a writer as I am, I could one day publish a book. Two specifics:1. This is a romance novel, not a science fiction novel. If you want to read a science fiction novel like I did, don't buy this.2. The writing style belabored. An example appears early in the book when the same event is presented from two different character's perspectives. This is done very clunkily (is that a word?), as if the author is unable to 'get inside the skin' of the characters. Unfortunately, this inability to present three dimensional characters continues. It reads like a longer version of a high school essay."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Military SF","review":"Unique background and setting that was a lot of fun. Interesting and believable characters. Only a couple minor things detract from it. For example, in a universe that I suppose consists of millions or billions of people, characters are managing to bump into each other on the surface as if it were a village of a few dozen people. Also, there are a lot of characters, many of whom don't have a significant role. Too many to keep track of. But I thought Jodenny was great."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little bit of everything SF...","review":"Part military SF, part space opera, and part science fiction romance, it's a very enjoyable read, with a plot that I thought would be simple but became rather complex. The writing is very smooth, very strong, and the characters are believable, especially in their faults. Reading this made me excited to read the next book in the series, and that's always a plus."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great first sc-fi novel","review":"The author is straight on with military life, You could put the characters on a modern navy ship instead of a space-ship and they would fit right in!The story is fast-paced and with some great action! I highly recommend this for those who like military sc-fi.When are the sequels arriving! Put me on the per-order list!"},{"rating":"2","title":"better than i thought","review":"When I read the first few pages of this book, I was not impressed. It seemed hard to understand and used a background that was strange. The next day, i picked it up again and before I quit, I had read it from cover to cover, twice. It could use more explanation as to the background universe but the main beauty is the developement of the characters. They were well written, believable, and likeable. The author, having served as a U.S. Naval officer, has the military down pat. Don't give up after the first few pages, keep reading, it's worth it.I hope this is just the first in a long series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivating series","review":"I actually read this one first...not realizing it was a part of a trilogy...so I purchased all 3...then reread it after I read the other 2....captivating series...didn't want to put them down!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't wait to read more!","review":"This was a very nice story! At times I couldn't put the Kindle down, but at other points I couldn't wait to get through it! It took a twist in the middle that I didn't think would happen, so overall I would highly recommend this book! For a free read (or even if you have to pay for it), it was great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Troublesome Creek","review":"This is the story of a sixteen year old girl, Cooper, living in a small village in Kentuky in the 1800s. Her stepmother wants her to become a lady and wishes to send her away in boarding school. Cooper wants to stay home.I had a hard time getting throught the first half of the book. The plot moves back and forth in time, the author concentrating first on Cooper, then her father, then her step-mother, back on Cooper, her childhood friend etc. All of this felt confusing and kept me from being interested in Cooper's story. It didn't help that all the characters act like if they're angels. No one makes mistakes, gets angry, drunk, uncharitable or even says anything stupid. They did not feel real to me. People are not perfect. Only God is.Respectfully, I found that the christian content overwhelmed the plot. I especially didn't care for (what felt like) pages after pages of sermon. This may be a big turn-off for some readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful read, hard to put down!","review":"This was my first book of this author and I was very please, I really downloaded it because it was a free ebook and it was hard to put down and kept me up way into the night, I loved the mountians and this book was full of wonderful suprises, I would recommend you read it, I am on the second book to this series and will want to read more from this aurthor, plan on readying the 3rd book too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Christian trappings, without Christian morals","review":"As a generic book, this would be a fairly well-written piece. Unfortunately, as a work of \\"Christian fiction\\", i was greatly disappointed with it.The book starts out with a very bad moral choice, and ends with a bad moral choice.Some books can do that, but yet make it clear the choice is wrong. However, this author seems to go out of her way to say the bad choices, were actually the RIGHT choices.That makes it an anti-Christian work to my view. That makes it even worse than a general immoral book, because it presents itself as Christian.Very unhappy with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good grief!","review":"This book left me shaking my head and wondering why I was still reading it. I made it only through the first 1/4 then deleted it from my Kindle. The romance was ridiculous. I think the writer had some good ideas but could use some help with dialogue. The cheese factor was a little too high for my liking.I do, however, highly recommend Fireflies in December by Jennifer Erin Valent...also a Kindle freebie and written well! A real page turner."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wasted my time","review":"This book is by far the most boring book I have ever read and was a great disappointment for me. All the characters are dull and lack personality. It is totally predictable and in short nothing of any interest happens in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"a great read","review":"I thought this book was a delightful read. I, too, liked the unpredictability and the reality of life experiences found in Troublesome Creek. I was strengthened by the characters' reliance on their faith to carry them through whatever life brought their way. I can't wait for the sequel! I can't wait to see what happens to these folks next and I've got a feeling Jan Watson has more to say."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful characters & story!","review":"Jan Watson's first published novel does a wonderful job at making the characters come alive, using flashbacks as a tool to give history & depth. Her descriptions of the way of life during the 1800's and the Kentucky landscape make you feel as if you are there. And the characters struggles with faith & trust in God are very realistic and spoke to my heart. I definitely look forward to reading more stories of Copper & her family."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well written and grabs your attention","review":"This book takes place in the late 1800s and is about a young lady and the challenges of growing up in the mountains of eastern Kentucky.

Stuart leaves no stone unturned and no issue unaddressed, and this is definitely a good work to consult for serious study of Exodus. Stuart has exceptional knowledge of Hebrew and is able to clearly explain several issues of translation and interpretation that may have been traditionally confusing to readers of Exodus.If this book has a weakness, it is a marked tendency to press the language of text towards a rigid literal meaning. There are places where it feels like Stuart is trying too hard to make the straightforward literal meaning of the text square with reality, even when the text is clearly being using a figure of speech or a metaphor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Abba karaoke","review":"Considering all the Abba karaoke cd's I have now, this is my least favorite.

The cover of the book is very flimsy."},{"rating":"1","title":"1/2 Star - Too basic, I need quality training.","review":"I was disappointed how little I got out of the book and how unprepared I felt to tackle the challenges of my business application for which I am creating help.

Then I read \\"Home.\\" The basic premise has promise but the execution is strictly hack work. I had to wonder if the book misclassified and was intended for the Young Adult audience. Even pre-teens deserve better than this.\\"Home\\" is a bizarre hybrid of the Nancy Drew novels and the Harlequin Romance series. The characters are one dimensional, at best, and their actions are so random they defy belief. The writing is often cringe-worthy. Where was the editor for this book? Was there an editor? The book reads like the output from a vanity press.If you are a Sci-Fi fan, skip this book.

It does this very well, but steam is not always the best cleaning solution. For example, on carpet, I have to use a vacuum, then the steamer, then vacuum again. The carpet looks good, but it's a lot of work. It did not work well on my tub basin -it was not able to knock off the grime that I leave from sports and car repair. It worked okay on my car wheels, although it takes a knack to make most of the dirt drain onto the road. I still needed to spot clean the wheels with a rag. Works great of shirts.

After all these years, they take a crew of younger people including their own grandsons and granddaughters back to the beaches where they fought. They explain WHY Iwo was so important to the war effort, why it was worth so many men giving their lives, and how it helped to end the war. They praise God, and also pay tribute to the many who did not live thru the battle.Many times historical accounts of the War fail to focus in on the reasons, what lead up to the war, or to put a face on the conflict.

I have not washed them yet -- I'll try to report back on how the sheets fare -- I just wanted to warn people about how cheap these sheets look. If you want quality, don't go here.

It deals with, and focuses on, the principles and philosophies of publicity as they relate to the business professional who is attempting to maximize the visibility of their product, service or organization.

I mean this book is really bad... after I read the whole thing, I felt like I hadn't learned much more than I already knew from watching the movies. First of all, this book is about the Army, not all branches of the Military - so if you are intrested in the Coast Guard or Navy like I am, this book is a total waste of time. A friend of mine from my graduating class is thinking about going into the Army. He read the first 20 pages of my copy and said he couldn't take it anymore and gave it back to me.

This book is filled with information you can't get anywhere else and I feel it's a valuable tool for any delayed entry recruit. I will say the book is geared more towards U.S. Army recruits than other branchs but most of the information is universal in nature. The author and I have remained close friends ever since Basic and I wish every day that some of my new soldiers had read this book before getting on that plane for boot camp."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insight and Informative","review":"This book took a very candid look at what basic training offers.

I put the kettle on to boil and it never whistled, so I went to check it and the whole whistle contraption had melted and was dripping down the teapot!! I emailed the company and they promised to send me another one but I am very dubious about using it, why would a new one be any different? But we'll see...at least they said they would replace it."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Third One !","review":"I love the balance, relatively light weight, and the fact that it has a lid that comes off for filling along with a whistle spout that self-opens to pour when you pick up the kettle. They heat up fast too. But they don't last forever, and they're not cheap. Rust, chipping, or melting of the plastic cover of the spout get them eventually. Also, I had to go through some exchanges to get replacements with a loud enough whistle and/or no leaking around the handle base. But I love this kettle so much that it was worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this tea kettle for the price","review":"This tea kettle works great, especially for the price. The handle is comfortable, and it pours easily. It also has a nice wide opening and good whistle. I just caution against putting on the \\"power burner\\" of a gas burner. The large flame came up over the top and began to melt the black pouring cap."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Bible -- in French","review":"Cette version francaise est actuellement la traduction originale de la Bible de Jerusalem.This is a wonderful translation -- direct from the Latin Vulgate -- for French readers. French is my third language, and I'm not fully fluent, but the words are simple and there is not much difficulty in understanding the vocabulary. The language is poetic in places, and really flows wonderfully.The Jerusalem Bible (in English) was actually translated from this version. It is a great reading source for practicing your French language skills, the translation is well-respected (especially for its copious, detailed footnotes), and I have facilitated my study of the language by using an English Bible and this French one side by side."},{"rating":"1","title":"the rhythms were offbeat","review":"I seem to be at odds with most of the other reviewers who thought the book started slow and later picked up speed. I personally was rather intrigued with the beginning and very interested in Cora's story. I agree with the Publisher's Weekly review that it could have been a great characterization of Cora and her struggles, but it passed over many years to start the story of Emma and quickly became uneven and full of holes. The part of Parris was so short and uninteresting compared to the other two that I believe even Ms. Hill grew bored with her rambling story and just wanted to hurry up and finish it. For a more well-written (minus the empty fluff) generational story of mothers and daughters, read Cane River by Lalita Tademy or the Joy Luck Club by Amy Tan"},{"rating":"2","title":"Slow at first but picks up","review":"This book started off kind of slow. I was getting very discouraged in the beginning but as I continued to read it finally picked up. It was an interesting tale of dreams and reality. There were hard lessons learned in this book. There were choices made that affected generation after generation. I can say the author kept you on feet wondering if the secrets of the past would come out to change the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must have","review":"This is beyond a must read, this is a must have. I enjoyed all the characters, and the imagery in this book was spectacular. Loved it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hayes","review":"I think this game had pretty good gameplay. I think they could have put more effort in to the fact the some of the scenary was just long hallways and office rooms. The graphics was good but i have scene better. Over all it is a good game for people who like shooting with not many guns and like to shoots hundreds of bad guys. When in the movie there was about 20-30."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"If I could return this game, I would. The gameplay is non-sensical and the graphics are pretty stale by the current standards. Just buy the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad from the Demo","review":"I just played the demo on my 1.6 Ghz with GeForce 3 and the game was all choppy even at the lowest settings. The combat was very tedious too. I tried to shoot an enemy throught a thin wooden table with an MP5 and it didn't even go through. Hopefully the final game will be improved."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm Surprised","review":"Let me star out with saying that this game is really very fun and I am rather surprised at how badly it got rated. When I received a demo of this game I found it partly origional because of the three health meaters (heart, starmina, and moral)and me being a big Die Hard fan liked how closely it followed the origial story line, but after some surfing the web, I realized that on average this game got a 2/5 from most all major game companies. This confused me, so I played more of the demo and ended up beatig it. It was so fun that I went out and bought Die Hard: Nakatomi Plaza that very same day. To rap up, if you loved Half Life, Max Payne, Unreal Tournament, and Die Hard 1, 2, and 3, then my suggestion to you is to disreguard the other ratings and buy this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"So so kinda game.","review":"This game really doesn't have a replay value as like Medal of honor:AA, one reason is theres no multi player mode where you can play others online, that woulda been cool. As for the graphics goes, it was done very nicely and clean. I guess what killed it for me is the additional levels added to the game didn't really if none at all, fit the movie senario. But they were still fun to explore. Like many have already mention, the ending was terrible. Think god I use a god mode cheat all throughout the game, b/c if you swet it out throughout this game your gonna get a rude awaking when you see the simple to short ending cutscene. The only interesting thing about this game is the attention to detail of the levels, and it was fun to explore them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Buy if you Loved Die Hard","review":"When I first got this game I thought it was very cool. I played it 'til the end, and now I just started replaying it. Good. Very well made. The replayability isn't that great, unless you wait a long time and forget everything that happens. Hiding Hans's face was kind of a joke for the first half of the game. Very repetitive, though. My expressions while playing changed from: \\"Yippee kai yay\\" to: \\"Surprise, surprise, another terrorist.\\" All of 'em pretty much look the same. The game does have it's moments, though. Like the feature of being able to live that scene of jumping off the roof was pretty darn cool. All in all, since this game is [cheap], buy it, I liked it."},{"rating":"1","title":"not so happy","review":"the thing i dont like about it is i have to wait for several minutes before i can fill the tank again with water. also it takes awhile for it to heat up. but since i already have it i might as well use it. it works well though once it heats up"},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of money","review":"This didn't clean anything that a good sponge wouldn't clean, and it took more time.

It suppose to save you time but creates a bigger mess then you started."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't think is that \\"Hot\\".","review":"This enviro steamer is too expensive for what it really does. To clean a small area of tile in my shower I had to put water 3 times because the Hot Shot's water tank is too small. This steamer doesn't really remove grease or mildew by itself without scrubbing like they advertise on TV. The handle is not \\"hand\\" friendly. After a little while my hand started hurting and I couldn't hold the darn thing straight because it kept sliding. If I would have known that this gadget wasn't going to be worthwhile I wouldn't have bought it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed in the Hotshot...","review":"The steam isn't pressurized too much, so you have to hold the nozzle right against the surface to blow away any dirt, and then it often leaves a residue behind and only wets the item. It didn't do anything for my shower door, but it was handy for cleaning in the shower door track and other hard to reach places. The Hotshot did a good job on the mirror, but then the mirror was so wet that it had to be wiped anyway, so it didn't save any work. The final blow is the tiny water tank. You can only clean for a short time before needing to refill. When refilling, you have to wait 3 minutes for the boiler to cool, and three minutes for it to heat back up after adding water. It's going back tomorrow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless","review":"I'm an engineer, a mom, a volunteer and we're renovating our house. Something has to give and it's usually housework. ANYTHING that says it might in any way possibly cut the time, effort or drudergy of cleaning a house has my full attention. I was really hoping this would help in some way- either make it easier to clean screens, clean the bath tub or even just steam the wallpaper off the walls. This bats .000. If you're looking for something that leaves big pools of dirty water, a fine mush of insect parts and mud in screen channels and promotes mold by raising the humidty, this is for you. If not, 409 and a scrubber are your best bet. Mine goes back tomorrow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why no audio sample?","review":"How do you expect to sell this without an audio sample? It is an older recording and the sound may be subpar. I heard this a while back on the radio but they didn't announce the artist.

The first CD contains all the hits - or rather best known tracks - from the band with the exception of 'Baby's Got A Temper' which is a big shame, as it is a great single. Good news for those who will buy the DVD - that one does have 'Baby'The second CD contains remixes and a few live tracks, which doesn't add too much to this compilation, except some curiosity to known versions. The live songs are ok, although it leaves you hungry for more live material - can we have a live album, please??.Anyway, this is a great compilation from a great dance band and will keep you toe-tapping along for a long time.

Altogether a pretty good album, though!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Intense Emotional Rock Music","review":"This album is a refreshing change from all those rock bands out there with empty lyrics.

Breaking Benjamins new cd has one great song on it and thats the diary of jane. I even told my girlfriend that I was nervous about this cd, and she said why? I told her thats because BB always releases great singles but they never release great cd's except for saturate. wow they have declined downhill and I was not impressed at all. they are a good band yes indeed, but this is not worth the listen, unless u are new to rock music, this might be a good starter. dont put to much time into this album, especially when one song tells the tale-- diary of jane... no more one hit wonder albums please"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too bad!!!!","review":"I was hoping that this would be great. I loved We Are Not Alone and Saturate so I expected something really good. I was very dissappointed, because this album only has a couple good songs (You,Diary of Jane,Breath) and everything else is just really ordinary and boring!!! I mean this album is not terrible , but its just not really worth buying (unless your willing to spend like $[...] on 3 songs). I would however recommend We Are Not Alone or Saturate to anybody!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Great Album","review":"I first heard BB from my roomate in college. He always had the Saturate album playing and it caught on with me quick. When the We Are Not Alone album was released, I instantly went out, picked it up, and absolutly loved it. So when I found out BB had Phobia coming out a couple months ago, I have been waiting with great anticipation, and I can truley say I am not at all disappointed. Every song on this album has its own great qualities to it. My favorite songs are Toplees and Breathe. All the other songs are great also. This is definatly a must have for any body who likes just the littlest bit of the BB sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"Phobia ROCKS!","review":"The Third album release from Breaking Benjamin, is by far their best yet.They have continued to bring exciting and fresh music to the world of rock music. The stand out track on this album is \\"Unknown Soldier\\". What an amazing song.You HAVE to get this album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"Breaking Benjamin has been my favorite band for many years now, and their CD Phobia only affirms that I have made the right choice. The utterly perfect combination of all of the instrumental elements and Ben Burnley's vocal performance crash together to create a very new sound. Whether you like serious power cords or hard hitting lyrics, Breaking Benjamin has it all!Of course, I can't say that I absolutely love the entire album and wouldn't change a thing. I do find myself skipping through some songs (such as \\"You\\" or \\"Here We Are\\") but even when I just let the CD play through I still find myself getting captured by their music.I recommend to everyone who likes a good, hard hitting rock band."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best offering yet from BB","review":"These guys have a refreshing sound in the jam-packed major-label hard rock scene. When you hear a BB song on the radio, you know it's them. They have had some decent success over the last few years with some hit singles like \\"So Cold\\" and \\"Diary of Jane\\". While those are two of their best songs, Phobia, their 3rd major label album, is full of other great songs. If you like their hits, buy the whole album. There is plenty more where those came from."},{"rating":"2","title":"No need to have a phobia about this album!","review":"Not sure what to say other than...this album ROCKS! Breaking Benjamin prove that they have musicl skill and are great song-writers. Ben put his soul into this record and it shows. From 'Diary of Jane' to 'Fight Me'...each have their own unique sound. I can't turn it off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Album","review":"Breaking Benjamin return with their third album \\"Phobia\\" and i must say it is their best yet.

I dont think its as good. as W.A.N.A (2nd album)but it is darn close. Diary of Jane is incredible and \\"You\\" are my two favorite tracks. Although the music is similar to other bands like staind and earshot Ben Burley's voice is the difference maker, he can sing and scream with the best like no other. A soild 4 star album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Breaking Benjamin has sold themselves out","review":"Want some good music? Check out their earlier albums, We Are Not Alone and Saturate, because this is not the Breaking Benjamin I know and love. This is Breaking Benjamin gone emo after having sold themselves out. With the exceptions of The Diary of Jane, Until the End, and Broken Soul, this could be one of the most disappointing, as well as misleading, albums I have ever listened to. Breaking Benjamin went mainstream after the release of Sooner or Later in late 2004, and their fame has obviously taken it's toll. Breath was the big hit off this album... but, in my opinion, this song was just okay. The entire album gives me that impression. They've gone from the highest of high to... well, I'm not sure about the lowest of low, but pretty far down there.Shame. They are following in the footsteps of Slipknot, Atreyu, Taproot, Staind, and possibly Seether and Trapt; were once owned by their passion of music, now they're owned by the record label."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"Minus one star right off the bat for having a lame intro and outro. Diary of Jane is the only great song on this album. 2 or 3 good songs, and the rest just sounds so generic and uninspired. We Are Not Alone was a great album and so was Saturate. It sounds like the energy was lost in this album. I'm not counting the band out yet, but if you want your BB fix stick with the first two albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorites","review":"Nearly every song on this CD gets 5 stars on my ipod. Really talented musicians at the top of their craft."},{"rating":"2","title":"An honest (short) review","review":"Like most people who enjoyed Breaking Benjamin's past efforts (mainly We Are Not Alone), I was a bit surprised to hear the shift in sound. Phobia showcases a softer, more melodic breaking benjamin, with emphasis on strong, hooky chorus' and vocals. If you think back to staind's transition from dysfunction and break the cycle to 14 shades of grey, you'll get a pretty good idea of where Breaking Benjamin went with Phobia. It's more accessible, less aggressive, and very catchy.All these long, editorial style reviews need to stop. These are the facts. Use them to make a decision for yourself. The End."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good listen","review":"Diary of Jane is definitely the most prominent song on the cd, but all of the songs are pretty good. It is a mellow cd so pick something else up if you want something with a little more kick."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Phobia\\" is the best album of 2006!!!","review":"Wow! When I first heard this CD I knew that it was the best album of 2006!!! I love all of the songs on here! My favorite one is \\"YOU.\\" It is a good song! But I really love the whole CD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"This album as a whole is more polished than \\"We Are Not Alone\\" (for instance, someone stopped the singer from doing that \\"hiccup\\" sound at the end of a lot of his lines), but is really more of the same. The hooks (which are important with this kind of \\"radio-rock\\") aren't as catchy, and the lyrics aren't great. Plus, you've already heard the best two songs on the radio. I hope the next one is better, cause I like their sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's (Almost) All Filler","review":"There are two singles on this 13 track LP entitled \\"Phobia\\".Can you spot them? Listen real hard...You're right! The Diary Of Jane and Breathe are both singles.As for the rest of Phobia, let's just say that calling it cheap, disposable, \\"anyone could write a hook like that\\" GARBAGE is being more than fair.I had to pinch myself to make sure I wasn't dreaming by the time Topless hit. Could the once untouchable Breaking Benjamin really reduce themselves to such an awful, boring sound?Everything that made these guys unique is gone on Phobia. Following Breathe, the album takes a turn for the worst one song after another. It's generic, yes, but generic can also sometimes be listenable. Save for the obvious two singles, I hope I never have to listen to anything on Phobia again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Phobia","review":"Breaking Benjamin's previous album \\"We Are Not Alone\\" was the first time I had heard BB and it blew me away after I had finally listened to the entire CD. I didn't care if this new album was good or not, I wanted to buy it. The CD did not dissapoint in any way. At first it seemed that alot of the songs were similar, but I was hooked and I've been listening to it for the past three days straight. I feel that this CD is not quite as good as their previous effort, but extremely close and still merits a five star rating."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's not enough, it never is.","review":"I popped this CD in my car the day it came out, and I just let it play. I didn't really listen to it. For a week or so I let it play, not really enjoying much besides Diary of Jane, and then took it out of my CD player. A few weeks later I decided to give it a second chance, and that time around I gave it a real listen. This CD might not catch you right away, it may take awhile to truly appreciate. At first I thought this album was a bit of a letdown after two terrific CD's from Breaking Benjamin. I thought this one just doesn't have what the others do. It's true, its not like the other albums. It's darker, it's heavy, and it's textured and emotive. This album has grown to one of my all time favorites, and that is a short list. Breaking Benjamin isn't a band that is going to continue to write the same album over and over. That's why they will always be one of my favorites.

The only song that stuck in my head was THe Diary of Jane, and the softer version of it at the end is good too. There were a few other songs with good chord progressions that I don't remember the names of, but overall I hated the lyrics and the guitar progressions were simply boring. Don't buy this album, or the other Breaking Benjamin CDs. They're not any good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poop","review":"Its Poop, and \\"poop\\" is the only word befitting this perversion of music.

Like many of the other reviewers, pick it up after i return it, its definately not worth a full price purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great! If all you listen to is ballads.............","review":"This has been a year of disappointing music and Breaking Benjamin is no exception. This album is just one slow song after another. The only song that sounds like Breaking Benjamin is Diary of Jane. The rest is basically one ballad after another. There are no real rock songs on here. I have been a fan since Saturate and loved We are not alone as well but let's face it these guys dropped the ball on this one. Do not support this cd so Breaking Benjamin can get back to making excellent cds like I know they can."},{"rating":"1","title":"i have a phobia of breaking benjamin","review":"theres nothing much to see here breaking benjamin is just another major label sellout with lyrics that have been done over and over again. the amount of angst in this music is obviously fake. this is a not a band but a major label marketing technique."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect atmospheric, downtempo rock.","review":"From the depths of San Francisco comes Thee Shallows. A darkish, moody album driven by layered guitars, piano, a cello, and a group of drunken fools! Do yourself a favor and check out this album.

I wanted to make sure it wasn't a failure. I waited for the reviews to pop up, and as soon as they started getting published on the web, I read each and every one of them. Then I decided to buy the game and I am so glad I did. The graphics, the sounds, the atmosphere and the ability to play as the alien, predator and the marine all add up to one high quality game. The work that has gone into developing this game is evident from the start. I love singleplayer so I was actually a bit dissapointed to find that the singleplayer mission aren't that long. I expected something maybe not as long as No One Lives Forever, but at least close to it in terms of singleplayer play time. Still, this is a great game that the fans of the films should enjoy. I gave it 4 stars because of the short singleplayer experience which excites you and then finishes. Good job Monolith!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A bunch of fun for fans","review":"This game is suprisingly fun, especially for fans of the Predator and Alien movies -- all of the sounds, weapons, and visuals are true to both movies.

It just looks like you guy is skooting along the ground. And the balance is no good. Preds can cloak, and to make it worse, they can regenerate their energy any stinkin' time they want! The marines always die in one shot, only have one alternate vision mode (and it's no good). The Aliens can walk on walls, but every time they charge to kill someone, they get killed in a couple shots, and they are still usually about a mile away from their foe.

The game has amazing environment detail, but the aliens look kind of strange compared to the 1st. Overall, a great game with great graphics and weird aliens!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun game to play","review":"I was looking for something fun to play while games were in development so I picked up avp2 in the discount bin. This game is incredible. I played the marine mission because the feeling of being hunted far outweighed the interest to play a non-human species.This is a fast-paced, adrenaline-pumping game. I can't even describe the fear [and thrill] of a single or dozen aliens charging straight at me. I often wondered if my neighbors could hear my screams because let me tell you, I screamed a lot.The multi-player gaming will keep your interest for a long time. I find the marine to be boring during online gaming so I stick with the predalien unless I'm needed to balance the races.I'm an avid fps gamer. This one won't disappoint you except for 1 thing: it should have been a longer a game. I also purchased the Primal Hunt expansion for more fun.

It is possible that my review is biased in that I only played the game for 2 days but frankly it just isn't enjoyable enough to make me want to play more. There are many interesting ideas included here and it had great potential which was lost in the actual game play and level design. The interface although fairly intuitive leaves somthing to be desired. The level design is fairly standard fare for FPS games, the usual save often instead of use your head ... I can not say if the multi-player was well done becouse I have already moved on to another title. People who are great fans of FPS games will probably enjoy it regardless of its flaws. But for the rest of us aside from a few graphic improvments and some cool licenceing concepts you might as well just blow the dust off your old copy of doom, and re install it ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Resource - Fills in the Details That Other Books Don't Offer","review":"I learned FrontPage 2003 using 'How to Do Everything with Microsoft Office FrontPage 2003', which is a very good book to start with, but as I developed some skills, I started asking myself questions about how I might go a little further or why some things were the way they were with the program. I found 'Inside Out' gave me a lot of answers to big and little questions that I never saw explained in any other published text (I have five FrontPage 2003 books). Each chapter stands alone, so that you don't have to build up your knowledge to understand any particular chapter by having only read from the beginning. I am using the book right now and improving my website every day. A very good resource. Much better than the FrontPage 2003 Bible, which I checked out from the library.

The characters were annoying and one dimensional. It almost felt as though I had missed the whole first half of the book or maybe the second half -I listened to it on audio and had to recheck the download because the plot holes were so enormous and the author's attempts at being humorous failed miserably. I trudged through the entire book and less than eight hours later I was hard-pressed to name one single character. I read at least a book a week and I am also an author of three traditionally published books and I have to question how this book made it to publication. and I can't comment on the line editing but I would imagine that is also unprofessional.

Very difficult for the reader to keep track of the twenty-odd characters in \\"The Game.\\" The characterizations are poor and no reason is given for the reader to care about these people. The plot is so tenuous and obscure that it is an effort to maintain interest. By the time you find out what has been happening and why - you just don't give a d---.

Its written more in the male perspective and more about the African American male and his role in the subjugation of African American women. Although at times its it really repetitive, it gets the point across and keeps you turning the pages. The only downfall is the authors are trying to make the argument that all actions within the African American community, especially male actions, can be traced back to slavery. While that may be true (or not), it makes you think about whether that argument really is valid in 2010. All together though a great read and worth the Amazon price.Happy Reading!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What in the world happened to World 2004?","review":"World 2002 and World 2003 are two of my most favorite CDs. Their songs are modern, lively, and really catchy. World 2004 seems like it's gone to \\"payola\\", a term that only folks over 50 may understand. What happened? I do see that a different CD label seems to have taken over the \\"World 200_\\" title, and this CD producer must have decided to get nothing but the cheapest and least-desirable of world music for this CD collection. Even the artists I know and like on this CD seem to have handed over their most forgettable songs. It's definitely not worth the 18 or 19 dollars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Amazing Compilation","review":"I did not buy this CD for a long time after looking at a couple of negative reviews on this site. I dont know why some of the reviewers did not like this. This CD is an amazing compilation, equivalent in quality to the World 2002 CD. Recall that Charlie Gillett excels in collecting sounds which are different and pleasing, not necessarily just the catchy sounds. If you keep an open mind and have a curiosity to listening to different sounds, you will love this CD. \\"Fat Marley\\" and \\"Terry Hall and Mushtaq\\" sound very different and unique. \\"Fellini in New York\\" is mellow and poignant sounding. Tinariwen is one of the songs I like best. And there's so many more... I would suggest that listeners read the booklet which comes along with the CD, and try and get a perspective of what each song is about, and who the artists are. You will tend to like it more, when you do that. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Exteremely tasteless & boring","review":"I usually do not post feedback about music CDs I buy, unless they are really outstanding. This time, however, I will make an exception. The WORLD 2004 compilation is worst hodgepodge of boring, tasteless material I have heard in a very very long time. It is a total waste of money and time. I have no idea what criteria was used to judge and choose the contents of this CD; I suspect the rights to these songs were bought by the pound. It is shocking to see that the worst possible material from very well known artists was used here. The whole contents is nauseating. I now swear I will never ever buy another CD without giving it a spin first; too much rubbish out there.Summary:This is without a doubt (in my opinion) the worst compilation CD of the decade(s).SincerelyPirooz Pakdelgjinc@lycos.com"},{"rating":"2","title":"Redbird delivers","review":"This is a thoughtful,textured and beautiful album.

Strangely, it was copied onto a fake import cd, and I couldn't have been happier! Her voice is what will draw you.. so beautiful, melodic, seemingly innocent until you listen to the lyrics. The acoustic guitar playing ties it all together with a soothing effect overall for me. Her music is a bit reminiscent of Jewel and Dido, so if you enjoy them, give Lene Marlin a go."},{"rating":"2","title":"TOTALLY Not What I'd Expected!","review":"I got to fully listen to Lene Marlin's \\"Sitting Down Here\\" on \\"MTV Non-Stop Hits\\" (that's a great CD too, by the way), and I was promptly hooked on buying her album. Frankly, after hearing (I didn't LISTEN to these fully) \\"Playing My Game\\" & \\"Unforgiveable Sinner\\", I thought I'd wasted my money on another teen body of gimmickry. But listening on gave me such SURPRISES!Along with the first track, every other song was WONDERFUL! But my extreme favourites are \\"Flown Away\\", \\"Way We Are\\", \\"So I See\\", \\"Maybe I'll Go\\" & especially the acoustic version of \\"Way We Are\\". She sounded great when singing the latter, but the acoustics showed such skill in her guitar playing! This whole package amounts to something unexpectedly mature from a Norwegian; and, NO, that's not the only way she's different from traditional teen singers (not even Britney or Christina could meet up to her style!).This is the type of pop music we need! Play on, Lene, we LOVE \\"Playing Your Game\\"!"},{"rating":"2","title":"ok , good","review":"Well, I think Lene is a talented artist, for the voice, ok, but above all because she writes her songs by herself and it's not very common. Considering the album, I think it's a sad album, infact 'A place nearby' is a very sad song but I think it's one of the most beautiful in this cd. 'Sitting down here', 'Unforgivable Sinner' are the most popular and they don't need any comment. All the sounds are soft and the most of the songs are slow and sweet but again very sad ( examples are 'Maybe I'll go' or 'Flown away') The reason for which I gave her 4 stars and not 5 is because I think in this album there are only 10 songs and It's less than other artists, so a short album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Different from Britney, Christina etc.","review":"I heard Sitting Down Here countless times on the radio in 1999 or thereabouts and fell absoutely in love with the song. I downloaded it on Napster and listened to it over and over again. But I didn't hear anything more about Lene Marlin so I figured she must have been a one-hit wonder. But then I downloaded Unforgivable Sinner and fell even more in love with her songs. So when I happened to see a copy of her CD in a CD shop I immediantly bought it. And I'm very happy to say it was money well spent. Even though not all of the tracks are ones you'll listen to over and over again and sing along to, they're ones that are excellent 'chilling out' music or the like. The ones you can sing along to which in my case include, Sitting Down Here, Unforgivable Sinner, The Way We Were, So I See and Where I'm Headed.

She is exactly the kind of artist we need in America to break the general population out of the manufactured (though admittedly not without merit) pop machinations of the Backstreet Boys, N'Sync, and Britney Spears. She posesses all the marketable aspects - youth and beauty, but her music shines as something truly special and worthy of attention because of the -gasp- content of the music. This CD has become one of my favorites. I can't wait till my fellow Americans wake up from their hum-drum music existance and embrace music like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heia Lene!","review":"Lene is off to a wonderful singing career. At only 18 she has a wonderful voice that accompanies the acoustics in each song. It's the type of music I would here playing in the background of a cafe.

Does Mr. Urban really believe what he tells his readers - that, until a mere of thousand years ago when the Phoenicians came along, humankind communicated purely by drawing pictures and letting loose the occasional wordless grunt?It simply did not happen that way - ask any linguist, archeologist, or historianThe author of this work also misleads his readers on the origin of the word \\"phonics.\\" Contrary to his assertion, it doesn't have to do with the word \\"Phoenician\\" at all. Checking \\"phonics\\" and \\"Phoenician\\" in any dictionary which gives word-origins will confirm that.I'd rather fail to communicate at all than communicate false-to-fact information, even for the vast sums that Hal Urban claims he makes from selling his inaccuracies to corporations and the general public."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great advice","review":"They say it takes two weeks to create a habit.

No doubt this will turn off some of the more sophisticated and complicated readers; however, positivity is good for you, a little positivity never hurt.His book has five parts, ending with a summary and a conclusion. The most enjoyable chapter in the whole book, in my opinion, is chapter ten: Funny Words Make Us Laugh, from part two. I actually enjoyed reading the book so much, I read it twice. I gave it four stars, though, because Urban's style can come across, at times, as being a little simplistic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book.","review":"mmm I think the gentlemen from Kenosha, WI was looking for some languistic book. that teaches him nice words you can say ... this book is not the case.. this book teaches you how to reach out and look for the positive, how to avoid the typical : hi .. how you doing .. good... and end of conversation.

The only caveat is the booklet is poorly written - - focusing too much on Syd Nathan and giving very incomplete information on the artists themselves - PLUS, there are no songwriting credits!

The author violates a cardinal rule of writing-he does not know quite what to leave OUT. Instead Washington's Partisan War tells of almost every militia muster, movement, skirmish, disbanding, etc. until one is totally lost in a (poorly written) forest of minute details. Context is significantly lacking here, and Kwansy fails to adequately tie in all of his facts to make useful conclusions. While Washington's Partisan War may be useful to some studying specific aspects of the middle states duringthe conflict, this book should be avoided by the general reader for the reasons above, as well as its terrible prose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of trees but little forest","review":"This book suffers from dry prose, lack of focus and the inability of the author to leave anything out!

The author refuses to deal with the reality of Baalbek, The Great Pyramid, Puma Punku and all of the growing evidence that a sophisticated, scientific and advanced engineering race of alien beings, capable of remarkable achievements, colonized Earth, lived amongst primitive homo erectus and put to practice skill and knowledge that still remains a part of the human memory and archaeological record."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Good Portrayal of Today's Events","review":"With war in Iraq looming, this game brings a very chilling sense of reality.

With a variety of weaponry of today's army (except infantry), you command American forces in invading Iraq, Russian forces in invading Ajerbaijan, and Iraqi forces trying to battle against the U.S. The only negative point which keeps it from getting 5 stars is that you have to speed the game up while developing weapons and technologies.

The story, disjointed and reading it was as fun as pulling my own teeth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank you, Karmel!","review":"I was very young and very scared when I was pregnant with my son, Connor. To add to my problems, I am allergic to just about everything, which meant Lamaze was my only choice for childbirth. After reading Karmel's book, I had pride in myself, that 'yes, I can do this' and that, I would actually enjoy giving birth. Needless to say it only took two hours to have my son on a late Sunday night, I took four extra strength tylenol, which was mainly for my nerves and headache from all the nurses telling me I shouldn't be moving around, and returned to work on Wednesday. This book truly works! This should be required reading for anyone who is fearful of labor, or wants to be able to really experience the miracle of life without being being foggy minded bc of medication!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book changed the way I looked at childbirth!","review":"When I was first pregnant, my mother dug out her copy of this book and I read it and reread it and then read it again! It was my bible and using Dr. Lamaze's methods, not the bastardized version they teach at hospitals these days, is what allowed me to have a completely pain-free childbirth. Not once, but twice, as I used his method both times I was pregnant. This book should be read by anyone who is pregnant. It is well-written, informative and entertaining!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not useful for learning Lamaze birthing techniques","review":"I bought this book expecting to learn Lamaze techniques, since there were no classes offered in my area. What I got was a long tangent on natural deliveries performed during the 80s. Like other natural birthing books I've ordered, I thought that this one would explain breathing techniques, the philosophy, positions that ease birthing pains, etc. Unfortunately, I didn't gain one beneficial point from the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Greatest Book","review":"Really just a history of Dr. Lamaze. Interesting, but only really useful if you are planning on using the Lamaze technique exclusively. I took some pointers but ended up being induced, getting an epidural and then an emergency C-Section! So it didn't really come in very handy."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth a penny","review":"i bought this book thinking it would be a great read and also helpful and it was neither i found errors and thougth it was poorly written!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Can you accept yourself as loved passionately?","review":"Campbell argues that truly accepting God's unconditional love is not an easy proposition. The centrality of God's love demands a radical shift in our understanding of self and others. Do you accept yourself as lovable -- as deeply, passionately, and unconditionally loved by God? If not, why not? Is obedience a condition of being loved by God or a consequence of being loved by God?God is perfect in every way. If we, though flawed, can love unconditionally, should we expect any less of God? If we, though sinful, can see the good in others, even when they are at their worse, should we expect any less of God? God's love is so great that no human language can express it fully. Only the incarnation and cross of Christ say it best! It is time that this great truth color our theology and our lives in a radical way. This book is a good start."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insightful","review":"This book is very easy to read while being an eye opener to the experience of marriage and divorce. The authors used real life stories from young people who have experienced their parents unhappy marriages, their divorces and the outcomes. These insightful stories helped explain the concepts that the authors described. This was such a good read that I didn't want to put it down. A must read for anyone in a relationship."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful Book","review":"I thought this book was extremely powerful because the readers got to read real-life testimonies of the many people who suffered through the effects of a divorce. The fact that the stories were real made it so much easier for readers to really understand the heartache that people go through. This book really hits you hard and forces you to accept the harsh realities of divorce. You can really feel the emotions that the authors of each story are going through and it almost seems too painful to be real. I thought this book went really well with Clarke-Stewart and Brentano's other book \\"Divorce: Causes and Consequences\\" because while that book was filled with facts about divorce, this book let you peek into what happens in real life. I recommend this very powerful book to everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read","review":"I never knew there could be so many aspects of marriage and divorce--and so many different stories of divorce! This book is a great book on marriage and divorce. It has so many real life stories in it that it actually reads like a novel. What is nice about this book is that it provides analysis for each of the stories, so the reader gets to learn what to do and what not to do from each.This book has things like risk factors and different types of marriages(couples) that can be really helpful to those who are not yet married.It's a great read! And it's even better to read simultaneously with \\"Divorce: Causes and Consequences\\" by the same authors. This book has more real-life stories while the other has more detail information. But since theyre written by the same authors, one adds to the other and make the reading more insightful."},{"rating":"2","title":"a MUST read before marrying and getting divorce","review":"the book includes a lot of real tiome story from children who suffer and survive thought the divorce process. parents underestimate the effect of divorce in children and thought that they are too young to react to Divorce. this book provides a real time story that ALL children amony ALL age suffer from parent divorce. moreover, the book also provedes a way how we can choose our mate defore getting marry.i found this book really useful to me. it teachs me a lot of strategies on choosing a mate and makes me reconsider how serious a marriage should be.a MUST read book before marriage, having children, and divorce."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gerald Vann","review":"Vann is definetly my favorite Catholic Author.

This is nothing more than a glorified post-it-note calendar book turned into a thin softcover with skimpy details and then given an outrageously high price.

So I hit Amazon, read these reviews and bingo - I dropped $45 bucks for two of her CDs (this being one), both imports. Got them today and was INCREDIBLY disappointed. Yes, they are quirky, curious and fun in their own way, but NOTHING like her newest single - nada, zilch, zip. Very experimental, which I applaud, but a bit too experimental if you ask me, and of course I was expecting something way different from the reviews. In all honesty, between the two discs (32 songs total!), I MAYBE like ONE, and it is NOT the original \\"Sing It Back\\". SAVE YOUR MONEY and buy them USED if at all. Really...trust me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lady Kier move over!","review":"This album is absolutely deee-liteful! Not that it mimics Deee-lite completely, though there are similarities. This record with its tastily twisted beats and slick poetry is a must have for those who love something just a little bit different. Roisin Murphy's vocals really make this album because of her ability to change from a spaced-out jazz chanteuse into a roaring animal of killa bunny rage (only to metamorphosize into something new when that song ends). So, whoever you are, stop reading this and BUY THIS ALBUM!!! Trust me, you will not regret it. If you do, obviously you are on the side of the long-eared ones (buy the album and you'll get it)."},{"rating":"2","title":"I enjoy this CD...everywhere","review":"In my car, in my room, and in my discman...but it's only good for background music.

At least that is the rumor on the net.Bob's other funny show was \\"Newhart\\", which I cannot understand why it has not been released on DVD.The whole cast just clicks.

Although he's clearly Jewish, he seems to be strongly influenced by some form of Christian tradition.

But it lost something in the actual execution. The adults in both families seem determined to prove their racial counterparts wrong, rather than learn from each other. Don't get me wrong; the white parents would inspire this reaction in anyone, especially the father. But everyone involved (except the children) are only interested in claiming the honor of being right. The fact that they don't maintain their public disguises for the duration of the series doesn't help matters.As for the DVDs, I was hoping the commentary from the cast members would shed some light on the episodes.

The author makes you feel like a fly on the wall in the back rooms of the saloons in dusty Graham, TX. I found myself hanging on every page to see if the Marlow clan prevailed against the evil cattle barons and their lackey Marshall. I kept imagining what actors could pull off portraying the different people that populate the book and not ruin how much I enjoyed this book. This books deserves a wide audience, it is entertaining and informative."},{"rating":"2","title":"In the Spirit of Lonesome Dove","review":"I will admit right up front that I am not a fan of Western Novels... But this book flew in the face of the stereotypes this son of the North East had about the old West. From the first two pages I was sucked into the story and could not put the book down. The author not only recreates Texas and Oklahoma of the late 19th century, but makes you feel as if you have travelled back to the era and are a fly on the wall as the yarn unfolds. In my mind's eye I started seeing the Marlows taking on the corrupt Marshall and imagining what actors could give them their due in their portrayals. If you are fan of Larry McMurtry's Lonesome Dove you should give this book a chance."},{"rating":"2","title":"History is sometimes better than fiction.","review":"A lot of novelists write histories, but few historians write novels. This is one of the shining exceptions. This is not a horse opera or Disney-esque view of the Old West. No white hats or pearl-handled six-guns.Colonel Huffines takes a well researched bit of history and adds enough imagination to make it readable rather than simply another dry history book. The story is real, gritty and sometimes a bit cruel. Not, I believe, unlike life in that time and place. It is a good view into justice at the time and how easily it could be influenced."},{"rating":"2","title":"What I needed","review":"I love this CD.

I am going through a point in my life where I am going through a lot of emotional healing, before I even bought the CD I had an idea of what I wanted and this hit on alot of levels. You don't need a lot of words for them to take hold on the subconsious and sometimes that is the very place we need to create change. One statement that hits you just right can change self perception, attitude, or heal an emotional wound.

I had the impression from the title, subtitle, and cost that there'd be information, choice, cognitive intelligence, etc. involved. Not so. Ms. Day's hypnotic voice (beautiful as it is) is combined with Jeffrey Thompson's music to provide, perhaps, a 20-30 minutes of guidance. The author speaks a bit, and then says she'll remain quiet for the rest of a track. The second CD is strictly music...but I already own that CD, as do many people who've been purchasing healing type music over the past few years. This partly recycled product was not worth the $25-$30 cost. I don't think this is a fair deal -- which is particularly disappointing given the subject matter.

We need more of this type of educational feature on TV and in the classrooms, especially since the US has fallen so far behind the rest of the world in science and math.

I find myself just feeling awkward and discomforted when doing the moves, especially when doing the kicks. They just sort of jiggle around like bungi coards rather than providing any intense resistence.I agree with those who say this workout isn't nearly as heart-pumping as it claims to be (you actually just end up being persuaded into thinking you've done an intense workout, when you're really doing a lot of walking in place and very slow moves that feel like a waste of time).Yes, it will make you sweat, and it will get your heart-rate up evetually, but Tae Bo veterans will be extremely bored and unsatisfied with it. For some serious calorie crunching, I'd reccommend the Tae Bo Get Ripped series."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!!","review":"A fast paced workout, not for beginners or the faint hearted, I found it a bit much with the bands.

Of course I enjoy Billy's encouraging words and the moves are more sharp and precise. I didn't sweat as much as I do with the \\"Get Ripped Advance\\" but my heart was pounding a mile a minute and I felt really \\"worked\\".This is a great addition to anyone's workout collection.

The crappy drivers causes kernal panics within a few minutes of starting the system. I contacted their \\"Tech Support\\" and got nowhere fast. It seems that they are more interested in making excuses and finger points to oters as to why their card doesn't work. Then they go on to basicly say \\"Tough luck for now. We will have new drivers for you soon\\" but they don't say when, if ever, that they will have them.It has been two weeks since Panther has come out and there has been nothing from them. All their other products have Panther updates, why not the Revolution?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Music - WOW! Games - NO!","review":"If you're primary concern is music and you don't play any games AND you have a FAST (2Ghz processor +), this is the best sound card you can buy for the $$. If you play any games which need EAX support, don't even think about buying this card. Buy yourself an Audigy 2 ZS and be happy.

Currently there is still no driver for anything past 10.4.6 and if you upgrade any higher the card will not work in Surround Sound. Besides that there is constant speaker popping and horrible buzzing and squeals when switching between programs, sometimes even when the computer is not in use. It has been flakey with surround sound when using DVD Player and Quicktime, as well. During the 10% of times it works without a hassle the sound is great through my Logitech speakers, so it is quite sad when it doesn't work. It seems that this is the only option for Mac users to achieve surround sound that I know of, which is also very saddening.I have a feeling I will be selling this to a PC user in the near future and just settling for good ol'stereo."},{"rating":"2","title":"From Back Cover","review":"A RAW LAND DRENCHED IN BLOOD, PASSION, AND DREAMSGripped by the searing violence of their heritage, they faced an untamed continent teeming with anarchy, mutiny, and corruption; a savage world seething with human hunger; a rich wilderness that promised a radiant future of peace and hope for unborn generations yet to come.Set against the turbulent epic of a nation's birth is the unforgettable chronicle of Jenny Taggart, a woman whose life would be torn by betrayal, flayed by tragedy, inflamed by love, and sustained by unconquerable determination.From the launching of a perilous dream to its bold and glorious fulfillment, they were...THE SETTLERS"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Singapore Malaysia Industries....","review":"This book discusses none of the tenets that it set out to.

It's worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Money!","review":"Though the book in it's entirity is filled with supposition, assumption, presumption, and speculation, the first two-thirds of the book are fairly entertaining. Mr. Thomas tries his hand as a psychic, military tactician, and psychoanalyst; he fails miserably on all counts. He also manages to omit several key incidents in Lee's life which point much more directly to the man's real character and values. While the last third of the book is boring and tedious, Mr. Thomas doesn't miss the opportunity to do a little politically-correct Southern bashing to assure good reviews from the New York Times, et al. In the end, Thomas tries to leave everyone with a comfy-warm feeling which really only serves to undermine much of his own thesis. By the way, nearly ALL white people in the US in the 1800's, whether North or South, abolitionist or slave-owner, educated or ignorant, rich or poor \\"believed\\" the white race to be superior...even Lincoln.

I tried calling customer service and contacting them online... a response was not given until nearly 3 weeks later and was not helpful.My purchase of the Landmann Heatwave is probably the worst shopping experience I've ever had online and off.

It is certainly sturdier than similar items that we viewed at the local stores. The size makes it easy to put in decent size logs and the heavy grating and lid add security from flying sparks and ash. We have used it about 5 times now. For effective smores, you do have to start out without the surround grate and lid, but once the kids have had their fun, you can add a few more logs and put those items back in place to enjoy a roaring fire outdoors. The only negative things I can say is that I noted the black interior paint is burning off, but with an item used for fire, this is expected. Also, it is somewhat inconvenient to have to remove the lid to add logs, but it's not a deal breaker. Note to manufacturer to add a door on the side to open would be a nice touch.

At the same time, it's a gem of a thriller that you won't want to put down, and a wonderful study of the workings of the most concealed parts of the human mind. Jean Hontz has proven herself to be a talented writer who has a wonderful sense of what the reader wants to know, and when is the right time to provide this information. The characters are complex and ring true, and the plot has enough twists and turns to keep you from guessing the ending in advance. Like many really good books, this one leaves the reader with something to think about after the final page is turned. Demons, whatever form they may take, can never be escaped until their victims find the courage and strength to stop, turn, and face them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful!","review":"I have no clue as to where these come from, but I recommend superior nut's raw macadamia nuts, which are very good.

I did not expect it to be so absorbing. David Faris Cross clearly has compassion for those who died there or were captured, and is very insightful about how poor command decisions led to tragic results.

It's a great buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant!","review":"this book provides such a valuable lesson to children and adults, alike.People can worship, what and who they want.....or not.The book is worth purchasing even if just for the artwork!"},{"rating":"2","title":"baby book","review":"\\"Old Turtle\\" has become a tradition of giving in our family. When we recieve the announcement that a child has been born, we get a copy for the babe. We like to think that this is one of the ways this child will first hear about creation and our place in it. The illustrations are simple and exquisite, the narrative compelling. I'm a \\"big kid\\" and I love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding spirtual and environmental book for children.","review":"How do you explain what God is to children? As a parent, how do you explain about the importance of caring for the environment and all living creatures? This book accomplishes these things and more. The flowing text and beautiful water-color drawings inspire an understanding of Spirit that children and adults alike can relate to. If you have children, please share this book with them, my daughters love it. If you don't have children, buy this book as a gift for yourself, and read it often, to reconnect with the Spirit that is all around us and in everyone of us. Many thanks to Douglas Wood and Cheng-Khee Chee for such a beautiful book, it has become a family favorite."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best spiritual book ever!","review":"I NEVER write reviews, but I had to write about this one!It talks of all the different aspects of the earth and their arguments with each other over what is God. Old Turtle speaks up and proclaims that God is all the things they have said, but most importantly, GOD IS.Old Turtle then goes on to talk about how humans are coming and are a gift. The humans do come, but they forget the gift and thereby destroy much of the earth. When they remember, they realize that if they love, they will experience the gift of God again.This is how I want to teach my son and new baby about God. Not the politics of who is \\"right\\" or \\"wrong.\\" We can all just be assured that through whatever spiritual path we are all on, we can take solace in knowing that GOD IS.Beautiful story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lesson for all","review":"This is a book for children, but really is a lesson for mankind.

It will touch you and make you see God in all of your surroundings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Children's Book for Adults","review":"I bought this book for my toddler, but the art work was so extraordinary and the prose so poetic, that I showed this book to my mom, who's an author and an artist. She ended up permanently \\"borrowing\\" this book, that I gladly ordered another copy. The sophistication of this book is such that it takes a person with mature artistic sensibilities to appreciate it in full. Buy two copies, one for your kids to chew on (literally and figuratively) and another for you to cherish."},{"rating":"2","title":"a true favorite","review":"What a beautiful book, a real treasure and favorite, talking about people getting along in language anyone could understand.

I know it's about saving animals and all, but this is, well, TRASHY, BABYISH, INCREDIBLY UNREALISTIC GAME EVER!!!! The other vets treat you like a baby. This game is not much more than a very limited, way too easy, and boring game. You have about 15-20 patients, then the game is over.

Which could mean good things in terms of its power, but the way it's built, the exhaust ends up blowing dust around where I'm trying to vacuum, which means you have to go over things twice and even three times, thus defeating the purpose of strong uptake. And the head is a joke: if it's not positioned exactly parallel to the floor, it won't pick everything up.Finally, what lowers it from a two-star rating to a one-star rating: I haven't been able to find bags for this machine anywhere locally (I live in a large city, and K-Marts and Targets are close by too), nor does Amazon stock them. A real pain. This vacuum is a bust."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it - it doesn't work!","review":"Loud machine with really lousy suction. You can vacuum the wooden floors but when it comes to the thick carpets - it simply doesn't pick up a dirt. This vacuum is a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blu Ray was not in English","review":"I was not aware that this Blu Ray was only in Italian and Japanese. To be honest, Italian is listed as the language in the product details section of the listing. However, there are also reviews raving about the English dub on the same page. Presumably these are for other vendors who are actually selling the English version.In any case, either the vendor or Amazon should really do something to clean up this listing. It is clearly misleading. Just something like \\"Akira [Italian version]\\" is all it would take for the listing title. I really don't think that's unreasonable.Two weeks after I returned the Blu Ray and still have not gotten a refund. I cannot recommend this vendor, but at least I've learned a lesson about paying closer attention to product listings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Scraper EVER!!","review":"Tupperware makes a fantastic scraper. The handle is sturdy and rounded for easy and comfortable mixing, scraping & cooking. The colored silicone does not stain like the white one from Pampered Chef that promises not to. I've had several of these, for several years and use them daily. I send them through the dishwasher, fry bacon and cook spaghetti with them. They still look brand new. (mine all have the black handles) Tupperware used to make 3 different sizes. Sorry to say they only make this one now. I was able to find the larger blue one on-line but the smaller/longer green one is nowhere to be found! You will not be sorry with this purchase. They are worth the price Tupperware charges for them, so at these prices they are a steal!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for back trouble","review":"This Pilates workout is intended for those who need an extra-gentle Pilates session to strengthen abs and rehab the back. I found it to be an excellent, gentle and safe introduction to Pilates. (Always check with a practitioner first though). I also recommend Allan Menezes Pilates for back pain."},{"rating":"2","title":"For the non-expert this can be a little overwhelming","review":"This book is well researched and well written. However, if you have just a passing interest in the Battle of the Little Bighorn, or have just begun your reading on the subject, this is not for you. In an effort to solve the mystery of 28 troopers who apparently died in Deep Ravine, but whose bodies are said to have never been found, Michno provides innumerable eye-witness accounts both white and Indian. In the beginning I tried to follow all of them, especially since I had just been to the battlefield, but I soon found it far too cumbersome. Mr. Michno has put alot of work into this, and he deserves recognition for it, however I would recommend this book only for people who already have a very detailed knowlege of the subject. END"},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent read","review":"I have only recently begun reading on Custer and the Little Big Horn. I started with Dr. Fox's work and I have been reading backwords as much as I can. Michno's work is excellent and offers many new views on Custer and the battle and I am sure his views will stur up some thought. I strongly suggest everyone read this work and his others. I am convienced he is correct in his views, and his conclusions I completely agree, no other Custer work has been as good as this one. I am an ex combat soldier and served in many a scrap, I can readdly se and understand the mess Custer got himself into. I hink you will really enjoy this read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nicely written and not overly romantic","review":"The editor of this book kept the author's name withheld, so there's no way of knowing who she was. He also doesn't say when she wrote, but she mentions reading the book Richard Feverel, which was written by George Meredith in 1859. There are 86 letters to her unknown correspondent. She's writing to a male, and she addresses him as Darling, Beloved, Dearest, never Husband, so they're probably not married. Actually, going by the way she writes, I'd say that they're obviously not married. She writes very well, and luckily her musings on love are not nauseatingly flowery or full of heartbroken anguish. It's like they're unavoidably separated, and she's waiting patiently until they can get back together. This book makes for great romantic reading, though I found it best to read 2 or 3 letters at a time, rather than the whole book at once."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"I was not happy with this game. I realized that the only thing you can do in this game is build. You have to continually build things. There's nothing more to it. You can't sit back and watch your colony like you would watch your mall in Mall Tycoon, becauseyou can't even see the people. The graphics are horrible and honestly I wouldn't consider this a good buy at all. If you're looking to buy this for someone as a gift, don't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"Absolutely great the whole family loved it. They especially loved to own the Lunar colony. Out of this world excitment. This is the best out of like 15 tycoon games i have ever played"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Pretty Cool Game","review":"I think that this game is fun. It gives you a strong sense of achievement once you unlock everything. It's not freakishly hard or anything, but it still isn't the game that you can sit down and figure out immediatly. The only bad part is the graphics, which are not great, but you can account that to the game's age. Altogether a game that is well worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Moon Tycoon Graphics Problems","review":"We have a HP pavilion mx70, 800 MHz Intel Celeron processor with 64 MB of SDRAM & up to 11 MB allocated to video memory and even though I went out on the net & upgraded our Intel 82810 Graphics Controller to the latest upgrade, it still wouldn't run this program without losing graphics. Very quickly, while building on the moon the graphics begin to fall apart to the point that you can't even see a great deal of the graphics. At first we thought it was the CD so we returned it & got a new one, but it was just as bad. Then we got the upgraded graphics driver & it started out a little better, but still started breaking up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be Warned-This is NOT like Roller Coaster Tycoon","review":"My twin 7 year old boys love Roller Coaster Tycoon. I was thrilled to see Moon Tycoon - it looked great! We just put it on last night and it was a big disappointment. Its very dark and hard to see what you've built. Its complicated for little kids (and their dad). We lost interest quickly. Its rated E so I thought it was geared to the younger set.

It was the first tycoon game that was in 3d which was why i bought it. I really like tycoon games. This one was great! The missions are clearly possible, the graphics are great, the gameplay is great and the structures look really cool. Even the inflatable houses look neat. There are some cons though. Such as: The screen movement is choppy and it's VERY hard to keep your budget in tact. In the reagular version you start out with 50000 dollars to build your entire colony. When you finally finish you can look back at your work and enjoy it because the layout they made is beautiful, a real eye opener. I too wished when i was playing this game that i could just settle in one of my colonys. It is clear how any sim would want to settle in on someone's colony.Recommendations: I would recommend this to anyone who is good at keeping good budget at these games.Not recemmended to: Gray Davis"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but not complete...","review":"I liked this DVD, but like other reviewers, was disappointed about \\"Stay\\" and \\"Let's Go Through The Motions\\" being omitted.

There must have been a rush to get this game out in time for the movie release. I too have one disappointed youngster since Christmas morning -- guess this gift goes back to Santa."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cat in the Hat,,, it's good, but it's not all that.","review":"Though somewhat juvinile I found the game still enjoyable. It was challenging sometimes because it was genuinally difficult to do some of the thing that needed to be done, and other times it was because they didn't explain well enough what you had to do in certain situations. Because of that, I recomend that everyone new to the game look at control settings to find out what moves this cat has up his hat. One of the reasons I enjoyed the game is because I enjoyed the movie. Although not in a story mode, it was still fun to chase Quinn out of every corner of the mutant house. However I must warn some people that the extra points are not just bonuses. Sometimes you will need a certain amounts of points if you want to continue the game, plus if you get all the points out of a level, that part of the house goes back to normal. For boss lovers I'm sorry to say that their are only two of them. That's why I think that the Cat in the Hat is a mixed bag."},{"rating":"2","title":"HP Ink","review":"This product works as it is supposed to.

This otherwise very good music has been completely compressed to death. Not a little bit, we're talking completely straight line. This moronic pursuit of loudness is killing the sound. The drums and cymbals are wrecked on this disc. It makes me angry because there's nothing you can do to fix it. There's a very clear reason why modern metal albums don't hold up as well as their older generation counterparts. It's because of the crummy recording techniques they are using. You don't want to turn these albums up nice and loud because there's no power there, the music has nowhere to go, it's completely flattened. Compression does not equal heaviness, it just fatigues the ears. This music deserves better than this abuse."},{"rating":"1","title":"OLD SCHOOL FANS BEWARE!","review":"this is not a return to the morbid tales style frost. the 1st track is good and the album is produced well and it is heavy but it is not a thrash album. i would call it more of a doomy type record. the songs are long and quite slow. it is worth having in the collection though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing, boring, and disappointing","review":"As a lifelong Frost fan I looked forward to this release and bought it without hearing any of it , but this is a big disappointment.Depressing as hell, I dont know how anyone could listen to this without wanting to commit suicide.

I truly believe CF is one of the most innovative and original bands ever. They were definitely the pioneers of the Black Metal and Doom genres. That being said words cannot describe the sheer disappointment I felt when I first heard \\"Monotheist\\". Their first release in years is utterly awful and unbearable to listen to...and I tried real hard. This album makes \\"Cold Lake\\" sound like a musical masterpiece. I gave this album one star out of respect to the band that released such classics like To Mega Therion, Into The Pandemonium and Vanity/Nemesis. If this was the direction CF was planning on taking before the drama queen Tom Warrior left the band...then I'm very glad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bleak","review":"As I listened to \\"Monotheist,\\" I could only visualize guitarist/vocalist Tom Warrior being bummed out to the point of no return. That's a bad thing. The vibe here is cold, bleak...from the scariest reaches of existence. Afterwards, I was unable to find enjoyment in anything at all for a day. \\"Dark\\" barely describes the complete downer that is this album, and I won't be revisiting it again anytime soon. Gone are CF's piledriver riffs, thrash, wild tempo-shifts and experimental impulses. Here, they deliver agonizing, existentially painful songs that offer few hooks, melodies or grooves - only a morass of solemnity. Sure, there are days when I feel this way right along with him, but musically speaking I don't find that these songs transcend the experience. \\"Monotheist\\" is just pure bitterness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brutal Assault On The Senses","review":"This is exactly the album I wish they had done after Into The Pandemonium.

From start to finish, this album is great. I particularly like the first two cuts and Obscured but that is not intended to take anything away from the rest of it. I am just so glad they decided to make another go at it. Their brand of extreme metal is unique and not like anything else out there.

The recording is poor and the songs go nowhere. Sure, the music and haunting sounds make for an evil and somewhat disturbing record, but I ain't buying it. Frost has never been the most talented lot and their \\"career\\" has been hit and miss (big). This just doesn't do it for me. Maybe I shouldn't have come in with such high expectations.

Frankly though, there are much better and more efficient workouts for people of all levels of fitness. In addition, the music is annoying... like the soundtrack for an 80's video game.

However, I find that beginning with the previous book in the series, A Long Line of Dead Men, the fun has left the the Scudder books as they become mostly talk and very little action. I still would highly recommend all previous Scudder books -- of which there are 11, but it's time for Block to put this PI to sleep.

Block fails to embody his all too human hero with the life necessary to carry two plots. A re-reading makes the reader think that the book would have been better as a short story.

I suppose if you're totally incapable of writing your own resume, this program would be good. But if you've gone as far as reading reviews on Amazon, you're probably capable of writing your own resume and should avoid this program.

My condo deck faces south which provides great light but serious heat. I couldn't use it during the summer for fear of evaporating. I did a lot of research on sun shade sails and cloth and decided on the Coolaroo option. I have a pergola on my deck and wanted to be able to customize the shade cloth to fit. I cut the cloth with carpet scissors because it's too heavy for regular shears. I stapled the cloth to the pergola roof and finished the edges. It's perfect. I'm amazed at how different the temperature is under the cloth and I can still grow 'full sun' plants. In fact, the plants are thriving now that they aren't being baked by all day sun. I plan to leave the shade cloth up all year round. It handles rain with no damage. I use my leaf blower to blow debris up and off the cloth. Great purchase and much cheaper than the alternatives."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shade Fabric","review":"Excellent product. Easy to fabricate into any shape desired. Does not shink when warmed by sun.

I used the butterfly clips made by the same company and attached them to dog tie-off cables. Because I needed the length, I put the shades on their sides. The shades are holding up really well and have gone through a couple of big storms without ripping. The fabric weave is very sturdy, yet it's easy to attach the clips. I also added some hooks to the deck and ran some strings through the bottom of the shades to tie them off and keep them from blowing in the wind. It's also easy to bunch up the shades and tie them off if you don't want them extended. On hot days, it's easy to notice the temperature difference behind the shades as opposed to being in the sun. They do a great job blocking the sun and heat, yet you can still see through them fairly well."},{"rating":"1","title":"CURLING PROBLEM","review":"I tried to save money by making my own 8' shades. Bought the Coolaroo clips and attached them to a strong wire my husband put up. They will not hang straight,(Probably because the fabric's bias is off). The edges are in a constant curl. I bought more clips, added them to the sides and tied them to the post. In between the clips the edges still curl. UGH! I gave two stars because the Coolaroo does make the porch cooler.

It has a ribbon page marker, but the darn thing keeps slamming shut. Its not wide enough to place a jar or something on it and its too heavy to hold something else. I tried putting a binder clip on the pages, but its just to heavy to hold it. It also needs to have a waterproof cover, something you can wipe clean instead of the paper dust cover that it currently has.

For all of you who think that these new guys must be the three best tenors in America, think again. I don't want to flame those who have written reviews before me, but potential buyers of this CD should be warned that there are soooo many other discs available which contain the best and most beautiful tenor singing of all time.

But listening to them almost 20 years later, I now realize that Dealing With It is their only record that really stands the test of time. After this they began to mellow out a bit (relatively speaking, that is; none of their albums come close to being \\"mellow.\\") There are a small handful of mid-tempo metal songs here, but the majority are blistering hardcore/speed metal. DRI were known as \\"the fastest band on the planet\\" for a few years, until Napalm Death came around.

The songs range heavier to clean, eerie songs. Each provokes the mood of the listener and tosses about his/her soul in a pool of thought, from beginning to end. The poetic look into death, drugs, love, and their reachs adds to the underlying feeling that you are listening to more than you are hearing.

I know there are aspects of this kind of music that some people will never be able to get passed; what a shame. The rhythms, melodies and bluesy/alarming vocals reach deep into the soul. This is a truly original mix of many types of music. Do yourself and Acid Bath a favor and buy this record. Open your mind, turn off the lights and get ready to be pulled in.

Although, part of the enjoyment of viewing a beautiful waterfall is also hearing the sound of the water. The harmony of both the visual and audio creates the tranquility that gives one a sense of peace and serenity. I assume that would be the intent of those who desire to watch a DVD like this.Instead of sounds of nature, water cascading, flowing, splashing or bubbling... you are given piano music. It actually became distracting and I had to mute the sound. I would have much preferred the natural sounds of the environment. Even wild birds would have been better.I also would have liked to know the names and location of these worldwide waterfalls.

The game helps little ones work on fine motor coordination, size and colors. The pieces are well made and durable, although I do worry about the \\"alarm\\" (a ball at the end of a stick) snapping if it is stepped on or otherwise misused. I love the feel of the wooden pieces and heavy cards, and the game avoids the cliche of typical children's toys. I highly recommend this game!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun game for a 3.5 year old","review":"I got the game after looking at other reviews (in particular on [...]) and I am glad I did.

It might take a while for new listeners I would recomend \\"Rust in Peace\\" or \\"Countdown to Extinction.\\" The demos on this CD are pretty cool and the commentary by Dave Mustaine and David Ellefson on each track are really cool.Last Rites/Loved To Death (9/10)Killing Is My Business...And Business Is Good (11/10)(The best track)The Skull Beneath The Skin (10/10)Rattlehead (10/10)Chosen Ones (9/10)Looking Down The Cross (9/10)Mechanix (11/10)(Pretty much \\"The Four Horsmen\\" by Metallica but two times faster and two times better)These Boots (4/10)(Would be a 9/10 but the F*king blips kill it)This is a great Megadeth album but very very far from thier best.

The CD also has liner notes from Mustaine and Ellefson which are interesting and sometimes funny.

A monkey can learn to pull strings on a piece of plastic, or hit cans with two sticks. This band just throws together the same old vocals with a little different variation everytime.Just because they have been playing for a long time does not make them good. Emotion is where true talent lies, this band is just a shadow consisting of men who cant do anything beyond their pathedic band so they capitalize on people who liked their previous work. They have no emotion and are poor because of it.I would give them one star, but there is one nice riff on the album, nothing special but its a nice ten seconds compared to the rest of the cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame.","review":"This album is typical, cliche generic trash metal!

The drums are much clearer, you can tell how good Gar was. You can understand the vocals so much better than before.

I used to love Megadeth back than. To make a long story short, I have rediscovered Megadeth. Just like the \\"old\\" Metallica, I feel the \\"old\\" Megadeth is better than there newer stuff. This rereleased version of, Killing is my buisness, is awesome. It sounds remastered. You can hear clearly the intricate lightning fast thrash approach of the guitars on songs like, \\"Last Rites, and The Mechanix.\\" This whole cd kicks axe. I have never liked the song, \\"These Boots,\\" though. Why did Megadeth cover that? It is almost like an insult to an otherwise masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Review For...KIMB...ABIG","review":"This is by far one of the greatest debuts for a band in history. As production holds it back, the album is still pure thrash. Any Megadeth fan or any fan of metal would like this. The highlight of this album would be 'Mechanix'. This is the first song they 'released'. But could you believe its not on the Greatest Hits? That sucks and blows and everything else but i'm not getting into that. lol. It has just so many metal sounds and you can tell from some metal today that this album influenced most of it. The songs are great and no sense in going through all of them. The ONLY drawback to this album is the beeped out 'These Boots'. I haven't received the original yet, but its on the way. To hold me over, I just burnt a copy of this remastered version and added a downloaded unedited version 'these boots' to it.

The drums are clearly heard, the solo's scream,and you can understand the lyrics to near perfection.However, if you already have it, and are expecting something new...don't. It's the same stuff with a better sound. There are occasional parts I liked better on the original version, but on the whole it's is a gem. The main downside on this album are the annoying bleeps covering half the lyrics on \\"These Boots.\\" The cd booklet covers that. The 3 extra demo's lack in sound quality, but make up the difference with their commanding speed and Dave's intense vocals.However, one thing stands....Dave Mustaine sounds so fierce and aggressive on this album, if you don't have this or the original....you'd better get it. This is classic thrash."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing...","review":"Now that this album has been cleaned up, I can finally see how amazing it really is. I've never heard anything like this in my life, and truly doubt that I ever will again. If you are a fan of metal, you owe it to yourself to hear this. BTW, the track listings here aren't correct. The first 7 are, but then there is a version of \\"These Boots\\" with all the \\"vile and offensive\\" lyrics bleeped out, and then 3 demos of \\"Last Rites/Loved To Death\\", \\"Mechanix\\", and \\"Looking Down The Cross\\". This cd is worth much more than the asking price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What the heck happened to \\"Boots\\"?","review":"The only thing that knocks this deluxe re-release down from 5 stars is the fact that \\"Boots\\" is missing...just like it has been from the most recent compact disc releases of the regular album. Did Nancy Sinatra not like it? Ah well, I was looking forward to the possible inclusion of \\"Boots\\" back where it belongs when I saw the listing for this in Ice, but instead I will settle for the original '84 demos which are an awesome inclusion.

It's missing all of the monk chants and what not so it's nowhere near Enigma 2-4. It's closer to Enigma 1. Some songs sound jazzy. Overall it's good. If your a true Enigma fan I feel you'll like this. It will take time to get used to the new Enigma since we're all used to the old Enigma, but you still won't be let down from this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hmmmmm","review":"My only real \\"un-favorite\\" Enigma album.

It's the only one I don't listen to frequently, but it is Enigma."},{"rating":"1","title":"a disappointment","review":"I love Enigma.

I really was disappointed indeed as Engima is Such a Great Group."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shockingly bad album by one of my favorite bands","review":"Enigma really tried to do something new with Voyageur and, once you've heard all their albums, it's obvious that they figured out how to use the sound they developed in this album more effectively later. If you're not just trying to complete an Enigma collection, I recommend skipping this album in favor of the one that followed it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very average album","review":"2003 \\"Voyageur\\" - that is very, very average album. You can find many of pop albums with similar quality. Whatever factor was making from Enigma a very special project here is almost completely lost.

I like only one song really: \\"In The Shadows In The Light\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the worst cd I've heard","review":"This is not a CD that follows the flow set by the first 4 CDs.

Not only has Enigma turned its back on what made it great, Cretu has totally taken Enigma into the almost unlistenable.I have all Enigma's CD's and listen to the albums frequently, but I will not be listening to Voyageur ever again. There are no notable songs worth listening to. What happened to the Gregorian Chants?Cretu you cannot change the style of Enigma and think that the music will still sound good and the much anticipating fans will love it. In my opinion, Voyageur is not worth buying...I will wait for Enigma 6, and hopefully Cretu will return Enigma to its roots....Love, Sensuality & Devotion."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was he THINKING?","review":"Before I write this, I must state that I love Enigma dearly. That said, this CD is truly horrible. The only good tracks are \\"From East to West\\", \\"Voyageur\\", and \\"Page of Cups\\". As for the rest of the tracks, Enigma has completely lost their mysterious, ethereal aura in favor of a trashy pop sound. Listen to this album carefully before you buy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Voyaguer to Dissapointment","review":"I have been an Enigma fan for over 10 years. This was the most horrible music I have ever heard. If I wanted to listen to YUCKEY EURO music I'd get it. I will never pay for another CD of theirs unless I have heard it before through someone else.All the songs were monotonous in the beat with that horrible euro noise in the background. You couldn't even hear the words of the singers properly. The music hurt my brain such that I couldn't even venture to listen to any of it a second time.What happened to that wonderful sensual music they had in the first couple of albums. Is there someone else that can create music like that?

None of these tracks contains the enchanting gregorian chorus that we used to hear in other albums and which, in my opinion, gives the spiritual richness to Cretu's compositions. In addition, we can't find any song like \\"Silence Must Be Heard\\" , \\"I Love You, I'll Kill You\\" or \\"Why?\\" which makes us discover the dephts with their beautiful melodies and moving rhytms... What's left is a superficiel music that doesn't satisfy our expectations from Enigma..."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened ? It is not ENIGMATIC anyomore !!!","review":"I have been listening to ENIGMA since way back in 1990. Coming from a country ( COSTA RICA ) where most people listen to salsa ,merengue and more \\" tropical \\" rhythms I was certainly one of those few enigma fans. During the last years I have enjoyed all of Mr. Cretu's releases : Le Roi est mort, The Cross of Changes , The Screen Behind the Mirror, etc.. Even the DVD which has that beautiful video of the monk being tempted in SADENESS ( but that is another story, hehe) Going back to the review, I really don't get what or where is Mr. Cretu going with his new project. I can understand artist's constantly \\"evolve\\" but this VOYAGEUR album leaves me with a bitter taste. Let's see what will happen with the next album. I just hope it has no Boum -Boum elements..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this one...","review":"I have to admit, I'm stubborn. I liked the first four Enigma CDs so much that I was determined to buy this, despite reading the reviews here that referred to it as directionless and disappointing. So I bought it...and <surprise> it IS disappointing, and not at all what I've come to expect of M. Cretu. I'm not saying Enigma can't have somewhat of a new sound, but this sounds like a compilation of tracks that were never released (for good reason.) Sadly, they WERE released, and most are either forgettable or obnoxious. Almost every track on Enigma's previous albums was of high quality, and I liked almost all of them. In contrast, I like 2 out of 11 tracks on Voyageur, not a good percentage. Buy A Posteriori instead, if you already have the first four albums and are looking for more."},{"rating":"1","title":"MISSING MYSTIC","review":"Voyageur is clearly missing the suductive mysticalness that I have grown to love and crave about Enigma. Please bring back the subtle chants, chimes, and angelic chorus that seduces the mind and take it to far away mythical places. I will be placing Voyageur on the \\"TECHNO THUMPTY-THUMPTY\\" shelf where it will be collecting dust.P.S.

This just is Not Enigma.Don\`t Buy This get the greatest hits CD Instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of his worst","review":"Enigma did a stellar debut with MCMXC a.D. and later CD's never could match that debut. This CD is quite bad because Michael Cretu sings on about 80% of the tracks, and singing is not his forte. With track #5 the text is \\"my heart goes boom boom boom, every time I think of you\\". Is he trying to be a teenage popstar? He is around 40-50 years old by now. I do not recommend this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Three years in work?!","review":"This album is such dissatisfaction to me...

This album really sounds like a counterfit. Two stars because the only good tracks are 1 and 11, sort of, ok maybe 10 too. These are the only tracks that come close to what Enigma is or was. Everything in between leaves very much to be desired. The lyrics and synth sound very ameturish. *sigh* I hope he returns soon and recovers from this. I love Enigna, but not this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull CD","review":"I enjoy listening to Enigma, especially the earlier works. But this CD isn't worth spending .99 cents for a song. I was checking out the songs on iTunes prior to just buying a CD and it wasn't worth spending any money on it. I'm glad that there is a service that let's you preview all the tracks before getting stuck with an album that will be used as a frisbee. I think only people that worship Enigma will enjoy this CD, I'm sorry, but I couldn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost the Touch","review":"Other than 'The Piano' which is strickly instruemental Voyager is lacking. Entirely too much electronica and vocals that are synthetic sounding. Change prevents artists from becoming stale and there are some good things on the CD. Most of the songs have a good basic rhythm but are ruined with bad vocals. I was very disappointed with this effort and will never buy another Enigma CD unless I listen to if first."},{"rating":"1","title":"ABSOLUTE HORROR","review":"There is rarely a day goes by that something by Enigma does'nt end up on my CD player, the music inspires me and feeds my soul. But, this latest CD which I have been eagerly anticipating for the last three odd years is.... to put it bluntly....PANTS. I actually returned it to the store and exchanged it for something by Delerium. A sad day indeed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its like Eminem sings \\"Oops I did it again\\"","review":"I've waited all these years for this? I'm a die-hard Enigma fan and this album is really disappointing. I'm all for change; change for the better, not for the worse. The only track I liked was \\"From East To West\\". The rest sound either boring or something you hear on a cheesy pop radio station. Nothing interesting in this album at all. Enigma has, or rather had a unique sound; yes I do miss the chants, operas and the samplings. Thats what I expect from Enigma. Listening to the last track \\"Follow The Sun\\", I thought I was listening to the Dixie Chicks sing. I guess I have to wait another three years for the 6th album to come out to HOPEFULLY get some good ol' Enigma music. Disappointing album unfortunately."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Music That Should Not Be Missed...","review":"For anyone who has never heard the music of Enigma, the sounds on this album are truly one-of-a-kind when compared to other forms of music--there is simply no way to describe it, much less assign it a label. I would LOVE to meet Michael Cretu (producer and the brains behind Enigma)and try to understand where he comes up with these amazing sounds. I only have one critisizm and it's minor--To my ears, this CD sounds significantly more synthesized and less \\"human.\\" There are fewer tantalizing and unique voices. The music is less thought-provoking and is not as contemplative as most Enigma CDs. Still, I can't get enough of this CD. If you've never heard Enigma, by any CD, take it home, turn out the lights, cover AND close your eyes, and then put on some headphones and let this amazing music take your mind in directions you never imagined..."},{"rating":"2","title":"true to its style","review":"I always look forward to Enigma new cds; they never disappoint me.

This one is NOT going to make it, its just flat. Expect nothing like the old albums. I still recall when I bought \\"Le Roi\\", I could not listen enough to it and I still listen it a lot to the day. This album is definately not Enigma, more like a desperate attempt to fulfill the obligation they have to release new albums. What a shame, they used to really kick arse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Voyageur~A Changing But True Masterpiece","review":"Enigma V-Voyageur. What can I say about this album, this album is basically a masterpiece. Each song so well intertwined in a trancey journey that could only be weaved by Enigma. Different from previous releases, thinking about it each album is different in it's own way and this is not off. This album is beautiful and filled with wonderful songs. No song too slow or too fast, everything just perfect. If ur looking for good music, Enigma Voyageur will not disappoint you for it holds many mysterious surprises, rhythms, sounds, and feelings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, but don't buy the good reviews","review":"I am an insatiable Enigma fan. This is my favorite group of all time. I bought MXC before it ever hit it big, and I marked on my calendar with excitement for the every three years Enigma puts out a record. I own every album, every remix and every DVD. This album is good, but it is missing all the brilliant layering of the earlier albums. \\"The Screen Behind the Mirror\\" keeps getting degraded on these reviews but it is a far better album than Voyageur. At least the signature Enigma sound is intact on that album. Cretu has become FAR too in love with his voice on this album and it actually ruins some otherwise good songs. Also, the lyrics are unbelievably cheesy at times. The album will grow on you, but it is still an overall disappointment.PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE GO BACK TO YOUR OLD SOUND ENIGMA! You can still \\"explore\\" the boundaries of music with your old sound intact."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent production, Bad material","review":"There are only 3 songs that I kinda liked. From East to West, Page of Cups, and Following the Sun. This could have been so much better. I agree with trying a new formula, but this one comes short. It seems as if it was just thrown together compared to previous albums (material wise). However, I was totally impressed with the overall mixing and production. There just seem to be NO more magic left for this cd. Buy it and try it for yourself, you can always sell it if you don't like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened ?????????","review":"Enigma used to be the proverbial booty music CD and man has this fallen short of expectations!

Just because a band decides to go beyond its usual \\"pop-punk\\" sound and try somethign a little more experimental (for them) does not make it a bad CD. On the contrary I think that this CD is more mature than their previous offerings, but not quite as \\"dark\\" as another reviewer put it. It's a bit more rockin', a little more emotional (note I didn't say emo), and probably won't land them on Warped Tour, but it's got a good beat and decent lyrics, and genuine vocals. Definitely not for the true-blue Drive Thru records fan, but then we can't stay 13 forever, can we?"},{"rating":"1","title":"back in the day","review":"Short and simple.

The band's previous albums thrived on hooks, vocal harmony, and catchy pop-rock sensibilities. However, front man Gabe Saporta traded those redeeming qualities for a crack at being the next pretentious rock star on \\"Forget What You Know.\\" Midtown attempted to jump on the bandwagon of making a more \\"musically mature\\" album and instead, gave their fans one of the most trite, fake, and forced albums of 2004. Noteworthy: \\"Empty Like The Ocean.\\"1/5"},{"rating":"2","title":"The class of 2004","review":"Forget What You Know is the best album of 2004. Midtown shreds its emo-punk roots and instead charges forward with heart-wrenching lyrics and and even more tremendous musicianship.Midtown's bio mentions FWYK: \\"The songs, they all deal with the same things: The dissolution of the lines of reality, our abstraction from meaning, searching for it in the wrong places, filling empty spaces with things, garbage.\\" It's hard to say it any better. It's unfortunate that this album will never get the acclaim it deserves because it's easily the best of 2004.

The first actual song is way too catchy....it's a wonder it wasn't a \\"radio hit\\" for them. The CD overall was pretty mediocre. A lot of filler and just plain horrible songs. I was able to find 3 that stood out. \\"Empty Like the Ocean\\", \\"Nothing is Ever What it Seems\\", \\"Help Me Sleep\\". Those songs kick some major ass, and for that, i give the CD a 2. I'll be hesitant to buy their next CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forget what YOU know-This is NOT Midtown at their best....","review":"I bought this album expecting to like it because I like Midtown. I was highly disappointed in it. First off, it sounds NOTHING like Midtown, but in a bad way. The sound varies so greatly between the songs, I almost begin to believe that I'm listening to a compilation album. It's almost like they couldn't decide how the band should sound, so they just threw some stuff together to make songs. Secondly, the lyrics are pretty lame. Take just a minute to listen and you'll know what I'm talking about.Midtown have changed, and for the worse. For fans of their previous albums (Living Well..., ...Lose the Girl, etc.) I don't recommend this album at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"a letdown","review":"I first heard Midtown after they released Save the world, Lose the Girl. Thought it was pretty good. Then I bought their second release, Living Well Is The Best Revenge. Iloved it. I saw them perform live while promoting the album. I loved their performance. When I heard Midtown had another release, I was excited and I got the CD. I am quite disappointed with it. The album is darker and not near as upbeat as their first 2 releases. The happy poppy punk is nearly gone and this album has a rather rock-like experimental sound. There are just a handful of decent songs on this CD but I wouldn't rate most of them over a 6 on a 1-10 scale. I hadn't heard Giving up, their first single, until I got the album but I think its the only really good song on the whole thing. Overall, I am extremely disappointed with this CD. I don't know much about their dispute with Drive-Thru records, but it must've done something bad to them to result in such a lame attempt at good music."},{"rating":"1","title":"I always knew they were scene chasers","review":"Man, i was really amped for this album - but its just not very good at all. I really dig the single, \\"give it up,\\" but the rest of the record is so phony and lame. None of it is honest at all, the lyrics sounds so incredibly forced like they realized a more 'dramatic' sound was getting popular and they needed to write 13 songs based around the same 5 vocabulary words in mismatched and completely non-sensical orders. Its all just so incredibly fake, and if you ever get the chance to see them live you can literally see the falsity; its like a frat boy fashion show. It just sounds like Gabe sat in his room and played his favorite Creed records over and over until he popped 13 songs dramatic enough to entrench him in some 'salvation.' Oy, anyway, don't waste your money. If you feel the need to spend some cash look into the new modest mouse record or the joey cape/tony sly acoustic split - both fantastic records. Okeedokee, laters."},{"rating":"1","title":"The only thing worse than a band selling out...","review":"is a band selling out to a MAJOR LABEL and STILL being called the \\"lesser known\\" of their genre. Fed up with being unknown, Midtown decided they would backstab and abandon the Drive thru label, and in doing so quickly got a deal with sony. The result was a below average (at best), generic rock album, with not so catchy songs and nothing to make it stand out among the crowd (aside from shock-value song titles like \\"god is dead\\"). another year or two with DTR would have probably gotten them the fame they so wanted, but instead, they opted for an easy escape and lost on all counts i.e. this is hardly the kind of \\"success\\" a major label like Sony records expects...Don't count on a sophmore sony record from these guys, cuz just like zebrahead, they'll be shown the door faster than you can say \\"SELLOUTS!!!!!!!!!\\"...."},{"rating":"1","title":"why?!?","review":"midtown why? what the &^%$& happend to your sound, this is crap pure and simple, a huge dissapointment, a total sound change from their upbeat tunes in the past, the last song continues for an extra 10 minutes reapeating the same line over and over again............wow thank you obvously trying to meet a alotted time for the cd, this is garbage use that money for 10 slim jims and youll feel full, which is more than this cd could ever do for you"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing if you liked the sound of the first two CD's","review":"I'm going to concur with a number of reviewers. If you liked Come On, Get It Together, Like a Movie, You Should Know, etc..., then don't expect to find any songs like those on this CD. It reminds me of Ash's Nuclear Sounds CD if you're an Ash fan -- I didn't like that either. Some of the reviewers liked the 'new' sound. We can all agree that it is a different sound. My review reflects two things: 1) I didn't like the new sound and 2) I was hoping for ten more upbeat songs like the ones in the first three CD's and was extremely disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid introduction to contemporary hymn writers","review":"This volume attempts an introduction to 20th century hymnody in the US with an overview of the issues of concern to the hymnists.

In this story, the hero and heroine are childhood friends who after one unexpected night of passion went their separate ways. Now, nine years later, the hero is back to recapture what he was too young to recognize as the love of a lifetime. Rather than centering on a typical romatic wooing, the feelings of love and passion are taken for granted, and the hero works to win back the soul-melding closeness they had always shared. Unlike the majority of romance novels, the feelings in this novel seem like true, lasting love rather than mere attraction and infatuation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Guadalupan events: historical evidence","review":"This is the best book I have read on the Guadalupan subject. Though the author's credo is clear and professed, the text is thoroughly based on documents, which are fairly analysed. They cover particularly the initial period (16th and 17th century), which is often considered lacking of adequate information. Unlike many partisan writings on the subject, the author's documentary work proves sound and reliable and his statements are well supported."},{"rating":"2","title":"Son of the Smokey Sea","review":"The book was in excellent shape.

Because of his reputation as a first-class story-teller, over the years, an entire industry developed creating, rewriting, and embellishing Lincoln stories. In putting together this collection, Zall has endeavored to select stories that Lincoln himself told, even when he himself took them from earlier sources. This is not a joke book, but a collection of colorful, and mostly clean, jokes and anecdotes. Together they offer a glimpse into the psyche of an interesting man who was a master in using simple humor to political purpose."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everyone Loves a Mystery!","review":"When I first read this book, I was really not ready for it.

It is comprhensive and the extra chapterson God's righteousness are very convincing and insightfull. Piper's ability to anylize Paul's opponents are not only helpful, but extrodinary. The book has many insights that you will not find in an ordinary commentary on the subject. I cannot see how anyone who reads this book could not be convinced that Predestiantion is taught in the bible. With a religious world clamouring for sciptural support, this book is the anwser to their delima. I'm on my seconding reading and my amazment ofthe depth and theological consistency of this book continues to grow. It is one the greatest modern works by a Calvinist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Calvinist work on Romans 9...","review":"...however, it doesn't address the argument of the person who had the best non-calvinistic explanation of Romans 9... (drum roll please)... Arminius!! Piper in a calm and persuasive manner goes inch by inch through each verse and utterly demolishes the hypothesis that Romans 9 discusses nations, not individual destinies. However, that wasn't Arminius' premise (which in some places is remarkably similar to Piper's) and the fact that Piper didn't go over verse 30 leaves a hole in his explanation that's big enough to drive a truck through. For all of its in depth analysis of the Greek and Hebrew, the book is still extremely readable and a good page turner. Anyway, if you are an Arminian, you will most likely have your views challenged in a good way and if you're a Calvinist, you will probably walk away from it satisfied, but look around for Arminius' explanation, you might be pleasantly suprised that there are legitimate intellectual reasons for being an Arminian."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast and Cold, Alaska Whitewater","review":"Great and informative book.

My personal take is that both views are understandable.With this album - one of their earlier efforts - the latter is my viewpoint. The songs belt along and are quite well played. The vox are an acquired taste but certainly no worse than many other bands have, and they are at least mixed above the music, some of the early thrash bands not being able to afford decent production values and falling into a vocal no mans land.With this album Rage started to gain some momentum, the guitar playing is biting, the intent clear - these guys want to level the room. The snag is that the songs tend to wash over the listener without really grabbing hold.Of this bands early output - I'd have to recommend prospective buys skip this disc and instead buy Secrets in a Weird World instead as the songs on that disc have more connectivity with the audience and a slightly more human feel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still punkin it up after all these years","review":"I can't believe that these 40 yr old Thrashes still play 3 chord punk rock.

The 19th century's character, McNally, is just a guy who can't stop all the bad things happening but to predict even manipulate them to happen in accordance with what he(or you, the reader) already so readily ascertained. This is the worst kind of mystery written for brain dead people. If a story you've already known WHO, WHAT, WHEN, HOW, THEN...SEE? I'VE ALREDY TOLD YOU IT'S GONNA HAPPEN SOONER OR LATER LIKE THIS. Then, it's just a toilet literature for those who got nothing to do with their lives."},{"rating":"2","title":"A bit pedestrian but still ok.","review":"The trick here is not to emulate Travis McGee who is far too free-wheeling with his sex drives.

I have serious doubts that Lawrence Sanders wrote this latest Archy McNally installment. Sanders died sometime in February of 1997 after a long illness. This book was published sometime in April of the same year. After reading the first two pages of McNally's Gamble it was clear to me that Sanders was not the primary author. Having read all the McNally books, this one was missing Sanders recognizable writing style and humor."},{"rating":"2","title":"McNally at it again!","review":"McNally's Gamble provides yet another fun and witty Discreet Inquiry, chock full of Archy's illustrious wit and humor, as well as a clever storyline. Unfortunately, it offered fewer suprises than previous McNally jaunts and the villian was ever-so obvious. Still, it delivered what I expected and had hoped for -- a witty tale full of boisterous fun, eyebrow-raising espacades, a few more notches in the bedpost, and plenty of stops at the Pelican club. Not the best, but worth the addition to your McNally anthology."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deepest Bluest","review":"LL is back with this new, rough, energetic style which he shows briliantly on this track.

I have to say that I am so very glad that this book was not my first experience on the subject.I should have explored the authors subject matter more online before purchasing to my Kindle, because time and money would have been saved and I would not feel taken advantage of.This author is clearly promoting his own religious agenda and damaging the credibility of the entire subject of the nde, as in my opinion, he was more likely dreaming."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the most exciting writer","review":"While this story deserves to be told, the author tends to quote a lot in ways I find not-so-believable. I consider a quote an actual statement, but he quotes people when he's not there (in person or in spirit). He takes a lot of license, and I think that with such an important subject, he should have been more general in what people said and not quote so much when it would be impossible to remember everyone's detailed words. The writing was trite. As I was reading, I felt the author was imposing views on me that were more his than perhaps what he was experiencing.I believe in NDEs and their validity, and I have now read a number of books on the subject. This was my least favorite."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be Careful!","review":"Inspirational book from the standpoint of doing more for others than you do for yourself. But this only accounts for 5-10% of the content of the book. The cover of the book is misleading as it says \\"if a man were to die, and then return, what message might those from the world beyond send back to us\\". I find his experience hard to believe:- First, he doesn't die!- Second, I think his visions/experiences were drug induced, he was on heavy medication.- Third, his religious background (Mormonism) is prevalent throughout the book (i.e. city of enoch).

You cannot discern the truth of something if you go into it with a closed mind, as some of those who have left comments obviously did. Those who read this book with an open mind, with a desire to learn from his experience, will know with a surety of its truth, as with all truths.

Definitely sounds like they take a lot of acid. But whether they're on endless drugs or not, they've made a great drug album. This product of the Louisiana swamps is one of those albums that has to be described with lots of slashes: it's death/doom/blues/psychedelic/whatever metal. Lots of sludgy doom riffs, death-style tempo changes and evil lyrics, and an overall bluesy, psychedelic vibe. The vocals are cool, doing a good switch-off between death screaming and sorrowful crooning. Lyrics are lovely poetic evocations of hatred, torture, and death. A great album by a singularly strange band. Unfortunately, bassist Audie Pitre was killed in a car accident after this album came out, leaving the future of the band in doubt."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing.","review":"This is one of those albums that defines the meaning of 90's rock.

When you take gross anatomy in medical school, you will quickly discover just how wonderful a book is this text."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Gross Anatomy Standard","review":"Netter's is the ideal companion to the gross anatomy lab. There are numerous viewpoints presented through the drawings. Just about any situation you encounter in your cadaver is presented in Netter's with amazing clarity. Be sure to consider the accompanying CD-ROM Atlas. It has a custom test feature that is a great study aid for practical exams."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible content","review":"What a waste of money? Like most people, I bought this book for Gross Anatomy because it is so well-known and so pretty. But two weeks into the class, I had to resort to using big Moore and Grant's dissecter for both lectures and labs. This book is so disorganized that it is distracting. You'll be spending 15 min. trying to find the perineal cavity and it's nowhere to be found because the author seems to be more concern with presentation than content. I give this book 2 stars for its beauty but as we all know, asthetic quality doesn't mean squat in medical school."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Atlas of Human Anatomy Available","review":"As a surgeon, I know that precise and thorough anatomical knowledge is very important to the operations physicians perform. Having sampled most of the atlases available over the years, I can confidently say that Netter's is easily the best. I still refer to it from time to time to aid my work. I wish it had been around when I was a medical student taking gross anatomy. It would have made a difference in my understanding and test scores. This masterpiece is definitely worth buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty pictures don't always cut it","review":"First thoughts upon opening Netter's -- \\"wow, this book is gorgeous.\\" But after the first week of anatomy I was cursing it left and right and ended up relying on Moore's Clinically Oriented Anatomy and Gray's Anatomy for studying.Netter's is full of errors, mislabeled structures, and illustrations that are plain wrong -- seemingly drawn from imagination rather than cadavers. Text Moore's and Gray's don't have as many illustrations but their solid text clears up any confusion far better than a pretty picture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Choice","review":"This is one hell of a cable. You'd think how hard is it to make a cable that works? After all, it such a simple piece of hardware. Well it doesn't even fit into the video card slot, as the plastic is not in the shape of the socket, let alone deliver the power. This is trash. What a waste of $10.

I thinkm that the McNally series in an acquired taste, but oh so fun to get into. Archy tells all, in the first person, feeling, ideas, what clothes to wear, what wine and food to eat, and his love life. So much rumor here if you can give in and follow along with a good friend.

In fact, he was my favorite metal singer. I love his guest appearances on Gamma Ray's Land of the Free and Masterplan's Heroes. Instant Clarity had a couple of good songs on it and that was followed by the horrendous Readiness to Sacrifice. Unfortunately, this follows in the wake of R.T.S. and is almost as bad.For some reason, when Michael sings metal his voice is awesome, but when he sings rock his voice sounds whiny and annoying. I found the vocals on this album terribly irritating, almost out of tune, and practically unlistenable. Not that I'm suggesting that Michael go back to metal - he's way beyond that - but it seems he's lost his ability to write a good tune (actually he lost that somewhere before R.T.S.). There is nothing memorable on this album. A couple of the better songs are Let's Be Heroes, Boiling Point of No Return, and Turn It.

If you know Archy, and his world, you would know that his father would not have had an affair with Lady Cynthia, that L. Sanders would not have used a historical event like the sinking of the Titanic as part of the plot and that Archy would not be thinking of marriage after 24 hours of meeting a woman.There are a few smiles along the way, but the characters in this McNally step child are not the characters I enjoyed in the previous installments."},{"rating":"1","title":"predictable","review":"I first thought that Lawrence Sanders had one last manuscript in him before his passing - and this was it.

However, the very first page of this fake Sanders' book makes it obviously unARCHIE. I could not even force myself to read the pitiful prose and finish the book. I am mad that the publisher tried to trick the public by putting Sanders' name on the jacket. There is NO WAY this is the real thing. If my students tried to pass their work off as someone else's, I would give them an F for plagiarism! For those responsible for this faux McNally, I give them an F, too!

While the attempt is interesting, it misses the mark in many of Archy's more subtle characteristics. For the first time, it was clear how the end would evolve, another indication that Lawrence Sanders did not write this book.

Unfortunatly after reading this tomb I must say that it would have been better to die with the author. Lardo does not possess any of the charm that made Sander's character so endearing and lovable.

If you don't read the fine print, and miss the fact that this is an effort commissioned by the publisher and estate of the late author, you'll think this is Sanders' last book and his worst effort.

The publisher and estate of the late, great Mr. Sanders have greedily allowed a hack to write a novel using Mr. Sanders characters. Unfortunately, the writer, Vincent Lardo, does not possess any of Mr. Sanders wit or erudition, nor does he have a clue as to the genius it takes to write at Mr. Sanders level.

To say the least, when I read \\"he was the author of....\\" I was deeply upset and saddened. I had no idea he had passed away. I have been anxiously awaiting a new book by him so you can certainly understand why I was shocked! I shall continue to read and finish the book but it will not be the same knowing he is gone. I will certainly give Vincent Lardo a chance to redeem himself! Who knows, unless we give him a chance, we will never know if he is another L. Sanders!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Following Archy McNally around Palm Beach is a treat.","review":"Although it was pretty obvious from the beginning \\"who done it,\\" keeping Archy company is worth the time reading this book. Archie is funny, clever and hedonistic. While living in Palm Beach society he gives both an insider's and outsider's view of the goings on.The story is secondary to the characters and writing style. For me this was enough to keep me interested and entertained while Archy charms women, drinks, smokes, swims and earns his father's respect."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate to but in yet, but...","review":"Just saw the notice of the new book in today's LA Times. Shocked, knowing Sanders had died. Will read it though. Deserves a chance. I'm just popping in to say that I do recall the mention of a sister in an earlier book. And I do think a Christmas visit was mentioned."},{"rating":"1","title":"From a McNally in NJ: Such a Disappointment","review":"I was devastated when I learned of Lawerence Sander's passing. His books had provided me with so much joy through the years, and I knew it would be no more. But then a new \\"McNally\\" book appeared, and I was overjoyed to have one last venture into the world of Archie McNally. I started reading the book and could tell it wasn't as good as the others. Was Mr. Sanders ill while he wrote it? I imagined all types of horrible scenarios. Wanting to know if others shared my concerns, I logged onto Amazon.com to read other's reviews. This is how I learned that the book was not actually written by the great Mr. Sanders, but by an imposter. I looked at my book jacket, but found no evidence. Then I looked at the copyright page- there was the proof in small print. I was devasted. I had been mislead. I finished the book anyway and it was terrible. Mr. Sander's family did not do him justice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missed It By That Much","review":"Vincent Lardo tried, but he couldn't do it. Archie's wit and sartorial splendor, his father's dry personality, the atmosphere at the Pelican Club were sorta there, but everything was out of focus. I have enjoyed Lawrence Sanders for years, from the Deadly Sin and Commandment books through the McNally series, but I believe I have bought my last one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I've loved the McNally series and eagerly looked forward to reading McNally's Dilemma. I found the story to be boring. I thought Vincent Lardo did a fine job capturing the spirit of Archy and the usual characters, but the story just didn't do it for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lawrence Sanders rolls over in his grave...","review":"While I knew going in that this book was not written by Mr. Sanders, I had high expectations since Mr. Lardo was chosen by the Sanders estate and it was written in \\"the Sanders style.\\" NOT EVEN CLOSE.The plot line, prose, and even the characters themselves were trite, simple, and poorly written.This must have been the Sanders Estate way of raising money to pay estate taxes.I am glad I borrowed this book from the Public Library and did not buy it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another hit for lovers of Archy Mcnally","review":"I found this book to be another master piece by Lawrence Sanders. Archy is again tangled in deceit, murder and mystery. I have to admit that I did not enjoy this tale as well as the others Lawrence Sanders has written but it is a book that any Archy fan will enjoy. I look forward to the next adventure."},{"rating":"1","title":"McNally's lost his wit","review":"Sorry, but without Sanders special wit, Arch is too flat... what happened to his pre and post prandrial drinks? - loved those words - his making up with Connie whenever he was bad? - his having to bribe the housekeeper and her husband to get him info? - Vincent you gave it your best shot but this one just doesn't have the cutting edge or drag you into Palm Beach society the way Lawrence used to ...Lawrence's descriptions of Palm Beach and south Florida in general were so good you felt as if you were there, especially for those who are familiar with the local. I'd really hate to see Archy go but it might be time to marry him off on Connie and move him somewhere else and start over where his eccentricities can evolve.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the REAL THING","review":"Most of the McNally books took me a day or two to read because they were so funny. Archy McNally is such a great character! I love the use of words in the McNally books. However, this book took me about 1 1/2 weeks to read because it just didn't have the \\"zing\\" of the REAL McNally books. Something was missing from page one on.The story was OK, but I think I would have enjoyed it a lot more if I didn't feel like I was \\"tricked\\" into thinking Lawrence Sanders had written it. It just doesn't seem fair that the heirs can put his name on a book that was not written by the great Lawrence Sanders. What they have done is just short of fraud. Maybe next some great actors can pay someone to act \\"just like them\\" in a movie they can't do, Vincent van Gogh's family can pay someone to paint \\"just like him\\", and John Denver's heirs can pin his famous name on a new album of songs that sound somewhat like his."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jazz for easy listening","review":"Short and to the point. I have bought almost every CD in this particular collection. It's great for background music in social gatherings or in the office.

Each one different, and I never tire of listening to them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really hard pictures","review":"As always hapeens with Sebastiao Salgado, you can see really good pictures in this book, but they are really hard pictures and sometimes it's difficult to see this book.

The face is much richer looking and the quality seems quite good. Nice touch of gold accenting on the quality band. Small wrists might find the watch big. I need reading glasses and found it a bit hard to read in dark areas-watch hands and face background blurred together for me. Probably a little more on the \\"dressy\\" side than on the \\"sport\\" side, but for the price, wear it where ever you want. Had a question on operating the date (have to turn it quite a bit the first time) and vendor was extremely helpful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Collective Reminder","review":"You cannot fault the information given, it is in the usual style of Edward De Bono,there are reminders from previous written works also some additional information. It is very easy to read and take on board all he has to say. If your familiar with his work you will feel at home, if your new to De Bono, you would find it best to refer to previous works in the first instance other wise you will not gain all that is intended as there are sometimes only references and not all the detailed information you might require."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rockin' Houston Style","review":"I love this CD. The main reason I love it is because...I was there. It was recorded in Houston, TX. The unplugged version of Drunk is great. The live version of Always on My Mind was average, but the version of Being Boring was the BEST mix of the song to date. The CD is worth buying just for the mix of Being Boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"not overly impressed","review":"I bought this remote for my sons TV. The tv has been around since I was a teenager and the on/off button is starting to act up and with the orginal remote long since lost I thought a remote might help save the tv some lifespan. I programmed it to work the TV and the dvd player. The process was very simple... but the results not so good. You can't access the TV menu without it interfering with the dvd menu and then it simply wont shut the menu screen off unless you turn the TV off. It'll do it's job of saving the on/off button on the TV, but for anything other than that, it's just annoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Sound....","review":"The other reviewers seem very satisfied with the sound quality of this ocarina, so perhaps mine was simply defective, but I found the sound very disappointing. It was faint and breathy, and required much effort and even more luck to find just the right angle to get anything resembling a clear tone out of it. Returned it, and found a new one that works much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Childs play toy","review":"If your looking for something to use as decoration or to give as a toy to your child..

But if your really interested in learning to play the ocarina save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tales from the Morgue: Forensic Answers to Nine Famous Cases......","review":"I agree with the previous reviewer. Don't waste your time. There's nothing new, except maybe the information on the Kennedy case. I feel the author is capitalizing on the popularity of the forensic-type television programs, and I got sucked in. And now that I know more about Dr. Wecht from the news, my thoughts have been confirmed."},{"rating":"2","title":"I felt as if I was present during this FAMOUS AUTOPSYS!!","review":"This book is awesome! Great detail of each autopsy. Marlilyn Monroe, & JFK autopsy details are amazing! Easy read, you never want to put this book down!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother with this book","review":"As usual, Dr. Wecht (who, by the way, is under federal investigation for using his public office for private personal gain) makes the reader believe he had official roles in all these cases. In fact, in most of them he has been working for tabloids such as The National Enquirer and The Globe, and has not had any official role.It has been many years since any reputable law enforcement entity outside of the Pittsburgh area (where they have to use him) has asked for the Dr.'s assistance on a case, and his involvement in recent cases has just been to spout off in order to make the cases sound more lurid -- and thus profitable -- to the tabloid media.Save your money and don't buy this book. Use it instead to buy a front-row ticket to his upcoming (hopefully) federal trial."},{"rating":"2","title":"evidence of innocence for Scott Peterson","review":"At last, a book based on professional forensic evidence on the Scott Peterson case. This perspective, coupled with the book, Presumed Guilty, by Matt Dalton, create for me a more level-headed portrayal of facts, painting a clearer picture for the truth. Wecht's one piece of evidence for me, is the caffeine found in the toxicology test from Laci's autopsy. I have learned elsewhere, that Laci did not drink caffeine during her pregnancy. She clearly left her home alive, then, and was not drugged by Scott, as the prosecution suggested. She most likely was forced to drink caffeine under duress, suggesting the likelihood of an abduction. I do believe Scott will win his freedom, with a chance for a fairer trial."},{"rating":"2","title":"quick and thorough","review":"I can only comment on the edition for Maya 5, but after struggling furiously with another so-so book on the app, it came as a huge relief. It's not tutorial-based so much, more goes into specific functions, but it does so efficiently and clearly, with the middle two columns of each spread devoted to illustrations. I went through the book very quickly, and was amazed at the level of competence i attained in this huge beast of a program in very short order. It complements the Maya Foundation book very well; read this one first and then the tutorials in Foundation will just blow by. Tip: sit in a comfortable chair with a highlighter and read through it and mark up anything you want, then go to the computer and review the marked up areas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"This is a great book. You cannot beat the clear and to the point explanations of Maya's features. I really wish the writers would create individual books on Poly modeling and NURBS modeling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible expirience","review":"This is the first time that I have a terrible expirience with Amazon. I ordered my book and it took three weeks for the book to arrived. I never received a notification that it had been shipped or anything. I even thought that my order had not gone through. I got tired of waiting for my book and bought one at the book store, when finally the book that I had ordered arrived when I wasn't expecting it any more.It was an ownful services. I tried contacting amazon, and they asked me to contact the seller directly. I had no inforamtion about the seller. I was very disapointed with amazon this time."},{"rating":"1","title":"A lawyer's biggest errors","review":"Every lawyer knows better than to simply say what they think, give an opinion, or offer unfounded advice. \\"Don't tell me what you THINK, tell me the LAW!\\" This book makes that error on a regular basis. You'll get lots of information on how to write and present arguments, but none of it is actually founded on anything. Indeed, much of it flies in the face of what psychology has told us of the effects of primacy and recency. Another lawyer's error that simply underscores how baseless this book is? No citations."},{"rating":"1","title":"unversal confusion","review":"This remote I THOUGHT was the same one I had bought at walmart for about the same price....boy was I wrong! The programming instructions are EXTREMELY confusing and dont even seem to be the correct instuctions for this remote. To make a long story, this POS went to the garbage and I bought a 5 dollar remote from Walmart and it works easily and a child could program it......DO NOT BUY THIS REMOTE!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Remote could not find a single one of my devices","review":"I'm not sure if I'm being entirely fair giving only 1 star, considering I never really got to see the remote in action. However, considering I bought this universal remote to universally control my devices, I do think it utterly failed in that regard since it could not find a single one of them. I would have considered it acceptable if it had at least managed to control the RCA device for which I do not have a remote control, but it could not even find a device of the same brand as the remote. I will be returning this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Universal Remote","review":"My tv is an older tv/ vcr combo. I finally found tbe right setting but it would not remember it and I had to redo it . I gave up on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly designed. Where's the SAP key?","review":"Very poorly designed remote. There is no SAP key (????) so you can never access that feature. In addition there is no dedicated CC (closed caption) key, on some TVs this may be mapped to the PIP key. The batteries fit very loosely in the compartment and can come out place with the slightest bump. So if you want a remote with no SAP or CC keys and don't mind opening it nearly every day to put the batteries back in alignment then buy it...."},{"rating":"1","title":"DONT GET IT","review":"I bought this remote because it was cheap and seemed easy to program. Well, it was easy to program with my TV. I hate this remote because I have to change the batteries every week! If you like wasting a bunch of AAA batteries then this is the remote for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a do not buy review","review":"I bought this since my last remote was a RCA memory/learning remote. That failed due to a sticky fingered daughter. This new unit came and I was thinking, good, I will have a another good unit. Wrong!!! The power button would stick, the unit is lightweight and cheaply built. I had boughten two and sent both back upon trying the one unit. My advice, look further for a better remote. I am disappointed with RCA on this device. If I could give zero stars, then I would do this instead of the one star."},{"rating":"1","title":"no button for captions/subtitles","review":"There is no button to turn captioning on/off and no mention of this in the \\"user manual\\", which is not so much a manual as a list of instructions on how to get it set up--that's it. In order to get your questions answered by RCA you have to create an online account. Buttons are very small and don't always respond the first time you press them. I am returning this item to Radio Shack."},{"rating":"1","title":"DirecTV DVR users: get 6- or 8-device versions","review":"Obviously the 2- and 3-device versions lack buttons DirecTV users need.

Some other controllers do not work with Bluray players and so far I could never find any controller that worked with WD TV Live Plus."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommendable","review":"This works ok for my TV, but forget about using it for multiple units if you want any decent functionality. Granted, the play, stop, pause, forward and backward (chapter and scan) work for my DVD player (also an RCA-so you think there would be no compatibility issues), but maneuvering around on the DVD title screen is not very user friendly. To do this, you need to use the numbers and line them up with the order of the options on the screen. But here's the catch, sometimes you need to start with \\"0\\", and sometimes \\"1\\" on the remote. It's just a big pain, and it takes experimentation to figure it out. So if you like to watch bonus features, use subtitles or chapter selection, don't waste your time with this remote, it's just not designed well."},{"rating":"2","title":"satisfied","review":"For what it claims the remote is very good. No LCD like the $200+ options but it is very capable at learning new codes from old remotes and managing multiple devices. Works from a good distance as well"},{"rating":"1","title":"... Garbage","review":"When I buy a remote control that operates multiple devices I expect that when I push the DVD button I will be able to navigate the DVD menu. So when this remote failed to work I replaced it. Don't buy this control, get one that easily navigates your DVD menu with a d-pad configuration."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible product","review":"these are badly made shoes, i have owned them for about 2 weeks now and they are already falling apart. the material they are made of rips really easily, do not buy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Quality","review":"The shoe looks better than in the photograph, but the quality is really bad. It got torn in just 3 months."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great play, awful translation","review":"Well, I can't fault the quality of \\"Tartuffe\\" itself. It's a charming, well-written play that still holds up after the passings of time. Also, the inclusion of the French and English absolutely corresponding to each other does make this a decent French teaching aid.However, the translation is sorely lacking. There is no attempt to make any sort of verse translation, resulting in a flat, uninspired prose work. Beyond that, however, much of the phrasing is awkward and stilted. It seems to be faithful to the French original, but a great deal is lost when the only aim is to provide a literal rendering.In short, this book is more useful for stimulating the appetite for the much better Richard Wilbur translation. This edition may serve its purpose as a teaching tool, but it is a less than impressive read on its own."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"An excited fan, I ordered this CD.

After the first couple of chapters I skimmed thru twice as much as I read. The heroine was suppose to be young & naive; what I got was an airheaded nit-wit... an annoying one at that! I can't even imagine a man putting up with her nonsensical rambling, much less falling in love with her. The hero was probably suppose to be the brooding type - it went a little over-board to me.... hardly no personality.Well, I have heard good things about MJ, so I'm going to give one of her more recent books a try."},{"rating":"2","title":"ALICE IS BACK!!!","review":"Alice Cooper has gone back in time and revived his classic style with a hint of current day rock! Although I was a fan of his previous 2 studio albums (Brutal Planet & Dragontown) It just seemed like Alice was trying to break into today's mainstream market, but with 'The Eyes Of Alice Cooper' It might not attract a new generation of fans... but this CD will definately get playback over and over by his strong legion of fans!!If you are a classic Alice Cooper fan - this CD is definately a must have!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Detroiters ROCK ON!!","review":"This album shows yet again that Detroit puts out the best!To the person who said that KISS was not mentioned in \\"Detroit City\\" - catch up on your history - KISS is not from Detroit!!Very pleased with the shout out for ICP!!

Well, he made out a couple of good songsfor Friday the 13th part 6 and that opened the floor forhim to make a comeback.... He reach another high pointwith his big hit \\"Poison\\" and he had one more good albumbefore returning to mediocrity throughout the 90's. He isback on this CD... There is some good rockers on here..

Instead, I was left feeling like I had purchased some garage band Sound Garden meets Metallica meets Puddle of Mudd rip off. There were no clearly defined gutar riffs (where is Davey Johnstone when you need him?), supremely odd chord structures, noises or or weird ghostly effects. Oh, there were maybe one or two good songs that hinted back to Alice in his better days, like This House Is Haunted and Take It Like A Woman. Unfortunately, the rest of both albums were rife with overly heavy guitar and standard hired studio hand drum work, along with tired old references to how Alice got his name, no more mister nice guy, etc. I found both albums geriatrically Alice's worst ever ."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe this !","review":"What the hell is this? This can't be an Alice Cooper album.Instead of this I recommend Brutal Planet which is a better album ten times over. I think this is a pethatic attempt to go into popular music (bands like Blink 182, Sum41 or whatever). Alice Cooper is a shock rock legend, this album does not really say it! I have high respect into his earlier work but I just can't listen to this record more than once."},{"rating":"1","title":"He did dat -n- done dat... already!!!","review":"Alice is what... 200 years old and still singing teenager songs? No originality here. No maturity here. No progress here. Just rehashing older material. Pull out Billion Dollar Babies or Killers if you want Alice. Don't waste your time on this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Coop Does it Again!","review":"One of the most overlooked aspects of Alice's career is what an overlooked songwriter he truly is. The fact is Alice has always experiemented with a variety of styles. However, there is the most diverse album of Alice's career. While not every song works, as a whole this is one of his most satisfying releases in years. Longtime fans will appreciate where Alice is coming from and the songs are hard rocking enough to please most metal fans as well.Check out songs like Love Should Never Feel Like This or What Do You Want From Me to see the powere that Alice still has."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"for all of the people who complaining that this is not \\"billion dollar babies\\", well, it is not 1973 anymore, either.Get outta the time warp and join 2003, like Alice did.Out of the \\"old guys' 55 and older, his music is the most fresh, versus Rolling Stones, Ozzie, etc...I am an old guy who grew up with Alice, and am glad he does nto 100% look backwards."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great heavy rock fun once more with the shock rock king!","review":"This is just another simple, no thrills, straight on heavy rock album, with good tunes, strange, funny dark lyrics and wild guitar riffs. It is much like classic Alice from back in seventies like his Billion Dollar Babies and School's Out albums. Good honest, sleazy, heavy wild rock tunes to please. Great stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Coop Classic","review":"This is another great album from the Coop. Alice Cooper has made a flat out rock n roll album. This album is alot like Love It TO Death, Killer, and Billion Dollar Babies. The music is alot like that stuff with a modern \\"garage rock\\" twist. It's also like those albums because it is not a concept album like many of his later albums. The album just like all Alice Cooper albums has one ballad, but it let's his voice shine. if you have been waiting for 20 years too here Alice Cooper play rock music again, you will not be let down.I can't believe one person said that Alice's music made them ashamed to be a fan because of the lyrics making them laugh. \\"COld Ethyl\\" makes me laugh. It's about a necrophilia.Alot of Alice Cooper songs make me laugh, because he wants it to be fun and enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this really an Alice album?","review":"I am a big fan of Alice but I was very disappointed in this disc. Did Alice really write any of these lyrics? Where are the great guitar solos and hooks you just can't get out of your head? It does sound like it was done in a garage on a cheap cassette player and that's supposed to be cool? I thought that the last three albums were amazing in lyrical content, variety of musical style, and the topics were hilarious/serious. Who else would even mention that Elvis might be in hell? In concert they worked well with his older stuff too. I seem to be in the minority, but I hope the next album is much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Last Temptation to buy Alice","review":"The Last Temptation to me was one of Alice's Last classic albums! Sandwiched between hits like poison and this new album, it is amazing how versatile he is! I just do not like the LA kid sound that this album has.

I've cleaned my tiled kitchen floor, I've used it dry to clean the screens on my doors. There's no need to press down when using the scrubber, you don't need elbow grease at all, the rotating brush will take care of the dirt and grime.

However I have a compact car and a \\"small\\" SUV so it is not really necessary to use this. The amount of time I save using this to clean my car is used getting the item out of the garage, putting it together, and then putting it away. Therefore I find I never use it.I was going to try using it for cleaning the high vaulted ceiling windows in my house but probably won't because I have a \\"squeegie\\" / duster on a long pole that will probably work just as well with less hassle.I had an Amazon gift certificate so only paid half the listed price but I still regret purchasing it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Review.","review":"The Cordless Power Scrubber arrived on time, was esy to assemble and works well.

Later I found the same item at Menards for only $29.95. I couldn't beleive my eyes so I ask the manager if they had it priced right, he said it was.

Both films love to hate the film biz and its attendant phoniness, and DeNiro delivers a fine performance. Though it's almost too low-key at times, and I did get rather bored a few times in the middle when I'd think, \\"Why do I care about this guy again?\\" But his deadpan reactions bring some great comedy at times, so it's worth the occasional slog.If you like movies about movies, and some intelligently bitter humor, this is a good bet."},{"rating":"1","title":"a good book becomes a weak movie -- ain't that always the way?","review":"Robert De NIro gives his most appealing, least mannered performance in years.

His next big project is about to go belly up because its star (Bruce Willis) refuses to shave. And his therapist isn't helping matters any, either.Yes, yes, yes. Hollywood is a dark, soulless industry populated by manipulative, selfish, shallow individuals.

I really didn't care about the characters or what happened to them. The only person who had a major role was DeNiro (and even he was boring) while everyone else had minimal roles.

The book contains few strips worth remembering though his distinctive drawing style becomes quite likeable after a while, and I can highly recommend his other books, \\"Red Monkey Double Happiness\\" (a kind of South African stoner Tintin adventure, very fun read with lots of excellent artwork, this time in colour), and the \\"Dungeon Quest\\" series which is a parody of the old board game \\"Dungeons and Dragons\\" in comic book form. \\"Scrublands\\" is a weak introduction to this great comic book artist and would only appeal to fans of the previous books (like me) looking for more of the same - and not finding it here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Body Make-over","review":"This is one of many books I have bought to get into better shape.

Like in the legend of King Aurthur, the Holy Grail is the key to winning the seemingly never-ending battle of good and evil in this amazing novel. This story is mainly about three children, Simon, Jane, and Barney Drew. The Drew children, visiting their great uncle Merry stumble upon a secret opening to the attic, where they have lunch. What they find in the attic begins a quest for the Holy Grail that results in a thrilling and suspenseful novel. The excitement in this story makes it a must read for junior high students interested in the Arthurian legend."},{"rating":"2","title":"over sea under stone","review":"I love the book over sea under stone!It is an adventure from from when the kids find the map to when Barney meets the vicar(Mr.Hastings).The Drews are very risky and almost get into trouble with the grail.I think Susan Cooper put alot of work into the characters.They each have there own oppinion and lifestyle.I like the part when Barney and Simon go into the dark cave.This book leaves you on the edge of your seat.Over all I really like the book.It makes me wonder if there is a grail near me.You should read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lewis","review":"The story begins when a family moves to a new house and they find a manuscript in there atic.And the manuscript has words and symbols that they can not under stand on it.

The people are first shadowy so you can not think or visualize of what they look like. will not tell you who is tring to catch them you will have to read the book to find that out. I liked the book because there is a lot of adventure in the book and because it is not that hard to read because it does not have big words. It does not get boringbacause of the adventure.

Susan Cooper's mix of adventure, Arthurian legend, mystery, and the eternal struggle between good and evil (nicely consistent with our Christian beliefs) worked very well, as we eagerly anticipate the next books in the series. My son has read through all the Harry Potter books on this own, and he loved hearing this tale.Parents, there are quite contrived plot devices and implausibilities that strain credulity. There's not only a deus ex machina, there is literally a canus ex machina--a plot twist involving a dog. Also, the final rescue scene is hardly plausible, but that hardly matters because of the action. Finally, the problem with the moon's position in finding the grail applies to the sun as well.

Though some parts seemed a bit juvenile, it's impossible NOT to have that when the 3 main characters are younger children. But the plot is ALWAYS on the move, and I'm really excited to see what the rest of the series brings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible...","review":"I've currently read the first three books in this series. I love the other two, they read like \\"Dark Shadows\\", with a lovely mysterious feel to them. But this book seems more like \\"Hardy Boys\\", with only one instance of any real use of supernatural abilities."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Search is on","review":"In the Book Over Sea under Stone By Susan Cooper the Drew children Barney, Simon, and Jane are on Vacation in Cornwall, England with their parents and great-uncle Merry. While exploring a hidden room in the old Grey House where they are staying, they stumble across an ancient map that throws them into a desperate search for an ancient grail which will unlock power to war against the Dark side. The Dark forces (real life people) are also looking for the grail that links back to the days of King Arthur and a fierce battle between good and evil that has ensued for hundreds of years.I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone. This book sounds very exciting but it is very hard to get into and it never makes you not want to put the book down because it gives you so much detail and it drags on everything. If I had to recommend to some one I would defiantly recommend it for 1st-3rd graders but even they would get bored."},{"rating":"2","title":"Over sea under stone","review":"AWESOME Book.

I didn't want to pay a lot of money to buy it. Then I happened upon this great deal! For less than the price of the audio book alone, I got both the audio book and the Kindle book. And the were always and instantly in sync with each other. It has been fabulous to be able to go back and forth. It was an excellent package."},{"rating":"2","title":"Changed me as a child, I carry it still in my heart","review":"Over Sea, Under Stone is the first book in my favorite series of all time. I first read it repeatedly when I was ten years old, again in Ireland at age 18, and once more this year at the age of 28. The lore (as it refers to the wisdom of a people) and imagination of the series is profound, the characters both ordinary and extraordinary enough that they quickly work their way into a reader's heart. These books withstand the test of time, and will live well beyond the 20th century."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book was an exiting book full of suspense and adventure","review":"Over Sea, Under Stone is about three children hunting for King Author's Holy Grail. Their names are Barney, Simon, and Jane. They have to find the Grail before the evil side does and they'll need Great-Uncle Merry's help since he knows more about it and the evil side is afraid of him. I like this book because it is full of suspense and adventure. Especially near the end when the bad guys are right behind them after they had found the Grail. You would never guess that Merry would be waiting in a speedboat to rescue them. There were many times that the map leading to the Grail was almost stolen from them by the bad guys. When Simon was running from Bill and Merry sped by and picked him up in a car. All in all Over Sea, Under Stone is a good book because it is full of suspense and adventure."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was so mad (that this book wasn't written better)","review":"I understand the need for children's books about emotions, but this book is over-the-top. Not only is it dated, but the emotions are described without any resolution. Each page shows a mad child who is mad for a different reason, but nowhere does it show the child doing something about his/her anger, nor do the children talk to adults about what to do when you're mad.Add that to the page where the child spanks the cat and says, \\"You could be dead!\\" This one needs to be weeded. ASAP."},{"rating":"2","title":"Had known this magic manual earlier!","review":"Had known this book earlier, I could have scored better on my first trial.

No.","review":"Leaves are another nice little inoffensive indie band to add to your growing collection of Radiohead, Coldplay, The Verve, Travis, Starsailor, Lowgold, Lorien, Haven, Aqualung, Doves...sure its a nice sound and \\"Catch\\" is lovely but its hardly new to the ears - the same emotions and sounds are evoked by other bands, better. In fact this CD sounds ridiculously like Doves: the lead singer sounds exactly the same as Jimi Goodwin and sometimes the songs sound like what Doves would do.If you want this kind of thing go for either Radiohead (because they are more experimental) or Coldplay (because they do the simplistic nice inoffensive ballad better than the rest). If you want something that sounds exactly like this but came first, go for Doves. If you want some really good Icelandic music go for Sigur Ros. But its hard to see many people being satisfied with this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"If Coldplay is Radiohead-lite, then Leaves is Coldplay-heavy","review":"Nothing groundbreaking here, but it's better than a lot of stuff. The vocals are..different. Catchy melodies mostly, with the exception of Sunday Lover, which is terrible. They've been said to be a cross between Coldplay and Radiohead, but there's no Radiohead-ness here. Not as poppy as Coldplay (probably a good thing.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Leaves","review":"Please, give this wonderful Icelandic group a play. This album is quite good for a pleasant surprise of the Indie type of music. The group is comparable to Coldplay. The sound is pleasant. The mix is great. I stumbled on this group by listening to a sound bite VIA Windows Media player. This CD is for Indie, (Euro) purists."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coldplay meets Revis!","review":"This is a very good cd. The music much resembles Coldplay's style off of their first cd. The singer's voice sounds a lot like the deep voice of Revis, but this singer also hits a lot of the high notes like coldplay.

Tightening it only made the leak worse. When I asked Amazon for a replacement I was told that it was out of stock. Just as well since the 100' length is too long to keep untangled.

I think they rushed this album to try to acheive that. The CD starts off great with \\"Love Lost In A Hail Of Gunfire.\\" But it starts to get worse from there. The songs are too long and start to get boring. Too many repetitions of the same part. And they all start to sound the same too. Total lack of originality. Its not so much a swift kick to your crotch like \\"Portrait Of The Goddess\\" was. If I were to recommend you one, I would tell you to get \\"Portait\\". I don't think they will ever be able to top that."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'll pass on this one.","review":"My friend was hyping this cd and I had heard some songs from Portait of a Goddess that I thought were good so I decided to get it. As others have said, it is not the worst album ever made but it is far from the best. It sounds like something they threw together real fast in order to get a new cd out. Lots of the songs sound incredibly boring and repetitive. I was going to see them live(I even had tickets) but I got sick, and now I'm not sad that I missed them.

My taste in music has changed slightly- not to say that this album is bad it's just not as good as it could be. The only tracks i enjoy are love lost in a hail of gunfire, on wings of lead, number seven with a bullet, sweet vampirous, city of the condemned, this is love and Revenge i seek. The remaining 5 tracks sounded too repetitive in my opinion and just basically lacking in creativity. This album is definitely metalcore and honestly the sound that i prefer because as a long time fan of the band to me it's just more \\"classic\\" as recent Bleeding Through album's have gravitated more towards the swedish/black metal sound which is great and their new albums have been great but im just more into the older BT."},{"rating":"2","title":"top-notch","review":"This c.d is awsome puref**king heavy, with awsome drumsbeats, and brutal vocals, i saw these guys open for Cradle of Filth and Arch Enemy in November and they put on an amazing show, i would recomend you go out and buy this c.d, its amazing"},{"rating":"2","title":"All in all, A milestone metal album.","review":"From the opening track on \\"this is love, this is murderous\\", you know right away you are in for the ride of the year. This band combines black metal and hardcore to create probably the most brutal album of the year. Shredding guitars, powerfull screams and insanely fast drums is just the start of this masterpiece.Vocalist Brandon (ex 18 Visions guitarist) is fabulous in the fact that he can throw his screams to an extreme high and fall to a low growl constantly and still be able to sing as smoothly as if he never screamed at all, something that many bands fail to duplicate. This album is sure to be on the top 10 metal albums of this century.The only thing that sets the album to an awkward vibe is the ever present lulling keyboard. It seems all to present in some parts where its not needed and seems to darken the music more than it really has to. Other than that, its the strongest album yet from Bleeding through."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for you Slayer fans","review":"Obviously this is nay one of those cds you slayer and metallica fans want to listen to. But it's a strong album for you screamo/emocore/mealcore/whatever-you-want-to-call-it kids. It's not perfect, but it has a strong sense of melody, which is a main thing I look for in a cd. The vocals allow the songs to blend together a little too much which can lead to this being more background music than something to put on to listen to. It's worth the money you'll pay for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yet, another generic metalcore band.","review":"Sadly bt is another example that nu-metal kids are ruining the true sounds of pure metalcore.

Stations come in clear and crisp. The noise reduction feature works to reduce exterior noise. It does not eliminate it.

I found out it was the noise that was making me tired. All I can say is buy them NOW!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very comfortable and dampening but radio is average at best","review":"The best feature about these headphones is the comfort. The big thick ear cushions make you forget you are wearing them. Its sound-dampening ability is also excellent. I can operate my shop-vac with barely noticing the noise. However, the sound quality and radio reception leave a lot to be desired. FM reception is just average, and the AM reception is down right terrible. In addition, there is no tuning dial scale so searching for a station is a real adventure. Great concept, but poor execution."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great earmuffs lousy radio","review":"If you like listening to the radio while you work don't buy this product, you'll be spending all your time trying to keep it tuned in. The AM reception only allows you to pick up the strongest station and everytime you move or bump these very large head phone you lose your station and if that isn't bad enough any electic power tool causes interference on the AM band. FM reception is okay but the tuner has such a small amount of travel that any bump causes the station to change. What this radio need is a little modern technology, a digital tuner with station lock would make this a top notch product, and I would pay for the added expence. But if you are a professional builder crank up the boom box and pass on this one until they get it right."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Tool!!!!","review":"I love the combination of radio and sound protection in one comfortable product. I have tinnitus, work construction, and mow 3 acres and have tried different combinations of products for hearing protection and music, all which had serious drawbacks. I found this product in a mail order catalog and checked on Amazon where I found it for [$$$] less. These are not for the stereophile, but so what. I'm working in the yard not trying to hear the entire range of an alto sax. These headphones are a tool. Why anyone would care about the lack of a marked dial??? They are on my head. I can't see the dial and I'm not going to pull them off to look at the dial when I change stations. These are so comfortable that I wear them when noise is not an issue. I know tools and these headphones are excellant quality for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Product failed after 9 months","review":"I received my Peltor WorkTunes for Christmas 2003.

Not if I can find another brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as advertised","review":"The only thing the same was the brand and color. The headset they sent had no port to plug in a device such as an Ipod (which is why I bought it in the first place and it is advertised as having one).

Boomboxes lose reception just as much or more when you move them. It's much better on batteries than I expected it to be.If you're even considering buying these, definately do it. If there was another manufacturer making one with better reception I'd say go for that one, but since this is the only one on Amazon right now, you'll enjoy the concept."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Concept but Needs Improvement","review":"Was disappointed because I was unable to receive any AM stations and I am not into FM programming.

The legs and sleeves were WAY too long (and I wear my 6' tall husband's pants without problems), the torso was generous but not too long and the neck was way too big. I'm going to have to send it back for an XL, which is what I would have gone for if I hadn't read the reviews. To you other \\"fluffy\\" types, I would compromise between what was listed for your height and for your weight. Fortunately, I have enough time before my trip to send it back.

I would definitely recommend buying the bands used, because they make the exercises harder and you get both cardio and strength training in one workout. They are also about 40 or so minutes long each, which is longer than most videos. I find that I don't get bored because I can switch between the DVDs. The only downsides (and these apply to ALL the Tae bo videos I've done)are 1) quite lame pseudo tai'chi \\"cool downs\\" that don't really offer any stretching, and 2)Billy Blank's inane pseudo-spiritual babbling at the end which is supposed to be inspirational, I guess, but is totally incomprehensible and annoying. But it doesn't really matter because you can just turn it off at the cool down and do your own stretches and spare yourself the pablum. I'd definitely recommend this set (as well as the earlier \\"Get Ripped\\" Advanced workout)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Billy is th Bomb","review":"I recently purchased this two piece set and it is absolutely fantastic.

I bought some of the Elite (weighted) Billy Bands and when used with both DVDs they make for a really awesome cardiovascular exercise! I've been doing Tae-Bo for around ten years and I suppose I would describe myself as Intermediate/Advanced; consequently some of Billy's workouts are a little too short or not enough of a challenge but these two are definitely hard work!I am amazed at the difference the Bands make; I've got muscles and (good) bulges where I never used to so I would recommend getting hold of some bands if you can!At 46 minutes the Fat Blasting Cardio is a great length and quite easy to fit in on a daily basis. The Total Body Fat Blaster runs for 55 minutes and I suppose some people might find this hard to fit in to a busy day; however I think it is certainly worth making time for it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great workout!","review":"I enjoy this video more than most i've tried!

He moves way too fast, is totally impressed with himself, and doesn't do any real consistent moves. Plus, it's just WAAAYYYY too long.

You move around a lot and it is definitely more difficult than his first basic series of tapes of which there were 12.The only drawback is that you need the Taw Bo bands and it does not tell you that on the box or the item descriptions.

A friend did, and popped it out while we were in Den Haag. The Den Haag walk was great, crisscrossing the center of the city to show off the history and architecture. The walk snapped the city into focus for me, where it had before been just a blurred maze viewed from a tram.My friend left this book with me when I went on to Amsterdam and he to Germany, and I am so happy he did. I used it every day to give shape to my meanderings across Amsterdam. It's a compact city. You can walk anywhere if you're willing to spend the time, and I recommend you do. Slow down and spend the day ambling along the Herengracht with this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible book ( there are better resources)","review":"My wife and I used this book two weeks ago when we were in Amsterdam. The book is terrible. Often times, the writer suggests that you walk down roads which have no interest or value (such as down a busy road in the Western Isles walk). The directions given in the walk are confused and confusing (you are told to go down a street but not whether down means left or right). A better walks resource is the walks designed by the VVV (the Dutch train system) which are detailed, clear, and very interesting. The VVV is near is Central Station."},{"rating":"1","title":"There must be 10 odder and better books","review":"As a Dutchman I enjoy reading travelbooks about my own country.

It's definitely a Dutchman who wrote it. There are words in there no one uses and most Americans/Englishmen won't understand either. It's not very 'folky' which makes it weird sometimes.

Among the first victims of the evil android is the ever-unfortunate Krillin. Realizing that Earth needs Goku again, Piccolo makes a huge sacrifice to allow Goku to escape. Goku immediately engages Super 17, but even after Goku powers up to Super Saiyan 4, victory seems unlikely. Pan is nowhere in sight, but an assist from another mighty lady in the Dragon Ball universe just might give Goku the edge he needs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Android please","review":"this volume is like bad. super 17 gave the super vegeta a hard time, Goten and trunks an even hader time. Not even gohan could beat him. even MajUbb, who was just as strong as Super Buu didn't even make 17 budge. yet SS2 Goku just punched 17 and he moved miles and miles with ONE punch.Whats up with that? SS2 Goku is stronger than the merging of Ubb and Buu. Any way 17 was defeated by one dragon fist anmd Goku wasn't even super saiyan!! But the apprerance of #18 was nice and the destruction of dr.Myu was great but those were the only good points to these episodes. even the wrost DBZ episodes were better than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"toddler friendly","review":"This dvd is great for toddlers.

My husband was sckeptical but it is so convenient and it helps to keep my dash in good condition and my leather seat from getting too hot, so my husband decided he wanted one also. But be careful on the sizes because we found that just because it says a certain size will fit a particular vehicle does not mean that it actually will. The site said the 25 inch would fit my husband's infiniti m35 but after getting it the 25 inch was too tall on one side. We are looking into just moving the two shades between the two vehicles, if my shade fits his car to prevent going thru the whole return issues."},{"rating":"1","title":"too small for a pickup","review":"If you have a pickup, don't waste your money on this. The problem is they are too short by several inches to go across the window. I installed in my F150. You never want to fully extend these across the window because they won't fold up automatically. To make matters worse, it is fully extended across my window and is 5 inches too short. I took it out of the window and now I have these stupid black clamps in my window. They are securely glued to the window. Why would they offer 25 inches tall but make them too short for the window."},{"rating":"1","title":"Adhesive fails soon after installation","review":"Purchased as a Christmas gift for my girlfriend. I installed it in April, 2010.The product came with mounting brackets with an adhesive backing.By August, the glue pads that adhere the mounting brackets to the windshield had failed. The pads stuck to the windshield properly, but failed where the factory glued them to the mounting brackets. This is a manufacturing defect that should be covered under the 2-year warranty. Without the brackets, the shade is useless. No email response as yet from Vendor or the Manufacturer, Dash Accessories.Think we'll go back to the Eclipse brand shades. They are at least useable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea but doesn't deliver.","review":"This is a great idea but did not deliver. When it gets warm it doesn't fold back up well, it just wads up. I then have to wait for a cooler time to refold it the whole length to make it fit back in the bracket. It is a hassle. It retracts fine when it is cool, but that is counter-intuitive, I need to use it when it is HOT. And since it had permanent adhesive you can't just take it out and return it.**Update I stand by the product review I wrote earlier. The seller did take this as a return and refund even without the mounting that are STILL stuck to my windshield. I give the seller credit for being reasonable about this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too short","review":"I ordered these shades specifically by model to fit my Leisure Travel van, I paid quite a bit for them directly from the supplier. They seem to be designed so they slide under the rear view mirror which means they leave a large gap for the sun and heat to get in both on the top and the bottom and the sides completely negating the purpose for which I need them. also they are hard to pull closed leaving me to worry that they may snap open if one of my dogs hearing something happens to bush against it. great idea but extremely poor fit and poor execution."},{"rating":"1","title":"Moderate quality and it wasn't what I expected.","review":"I bought this sun shade as a long term investment, but the product I got was far below my expectations. I did not like the fact that the shade did not cover the entire windshield. If I'm going to pay $30, I wanted something that would cover the whole window. Also the cover material was very thin. I could see through the material if there was light on the other side. I'm sure this was necessary to make the shade very thin when folded up but I question its thermal conductivity. There are wires that are in tension which allows the shade to fold up automatically. This mechanism also didn't seem too sturdy and all the reviews about having the retracting wires break were understandable.I ended up returning the item so I didn't try sticking it on the windshield.I ended up buying a cheap $12 round fold-able windshield shade at the local auto store. This one is also thin and quality is far from sturdy but at least its not $30."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks nice, but hard to use","review":"After reading through all of the comments here, I cautioned my father about the threads breaking and the knob falling off. We live in AZ and it's almost October here, so the temps aren't as high as they typically are. It kept the inside cooler and looked nice, but it wadded up when we got in the car to go somewhere. We spent quite a bit of time straightening out the pleats while trying to not break the thin nylon string that enables it to fold. We had to actually start the car and turn on the AC because by the time we got it folded back up, the car had become hot. I wouldn't buy this product again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like a good dog, they must be trained.","review":"We use these hoses everyday and love them.

I personally did not like this book very much. It was a little immature, but there was a point. The main point was the Skin Heads can make you do things that you wouldn't normally do. Such as, Dan *nicknamed Demon* saw a crime being committed. He saw the Skin Heads beat up a store clerk that was of a different race. Dan didn't know what to do. The Skin Heads saw him and told him not to say anything. After that Dan was brought in to their little group. Even before that Dan was interested in them. At the Mall Crawl Dan, Laurel, and some of their friends saw the Skin Heads. The Skin Heads had all sorts of tatoos. The Skin Heads hate anyone of a different race. This is the reason that I personally didn't like this book. To me, it seemed stupid and in a way a little immature, as I have said. The concept was okay, but the rest was just boring.

Instead you have a pretend flight model that only funtions in 2D. No free flight at all. No dogfighting, no acrobatics. You just point on a map where you want to go, push a button, and off you go. (It's bad). On top of that, everytime Westwood patches new stuff to the beta, they make the game worse, and less fun.It doesn't matter that the beta testers tell them it's bad.Westwood just wants to get it out on time.They might get it straighted out a six months after the release, but by then hopefully someone will put out a good space game."},{"rating":"2","title":"EnB, I like it and husband likes it, too","review":"We've been playing the beta for awhile and tried 5 of the 6 avatars in the game.

What were they thinking?","review":"In beta this game was great because it had PvP in it, but when there were a few weeks left of beta, they took out PvP. Yes the PvP system was super buggy in beta but instead of trying to fix it they became lazy and just took it out which was a very bad mistake. No PvP means a boring game once you reach the highest level cause there really is nothing left to do other than kill monsters, trade, and talk to other players which easily gets boring. If you have love for PvP like me then get Asheron's Call 2 or Dark Age of Camelot though those games aren't futuristic like this one, they have extremely good PvP. If you only want to play futuristic MMORPGs then wait for Star Wars Galaxies to come out. It's funny if how they just left PvP in this game then I would have rated it 5 stars, sadly they [messed] up because of their laziness. This is all I had to say."},{"rating":"1","title":"At this moment, not very good","review":"Sorry, but this game is not very complete even with the latest patchI waited for the latest patch that was supposed to save this game and it just didnt pan out. Its a boring, tedious online game that has none of the emotion or character of EQ, DAOC and AO. It's fanbase is woefully inadequate and full of griefers and whiners that PVP should be allowed, while the majority of the content suffers due to a nazi like PVP following.Pass on this one now, as most people playing it are simply waiting for Eve or Star Wars anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Longer Playable","review":"This game has been unplayable for five years now. I am aghast at why this is still for sale when it cannot be played. Is there really such a thing as a \\"GAME COLLECTOR\\" who would be interested in making the game a part of some grand collection?And just for clarity, there is no single player mode and no way to host your own mini-universe for it.Again, not sure why it is still being sold when it cannot be played and why the sellers are not noting this in their product pages. Here is a quote from one of the vendors \\"PC Game complete in box with all contents - cds are in great shape and play great...\\" Hmm.. CDs play great eh? How?Sorry for being so down on this, it is not my style to be rude, but I have been burned four times now with ONLINE UNIVERSE games that sellers failed to mention could no longer be played.Hail Flavius!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great for a week or so, but gets old fast","review":"Being one of the beta testers for the game, I had already known pretty much what to expect when I bought it. It was bland, the missions were redundant, and it took way too much time to travel from one end of a sector to the other. However, I bought it thinking that Westwood was going to add new content every month.And so they did, but the content came only in little trickles and it hardly ever changed the game. Missions remained static, plot lines only slowly emerged over a matter of months, and actual help from the game masters was nonexistent. For the first month, this is a great game, if just for the novelty of playing a space trading game with real people. But it's not worth paying a monthly subscription for."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT the game I thought it would be....","review":"If you are looking for \\"Freespace\\", \\"Tachyon\\", or \\"WingCommander\\" in a MMORPG environment, this is NOT it.I mean... you control your ship with your mouse... need I say more?? Don't get me wrong - this game is very close to being a space jockey's dream... but it does fall short.It is really a solo game with a bunch of \\"chat\\" going on the whole time. It is so close to being something really cool, but falls short in the end. A good overhaul or two, and it might be worth playing... but as it stands, I'd just as soon break out \\"Tachyon\\", \\"Freespace\\", or \\"TieFighter\\" for that matter..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Tale","review":"The writing style, and the emotions and bearing of the main characters, are a bit dated but, if you stick with it, I think you will find this a wonderful tale - it certainly got me hooked on Weyman.

As much as I wanted to love this cookbook and the lovely, charming Paula, I was really disappointed. I found the ratios of ingredients really off and wondered if they actually hadn't made a mistake with some of the recipes. There are good points if you fiddle with the recipes- especially the banana pudding. If you're still dying to buy this cookbook, I'd see if I could find it used since there are few pictures anyway. But when there are so many cookbooks with recipes that work, why buy this one?"},{"rating":"1","title":"No photos","review":"I am actually a cook that if something looks pleasing to the eye, I will try and cook it. I bought a bunch of cookbooks and didn't read the summary description of those books so when I received this book, I was so disappointed to find out that there were no pictures of the recipes. I will not return it because the shipping cost is the same as the cookbook price so I will probably just donate this book back to the library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lady & Sons","review":"I love Paula Deen.....it's an excellant cookbook - but I can't cook like Paula everyday. Too much butter and oil for frying!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me....","review":"I was really disappointed with this cookbook. As much as I enjoy Paula Deen what I've cooked from this book turned out to be slop. The Sunday Morning Casserole was disgusting and bland. Maybe southern cooking just isn't my thing since I'm used to a different kind of palate of european style cooking. God knows I've tried to do the southern cooking thing, but I'll pass on this book and all the rest of her books. I still enjoy Paula's shows and adore her personality. She seems like a real sweetheart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Charming read, would make a good movie, but can she cook?","review":"Oh yeah, the intro by that Midnight author guy is in here. Yippee! For fans of his, this may be the only reason to buy this book, so I'm giving it 2 stars for that. I have to wonder if all these recipes even tested. I 've heard her cafe is actually good, but I cooked about 10 of the recipes in the book and they all were dissapointing. I almost felt ripped off. Don't waste your money. If you want to cook great southern food, try out True Grits or A Gracious Plenty - much better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was not what I expected.","review":"I chose to buy this book because it had such good reviews from other (...) customers. When I finally received it, I tried my first recipe-The Lady's Cheesy Mac-and was very disappointed. I put the eggs in just like it said and everything just curdled. So instead of having a smooth cheesy consitancy, I had macaroni in a chunky-eggy sauce. It was a failure and I wasted a lot of good cheese on it. But I decided to try another recipe in the book, The Cheese Buscuits. And they turned out better. Because of that I have given it 2 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Southern Cooking","review":"A friend a shared some recipes from the book and I found it in several retail establishments, but Amazon was much cheaper. There are sooo many good recipes (I have made two) but forget about Calories in this one. Just from the ingredients in most were talking 450 plus per serving. I look forward to making many more desserts from the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy, Fast and Yummy!","review":"I am a huge fan of Paula's. Her recipes are very warm and comforting made with everyday ingredients reminding me of grandma's cooking. ANY cook would be sucessful creating these dishes.

My favorites are the gooey butter cake, sour cream pound cake and the shrimp and rice casserole."},{"rating":"2","title":"Commendable collection.","review":"\\"The Lady & Sons Savannah Country Cookbook\\" is a commendable collection of down-home Southern recipes. Paula H. Deen, the owner and proprietor of the popular The Lady & Sons restaurant, has included hundreds of her favorite dishes here. And nearly all of them are simple to prepare--especially her signature Cheese Biscuits, which she serves (piping hot, of course) to customers waiting in line. Other delectable-sounding dishes include: Broccoli Souffle, Potato-Egg Salad, Ester's Dill Coleslaw, Herb Corn Bread, Hoppin' John (which, thankfully, contains no meat stock), and Grandmother Paul's Sour Cream Pound Cake. The book's spiral binding, non-glare paper, and simply layout are all laudable features. Author John Berendt (MIDNIGHT IN THE GARDEN OF GOOD AND EVIL) pens a fine Introduction, in which he discusses what makes Deen's downtown restaurant so quintessentially Southern."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is my favorite cookbook!","review":"Paula Deen's cookbook is one of my favorites. The food represents wonderful Southern cooking. My personal favorites are the gooey butter cake, Savannah crab cakes, a cold broccoli salad that would be perfect for potlucks, and a very hearty potato casserole with sour cream, cheese, and bacon in it. The recipes are very manageable and they don't take forever to prepare. Many of the dishes are served in her Savannah restaurant. I highly recommend this cookbook!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love me some Paula!","review":"This book is SO good- I remember first seeing Paula years ago on QVC selling this book, before it was released in bookstores. I wanted to buy it then, but didn't, for one reason or another. I finally purchased it recently, and the book does not disapoint.

I received this cookbook as a present from some friends, and it was one of the best cookbooks I've ever received. Each recipe has it's own litte way of bringing joy and fun to your table. One in particular, the Lucious Lime Cheesecake Bars are to die for! You'll receive compliment after compliment when you make these! Not to mention anything else! The book is very straightfoward, with easy to follow directions, and variations of recipes as well. I highly reccommend this book, and know it will bring a little more southern hospitality your way!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite cookbook...","review":"I love Paula! So far I have made 4 of the recipes, and they have all been super easy and they tasted great! I actually have the chicken casserole in the oven right now, so there should be some good eatin' in about 45 minutes! I would recommend this cookbook to anyone who likes comfort food. You won't find any \\"light\\" recipes in this book so you might need to space them out so you don't gain a ton! Overall, I'm very glad I have this in my cookbook collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Would be better with a nice photo.","review":"The only reason I don't give this five stars is for lack of pictures (I know, I know, but what can I say? I like a visual and there's not a single photo in the whole book). I made a dutch oven dish that was wonderful. Absolutely one of the best dishes I've had. Paula Deen isn't for everyone though. She's very country, which means she uses a lot of cream, butter, etc, etc. She's not afraid of going over the top, so discretion is advised. However, she is accurate in saying that butter makes everything better and these recipes are no exception! Also, this isn't 'thirty minute meals' by any stretch of the imagination, so if you're looking for something quick you might check elsewhere, but if you have a little bit of time these are some good old fashioned recipes."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Lady and Sons Savannah Country Cookbook","review":"Good book with lots of recipes some look good other maybe question with.

I got this second hand off eBay, for $250.00 I would suggest getting the the Freedom Grill (www.freedomgrill.com) or the Tailgator Grill(www.gatorpit.net) , both of these are true grills that are hitch mounted. Blue Ridge Mtn. Cookery (http://www.classiccookers.com) has some nice commercial catering equipment, but there was definately no planning involved in this design. The only thing I could easily cook was a few hot dogs without the thing getting full of grease and catching fire."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Sunday grill","review":"This grill would be great for Sunday when you are tailgating for the game and it is easy to use.

And then add a lot of Toto and that sort of stuff. Really good actually. A favorite track was \\"Holding The Line\\", and it don't sound like Toto's old hit if someone wonder. A quite comfortable track for the ear. The whole album is in that direction really, and with a positive spirit over it. This music makes you happy, for sure so if you're depressed, down and lonely...try it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gabor Kleinblosem, Strutterzine Magazine, Sweden","review":"Musically Jason Gonzalez is playing good AOR with some catchy tunes on his CD. The CD starts with \\"Starting Over Again\\", a nice midtempo aor/poprock song with a great chorus a la GREGG ROLIE meets JOURNEY. Track \\"Holding the line\\" is great midtempo AOR. Then we get to hear the best track, namely \\"Lover's Curse\\". This song has a fantastic AOR chorus. Concluded I can say that if you like everything from JOURNEY and related side projects of the band members, then this CD is a must for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good","review":"When I first heard this CD at a friends house, I though it was the great Steve Perry from Journey. Much to my surprise, it was a new band from New Jersey. I had to purchase the disk right away to add to my collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cake is here, let's eat.","review":"Well, at first I thought that the CD was just ok, and maybe a little repetitive. At that point, I thought it was 3 stars. However, after I listened to it more I re-discovered why I like Cake so much.Now, there are no anthemic greats like Distance and Never There, but the songs aren't let downs either. No Phone is their first single and it's good. However Wheels and Take It All Away are great too, and probably the most recognizable when compared to Cake's old songs. Too Much Carbon Monoxide, although rather distinct, is pretty good too. The last really good song is Guitar Man which adds a bit more melody to Cake's repertoire.In closing, this album is a great buy for Cake fans, and also just a good buy for any fan of contemporary rock."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice job Cake","review":"I love all of the other albums Cake has put out and I do like this one. I was a bit disappointed with the abundant synthesizers because I've never known Cake do use them this much. I think they could have traded some synthesizer for some more trumpet! I also love Cake's witty lyrics and they were definetly on this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"What's not to like?","review":"It's another likeable sing-along-able endlessly-listenable CD from the guys. My CD has a sticker on it that says \\"Contains the Hit No Phone\\" which is fun but but I like much better Take it All Away, Waiting, and End of the Movie. It's pop poetry. This is music baby boomers will like, their college-aged kids will like, and the kid brother will like too - everybody likes it. What's not to like?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Say it ain't so...","review":"I must be an old school Cake fan, and time stands still for me; but I thought I would never see the day where the band would change to the point I wouldn't buy, listen and assimilate the new record.I bought the record, popped it in and didn't listen to it for a month after the first. I returned to the record thinking, \\"what could be different this time around?\\" No precussion and no Trumpet, the backbone of the band, I guess. Because after the second time I listened to it, I noticed it more than anything else. I am crushed, but I will get over it, just don't ask me today, or tomorrow...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ouch..its so bad","review":"I have been a Cake fan for quite some time now, and I loved how they were so different and had a sense of style all their own. I was blown away and hooked by the first four cds. However, after buying Pressure Chief, I'm convinced the amazing musical energy I once loved so much is no longer existent.Besides \\"Wheels\\" and \\"Guitar Man\\" everything else plays on like an electronic mess. \\"No Phone\\" might just be the worst song I've ever heard, and supposedly it was the first single! The lyrics don't do McCrea any justice as they did on Fashion Nugget, or Motorcade of Generosity, and all around has been a sad dissapointment. Don't get me wrong, I still love Cake. Nobody is perfect, but I would definitely stick to the older Cds if you are interested in seeing what Cake has to offer, because you won't find it on Pressure Chief."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost Brilliant","review":"Cake is my favorite band, so I am biased. That said, I think I'm being fair when I say that the album is very good, almost incredible.I get the feeling that the band (or John) was a bit rushed when making this album. Sometimes the lyrics seem a bit sparse or weak or at other times just repeat way too much.I wish they would take a lesson from Pink Floyd and slow it down; let the music groove for a bit longer and say what they really mean to say.Now despite my criticism I think that they still have unbelievable talent when it comes to song writing and performing. This is a must have album if you have liked their past stuff, especially Comfort Eagle. Best track in my opinion is \\"Take It All Away\\" (if you want to, say, download a sample)."},{"rating":"1","title":"a real letdown","review":"not horrible but it does not compare to their previous work. the music is not as good and the lyrics are bad"},{"rating":"1","title":"Imploded Cake","review":"Like the last Cake effort, Comfort Eagle, the original members really made the band what it was and now they are gone, except the singer. The result is insipid and lacks the spark, charm and vibe of the early collaborations. The singer needs to find some new members that have some kind of aesthetic discernment and can play because it is lacking herein. I would suggest listening to the first CDs, excluding \\"Comfort Eagle\\" instead.Unless one has no ears or taste, the difference is apparent."},{"rating":"1","title":"boop boop boop boop boop","review":"Ummmm yeah...a bit too much with the synthesizers. I can't even listen to Dime. I've never had to skip a Cake song before. I absolutely love love love Cake, but this album is not Cake as we know them. They poke through in songs like 'Wheels' and 'End of the Movie' which are both amazing (especially since McCrea finally sings -- wow!) and make the album worth buying, but guys, c'mon, please drop the synthesizer and step slowly away."},{"rating":"1","title":"For the love of Cake, read this","review":"Awful. Absolutely awful. I love the band, I really do. I go to Cake concerts, own the albums, and generally know the words. Meanwhile, there is no excuse for a band to sing about a chick hanging a basket. Or to just say the words \\"Wheels\\" and \\"No Phone\\" repeatedly like the swinging of a dead horse against the pavement which has bad synthesizer work evaporating off it. It's real bad. Please, don't support this. Love old Cake. They didn't do any good, and in our heart of hearts, we know it feels like a sell out to disasterous degree."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cake at its worst","review":"This CD sucks. No matter how manty times I listen to it, I cant find anything to like about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Done.","review":"As I sit here listening to the CD for my second time through I must say Cake has done a good job. I am slightly disappointed to see Cake continue there heavy reliance on background electronic beats that was seen on Comfort Eagle. While electronic effects were a great enhancement to some of their older CDs, their recent dominance tends to reduce the overall quality of the soundtrack. Aside from that though Cake continues to dazzle all with their playful lyrics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great car music","review":"This is my favorite CD. My two year old loves \\"No Phone\\". If \\"Carbon Monoxide\\" didn't include the F bomb, it would be perfect. It's become a reflex action to turn down the volume just in time! The songs are very catchy, witty and detailed. Different and very fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cake still amazes","review":"this CD is slightly more techno and synth than previous CDs however, they will never fail to amaze and entertain with a sound that is Cake. Old favorites or new... the same charateristics and styles still apply.. it is no wonder they have such a large and varied cult following. They can grow as a band but manage to not abandon what the fans love about their music."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is some good Cake","review":"I'm a pretty big Cake fan, and I purchased this album the day it came out. It's not nearly as good as the flawless Fashion Nugget, but it's still really good, because, well, it's Cake! But if you are just getting started with Cake, I would start with their old stuff, like Prolonging The Magic. I give this CD a rating of 4 1/2 stars.Song by song rating out of 5:Wheels: 5No Phone: 5Take It All Away: 4Dime: 5Carbon Monoxide: 4The Guitar Man: 5Waiting: 5She'll Hang The Baskets: 3End of the Movie: 4Palm of Your Hand: 5"},{"rating":"1","title":"Competent but continues to dumb-down with polish","review":"2 1/2Their continuation of a more pop oriented, keyboard-driven, easy going snazziness is not as bad as it could be, but I understand why some fans of the band have become disappointed. Starting relatively strong, the album eventually dwindles into auto-piloted bounce, albeit with some still feint sings of the band's trademark lyrical and white-funk skill."},{"rating":"2","title":"Splendid Extension of Frankenstein","review":"Livingston and Tinnell's The Living And The Dead is the best thing they have produced to date. Their graphic novel extension of Frankenstein works quite nicely. (Far better than say Steve Niles' graphic novel \\"modernization\\" of Frankenstein, Wake the Dead.) The artwork by Farritor very much complements the story woven by Livingston and Tinnell. The commentary by Skal on the story and the persistence of Frankenstein in popular culture at the end was good, though it would have been nice had it been a bit more in-depth.Note, The Living And The Dead is contains some material that is for a more mature reader and thus unlike their graphic novel The Black Forest should not be handed to too young of a reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"great video","review":"Really love this video...need knee replacement surgery and have arthritis in knees and joints especially shoulders and this workout gives me back a full range of motion.

Really am enjoying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT MOTIVATIONAL!","review":"I was bitterly disappointed with Chair Dancing Around the World. I bought this for my 87 year old mother who has limited mobility in her legs. It moves way too fast, and Jodi's voice is SO irritating to listen to. She confuses the elderly by showing beginning, intermediate, and advanced moves all at one time! And of course, Jodi, is doing the advanced the whole time. \\"Just watch the person who is going at your speed\\", she says. That's really impossible to do because, of course, you gravitate toward watching Jodi in fast motion. It's ashame, because this could have been a great video--the idea behind it was fantastic. However, one time of listening, doing, and watching it was enough for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mamma Mia!","review":"I got this CD for two things Hey ba ba re bop and My Cucuzza. My mom had these songs on a 45. We played it so much the 45 broke! We know all the words and sang them all the time. When my parents had their 50th wedding anniversary and we had a big family party, we got this CD to play. What a sing-along that was. Louie Prima is so electric. You can't be sad or sit still. Just buy this CD. You won't be sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Glad To See Aussie Punk Going Well","review":"This Cd brings together a culmination of catchy, hardcore and fast punk songs. I strongly suggest purchasing this cd and to all the aussies to support the local talent. Seraphs Coal combine unbelieveable guitar playing with great vocals and solid drumming. My personal favs on the album are:The Simple Equation - Great song with awesome g-taring really fast.Easier To Say - Another fast awesome song.Blood Red Under Blue Skies - What can i say? Great song.Hope Is Where The Heart Is - I would suggest to any punk fan this song it is the best on the album and is one of the best punk songs i have heard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spend your money elsewhere","review":"I haven't even listened through the entire CD. I don't think I can bring myself to spend my time doing so. Where to begin. From the selections I've heard, the chorus sounds incredibly thin and weak, the organ overpowering them on numerous occasions. Part of the blame in that, however, goes to the mix...the choir not getting enough mic to balance out the instruments. That happens too often in chorus/instrument recordings and it drives me batty. The music selections aren't so inspiring either. You would do much better devoting your hard-earned dollars to Eric Whitacre's acappella choral works, or any of his contemporaries."},{"rating":"2","title":"More than I bargained for!","review":"I bought this for my newborn preemie niece for Christmas.

Well constructed. It's the mirror itself that is the problem. It's a plastic faux-mirror material that doesn't reflect in a linear fashion the way a glass mirror does. Akin to a fun house mirror - not quite as bad, but enough to warp your face and surroundings, give you a head ache and make you feel a bit nuts while looking at it.I would never let a child (baby) of mine look at him or herself in this mirror. It may induce autism or some other psychological disorder. Crazy baby syndrome. I feel it's important for a baby to see an unwarped reflection at this stage of development.There are other plastic mirrors on the market that reflect much better than this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just for puppies!

I blends all the things I preferred in the different books into one simple and easy to follow program that helps you understand in plain terms why and what you should be doing.

You then need to adjust it each time. And even more annoying, the volume up and down are two separate, and hard to find buttons, which make it louder or quieter in preset increments. It gives you very little control, and even the lowest volume is quite loud, so I can't get it as quiet as I want it.Really poorly designed. Don't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"could be better","review":"not too useful. Could have figured out a lot of this stuff on my own. Actually, I already did.

I don't know what the reviewer who gave it one star was complaining about...I suppose some of the photos look grainy because they are 70 years old? I thought using the different paper for the older photos was a nice touch. The book is wonderfully pleasing to look at and a good visual document of Riefenstahl's pursuits...It is amazing that she is still alive and apparently going strong at 99. She seems indestructible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gorgeous book--a must have!","review":"As gifted as she is controversial, Leni Riefenstahl's \\"five\\" lives are imminently fascinating as this impressive book will prove! Even to the uninformed or casual observer, this edition will entrance.

Come on Robert Nordan, whoever you are, this is 2001! Mildly suspenseful, the tale is trite and rife with paternalism and benevolence. The word nigger is more offensive now than it has ever been. Don't use it and site historical context as an excuse. Since this is the author's first book for children, for the sake of young people everywhere, I hope it will be his last."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Heavenly ever","review":"If your a fan of power metal or melodic speed metal or just good ol' fashion metal, this is a must have.

No offense to Sam and the boys."},{"rating":"1","title":"Much of the same....","review":"As my title states, nothing new with this album that you cannot find in on some other album somewhere. Alot of very generic music, cheezy lyrics and some impossibly difficult to understand singing.Do not get me wrong; I like Heavenly, I loved Dust to Dust, it melded together to create a very well told story, good music and some fun songs. Virus, however, does not do that. There are 2 songs on the album which are good. Wasted Time and When The Rain Begins to Fall. The ladder is something a bit more experimental for them, but overall, the combonation between Sotto and the female vocalist works well.The rest of the album is hooky; yes, some songs like Dark Memories and Liberty are catchy, but they are nothing new; Virus, Power and fury, Bravery in the Field, Spill Blood on Fire are all rehashed from other groups, and it all sounds very bland and generic.IMO, heavenly took a major step backwards with this album; Dust to Dust was a solid release, and virus is a big disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scent Locket","review":"I absolutely love this locket! For the scented part, I use a small piece of felt and spray perfume on it. Great size, not gaudy but not so tiny you can't put something in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could the package get ANY smaller???","review":"I ordered this cork grease to save myself a trip to the music store. I couldn't be more disappointed. The packaging is a joke. The diameter of the package is almost exactly the same size as a quarter coin - it is even smaller than a plastic cover for a water bottle or pop bottle. The thickness of the container is slightly greater than 1/4 inch in height. The package is EXTREMELY difficult to get open. Until the packaging gets changed - DON'T buy this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Title should be \\"the expensive not so big house\\"","review":"I made a list of my favorite ideas from this book, and I took that list to our builder. What I learned is that the author has told us how to build a wonderful small house -- but the kinds of details and materials she advocates will produce a small house that costs as much as a large one! I still agree in principle with the idea of building great smaller homes, but this book is only for those who have lots of money to spend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stylish, expensive and uncomfortable","review":"This book seemed to me to mainly be an essay on how to hire an architect to create a trendy, uncomfortable home. Some of the layout ideas do appear to have value, but it tends to be masked by the very uncomfortable looking designs. One specific comment would be that she writes about consideration for the lifestyle changes that are (nearly) inevitable as one gets older, but then gushes about children's rooms that are clearly designed in a way that will never be usable after the last child is more than about 9 years old.I would recommend American Bungalow Style or something similar before this."},{"rating":"2","title":"remodel","review":"This was a great book to get some ideas of what is needed or what can be simply changed in a small house to make it roomier without the price tag.

She isn't about building on the cheap, so much as getting the best living use from your money by thinking differently about what a house is and how it works.We had been looking at 2500 to 3500 sq.ft. houses before this, and now are looking at about half that space on roughly the same budget. She seems quite influenced by Christopher Alexander, et al's \\"A Pattern Language: Towns, Buildings, Construction \\", which is a great place to explore her principles in depth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so big house - You have to be kidding!!!!!","review":"OK, I guess I'm a loser, 'cause these are big homes to me. I guess I was hoping to see not so big houses that were ... well... not so big as in average to small. I was looking for ideas on a second home. I couldn't afford these as my primary home. I would love to see the book - \\"Too big Houses\\" if these are the not so big ones. If you were after what I was after, you may want a different book, or unless a 3500 - 5500 sq ft home is small to you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Creating a Home (not a House)","review":"Well written and edited philosophy of how to create a home that will serve your needs without having to live in a Cathedral sized house. Susanka is very upfront about what this book is about. It is not about building houses on the cheap. But I also believe that this doesn't have to apply to building a house from scratch either. If you are in the market for a house I believe this book can help you decide what you're really looking for in a home. Of course when not starting from the foundation yourself there is some compromise involved. The beautiful color pictures that fill the pages are integral the book and Susanka makes great use of them as perfect examples for her themes. The houses mentioned are typically of a certain style but I don't think that should limit one's imagination when envisioning their own space. All in all an inspirational and beautiful work."},{"rating":"1","title":"this book is about HUGE, non-urban custom houses in the rural midWest -book is irrelevant to small urban homeowners","review":"I am puzzled by the title and the contents.I wanted a book about small houses and how to remodel or decorate them. This book cannot be more irrelevant.This book is exclusively about custom built, large (2000 sqft+) houses for people (retired wealthy, or professional double income wealthy) with unlimited budgets who are building their dream home in the country woods.What really bugged me is that \\"not so big\\" in this book really means \\"not a 5 bedroom MacMansion.\\" If you are in New York City, Los Angeles, or San Francisco, the featured houses would count as rare gargantuan behemoths.I thought book editors gave lots of thought to titles, but this title was downright misleading."},{"rating":"1","title":"The interiors all look the same!","review":"Susanka has a great concept: less is more. But the problem is that her \\"less\\" is gunked up by more, more, more! I've never seen so many interiors so similar to each other, all featuring tons of that Minnesota wood. Susanka raps modernism for its impersonality of style, but her \\"detail\\" in house after house is just as alienating. Try Terence Conran's \\"The Essential House Book,\\" and fill up one of his minimal homes with your own style, not Susanka's or HGTV's! And beyond that, her environmental message is compromised. Excess is excess no matter how you cut it, whether it comes from gross size or gross detail. Maybe the answer is simply simplicity....at all levels of construction and design."},{"rating":"2","title":"A \\"House Book\\" in Amazon's Bestsellers list--it's that good!","review":"For those in the hunt for fresh ideas of a house designs that are: a. not just another \\"yuppie-domed\\" spec house b. looking for a more tailored house that fits your current/future lifestyle. c. that offers some interesting accents without expending the megabucks for a full blown architectural palace. Sarah Susanka provides some thoughtful, practical insights & some architectural tricks that make residential house design an alternative to the conventional contractor designs that are sooooo boring. Thanks Sarah, nice book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well written, helpful, and wonderful photographs","review":"Recommended reading for anyone wanting to build a new home (or remodeling one). This book enlightened me to many new possibilities for a home. The Not So Big House is well written with many photographs that are a great reference if nothing else. I've read the book twice and look at the pictures for ideas almost daily. Thank you Sara Susanka."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for owner of the \\"Not so Big House\\"","review":"The title of this book is misleading. If you truly have a \\"not so big house\\" this book does not offer any usefull suggestions for creating useful space in a small home. Compared to our little 1918 bungalow, the houses in this book seemed spacious. While the book offers many beautiful photos of space saving ideas- they are all applied to houses that don't really qualify as \\"not so big\\". I didn't find any of the concepts applied to our \\"not so big\\" home. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too big to be small.","review":"Compared to a 5000 sq ft home, 2500 sq ft isn't big. But is 2500 sq ft really a \\"not so big house\\"? I don't think so. A well thought out floor plan of 1500 sq ft or less (preferably less) can provide for everything a family needs and help people stay connected to each other.While the book did spark some ideas around the use of space and built-ins, overall I was very disappointed with the less costs more therory as presented in this book. It promotes a spending level that is beyond the average american's grasp."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outdated 70's Look, but a Good Concept","review":"I was disappointed once I got past the first couple of chapters. It was simply the same information repeated. No specifics really - and very few floor plans to show how the concepts are applied. The example of the couple who were disappointed with their 4000+ sq. ft., 500k suburban tract home rebuilt with the author for the same price, a 2300 square foot home. This isn't the goal of most people. The author doesn't really offer many tips other than cutting out the dining room and having the step-down \\"great rooms\\" that were popular during the 70's, along with using a bedroom/study that has a door as the away room. Almost all the rooms shown have dark wood trim and ceiling beams in all rooms with white walls. It would have been a better book if it showed the work of many architects instead of one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Susanka's next book","review":"To the reader from the Midwest who was wishing for more variety in The Not So Big House: I hear that Susanka has a new book coming out this fall, which I understand is packed full of NotSoBig Houses from all over the country in a great variety of styles--traditional, contemporary; new houses, remodels; farmhouse, New York apartment, etc., etc. Think this one's called Creating the Not So Big House. Can't wait."},{"rating":"1","title":"Design is visual, but these photos don't make the grade","review":"I picked up this book at the store but didn't buy it because it has a dated, depressing \\"feel\\" about it. I read the comments from the reader who didn't feel the dated photos were importand and I must disagree. I'm looking for a good home-building-ideas book that mixes good tips and home philosophy with photos of apealing rooms. By appealing, I mean rooms that offer a seamless blend of appealing architecture AND interior design ideas. Good design must have both. This book only does half the job -- it seemed to have a nice philosophical slant, but, unfortunately, the tired interior design shown in many of the room pix made me put the book back down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiration & ideas for rethinking your living space","review":"The ideas in this book encourage you to think about how you would like use your home space and how to accomplish this marriage of functionality with comfort and aesthetics. Almost every photo has some new little idea to think about. It gives me hope that I'll finally be able to create a comfortable home that integrates everyone's interests & needs. It's inspirational for those of us who have to adapt living spaces to growing families & to those like me who are now empty nesters (but who still need bed space for visiting family members)."},{"rating":"2","title":"READ ME! A fascinating new book on living","review":"This is a fascinating new book on living differently, and it is back to the basics. Why do we have a house? Is it to show off to people or is it to live in? Why would a couple need 5000 sq feet? They don't. This is a point of view from an architect, someone that is experienced and learned of her trade -- not a rich broker or real estate guru."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable, albeit slight, book that will make you think","review":"I enjoyed this book, and it is definitely a keeper. It is very much focussed at the American market, where building houses is more common than it is in Europe, especially in the UK. What I got from it was some interesting ideas about how a house is actually used, and a reminder to focus on daily use, not just impressiveness. I would have welcomed more detail on other matters, but the book is more a manifesto for the above idea, than a detailed how-to guide. I would definitely recommend it to anyone thinking about remodelling or building their living space."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book made me think differently about house design.","review":"This is a beautiful book with lots of color photos that made me think about how I live and how a new house should make that life more enjoyable. For example, the author suggests setting up an area for processing mail that's close to where you enter the house so that mail doesn't pile up in the table in the entry or on a coffee table somewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Important Concepts If You're Building or Renovating","review":"Insidious lies in our culture have made many believe that prodigious homes reflect some greatness about oneself. The idea that the American Dream is a house that is huge and ostentacious is ridiculous. This book takes us back to basics and fine workmanship. With the world's resources being tapped, it's important that we change the way we think about using the resouces that we have...and building a house wisely is a great place to start. The information in this book is wise and well thought out...the pictures are thought provoking and helpful in thinking about how you want your dream home to be planned out. This book will help you to create refreshing new perceptions about the purpose of your living environment and the usability of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Would you rather build a house or a home?","review":"Despite additions such as \\"feature walls\\" in purple and the like, many show homes still feel more like mausoleums. If you would like to build a house that has character and yet retains all the comforts of home, then this book is for you. This book is about the way in which we live in spaces and how to make those spaces work for us.This is the first house book I have seen for a long time where even just flicking through the pictures I was saying \\"yes, yes, yes! That's what I want!\\". Even though many of the photos are of the same houses, because the flow of the houses is different, it is fascinating to look at all of the different viewpoints.This book makes an excellent companion to Use what You Have Decorating and the Healthy House books. A great springboard for ideas and a must read if you wish to create a house that you love to live in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific book","review":"If you are building a new house or a remodeling, check this book out. It doesn't show you how to do it, so much as how to think about it. You may discover, on reflection, that the way you use the spaces alters what it is you thought you wanted considerably."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, easy to read, invaluable information","review":"This book was beautifully written and helped us to gain words and concepts to express the ideas that we were struggling with for the addition that we are planning. The ideas here were just what we needed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great ideas book for not-so-big homeowners","review":"My wife and I are living in our second not-so-big (and not-so-new) house and found this book to be full of great ideas about how to make good use of the space we have. This would certainly be an excellent book people like us living in smaller homes. It would also be a great book for homebuyers thinking about how big a house to get. It will convince you to buy something not-so-big and use the savings to make it comfortable and cozy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, what I feel put into print!","review":"I live in an old farmhouse in Boulder, Colorado, and all around me soul-less, 4,000+ square foot monsters are sprouting up like mushrooms after a long rain. They are new, and fresh, and totally void of any charm. THE NOT SO BIG HOUSE explains WHY I see these houses this way. Entrances and rooms scaled to impress do not then welcome a person, and one can find nowhere to snuggle in and relax. It's such a joy to read Susanka's explanations, with pictures to illustrate her point. I agree with a previous reviewer that the book would benefit from a wider variety of examples, and hope the new book from Susanka does indeed shed light on more styles."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Not So Inspiring House","review":"I ordered this book after reading great reviews since I was in the middle of trying to work out the purchase of a turn of the century home where space was the size of just that, turn of the century. The Amazon review picked all the best photo's in the book and the only pages worth reading in it, so I bought it. I was extremely disappointed to receive a book that had too many 1980 - 1990's dated, uninspiring interiors and not so much in the way of smart architectural choices to think about, as was advertised."},{"rating":"2","title":"Something for almost everyone","review":"Since I am very specific in what I want in the new small place I am about to build I have been buying a lot of books that have titles that speak to what I am looking for. Alas, some books get returned because they do not live up to their title or description, while others like this book get kept.Especially appreciate the built in designs of so many of the rooms and the open airy feel as well as the use of light maple in the rooms I read about since so many small home books I have acquired had an almost claustrophobic feel. Whereas I, living in California wanted no clutter, maximum use of space and built ins be it bed, dressers or pantries.This book also has something for almost everyone, from the larger family to the single person, empty nesters or those somewhere in between. The only type homes I wish they had included were/are rammed earth and straw bale, but then I reminded myself that this book was published in the late 1990's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big Ideas in a Not So Big Book","review":"This beautiful book does not promise building on a tight budget and anyone disappointed by the expense of some of the designs in reading it didn't bother with the dustcover. Regardless, building the Not So Big House is about a home for how we live, nuturing the spirit and fully utilizing the space you have. The possibility of upper-end design cost does not negate the point of building small. If you had the money to build bigger, you would - don't bother with the book, you've already missed the point.The techniques to determine where space is most valuable to you and your family, to determine how you live are very valuable in creating your space.For someone conscious of the ever shrinking earth and greenspace, but desirous of a beautiful home to express yourself and soothe your spirit, this book is a great place to start."},{"rating":"1","title":"No variety","review":"I think I'd like this book better if it showed more variety. Many of the interiors have a dated quality. And they tend to all be neutral with lots of wood and an overriding Craftsman look. The point of the book is great, but I'd love a book that shows me small houses in a wider range of styles. How about something slick and modern? Or how about showing a traditional Cape? Or a 1958 ranch house?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great idea book for the coffee table, but not the workshop","review":"The Not So Big House is terrific for those who are thinking of building a new home for vacation, retirement, etc. and need ideas on design and layout. From a philosophical perspective, the author does a great service by laying out her argument that bigger is not necessarily better. She provides a number of great tips in house design (cornerboards instead of mitered corners save A LOT of money, panalized design, etc.) and provides numerous examples of interesting designs. However, if you're looking for details on actually building such a house, this is not a do-it-yourself guide. Lots of good ideas, but the book sits on our coffee table, not in my workshop"},{"rating":"2","title":"More!","review":"Quality, Functionality and Craftsmanship?

The authors have disguised a history lesson into a mystery. Actually, there was no mystery. The characters were unlikable and highly unbelievable. The long drawn out plot, full of fluff, was too much. I am surprised I made it through the entire book. I stayed up late reading, hoping that some big secret would be revealed in the end. I was wary of the DaVinci code because of all the hype so I chose this book instead. Now I am reluctant to read Davinci! If you are absolutely fascinated by the Italian Renaissance, this book is for you.

The campus descriptions were uninteresting, especially all of the nonsense about social clubs and how you get in to the clubs to EAT. Whoopee. The \\"twists\\" of the book were elementary at best, and the spoon-feeding of the \\"mysteries\\" and \\"riddles\\" of the book down right amateurish. And the ending was as predictable and lame as a hackneyed made for TV movie. None of the characters were all that interesting. The love interest was loveless, sexless and relationshipless. They could have been robots for all I know. Not a well crafted book, at least not one that deserved to have its name uttered in the same sentence as Dan Brown's brilliant 'Da Vinci Code'. Save your money.

No matter how smart the intention The Rule Of Four comes up weak on character. An oversimplified series of events that barely leaves the grounds of Princeton eeks the reader forward without a semblence of emotional impact. I was tempted several times to abandon this text but it was the only book I had with me on vacation so I reluctantly finished it. Should The Rule Of Four have a grain of truth (Which it appears to) then perhaps the fun of weaving those mysteries into fiction was the main idea. Either way the writers missed the mark and clearly didn't deserve such overwhelming exposure for only an adquately written novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring book","review":"I too found this book to be rather boring.

I do not recommend it. While the DaVinci Code was a fast-paced suspense with a bit of romance thrown in, Rule of Four is a painfully slow book about the unrealistically stupid choices of college kids with a bit of riddling thrown in. The reader is hardly even a part of the puzzle solving, usually just being informed after the fact that a riddle has been solved.While the idea for the book is fantastic, it was poorly executed. If you're looking for impressive literary knowledge wasted on an embarrasingly high schoolish coming of age book, you'll like Rule of Four."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Rule of Bore...","review":"While quite an effort was made by the authors to produce a successful mystery/thriller, they remained successful only in describing Princeton University and it's environs. Characters were very poorly developed, came to conclusions suddenly and without any explanation and maintained an interminably dull persona throughout the book.The plot was feeble and did not possess much complexity and contained a number of unplugged holes. The story was tidily concluded with no catharsis in the characters nor any great discovery to help the reader understand the significance of their travails.All said, this books remains more of a travel brochure for Princeton than a mystery/thriller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rule of Bore","review":"I looked forward to reading this book...gave it 100 pages before schlepping it back to the library unfinished.

Too bad the actual story kept getting bogged down in history, backstory, and flashbacks. I swear I got dizzy from zipping through time. Perhaps the authors should consider taking weaving lessons...The prose is often nice, even poetic at times, but that couldn't compensate for the noticable lack of tension. The conflict and characterization just doesn't seem sufficient to carry the story.I have no idea how it ends and may not find out. Even as a history lover, I don't think I can take another long and boring detour through the ages.No comparison to The Da Vinci Code, which kept me comfortably hooked."},{"rating":"1","title":"Suckered","review":"I thought there might be a good reason Amazon.com was selling this thing for only $14, and I was right. It's a L.O.S.E.R. Now, if I can just figure out how it climbed onto the Best Seller List. Believe the others who scorned it; their comments say it all. Aimless plot, trivial insight and sensitivity, sophmoric character development, and really bad writing. Which took these guys six years to write? How did they even get an agent? I read the \\"Da Vinci Code,\\" and yes it's for 8th graders, but at least it delivers a story. This book? Gives you nothing but 300+ pages of quasi-nuanced dialogue and narrative.

The summary and the reviews of this book were really appealing, and I really expected something at the DaVinci Code's level. NOTHING to do with it. Although it also deals with secret codes, the book is written very poorly. You always have the feeling of reading a book written by and for high school or university students, (like those who write to participate in contests) but you never feel like you have real literature in your hands. Even in the most important parts of the book, the authors never take you to the real climax of the story. I give it two stars because I think the plot is good, yet a lot more could have been done to make this book really worth to buy it and not get really dissapointed about it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy, don't read it","review":"What cracks me up most about the reviews are those that say this book is an intellectual thriller. I am not sure what they mean, I guess they are trying to say that if you did not enjoy this book then it is not because the book is bad, but because you aren't smart enough to enjoy it. The book is so bad that I could barely finish it. Much of the book adds nothing to the story, nothing to character development. The characters are stereotypes. The characters are shallow, undeveloped and boring. It is obvious that the authors think more of themselves than anyone else ever would. Throughout the novel, the authors keep alluding to the characters' intelligence but rarely if ever display it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read Harry Potter again","review":"This is absolutely, unequivocally, the worst book I have ever read.

Comparisons to Da Vinci Code (a popcorn screenplay masquerading as a novel, but quite a lot of fun) are ridiculous.Seems to be Written by Four -- I can't figure out where I am and what has happened, and could really care less. Frat boys romping around Princeton -- do they study or have any other academic responsibilities? Do they take creative writing classes?If you get the urge to read this book -- re-read Harry Potter novels instead. Or rent Indiana Jones.

First of all I would never read trash like the DaVinci Code. Others have done much better (factually) than Dan Brown did (fictionally) on the subject. I didn't go to college and after reading The Rule of Four I wish I had. The four friends'(Tom, Gil, Charlie and Paul) relationships are the center of the novel. Period. The comparison to the DaVinci Code is in the marketing of the book. Forget that. Concentrate on the great writing, the development of the characters and the secret of that elusive book that plays second fiddle to the novel.

I have learned my lesson and in the future will buy my books well before I get on the plane.The plot centers around two Princeton students discovering the secrets held in a book from the Renaissance. Thrown in were a stock love interest, painfully detailed descriptions of Princeton geography and rituals, and various forgettable minor characters. Reading this book is like sitting in a Princeton grad's living room watching an interminable slide show, with most of the slides out of order.I am giving the book 2 stars because some of the Renaissance material was interesting and I would have liked to read more about it. Most of the book unfortunately was spent slogging through self-absorbed college students and the campus they apparently love."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fell asleep","review":"I believe that this book was \\"hyped\\" to be another runaway hit like the Da Vinci Code. But it was all that...just hype.I was disappointed to read a very disorganized, slow-moving, zero climax story. There is too much useless dialogue that has nothing to do with the plot. There are almost no twists. The riddles were corny.With the Da Vinci Code, you couldn't put down the book and you look forward to the next chapter.With this book, you always put down the book and you even want to skip chapters and see what the whole point is about.If you want to get bored...read this.Clive Cussler would have done a better \\"codex/thriller\\" book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yecch","review":"If you're thinking of buying this book based on a similarity to the Da Vince Code . . . don't repeat my mistake. There was actually a great deal of promise in the premise, but the internal timing is confusing, the characters whiny and the reader (along with the main character) are *told* the results of the research into the deus ex machina of the Renaissance text in question rather than being able to see it for ourselves. Hell, the discovery of Colonna's crypt takes place entirely off page.This one gets chucked immediately into the donation pile. I think I'll go read Angels and Demons again instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely Good read","review":"The mixed reviews almost made me pass this book by. That would have been a mistake. It is an extremely good book. As pointed out by others its resemblence to the Da Vinci code is minimal.

Sorry guys, better luck next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth reading","review":"I had a hard time finishing this book. The premise was weak: trying to be a DaVinci code type book. The transition to different times: Renaissance, two months ago, present were rough and messed with the flow of the book. The writing is weak. And, the book didn't manage to pull you in, despite suspenseful moments, because the author would pause to describe uninteresting details in the midst of what should have a been a frantic chase scene.

Don't be misled by the stacks of this book in stores nationwide right next to the stacks of the DaVinci Code ~ \\"Rule\\" is not nearly as good as the \\"Code\\"!The four key characters have a close and plausible, if boring, relationship ~ comfortable at Princeton, for four years, which is the setting of the entire book, with flashbacks to important childhood experiences. They may go off-campus, which is a dangerous place, some people do get killed, but they never even leave town. Sure, references to people who live in New York (gasp !), and several have gone to Europe.

I'm glad the middling ratings I found here didn't dissuade me from reading Caldwell and Thomason's first effort -- it's a much more readable example of this sub-genre (does anyone have a name for this sort of book yet?) than any of Dan Brown's efforts.The book has a broader \\"art-historical\\" appeal than The DaVinci Code, while featuring more sophisticated character development. I've read three of Brown's novels, and while I enjoyed all three, I walked away from each left with a vague impression of \\"a guy, a woman, and an older guy.\\" Such wasn't the case with The Rule of Four, and I found myself as engaged by the friendship between the central five characters as I was by the mystery of the Hypnerotomachia Poliphili."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not like Da Vinci Code","review":"I thought this would be similar to the Da Vinci Code and I was disappointed. The first half of the book is the better half, there is a lot of focus on the renaissance text/letter and solving the code. The second half of the book really lost my interest. The second half focused more on relationships and college life.I found that the book was hard to follow as well. There were critical things that needed to be remembered for later times in the book that the authors hardly explained and then other things they talked about in depth that were never brought up again.While I was reading this book I had the thought, \\"Did these guys reread after the first draft to make sure everything flowed smoothy?\\" It doesn't appear like they did. I thought it was poorly written, especially considering it was a team effort. I would not reccommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"desperately boring-- a total tease--stilted ending","review":"I forced myself to finish this book hoping it would GET TO THE POINT.

After the initial shock of the presence of so many amazingly bad reviews for this book registered, I decided to look at the other books that the geniuses who reviewed this book had read. More than one had to do with nascar. not exactly the literary type i would say. For those of you who are interested in academics and find the academic process exciting, this book can't be beat. It's about a princeton senior writing his thesis, who then discovers that his topic and the study thereof is surrounded by mystery and murder. This is the fantasy of every student trapped in a library. If you liked the Davinci code, but thought that its academic foundation was shaky, this book would be a great choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely boring, don't bother","review":"I was really looking forward to reading this book. However, I feel it was just a description of college life at Princeton--over and over. There was no suspense, not likeable characters, and was EXTREMELY boring and hard to hold one's interest. They had a good subject to make a fantastic book and they did very little with it. It was a disappointment for me.

This book has more in common with 'Thelma and Louise' than it does with 'The DaVinci Code'. The ONLY thing it really shares with DaVinci is that the story mentions an old book of puzzles - beyond that - its much more about a group of guys in college growing up. If you're looking for 'the next DaVinci code' - move on (perhaps Map of Bones by James Rollins)..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disjointed DaVinci Code imitation","review":"This book has so many diversions that it's hard to maintain interest in the main story theme.

I mean what can compare to the \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" ? Come to find out this doesn't compare quite so much. While it is a puzzle book of sorts, you are given all the answers and not allowed to use your brain. It does involve an ancient book, the \\"Hypnertomachia Poliphili\\" and the mysteries surrounding it. Set at Princeton, two students, one of which is writing his thesis on this book, are so possessed by its charms that they get little sleep until they solve the mysteries that have remained so elusive. Unlike \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" we find out a lot more about the characters in the book and what makes them tick. That this was written by two recent college graduates is amazing as the references to history and literature.Quite different from Dan Brown's books, it's still worth a read !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ignore the hype","review":"Where do I begin? Firstly, this book reads like a promotional brochure for Princeton. Secondly, the brochure is poorly written. The characters are one-dimensional, the dialogue is stilted, the 'mystery' is non-existent, and the plot moves only marginally faster than a turtle in quicksand.It is fairly obvious from the outset that this is some sort of coming-of-age novel, however, phrases like \\"Adulthood is a glaciar encroaching quietly on youth\\" make me wonder if the authors themselves have yet to mature.Shame on the writer of the jacket blurb who compared The Rule of Four to The Name of the Rose.

A puzzle needs at least two characterists to be interesting: solving it must be worthwhile (e.g., it unlocks a mystery or offers some reward) and the process of solving it must be stimulating.

The authors have somehow found it necessary to add overly complex descriptions of times, places or relationships that are not integral to the story. The reader sometimes gets the feeling that they are trying to impress you with their Ivy League education and/or vocabulary. It at times makes for a situation where you are just trying to get through paragraphs to get back to the story. There is also an issue with time...present and past.

I think it is insulting to compare this book to \\"A Separate Peace\\", a well written and moving book. I agree with the skeptical reviewer who suggested family in the publishing business.

Against my better judgement, I stuck with this book through the first 200 pages of tedium. It started to pick up a little then but not nearly enough. The authors seemed to labour the point of knowing the princeton campus and faculty as if it would add some authenticity to the book. It doesn't - the book is marketed as the unravelling of an ancient mystery. Maybe they should rebrand as a tourist guide to princeton campus. A small fraction of the book is devoted to 'the mystery' and the unravelling of the coded messages is painfully drawn out and about as dry as my tongue with a hangover. The characters are annoying and I found myself hoping for a freak hurricane to arrive and sweep the whole lot of them away. I now find myself putting the book away - unfinished with only about 20% of it left - I just cannot muster another ounce of endurance for this book which I had hoped would lead me into interesting and unfamiliar areas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Debut Novel","review":"After reading the Da Vinci Code I went in search of books with similar themes and found \\"The Rule of Four.\\" Written by 2 ivy leaguer, this is a very strong first book.

The only good thing about this book was the actual mystery. The characters were ridiculous, and their musings about life were so stupid that I periodically had to put the book down to roll my eyes for a while. Some of it didn't even actually make sense, and I can see the two authors sitting and trying to decide how and where to add another \\"deep thought\\".

The Rule of Four doesn't even come close to matching Mr. Brown's works. I found it boring, pretentious, and a real chore to read. I kept plowing on thinking it would get better. It didn't. The only thing this book does right is the marketing -- which rides on the coat tails of Dan Brown's successful, entertaining and very readable novels.

It's an OK start for two young writers, but is far from genius. The book's intended audience seems to be Princeton grads, who I am sure would get a kick out of the details, I myself grew numb with them and found much to be unneccessary and distracting.

It definitely reads like a story written by young, privileged, inexperienced scholars. It isn't tight. It doesn't flow. The depiction of Princeton may be accurate (I don't know), but it is somewhat snobby and offputting (but I've heard that from some people who went there).Not a particularly satisfying read."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Rule of Four","review":"The advertising for this book is extremely misleading. I expected a fascinating mystery. Most disappointing.Having read The Da Vinci Code this book's review should have stated that it was about students in college and their friendship.

The book revolves around several people who have a common bond through an old book (Hypnoternachia???) that will offer the reader a secret beyond their expectations if they can break the book's code. In the background is a story about Princeton and all the history that institution holds. Going back and forth between the two leaves me wondering how great either story might have been if they separated the 2. I had read the DaVinci code and mistakenly thought this book would be along the same lines - that was an assumption I shouldn't have brought into this book. Because of that I was frustrated that the read wasn't as quick or the history wasn't as detailed. I would urge the authors to go back and write a book about the history of Princeton and their eating clubs. They talked a little about it but it sounds like that could be a book of its own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well...","review":"I liked it.

I would have used that one.This book is poorly written, and is unsuccessfully riding on the coattails of DaVinci Code.What it lacks in a substantive plot, it makes up in the plethora of unimportant characters that share with the reader useless information.This book is truly bad. You don't care about the characters, you don't care about the story, all you wind up caring about is finishing. The book falls flat. The only redeeming quality is the interesting history tidbits that pepper the boring story. And these sprinkles of great history are used more as filler between the AWFUL dialogue than the basis for the book. What a shame.The last three pages were the best ones. So just read those and be done with it.I would definitely NOT recommend wasting time on this. Yours, mine or even your most hated co-workers..

This book is a lot more dull. Howver, historically, it is very accurate and very thorough in describing the Hypnerotomachia Poliiphili- a Renaissance novel. However, the book is very boring, and it was a pretty much bore to read. I do know understand the Hypnerotomachia more completely and I do think that it is interesting; however,I can't give it more than 2 stars as the authors do a disastorous job in making it suspensful and comparable to the DaVinci Code; it is 372 pages of a slow moving boring book."},{"rating":"1","title":"the hype on this book does not deliver","review":"Wow---I finally finished this thing---What secrets did we learn???

The plot is so dubious it's hilarious, and im sorry but anyone who thinks that this is a book for intellectuals is kidding themselves. The whole thing is tautological, that is to say it is easy to make it appear like the authors are in themselves some kind of cryptological geniuses, whereas in fact it is them who are making the codes and thus rendering the solving of them, well, quite straightforward.

Sadly, it is a tedious exercise in boredom that oozes with pretention and smug self-congratulation (though, to be fair, it IS mindless).

The book is lousy. The action stalls, the characters get in the way, and occasionally there is something about a tail of intrigue. It is not seemlessly written between the two authors, grotesquely so. Basically, whoever the author is that writes about the personal interrelationships needs to figure out how to get the characters more involved without the arrogance and immaturity.

Never have I seen so many classic literature references in one book. It was like the authors were trying to prove they were well educated. The story was also very boring....no action mainly just character developement for characters that I never really cared about.

The Rule of Four is not this summer's Davinci Code. It has been advertised as another mystery book with all sorts of codes to be deciphered. No, the book is about 4 college friends who do typical college stuff - until the death of one their classmates, halfway through the book. The so-called mystery book is only mentioned briefly as obsessions to various researchers and the readers are only slowly, slowly brought into the mystery book - a book which I found I cared nothing about as it has nothing to do with anyone's lives as opposed to books used in the DaVinci Code. I'm sure this book might be enjoyable to the 20-25 year old crowd who are still close to their college days.

Besides wooden, trite dialogue, there are parts of this book that just don't add up. So much so, that my first inclination was to cut the authors some slack and wonder if they had written their book in \\"code\\" like the infamous author of their story. Not wanting to spend time decoding a weak novel, I will offer that this is just bad writing. The major leaps made by the two Princeton students in solving the riddles, the flat, cartoony characters and the tacked on, completely expected ending all add up to a \\"why am I reading this\\" feeling.

At least Dan Brown has the mechanics of a thriller down: the striplings behind \\"Rule of Four\\" are rank amateurs. Brown at least keeps the writing simple: The prose in \\"Rule\\" is clotted with complicated syntax, choking on exposition and littered with silly pronouncements. The book's \\"wisdom\\" is especially laughable: The philosophical spoutings of Ivy League seniors are unbearably pompous even to other Ivy League seniors--why would the authors think grownups would take them seriously? The dialogue and plotting is farcical and would be hooted out of a writer's workshop.

Although well-written in places, it is, on the whole, overwritten. It tries to be both erudite mystery and coming-of-age novel but the \\"mystery\\" and \\"erudition\\" take a distant second place to the portrayal of a group of friends going through college with typical relationship problems. Think a \\"Friends\\" episode with one character saying to another: \\"I spent 12 hours today reading the Hypnerotomachia and I made 21 pages of notes.

The authors try to manipulate the reader emotionally which leads to an ending that seems forced and, well, stupid.

The story might have been somewhat interesting had the \\"mystery\\" been something that could be solved by at least some of the readers.

The main character is not the genius who solves the mystery or the adventurer who finds the the treasure... he's just a guy on the periphery of the 'action' who manages to come to terms with his past and get an idea of what he really wants from his future. Normally not the type of tale that appeals to me, but I enjoyed this one.

No comparison to other novels is necessary to decide that this book is a worthless waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"the rule of banality","review":"I found this book to be awful.

It ended up being a memoir of college days with a weak thread of a renaissance mystery woven into it.The story is not what you would think by the back cover(partial quote) \\"If Scott Fitzgerald, Umberto Eco and Dan Brown teamed up to write a novel, the result would be The Rule of Four\\".Do not be fooled by the hype! If you like a fairly well-written book about college relationships this book is for you.I would also like to point out to the authors that the death sentence of \\"Hung, drawn and quartered\\" does not mean the victim was hung then drawn behind a cart before being cut into four pieces. The victim was in fact, partially hung, drawn, which means partially disemboweled then cut into quarters either by being pulled apart by four horses or otherwise dismembered. They must have missed the movie Braveheart where William Wallace was put to death in this manner.Very dissapointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Holden Caulfield Goes to Princeton","review":"That should have been the title of this collection of college student angst. I fell for the publication hype, and knew I had made a mistake after 20 pages. This book bears no resemblence to \\"The Divinci Code\\" in either story line or character development. Besides telling me more about Princeton than I would ever want to know, the authors (in their obvious arrogance for their alma mater)allow this sideshow to interfere with the pace of the story. Finally, they cop out on the one interesting part of the story, the quest to uncover the secret of the book. The book jacket says they started writing \\"The Rule of Four\\" in 1998. Their effort did not age well like a fine wine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rule of Four","review":"I agree with most of the other opinions I have read. It is a great idea for a book, but it is poorly written. The interaction between the two main characters, Paul and Tom, is very stale and their reactions to the events of the book which are pretty life altering events, are emotionless and plain, the authors couldn't have made me care less. The dialog between the college students is not believable in the least, and the narrative as told by the main character, Tom, is awful. The only thing that saves this book is the information on the ancient text Tom and Paul are uncovering, which should intrigue any history buff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea, but...","review":"The premise is captivating but the writing and plot leave much to be desired. Vonnegut has a rule: if a sentence does not advance the plot, it does not belong. These two would do well to learn and apply that rule before starting their next project."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ignore the Hype!","review":"This book gets hyped and I was led to believe it is something like Umberto Ecco or Dan Brown. It is most certainly neither. I wanted to like this book, but it was just a bad experience. The Hypnerotomchica mystery is only a short part of the book, utterly superficial and most of all more than unbelievable. If you are interested in endless descriptions of Princeton campus life or of problems between a dead father and a son who rather has dates with his girlfriend than working on a far fetched mystery, then you might like this book. Otherwise it simply sucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I Could Give it a Zero Star I Would!","review":"Do not waste your time, energy, money, or free loan from a friend on this weak attempt at a story.

Pretentious dribble, written by men that think their day-to-day experiences in college were so fascinating. Oh yeah, and there's a mystery that makes no sense and characters that suck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was a bore to read...","review":"This was not a captivating book at all. It was a struggle for me to read, the plot line dances all around. I'm glad I bought it on paperback.The publisher seems to go out of its way to point out that the book was \\"in the works\\" before Dan Brown's \\"Da Vinci.\\" However, it's an opportunistic play to jump on the codebreaking bandwagon. Just was not an interesting book at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good...","review":"I liked the story quite a bit... the authors really made me want to know what was going to happen with these four friends as well as with the book that they all get involved with. However, this also led to me skipping a lot of the backtracking the authors did... I felt that there was some story int here that could have been left out. But, impatient as I am I skipped past it and that works for me. It was almost satisifying... I hate to say at the end it just felt as if there was a LITTLE something missing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not like Da Vinci Code","review":"Rule of Four could've been much better as I think the writers are very talented. The first half, even three quarters, is knee deep in Princeton lore, which gets old fast. The characters are well developed, but the review of renaissance history was a little tedious. The last quarter of the book is great, but you have to get through the first 3/4. If you're looking for another Da Vinci code, this isn't it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great core, but lousy filler","review":"I loved the premise of this book. It sounded like an intellectual thriller. Everything that revolved around the Hypnerotomachia was fascinating. However, it was lost in so much filler. The filler consisted of flat characters and more history on Princeton than I ever cared to know about. Finally, the chapters seemed utterly unrelated to each other as they skipped back and forth awkwardly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring Redefined","review":"The book as a whole was rather tedious to get through. A lot of characters were introduced quickly near the beginning of the book and were never really developed until later chapters. I felt no connection with any of the characters. The \`buddy' aspect of the book suffered considerably because for the first half the book I had little to no clue as to who the characters were.The writing/editing was sloppy in places. The sentence structure was often clumsy. I came across several typo/spelling/syntax errors while reading it. It is apparent there are two different authors involved in the writing as you read it. Sentence structure, tempo and context shifts are apparent between the two.If I were Dan Brown, I would be a little perturbed that someone compared \\"The Rule of Four\\" with any of my work."},{"rating":"1","title":"STINKER!!!!","review":"P.U.This book is so cheesy, it should be called the Rule of Velveeta.What kind of simile is this?\\"Taft remains still, like a crocodile having its teeth cleaned by a bird.\\" Who wrote this...third graders?They did get one quote right in the book:\\"There's no worse thief than a bad book.\\"Help, I've been robbed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zzzzzz","review":"The Rule of Four deals a lot with breaking codes to review the truth.

I finished the book out of commitment and was so disappointed that I threw it away. Can't give it to anyone else, I don't believe in passing on the punishment!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A little bit of a challenging read","review":"I really liked this book in the fact that I did have to work a little to get through it. I liked the Da Vinci Code but it was written too much toward the light readers. This one felt very satisfying and more real than the Code. The only thing I didn't like was the anticlimactic ending. I wish it had extended the story a little more and actually did the things they worked towards the entire book. All in all, a very good book and I really enjoyed the underlying history lessons (even if they weren't entirely true)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not great","review":"To be honest, I didn't know where this book was going halfway through it. With that said, however, this book finishes strong and was an interesting read overall. This book is not the Da Vinci Code and many of Dan Brown's readers may be disappointed with it. The plot is slower and takes place all at Princeton University. The mystery the main characters are trying to solve is harder to grasp then in other similar books and there are fewer tidbits of fascinating knowledge regarding the ancient world. When the mystery is solved, though, and the reader finally knows what occurred in the Hypnerotomachia Poliphili and why it was written during the Renaissance, the story becomes more interesting. I'm afraid that by then its' too late and the readers finish the book merely because they have come so far into it. Perhaps the most valuable part of the book is the authors' keen observations regarding friendship, relationships, and human nature. The book was good, but not great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Forget the rule of hour, the code is better.","review":"The first thing I can say about this book, is that you will like it when you get to page 120 or 150. During these first 120 pages or so, the books only hints at what is going on. Starting around page 125 you start to get an idea about the secret hidden in the Hypnertomachia, a book from the end of the 15th century.I have to admit that there is character development in this book but at the expense of the mystery and the action. Also the secret hidden in this book pales in comparision to the secret hidden in the code."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time","review":"I was truly disppointed with this book and kick myself for taking the time to finish it. I thought it would be similar to the DaVinci Code, one of my favorites, but it was not. After about getting half way through this book I realized I really didn't care that much about what happened to the characters. All the Hypnerotomachia hype ended up being crap. I had to pull out the dictionary a few times for this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"YUCK","review":"Makes me wonder why this book is in the top 100. I much prefered the book A Brush with Darkness by Lisa Fittipaldi which was inspirational AND well written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely Overhyped by Publishers","review":"Utterly terrible. Nothing like a Dan Brown book or Umberto Eco as the publishers suggest. Not suspenseful at all, and the writers spend far too much time developing unmemorable characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misses the Mark","review":"Although Rule of Four left the gate at a relatively brisk pace, the it quickly became bogged down. Character development was sketchy and not helped by rambling and often pointless dialogue. Flashbacks came out of nowhere as did sub-plots. Branded as a mystery novel, The Rule of Four read more like a historical tour of the grounds and traditions of Princeton. Found myself all too often having to back up to see what I missed. Comparisons of this work to the DaVinci Code do not exist with the exception of the search for messages hidden in archaic documents."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would advise not to waste your time","review":"Maybe I just couldn't get it, but I found the writing tedious. I had a difficult time following the train of thought and often wondered who did the editing on this? What could have made a good read was dull and a waste of time. I borrowed this book from a friend who stated \\"I simply could not get into it....maybe I'll try again.\\" I will recommend that the time not be given to this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the Beef?","review":"Boring! Boring! The first 100+ pages could have been dropped as they don't really figure into the plot. Much too much about the boys' life at college. Very little suspense (was there any?). This is an example of a book where the publisher took advantage of the reader's interest in books about breaking codes and greatly mis-chaaracterixed this novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Undergraduate Musings","review":"The Rule of Four is largely an exercise for the authors to demonstrate everything they learned at college. It spends too much time on the long, pointless and poorly-written background story of the main characters and far too little on the \\"intriguing intellectual suspense novel\\" it is advertised to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing really interesting happens until page 135","review":"I must say, the boys must have gotten themselves a rockin' good publicist to have this disappointing 'thriller' so far up the charts so quickly. It is no Da Vinci Code. It is not even Digital Fortress. It is certainly not as \\"If Scott Fitzgerald, Umberto Eco and Dan Brown have teamed up to write a novel, the result would be The Rule of Four\\" as stated on the cover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Damn Boring Frat boy yarn","review":"I picked up this book thinking that it would turn out to be a real page-turner with some real good puzzles like DaVinci Code (atleast the title page claims it is similar to it). But it turned out to be a boring book with lots of paper wasted on writing about the characters ( what the authors do is not character development but kill time and trees) and less about the actual plot. The actual plot about the book can be condensed to about 150 pages and the rest of the book is pure fluff. The book starts well and then goes downhill. The puzzles are also not to the level of Dan Brown's in DaVinci Code and Angels&Demons. If you like to read how frat boys in Princeton live then pick up this book. If you dont want to read that then stay away. I wish I had done that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasted Minutes","review":"I just hate it when I waste precious time on a knucklehead book. This was one. I couldn't have cared less about these pretentious characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Life's Too Short","review":"I wanted to like this book, but ultimately must agree with the detractors. The story is plodding and overembelished with boring details about campus life at Princeton.Life's too short to waste on this poorly written book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A poor argument in support of the lasting value of Art","review":"It is said you should write about what you know, and sadly I think the authors of The Rule of Four have done just that--at least as far it concerns the agonies of deciding which campus house to pledge. The rest of book, the unraveling of yet another literary mystery, is an overwrought effort that takes itself so seriously with so little to go on, that in the end its passions seem little more than the passions of priggish intellectuals and children who have done all their living in books. Most of the elegant bits of so-called philosophy that pad out this uninteresting romp in supposed suspense unravel at the slightest scrutiny into prettily phrased cliches completely lacking in substance or original thought. Read in this context, The Rule of Four provides a poor argument to support its overarching theme - the lasting value of Art."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to understand the reported success of this book","review":"I read the book because of the nice promotion phrase \\"the Da vinci code for the intellectuals\\" (not to say I am an intellectual, though),and had some time available. But the book is quite dull, boring and badly written if not for the thesis work in it which can be quite interesting \\"per se\\".I am happy that two students could make money out of their work, but that's the most I can say.I don't understand why some bad books become best-sellers and other excellent ones are hardly noticed, instead.For me, the real message of this book is that it's frankly worrying to see how life in an american campus can be: spoiled and self-contained."},{"rating":"1","title":"The end is better than expected, but still not a good book","review":"I had a lot of hope for this book since it was so overhyped. I won't repeat all the negative comments by the other reviewers but I want to emphasize the following:1) the character development is very poor and, in particular, the rendering of the relationship of the narrator with his girlfriend is just downright childish;2) the chronological development is unconvincing and I had to keep checking if so much of the main action was really taking place in one night (I know there were flashbacks);3) if you do care about the Princeton details, the arbitrary changes to the real campus and activities are extremely annoying. If they wanted to modify the university environment so much, they should have just created an imaginary place. Whatever they gained by tying the action to a real place, they lost by the silly and inane modifications.Save your money and time - read another book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A total mess","review":"It was a long boring agony. People were comparing this with DaVinci Code? Please! There is no comparison here. Painfully, I finished the book and still I don't understand the purpose of it or what was really the plot here. It was disorganized and clueless. The authors shoould not quit their real jobs. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rule of Four Lacks Edginess","review":"I agree with all of the negative reviews: flat characters, weak dialogue, lack of any real suspense. I loved the connection to Savonarola, but the authors really did not develop the outrage and fear that motivated the Hypnerotomachia's author. What a waste! If you want to read a fantastic depiction of late 15th century Florence, try Romola by George Eliot."},{"rating":"1","title":"How did this get published?","review":"It's not often I'm compelled to read a book with a red pen in hand so I can cross out each misused word or to correct the factual errors in the margin. These appear on nearly every page. Did the editor have a tin ear? Has Random House laid off its factcheckers? This is an ambitious and earnestly written book that simply overreached. First novels are like that. But I can only believe that the critics swooned for the Matt and Ben of the literary thriller world."},{"rating":"1","title":"No DaVinci code here","review":"I don't know folks. I found this book to be slow, dry and repetitive. The basic idea was very interesting but it was not well developed.The story had great potential but it never quite made it. I would not recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent once you get used to the slower speed","review":"I guess I was expecting something a little faster, which is why I didn't give this five stars. But otherwise this is a really good book. I really liked the characters in this story, especially Charlie, the most heroic of the 'four'. There is a line in this book that says 'a good friend stands in harms way for you the second you ask, but a great friend does it without being asked at all.' I loved that so much that I wrote it down, and I think that's really what this book is about, watching the four friends and learning about their friendship. I agree with the reviewer who said this is really a coming of age story disguised as a thriller. The thriller parts weren't really the heart of the story. The friendship is what makes this book great. If it had just been a little faster, I would defenitely have given it 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ivy League slop","review":"In the Rule of Four, the authors quote that \\"there's no worse thief than a bad book\\". How ironic, as this is possibly one of the most poorly written books I have read. The writing is overblown as if the authors are doing their darndest to impress you with how smart they are. Perhaps they realized that if you are confused by the awkward sentences and chronology, then you might not notice how lame the very frequent digressions are.I wonder if the Ivy does take out?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Forget It","review":"I don't see how this book can be compared to Da Vinci Code. The book was boring. This book sold me on the premise. \\"A mysterious coded manuscript, a violent Ivy League murder, and the secrets of a Renaissance prince collide in a labyrinth of betrayal, madness, and genius.\\" There was no plot. No suspense. No purpose. Just regret on the money I paid for the hardback."},{"rating":"1","title":"This bad book stole from me.","review":"Ironically, the authors described their own crime in their work. Somewhere in this mess of a book they make mention of how there is no worse thief than a bad book. For some reason I did not stop reading this terrible book when my good sense told me I had wasted enough time. Instead, I kept letting the book steal more of my time. Do not make the same mistake. As soon as you find yourself thinking that the book has to get better, just put it down and never return, because the ending offers no redemption.

I find it too tedious to read - the storyline is not focused, it goes too much into describing the nitty-gritty of the characters' lives...yet at the same time, I can't seem to connect with them.

I'm only half-way reading the book, and it feels like squeezing blood from stone...One of the driest and boring book I've ever read (and I've read many a best-seller)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing unfortunately","review":"I read this on a flight back and forth to the east coast and it put me to sleep the first trip. The second was way more entertaining. I found the first 200-300 pages slow and underproductive. Far too much time was spent trying to develop the past relationship Tom had with his father and with his current girlfriend.Paul did not get quite enough time in my eyes, as he was the main person struggling with the decoding. I did like the extra two characters, but honestly, their arguements had nothing to do with the story or growth of the main two.Now the actual Hypnerotomachia sections were alive and brought you back in. The saving grace was that the authors tossed tiny crumbs as you went along just to make sure you finished the whole book and didn't skip ahead. I would have prefered a short story of 100-150 pages over the whole thing.As often as I pick up just any book at random and usually enjoy it, this one left me wondering why I was seeing Best Sellers list on the cover"},{"rating":"1","title":"Well written?

And, tedious does no even begin to describe how painful it was to get through this. There is no need to repeat the negative comments already written by others, so I won't.

It took them six years to write this book?? If you break it down, maybe 20 pages of the entire book are actually dedicated to the so-called \\"Rule of Four\\"; the rest is nonsense about life at college. It is poorly written and had it not been for the sucess of the Da Vinci Code, I am convinced this book would have never (NEVER!) in a million years been published. It is so,so bad.

You can almost feel the smirks that they must have made as they described the steam tunnels and nude Olympics of Princeton. You can almost taste the sense of superiority that they must have experienced writing dialog that points out the misquoting of Hobbes.The thrill of a great Liberal Arts education is the thrill of elite trivia.

This book exagerates descriptions and details that have nothing to do with the plot. It loses focus by the middle of the book, and the end is very weak.

The authors couldn't make up their mind whether to write an antiquarian story, a college story, or a mystery. These strains are in no way intertwined. Everything that happens is totally unlikely. For instance, a person is murdered and no one goes to find out who and who did it. Or: Preoccupied about one room mate's fate, a student goes first lecturing about Roman topography in the middle of the night. The girlfriend of the first person narrator shows up from time to time and is not involved in the actions - is this Princeton undergrad love? The Princeton professor of Renaissance is named Taft, and of course the reader is induced to think of Anthony (Tony) GrAFTon. But none of the characteristics of Taft apply to Grafton.

The subject matter is very obscure and most of the conclusions that are drawn seem to appear right out of thin air without much concrete thought or evidence to support them.My thinking is that a publisher came across a manuscript that seemed vaguely close to the Da Vinci Code and just put it out there and accentuate the slight connection to try and cash in on the popularity."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS STINKS","review":"This book was the biggest disappointment.

But after plowing through to the end I just couldn't figure out why I was supposed to like the main character... or any of his friends for that matter. The authors fail to develop depth in any of the characters and thus never sufficiently explain why the central manuscript holds such interest for those involved with it.The book reads like a novel written by 13 year olds (and average ones at that).Do not waste your time or money on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Ready for Primetime Fiction","review":"This book is seriously awful. I cannot believe that an editor thought this book was ready to go to press. The basic problem is the structure of the book -- the storyline meanders all over the place because apparently no one thought about the best way to structure the narrative. Second, characterization is just non-existent. Third, the writing is simply pedestrian. Fourth, the solution to the puzzle is more than a let-down. It is flat and uninvolving.The germ of an interesting intellectual thriller is in this book -- but the authors seem to be more interested in showing that an Ivy League education is worth the money than in actually making the very real effort involved in writing an intellectual thriller. Perhaps they need to read a little more Umberto Eco (for plot) and Wilkie Colllins (for characterization) and a little less Nelson DeMille and Dan Brown."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull and Unsatisfying","review":"Was very disappointed in the flat story and academia name dropping.

The book doesn't pull you in, and you don't really care what happens to the main characters one way or the other.

It's powerful incentive, obviously.Make no mistake: The Rule of Four is no DaVinci Code. The only real intrigue presents itself in the epilogue. It's a little bit DaVinci-esque, but it's far too little and far too late; by that time, it just seems like a preposterous bit of reverse shark-jumping. The characters are so poorly drawn that it's possible to distinguish one from another only by physical descriptions; a real author would not have felt required to keep reminding us how big and black Charlie is and how small and slight Paul is. And throughout I was haunted by the burning question: Does Princeton have some special legal dispensation that allows for such free-flowing liquor at undergrad functions?The book club meeting starts in two hours, and I am ready for that glass of wine. I've really earned it this time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievably boring!","review":"I cannot believe that this book is a bestseller and is being compared to works by Umberto Eco and Donna Tratt - it is unbelieveably slow with the authors simply reminiscing about the variious traditions of Princeton that they must have enjoyed when they studied there - and all the characters are so dull. The relationship between Tom and Katie is completely lacking in any reality or warmth. Where is the sensitive coming of age? The authors' rambling style constantly switching between the events of the past and the present is tedious...Totally not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"undergraduate literature","review":"Erudite? Riveting? Poignant? For whom? Also misled by the Times (why do we continue to listen?), I picked this up to read in the country, when I had unlimited attention to devote to what I hoped would be fun and cerebral, layered and full of arcana. Instead, Rule of Four was boring when it was not pretentious, full of the wisdom of the newly degreed who haven't yet experienced much of life, mystery, work or -- quite clearly -- intimacy.However, the authors are talented and really precocious. I will be interested in seeing their work when they grow up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drivel","review":"I wanted to be fair, and I've read 82 pages. I can't push myself to read more, because it's just drivel about four Princeton seniors, the one senior narrator's father, several professors and some damn 500-year old book that only a handful of people in the whole world know about. With apologies to the authors and the book snobs at The New York Times who loved it, I just don't care to spend any more of my life reading this book. Two stars is generous. I'll get back to a sure thing by Robert Crais or Harlan Coben or John Lescroart or Michael Connelly or Lee Child or John Sandford or Brian Haig or P.T. Deutermann or Vince Flynn or any one of a dozen other novelists who will keep me turning pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sophomoric, elitist, collegiate","review":"I wouldn't even give this book (ha) a star, but I could find no other way to submit the review. This was by far the worst book that I have ever read. Like another reviewer stated, why the comparison to Dan Brown's The DaVinci Code is beyond me. I wish that I could get my money back and my time wasted on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the time it took to read","review":"It appears that the authors of this book were attempting to cash in on the popularity of The DaVinci Code but have failed miserably in their effort. This is a story with a weak plot and flat characters. It is the tale of how some Princeton undergraduates solve a 500 year old mystery that has eluded experts for generations. It appears more focused on describing the various buildings on the Princeton University campus than it does on developing the story line or adding depth to the characters to try to make them seem more real.The only reason I read it was because I was stuck on a plane and had little choice. In retrospect I should have read the Sky Mall catalog. At least I might have seen something interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Father Fixation","review":"How anybody can call this book a \\"good read\\" is beyond me. The \\"My father this....\\" and \\"My father that....\\" repetitive sentences drove me to tears. IMHO this book is a poor 'first novel' and not worthy of the praise it has received."},{"rating":"1","title":"awful. Boring. Don't waste your time.","review":"I haven't read DaVinci code so I can't compare to that like everybody seems to do, but this book stands on its own as really really awful. Cardboard characters doing unlikely things in uninteresting ways. I see no reason anybody should read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Beautifully Wrapped Stinker","review":"As others have pointed out here, some of the writing in this book is brilliant. Unfortunately, none of it applies to the \\"plot,\\" and I use the term loosely. The two villains seem interchangeable to me, so much so that I got them confused. The laborious business about life at Princeton merely got in the way of the story. The murders encountered by the protagonists are glossed over, as if such events are everyday experiences, and the police investigations were explained away with a sentence or two.It was also hard to keep track of the story/backstory, with the narrative jumping around from flashbacks to the present.A lot of people are making money on the success of The Da Vinci Code. These two fledgling authors are doing the same. If they have a multi-book contract, I'll be interested to see if they develop more writing muscle in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"I just didn't care about these people","review":"I also have the 100-page litmus test that one of the other reveiwers mentioned. If I'm not hooked by then, I never will be. But right around page 100, it picked up a bit, so I gave it another 30 or so pages. I was disappointed and I put down the book. The writing style was entertaining, but I just didn't care about the outcome of the storyline at all. I wasn't even tempted to speed-read the last chapter or two. Sorry guys. Your story was totally lost on me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book doesn't deliver","review":"Looking forward to reading this novel, I was very dissappointed that it was not the \\"great chase\\" but more of a coming of age novel about college male relationships. While this is fine and good, the book was touted as one for a mysterious manuscript and the search for its solution. The novel is bogged down in the characters' and thier relationships, the search for the solution is lost quickly. A shame as the writer's style is pretty good.If you must read it borrow it or check it out from the library and purchase something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intelligence and heart in a coming of age drama -","review":"No, not really a thriller or in the mystery genre, but I really got a kick out of this book. The subject was obscure but that does not make it inaccessible; in fact the authors make a generous point of unveiling the Hypnerotomachia to the uninitiated. For anyone who went from being the brightest star at their high school to being one of an ocean of bright stars at an Ivy League college, the characters and their relationships will ring very true. The only females in the book are hollow and petty (and superfluous), but as the book is written as a first-person narration by a male college student, I think that's entirely appropriate! The main girl in his life actually calls him on that at one point and rings 100% true. This is NOT the adrenaline-rush of a Dan Brown freefall, but a thoughtful and sometimes suspenseful account of a post-adolescent reassessment of life's priorities. Wordy, not for the impatient, but nicely-read and sweetly engaging."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst book I have ever read fully","review":"After checking out the summary on the back cover, I felt this book would be a great follow up to Dan Brown. Nothing could be further from reality. Having actually endured the entire book, I now feel that the only possibly enigmatic and remotely interesting part was the name of the Renaissance book \\"Hynerotomachia Poliphili\\". The book alternates between laborious and terribly boring passages of life at Princeton and an incredibly slow paced quest for some very mysterious secret. Enduring and fighting though the tedium of the Princeton passages, I was hoping to find some worthwhile secret unveiled at the end. Not to be! Rule of Four a complete let down. I would not even recommend it as a paper weight for which it is truly fit considering its girth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrid writing","review":"I picked up this book only because of a comparison to Umberto Eco's The Name of the Rose, which I remembered was a thoroughly engrossing read. This book does not come close. The writing is painfully sophomoric, the dialogue is pretentious and unnatural. Even worse, plot points are muddled and yet as a reader, I found myself not caring about the story, the mystery or any of the characters. The ending is a wink towards Hollywood as spoofed in Robert Altman's The Player."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less than I was expecting","review":"The premise for this novel moved me to eagerly await its arrival in the mail. I really wanted it to be good, and kept plodding through the choppy writing, flat characters, and pointless relationship angst. The ending did provide a measure of satisfaction, but I can't say it made up for the tedious hours leading up to it. I'm being generous with two stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was really bad","review":"The story was smarmy and almost 100% exposition. For every 1 line of action you get 100 lines of back story. The narrative is constantly interupted with unsympathetic characters and ill conceived \\"mysteries\\". Seriously - save you money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"It is beyond me how people are comparing this book to the Da Vinci Code. The only similarity they share is that they each involve an ancient mystery that the protagonists attempt to solve. The differences are many. Whereas the Da Vinci Code embraced its mystery and suspense, the Rule attempts to combine its element of mystery and suspense with the coming of age of its characters. Be one or the other, but don't try to be both -because you might fail. The qualities of the Rule which would have been otherwise attractive are suffocated by the writers' attempt to create more than just a suspense novel. Too much pretense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ick","review":"I wish I had used the time reading this book for something more productive like waiting in line at the DMV.Was it not enough for these guys to graduate from an Ivy league school - they needed to impress the world with their command of the language and arcane literary knowledge?I can't remember the last book I read that had me skipping HUGE chunks only to pick up pages later having lost nothing in the process."},{"rating":"1","title":"i got this book for free and i still want my money back","review":"nice try, but poorly executed. the premise of high crime on princeton campus needs a better motive. the whole thing was just too implausible to be taken seriously. plus, the overly romanticized ivy-league images were a turn off. an extra dose of reality and a shot of action could have saved the story. still, there were clever parts that showed thorough research. all in all two thumbs down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh....","review":"A Dan Brown esque novel that isn't near that level. Maybe my expectations were too high after reading Dan's four novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth the time","review":"Having read the DaVinci Code, I was eagerly looking forward to this novel. What a disappointment it was! The plot was confusing and not at all plausible. It seems that the two young authors are trying to show how learned they are, but I came away bored, although I have to admit, I read the book to the end. I wouldn't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't believe the hype -- this book is terrible","review":"I received this book as a gift and was eager to read a great story like Da Vinci Code or Angels and Demons. But I was disappointed from the first page. The characters are undeveloped and unbelievable stereotypes that are completely one-dimensional. Who has ever heard of undergraduates who spend every waking hour consumed with their thesis and academics? The dialogue is so stilted and unrealistic that it's painful to read. The central mystery is boring and uninspiring -- you don't care one bit whether they \\"solve the case\\" or not. This is a pompously written weak attempt at \\"intellectual\\" literature. Please do not waste your valuable time and money on this stupid book."},{"rating":"1","title":"semi scholarship","review":"Although based on the premise of a real book of clandestine meaning, the race to unlock its secrets was not terribly interesting. There was little of the intellectual \\"meat\\" found in Umberto Eco or even Dan Brown. Interesting factoids were too few, and although character development was deeper and richer than in the Da Vinci Code, the characters were not particularly apealling to me. One for the weekend at the beach."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Clever mix of a Boring Book and Good Marketing","review":"It's difficult to add another one-star review, but it should be be done until this book's rating is brought down to a deserved level. The people who made Fabian a rock star in the 50's and Britney Spears a diva now must have been retained to foist this book onto a best-seller list. The two authors spent several YEARS writing it in their basement? They must have been playing video games.

However, it is a definite must-read for anyone who has \\"read them all\\" and is looking for a new author with potential, especially an author that is outside of the standard mass market garbage (Dan Brown).

In fact, I was stupified, numbed so much that I was unable to read further. And, after looking at so many other readers' reviews, I appear to have made a good call. I felt The DaVinci code unravelled somewhat, but it was a rivetting read. This book is not.What has happened to our faculties of literary criticism, which have ridiculously propelled this palpable nonsense into the best-seller lists? Clearly, Barnum was wrong.

Have a feeling that these young authors will someday look back on this work with embarrassment -- but hope they try again as there is definitely promise for one or both to be excellent writers.The book suffers from sloppy explication (too much at times, too little at otheres) and some really unfortunate cliche plot elements, the worst being in the final chapter.Overall, it seems like what you might predict would be the result when two very smart recent college grads take six years to co-author a novel ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"very disappointed by this book.

I thought I was getting it with this book but it was a bore. By half way through the book I realized that there was NOTHING going on in the story. I struggled on hoping for a climax and none came. I thought this book was terrible. I think I would have more fun and interest reading the Hypnerotomachia myself. It would be more interesting. The characters were wooden with none clearly defining themselves at any point. It seemed as if if was written for a teenage audience. I give it two stars because the author really had a great premise to tie a fictional story in with the Hypnerotomachia. I now would like to read it myself and if it wasn't for them I probably would never have heard of it. But, other than that, this novel was rubbish."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst book ever","review":"Good marketing in the wake of \\"The Da Vinci Code\\", has made this book a bestseller. Nothing else.

Even after not being moved by the first half of the book, I gave it the benefit of the doubt and finished it believing things would get better. Turns out, I just wasted my time.I had hoped it would be something like a Dan Brown novel, especially after reading a quote on the back cover by The New York Times Book Review praising The Rule of Four as \\"the ultimate puzzle book.\\" In reality, solving the Hypnerotomachia wasn't a major plot line, but rather a backdrop of sorts.A line at the top of the front cover reads, \\"500 Years Ago the First Men Were Murdered to Protect the Secret.\\" This led me to believe that there would be secret societies and mysterious murders throughout the book ala Da Vinci Code, but this also turned out to be false hope as well.The Rule of Four basically centers around the college lives of the main character and his three friends, all of whom you do not give a damn about due to poor writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"BETTER than Da Vinci Code","review":"Have also seen the comparisons to Da Vinci Code, and agree that this link is misleading.Found Da Vinci Code formulaic and annoying.

I thought it moved right along, and never found myself skipping over long, drawn-out passages.I liked it because something seemed to always hold my attention. The characters were easy to relate to, reminding me of perhaps one of my own friends. I really love modern/historical mysteries, where the authors blend fact and fiction.

This Book was and is one of the most miserable attempts to hitch a free ride on the Da Vinci mania of recent. Do not waste time and money on this example of poor storytelling."},{"rating":"2","title":"An interesting foray into the land of an ancient text","review":"The main attractions of \\"Rule\\" for this reader were the setting (Princeton) and the fact that it deals with underclassmen researching an ancient text. I was not expecting, nor should I have been, a literary masterpiece and I wasn't disappointed in this aspect. Still, it is well enough composed for what it is, and this is a commercially successful trek through college accompanied by puzzles and problem solving.Granted, comparisions have been, and will continue to be made against Brown's \\"Da Vinci\\" but \\"Rule\\" is truly unique. The only real connection may be that the authors were influenced by Brown's work--for me the similarities stopped there.Given the success of this book, it will probably stay around for a few more years. While it may have its detractors, for the genre that it is, the writing and story are enough to keep you turning the pages. Not a book for English class, but rather a good-natured romp through academia."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievably bad","review":"Like everyone else, I bought into the hype for this book. I rarely buy hardback books, but the \\"buzz\\" on this book had me drooling in anticipation. Holy crap, was I ever wrong!

I'm putting my copy up for sale on ebay. And before these two authors write again, I'd advise them to learn to be concise when allegedly writing a thriller. Let me know when the next John Le Carre book comes out."},{"rating":"1","title":"not very good, frankly","review":"Despite the mountains of hype that this book has generated - mysteriously - it turns out to be a rambling, flacid thriller with glancing pretensions to scholarship. The details that are evoked most lovingly, like life in Princeton dining clubs, are of interest only to those who experienced them. It's like being trapped at a dinner party with a bunch of recent Princeton grads remembering the good old days, and unconvincingly attempting to inflate the mundane details of Princeton life into something transcendent. As for the mystery and the celebrated puzzle-solving in the plot, there are one or two neat twists, but mostly it has been done better elsewhere. The writers are talented, but green. I do not think their publishers have done them a favor by conflating this early effort into a best-selling event. It is only likely to make more difficult the writing of the truly good book that may still be within their grasp."},{"rating":"1","title":"Positively Painful","review":"We had a friend over from Australia who raved about The Rule of Four.

The pedantic storyline fails to catch the reader's interest, and the two main characters - too obviously the authors' alter egos - are flat, and live their lives at 20+ with a pathos one would hardly find in a 70-year-old ex-con.A few things in there are worth saving, such as the Hypnerotomachia subject itself and the underlying historical background. A better writer would have turned this raw material into a major success.This is a so-so first for the book's young authors and I wish them success. I just hope they will not repeat the mistakes they made in this book - too many to list - and that they will not write their next novel at the same pace: 6 years by some accounts, and about as long to read it.

In my enthusiasm to draw, I eagerly used most fo the colors in the pallette. As a result this was the worst drawing I ever did. This book reminds me of that drawing, trying to do too much and not conveying a single thought completely in the process. I hope these writers and hopefully their editors are more mindful of the following rule: \\"Less is More\\".I don't understand how people compare this book with Dan Brown's Da Vinci Code!! Everytime I see this book in my library, I get upset of the time and paper wasted on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cover lie","review":"I just started to read this book today, July 24, '04. I've read a few reviews here and I don't know if I'm also going to be turned off by writing style but I'll plod ahead. In the meantime, I just wanted to say that right on the cover is the first turn-off. At the top of the cover it says: \\"500 Years Ago the First Men Were Murdered to Protect the Secret\\" This is not true and those men were killed only because they failed a test of trust. They did not die to protect anything. Their killing is clearly explained in the Prologue! So, the publisher uses this teaser to make you think that there is a secret that men were killed for when, in reality, it is totally meaningless. I'll be back with a full review IF I do make it to the end 'cause if I don'te there are enough negative reviews here already that mine won't make any difference."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Boring! Unless you can pronounce Hypnerotomachia don't give this book another thought. I gave up after 135 pages; the story appeared to be going nowhere.

This is possibly the worst book I have ever read. There are too many inconsistencies for this to be a good book. The example on pp189 is purely a result f bad research and watching too much tv.The glue that holds the plot together is poorly written. The post puberty immature antics of some mediocre college students are boring if not down right irritating. I was amazed that the two author have attended and presumably done well at two of the America's premiere education institutions, I guess they must let anyone in these - a real shocker."},{"rating":"2","title":"overhyped","review":"My review would probably be more positive if it weren't for all the hype, which led me to expect something truly out of the ordinary (like \\"Cryptonomicon\\", maybe). This book isn't bad, but it's not exceptional either. Beyond that, the most useful thing I can say, probably, is that it is more of a \\"coming of age\\" story than a \\"treasure hunt\\" story. It reminds me more of \\"A Separate Piece\\" than \\"the Da Vinci Code.\\" While there is a lot about the way the mystery book has affected the narrator, his father, his friends, etc. the actual \\"mystery\\" of the book itself is secondary to these relationships and characters. In fact, I could not make myself care about the mystery book. To put my views in context, I am not much of a \\"da Vinci Code\\" fan either -- I think it goes too far in the other direction with cardboard characters and awkward dialogue. If you like mysteries about art and art history, or codes, read the \\"jonathan and flavia\\" mysteries of Iain Pears or \\"Cryptonomicon\\" by Neal Stephenson."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Rule of Four","review":"I must agree with previous reviewers.

A movie critic recently offered this observation on \\"promotion\\": It's Hollywoodspeak for convincing moviegoers that something isn't dog poo when everybody knows it is...\\" The same applies to this book - The Rule of Four is not suspenseful, not engaging, not interesting - unless your tastes run to enjoying 170 pages of description of what it is to be a senior at Princeton. Only perseverance allowed me to finish reading this drivel. Dan Brown can rest easily - masters of the suspense, these authors are not. The book is slow paced, ponderous, in fact, through the first half, thoroughly predictable in the second half. I wouldn't recommend it except as an effective sedative for sleepless nights."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow moving","review":"I'm giving this book two stars because I respect the subject matter it has tried to undertake, however, this book is quite a yawn. I had a difficult time getting into it. To be honest I bought it because it sounded something like the Da Vinci Code, and perhaps that's where my disappoint lies. This book is not as action packed and not as well researched and written. Still, I think the subject could have been interesting and if this author tried to write another I would also give that a shot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly, a disappointment.","review":"I share many of the same impressions as G. Makarski in her review of 10/22.The marketing of the book as a comparison to DaVinci pretty much guarantees you will be disappointed. This is unfortunate, as the book has interesting qualities of its own, but should not have been compared with a story of suspence. You'll note many of the reviews here come to the same conclusion; slow, unfocused, and awkwardly written at times, but with some rewarding moments all of which pertain to human relationships, especially between these young men. It seems to me that all of the ingredients were here for a really great book, but it should have been edited down to perhaps one/half its length, removing the clutter that subtracts rather than adds, especially in the latter third of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Greatest, but Not the Worst","review":"Like many other reviewers, I went into The Rule of Four expecting it to be similar to Dan Brown's work (which I LOVE!). The authors spent a great deal of time of developing the character's relationships with one another. At times, suspense would be building when they would delve in a character's past, which I didn't enjoy. I must admit I was confused at several points at some of the interpersonal issues they had with one another. I must have missed something earlier. When I finished, my first thought was \\"That book was confusing.\\" It was good, but not great, and could have been better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great first timer novel","review":"Other reveiwers are correct-this book is no DaVinci Code. While the premises of the two books are similar, The Rule of Four is not the suspense/thriller that The DaVinci Code is. That said, however, I think the Rule of Four is a great book. I enjoyed learning about an ancient manuscript I had never heard of before, and I am always intrigued by hidden riddles, codes, etc. A few spots where I didn't care for the book are: Long narratives of memories that, while you read them, seem not to matter, but you get insight for later events. This is not a bad feature, but it took me a while to get used to it. The other minor flaw was how quickly and easily the books secrets were discovered. That seemed illogical to me. I also would have loved to know more about how the rule of four actually worked. It is alluded to as the answer, but we never really find out just how it helped solve the puzzle, or how the kids figured it out. In the end, though, I thoroughly recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good","review":"I was highly disappointed with this book. It was recommended to me as \\"similar to the Da Vinci Code,\\" and it was nothing like it at all! There was no around the world problem solving. There was no art history and religious symbolism.

Unlike Dan Brown's bestseller, which propells the reader headlong at a breathtaking pace, and ladles out the exposition in bite-sized chunks of dialog, the Rule of the Four is plodding and ponderous. Almost nothing happens in the first fifty pages, except to introduce characters and wedge in page after page of backstory and Princeton travelogue. Don't be taken in by the comparisons to The Secret History (Donna Tartt), the Brotherhood of the Rose (Umberto Eco), and The Da Vinci Code, as this work is never as well written as the former, as exciting as the latter, or as scholarly as the one in the middle."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's all the fuss about?","review":"After all the over-hyped reviews of this book, I was disappointed with the read, and felt I had wasted my time.

This writer wrote this book with scholarly words and applied exceptional metaphors in describing complicated thoughts and abstract concepts. In a way it gives me a feeling that the four Princeton undergraduates reflect the writer himself. Be that as it may, from a novel reader's perspective, the plot and development of this novel is a failure. The closer to the ending, the poor the story.

I like fast pace, page turners that does not dwell on each and every detail (i.e.-Jack Higgins, Robin Cook, John Grisham). This book is more for those readers who likes random details about the characters, locations, and activities.Now to the book review: Nothing happens in the first 1/2 of the book. It goes on and on about the book, school, and irrelivant character descirption. For example: what was the point of the paintball match which had zero bearing on the story. Or, three page description of Gil ex-girlfriend/s (trust me, there are more but two examples are enough). As I stated earlier, I don't need unnecessary details.

But, the realty is that they are unoriginal, boring and try too hard. When I finished The Rule of Four I thought nothing. I didn't hate it and I didn't love it. It was forgettable. The book starts off with the main character, Tom Sullivan, telling the reader about the Hyperotomachia, the mysterious book that is the center of the story. This would be great, but the authors fail to give the reader a reason to care. They seem to be so caught up in writing the story with it's complicated riddles and details of snobby ivy league students that they forget that a story is only compelling and passionate to the reading public if they can in some way identify or empathize with it.

Except for the few references to traditions at Princeton and some of its illustrious grads, there's not much in any of the four main characters to engage the reader.

The plot, however, got lost in the personal and sophmoric antics of college students that were frankly uninspiring. However, if all the padding about Princeton were taken out, there would be little left. The pace was too sloooow and the writing not tight enough to make it interesting.

The Da Vinci Code at least swept you along in a fast pace of mystry and puzzles, but this one was more like slogging through an end of the year term paper.

They have a plot that screams along.Alas, The Rule Of Four is bogged down by its attempt to be deep and meaningful. The plot seems incidental. The characters are unpleasant, shallow and too exposed. Nowhere is the mystery made to seem important. Who cares about page upon page of Princeton lore and embarassingly written romance?

He would've gotten away with it if it hadn't been for those meddling kids!!!I cannot begin to describe just how rotten this book was. To call it a steaming pile would be an insult...to steaming piles. The writing stinks. The story stinks. The only thing compelling about the Rule of Four is that you'll be compelled to keep reading and keep reading - like a Bataan Deathmarch of Literature, thinking to yourself \\"Surely it'll get better? Surely there's a point to all this?\\" It never does. There never is. Oh, if only I'd followed my first instinct and drop-kicked it out the window!!You'd think two guys with Ivy League degrees would be capable of doing a little better? Not these two, apparently."},{"rating":"1","title":"A pretentious attempt at depth","review":"I bought this book after reading numerous rave reviews. It is a terribly boring and misogynistic story that's so proud of itself it's nauseating. Other reviewers claim that only shallow, TV-obsessed readers will dislike this book. All I have to say is that I graduated first in my class at Berkeley, got a 1600 on my SATs, am Phi Beta Kappa and currently getting a PhD from MIT and I hated this book.

It is boring and hard to follow. In fact, the sale of book has been outlawed in 39 states for being so bad, I hear. I read Brown, Clancy, Crichton, Grisham and King among others, and \\"the rule of four\\" guys couldn't even carry their pencil boxes. If you want to be disappointed, read this book!p.s.

I bought the book based on the cover and thought it was going to be a la Da Vinci Code. How wrong was I? First of all the story of the Hypnerotomachia has nothing to do with the rest of the plot. I thought the authors were showing-off their knowledge without even trying to support the main plot. Second of all, the dialogues were bordering childish or were unreal. Specially the dialogues with the main character Tom and his girlfriend were so out of this world and did nothing to enrichen the book.It's few days of my life I will never get back..."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Loved This Book","review":"I don't understand the low ratings on this book--I thought it was fantastic. A complex, mysterious thriller of a more cerebral variety. A movie is supposed to be in development for this, as well as for The Historian (which I also loved). Let's just hope Ron Howard doesn't get hold of these, too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it, don't read it","review":"Having found this book abandoned in a hotel lobby, I thought it might be fast paced and interesting. Boy, was I wrong!This story wanderrs aimlessly without recognizable organization. My mistake was to read the first hundred pages hoping it would improve, as I was desperate for something to read - it didn't. Why it was published, I have no idea.After looking at the author's bios, I realized they were two kids fresh out of college with no life experiences. It shows.Don't buy this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting premise but a dull end-result","review":"I love the premise - 500 year old book filled with riddles and puzzles. But the lack of character development and over-dependence on descriptive day-to-day college life makes the end result dull. The authors, if they continue writing, will undoubtedly learn how to develop characters without resorting to simply describing the characters and the character's feelings. But as for this book, 80% of it is exactly that - a descriptive narrative of a group of college seniors and their daily actions and feelings. I don't feel as if I got to know or empathize with any of these characters despite learning eveything about them.As for the ancient book and it's mysteries - interesting at times, but there were too few of these moments.All in all, a forgettable read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't live up to recent hype","review":"I haven't been this disappointed by a book since I read \\"The Lovely Bones\\". High points: the research the authors have done seems to be solid. I was interested in the story behind the \\"Hypnerotomachia Poliphili\\". That's where the praise ends.Low points: Character development was way below average. I can't think of any one character I gave a darn about. And, I couldn't give a hoot about Princeton life.I can't figure out how anyone can compare it to \\"The Da Vinci Code\\". Brown's book had it's problems but at least it was entertaining.In my opinion, the publishers saw an opportunity to ride on the coat tails of the success of \\"The Da Vinci Code\\". It's almost like they said, \\"Hey! Lets' print this quick so people will snap it up while Brown's book is fresh in their memories. Who needs a good story?\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another NY Times Hype Job","review":"Whenever I read a rave review in the NY Times, the first thing I say to myself is that there's a 50-50 chance this book will live up to the hype. Lord, was this boring and pretentious. Another tedious attempt at \\"I am smarter than thou.\\" More and more, I am scanning the Amazon.com reviews to hear what real readers think. I found two readers who were touting Robert Harris' Pompeii and 1906, an epic based on the great San Francisco earthquake by James Dalessandro. The previous is wonderful, the latter is the most thrilling, page turning read I have found all year. Let me jump on the band wagon of people who love powerful, colorful, complex historical fiction and say Pompeii and 1906, particularly the latter, are the year's best books. Could not put them down. If you must, borrow this book from a friend and judge for yourself. Then give 1906 and Pompeii a read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly overrated","review":"Although I admit that the book finally 'picks up' some momentum after the initial 200 page slog, it never really becomes a compelling read. I did, in fact, finish this book, but only because it's difficult for me to abandon any book I've started. There is absolutely no basis for comparison between \\"The Rule of Four\\" and any Dan Brown work beyond the tenuous thread that some historical puzzles are being solved within the pages. The fact that the plot line of \\"The Rule of Four\\" is anchored in an actual historical text does nothing to lift it from its plodding pace. My copy will be donated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very difficult to fathom","review":"Sorry , but:Among the worst books that I have ever read, or tried to read. I gave up half way through.

More like a final exam than enjoyable reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"104 pages and waiting for something to happen...","review":"I am not enjoying reading about Princeton college traditions. If I wanted to read about that subject, I would have bought such a book. I guess I'll press on to the end, but man, what a boring ride. Princeton alumni will probably like it. Not sure why it's a best-seller, though. zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't grab me in the first 100 pages ...","review":"I wanted to like this book. Really. It appeared to be a thriller much in the vein of _The Da Vinci Code_. However, the story really didn't do much to keep my interest. By page 70 or so, I found my thoughts drifting away from the book.As other reviewers here have mentioned, the authors paint a very tactile and detailed picture of Princeton University in the winter. Unfortunately, the narrator's shifts into unimportant backgrounds of secondary and tertiary characters are what I found to be the potholes in the road of this story.My rule of thumb is that if I don't really care about any of the characters or what the outcome of the story is by the first 100 pages (usually 1/3 or 1/4 of the way through the book), I close the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sheer Agony","review":"No stars. For plenty of reasons why you shouldn't buy this book, please read some of the negative reviews already on this site. If after reading the thumbs-down reviews, you still want to check it out, I suggest checking it out of the library, borrowing it from a friend, or paying less than $1 at a garage sale first. It's not so much that it's not as good as, or similar enough to, or as fast-paced as The DaVinci Code; rather, it's simply not well-written. Many of us have books on our shelves or in our donation box that we didn't like and wished we had skipped. But this book actually made me *resent* the time and $$ spent on it...even though I only paid half price. Confession: I only finished this painstaking book because I needed to believe it would get better, or have some redeeming, rewarding Aha! at the end. Nope."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"How dare anyone say this book is better than Da Vinci Code...it is not even close..I was fooled by the reviews on the book..bought it ...read it..and still regretting it..and whats with the word \\"nodded\\"..they use it like a zillion time...Mostly the book is about Princeton...if i were interested in that..i would have got a Brochure...Seriously...either the authour knew a couple of critics who gave them good reviews and that influenced other critics...OR..the critics were talking about a totally different book then the \\"Rule of Four\\"..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ho Hum....","review":"After reading the back jacket of the book describing how this was going to be a \\"Dan Brown\\" type of read I quickly purchased the book. While at times the book stayed true to the \\"Smart Fiction\\" genre that Dan Brown follows, I didn't want more. I was sick of hearing about the lives of these Princeton kids, while I think it makes a good story overall, it didn't have the \\"Can't Put Down\\" feeling that Dan Brown is able to capture. If you're looking to read anything like the Da Vinci Code, stick with Dan Brown and read Angels & Demons."},{"rating":"1","title":"Have low expectations and maybe you won't be disappointed...","review":"Well, I was excited that it would be a great read and expected another Davinci Code. Without going into specifics, half the book was dedicated to life at Princeton and the other half was split between character development and the actual document/history.So, in summary, less than 25% of the book is dedicated to solving the mystery.Have low expectations and wait until the library gets a copy..."},{"rating":"1","title":"These authors are in their early twenties and it shows.","review":"Turn on MTV for the same one-dimensional Ryan Seacrest-like characters. The 'Hypnerotomachia Poliphili' is such a bold topic and I am thankful the authors educated me on the mysterious book, but they also created four of the most unlikable characters on record. I was hoping the protagonists would fade into the background and the book would take center-stage... not a chance. Those whiney brats kept blabbing on about social issues and romances that twelve-year-olds have. These writers are gifted historians (and now they're rich), but they've spent most of their lives in libraries. They need to get out of quad if they're going to actually write about people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rule of One Star","review":"This book has received great reviews, and a very positive write-up from Nelson DeMille, who I love. The prologue to the book is excellent. Unfortunately it is followed by several hundred pages of some of the most boring storytelling I have ever endured. I have read thousands of novels, but it has been a long time since I picked one up that put me to sleep so easily. The plot is weak, the non-existent story is wordy and unbelievable. Although I didn't love the DaVinci code, any comparison between it and the Rule of Four is just plain dishonest. There is more action and story in the first 2 chapters of the DaVinci Code than there is in all of the Rule of Four. Don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thank You Mass Market","review":"This book is the product of a hot new market place (thanks in part to Dan Brown) and the idea that Ivy League writers are automatically brilliant. The truth of the matter is this book is thin, weak, tasteless. It is watered down coffee relying upon cream and sugar fundaments to spice up an otherwise crumbling effort. Do yourself a favor and pick up Human Interface here at Amazon by Jason Giacchino and leave the scholars to their studies. Who knows, perhaps after Ian Caldwell graduates from Intro to Creative Writing, he'll release a more impressive second effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why is this book so popular???","review":"I might have liked this book better had it not been compared to the Da Vinci Code. Now THAT was a great book! The great mystery in this book has lasted 500 years - yet its unraveled pretty easily by random people popping in the main characters dorm room. I found the main character rather unlikable. He is this kind of geeky self absorbed character - and yet is doted on by his girlfriend who stepped off the screen of Dawson's Creek (and is even named Katie) and by his glamour room mates. I don't get it. The two main characters are pretty well drawn out - but the girlfriend and room mates are fantasy caricatures. There were also some editing problems. All in all - pretty mediocre with a few clever moments thrown in. I want to get rid of my copy but I certainly won't give it to any of my friends to read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst ever","review":"I had just read the Da Vinci Code and was looking for something more taxing, but in the same vein, so I bought this one - based on the reviews. What a waste of time and money!!This has to be the worst book I have ever read. The story lumbers ponderously onwards, littered with obscure references to US University life which mean nothing to foreign readers. There is no \\"grip\\" at all. I usually read a book like this in a day or two - this took me three weeks!!! It is simply \\"unpickupable\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit juvenile for its setting","review":"I suppose I fall into the category of folks who didn't get the point of this novel. Aside from learning a good deal about Princton History, this book was a trite little love story that was schmaltzed up to entice a greater audience.Did it even end?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Gee Wiz-Kid Writing","review":"Although I admire their intellect and attention to academic detail, this is not a great book. It is at turns both precious and precocious. They are trying to be too \\"writerly\\" - the effect is like miking the floor beneath an amateur ballet - you hear all of the steps rendered clumsily and obviously. The characters do not come to life except as stiff cardboard preppies, and after all that trying. At least Brown doesn't even try to depict real people. I tried to be sympathetic, but in the end, I hated this book and had a great deal of trouble trying to finish it before owing my tax refund to the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"A real yawner","review":"The writing is smooth. The narrative is even. But's there's no story there, as Gertrude would have said. I got to page 135 and could not care any longer. These guys should go back to Novel Writing 101. They must be laughing all the way to bank, however, having masterminded this [is not the way to be] brilliant bestseller."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Rule of Four","review":"An average first attempt by two recent college graduates. I found one error troubling that the authors should have found in their re-write phase: first, the authors tell us that Paul spent his freshman summer in Italy studying art with a professor and in a later chapter tell us that Paul spent that same freshman summer working the loading docks somewhere near Princeton's campus. Where exactly was Paul that summer? While these two highly eduacated authors tried to impress us with their knowledge of books I was not impressed by such a careless error in editing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not to be confused with Da Vinci Code or Name of the Rose","review":"I bought this book because it was compared to works by Umberto Eco and Dan Brown. Having read those authors with delight, I looked forward to a tight, gripping story.This book has nothing in common with work by those authors!!!The plot line is very imaginative, but the charqacters are not engaging and are developed too late in the story line.I found the story to be very choppy.Overall this book was paced too slow at the outset and easily loses the reader's attention. Though I did finish the book, it would have been easy to set aside had I not been determined to finish."},{"rating":"1","title":"i could only hope","review":"Much like many of the other reviewers, I feel like I was sucked in and let down by what was ultimately 500-odd pages of nothing. It was easy to read, but lacked any substance, character development or credibility. I liked the idea of a 'Da Vinci Code for intellectuals', as the trashy writing style and fanciful plot lines of Dan Brown had disappointed. But at least there was some interesting views of long held ideas in The DaVinci Code.The Rule of Four seemed to steal others ideas (Brown, Eco, Tartt all too obviously) and then throw in some Ivy league tedium, mountainous intellects with precise recall of obscure texts, and the token Afro American with a heart of gold - but in reality would be a pain in the ass with his medical references and Doctor/God ideas.Oh well, I must say it was too be expected given the comparisons and airport newsagent packaging."},{"rating":"1","title":"Prolonged","review":"I read this book because it was compared to the DaVinci Code. Sorry, very far from it. They are alike only because both are about hidden codes in old books--that's as far as the comparison can be made. From the beginning I found it just rambled on with pointless dialogue. Character development was sketchy and at times confusing. Although, it was branded as a mystery novel, The Rule of Four read more like a tour of the grounds and traditions of Princeton. I just finished reading it because I paid for it and hoped it would get better... which it didn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"I was excited to read this book as I has heard that it was a \\"smarter\\" Da Vinci code. I am sorry to say that I was pretty dissapointed. The characters didn't feel very real to me, they all seemed to be exceedingly uptight and the relationships amongst them didn't feel genuine. I can appreciate and respect that these guys had lofty academic pursuits that extended beyond nightly keggers and stupid pranks, but I was left with an impression of Princeton as a boring military state for the priveleged.It is interesting to learn about the Hypnerotomachia, but not enough to merit reading this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slowly unwinding tale proves a solid summer read","review":"Though their reach often exceeds their grasp, Caldwell and Thomason have written a decent and entertaining first novel. The pace of the story can be frustratingly slow and they awkwardly inserted backstory at the most inopportune times. That said, the actual and imagined history behind the medieval manuscript is fascinating as is the social hierarchy of the Princeton eating clubs. If the authors fail at anything, it is at deciding whether they want to write a mystery/thriller or a campus novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two Authors = Twice The Disappointment","review":"This is the sort of read you feel compelled to finish in the hope that it gets better - it does not. I feel I know more about the layout of North American campuses after reading this but nothing about the key players or the underlying quest.The authors, who have been friends since 8 would be better off sharing the occasional beer and leave it at that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dan Brown still Rules","review":"Huge disappointment! I bought the book after reading reviews that it was as good as, if not better than, the Da Vinci Code. This story lacks the thrilling page-turning suspense that Dan Brown achieves in the Code. The authors spend too much time with descriptive fillers rather than sticking to the meat and bones of the mystery. I would have rather read more historical background of the'hypnerotomachia poliphili' than of Princeton's traditions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time or your money","review":"With all of the hype surrounding this book, I thought it was going to be great, unfortunately it was far from that. It was so slow and too pretentiously intellectual. Nothing in this book caught my attention and it was painful to finish. I don't know why people keep comparing this to The Da Vinci Code. It doesn't even compare. Save your money and rent it from the Library or If you want a great book, get The Da Vinci Code."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Payoff","review":"Promoted as this summer's DaVinci Code I was excited to read this new tome only to be disappointed in the meandering and uninspired story.

I also suspect that they have either relatives or family friends in the publishing industry. They must because this book is AWFUL. Silly, meaningless story line, confusing and poorly written timelines, really and truly horrible. I can't imagine that anyone would care what happens to any of the totally unlikable characters, and I only kept reading to assure myself I was not giving them every chance to improve.

Plus it was on the best seller list. So why would one not want to read it?Unlike Da Vinci Code, there is fairly little action. Only about 25% of the book is devoted to moving the story along. The rest seems to be lots of retrospective look at personal interactions among the main characters and their collegues and family. So it is really a book about relationships than historic mystery.There is nothing wrong with that execept that is not how the book was billed. So I found myself skipping pages at a time to get on with the story. By about 1/2 way through the book I had to finally give up. Maybe it got better, but the slow parts really detract from what could have been a good story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save the trees","review":"Seems to me that that the publishers wrote a better novel on the back of the book.

The story never takes off, there is no suspense what so ever and it all boils down to some sort of story about four friends of different backgrounds who meet at Princeton, and the on-and-off love affair that one of the guys has with some girl on campus. Mystery?

THe way they hyped this book I was ready for a long night's read. I tried to tough out the first 50 pages. Not only was it going no where, it was jumping around all over the place. THe narrator was rambling but never getting near the point. I kept hoping but finally through in the towel. Who ever praised this book must have read something else. All that stuff about the goings on at Princeton, never figured out what that had to do with things, though I will admit I gave up"},{"rating":"1","title":"Freshman Effort","review":"For as much as I wanted this novel to be a good read, my expectations were not met. The story was promoted to have suspense and intrigue which it terribly lacked. The pedantic musings and invesitagations by the protagonists come across as showmanhip rather than legitimate and academic. Finally, the attempt to work Princeton college life, frienship, and the choice between girlfriend or ancient text is quite possibly the weakest and most underdeveloped portion of the novel. For its immaturity, posturing and lack of cohesiveness, you might consider reading something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had to put it down","review":"After reading The Da Vinci Code I looked for books that might be similar. Amazon reviewers seemed to guide me to this book. After reading the first 100 pages I didn't know what was going on. I didn't know why I was reading this book. After each chapter I felt no urge to press on.I do not know why there are any comparisions to Dan Browns work. I would hesitate to not reccomend this book because I didn't finish it...and don't plan on finishing it. I dropped this book and picked up Angels and Deamons by Dan Brown instead and was happy I did so.I also gave this book to two other people who really enjoyed the Da Vinci Code and they too put the book down after about 80 pages.I don't mean to bash a book, but nothing made me want to read on.

However, as has been previously and frequently critiqued, this book is not even close. I'm not saying anything about the literary style, character development or intellectual (pseudo) prose of these Ivy League authors, I'm simply saying it's not what it was pumped up to be!!! So far, half way through and I'm still trying to get my adrenalin pumping the way all of Dan Brown's books did. I read one review that stated the writer couldn't sleep after finishing the book because of the thrill quotient, but come on, do I have to get through this entire book--touring all of Princeton-- for a payoff? I think it's just a wanabe wolf in sheep's clothing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a thriller","review":"I was expecting the type of action and suspense that was in Angels and Demons and other books in the genre.

I regret having bought it based on the recommendation of a clerk at Barnes and Noble (saying it was like the DaVinci code but different). The book is more about how intelligent the authors are and a guide to Princeton than it is about the Hypnerotomachia Poliphilli.This book could have been so much better given the pre-text. I had really wanted to learn more about the subject but became drowned in pointless paragraphs and action text that came out of nowhere. It bored me to the point that I just finished the book without caring anymore about what the riddles eventually meant.Even the second story of the personal lives of the students was boring. To add, the college students didn't act, speak or behave like normal college students (but I didn't go to Princeton nor did I major in English literature).Perhaps being intelligent isn't directly correlated to telling a story well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying","review":"So many good books, so little time. I regret the hours that I wasted reading this book. It is confusing with switches to the past and present leaving me re-reading to clarify, it's not compelling and I tossed it aside after reading half, disappointed and too bored to go on.

After finishing it I still haven't a clue."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very unevenly paced read","review":"Like many others, I purchased this book in hopes of replicating the excitement generated by reading 'The DaVinci Code'. However, put thoughts of that book out of your head when reading 'The Rule of Four'. There really isn't that much in common between the two.I simply had trouble getting into this book. The descriptions of life at Princeton were dull, the plot took far too long to get up to speed, and by the time it did, I just wanted the book to be done so that I could move on to something else. The two authors do show a lot of promise and probably just need some time to develop in order to turn out better characters and pacing.I can't recommend this book personally, but looking back at other reviews, it seems that some people have greatly enjoyed it. Maybe I just didn't have the patience for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"pretentious and boring","review":"I had great expectations for this book after reading a brief synopsis of it -- I would have been happy to stop reading right then and there. There is very little suspense built up over the course of the entire book, and there are senseless plot twists that keep the reader wondering \\"why did that have to happen?\\" (and why am I reading this?). Secondly, there are too many characters introduced for the authors to be able to deal with them on a less superficial level. Thirdly, the characters go off on way too many philosophical ramblings at inappropriate times in the book--people just don't talk that way (citing Greek philosophers in casual conversation)--even pretentious Princeon undergrads don't interact with each other that way. If they do, then I'm sorry that I wasted my time by painfully reading through this book. Don't be fooled by the inside cover's plot summary. You'll be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is no Da Vinci Code","review":"After hearing all the hype for this book, I was so excited to read it. However, the book moves at an extremely slow pace. The story around the Hypnerotomachia Poliphili was very fascinating, but the rest of the book was blah. I didn't particularly enjoy any of the characters or the various subplots. I wish the book was more focused on the Hypnerotomachia Poliphili, rather one of the author's experience at Princeton. Again, you if you looking for a Da Vinci Code like book, this is not it. Just read Angels and Demons or Digital Fortress by Dan Brown"},{"rating":"1","title":"There's no worst thief than a bad book","review":"That quote is found in this book and couldn't be more apt. The quote is the only good thing I got from reading this story. And when I say \\"read\\" I mean I skipped many pages and came close to just quitting the whole thing, but decided for some unknown reason to keep slogging on to the end. This book stole my time.

Actions I would recommend instead of reading The Rule of Four."},{"rating":"2","title":"A thrilling scholarly read","review":"This book was my introduction to the mathematical/techno-thriller genre and I must admit I got totally lost in this book, unable to do anything but turn the pages. Being a grad student myself, all of the discussions of unbridled academic curiosity really struck a chord with me and the hours melted away.The obsessive curiosity of the characters was terribly infectious and I felt myself wanting to find such a convoluted puzzle to obsess about. Characters were extremely easy to relate to and expertly written. By the final pages I felt as though I knew the characters personally."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Great Book For Insomnia","review":"I was REALLY disapointed in this book. The hook on the inside cover sounded so great that I just had to buy it.After reading the entire book, I'm still left wondering where the ~bizarre world of the Hypnerotomachia -- a world of forgotten erudition, strange sexual appetites, and terrible violence~ is in the book.I would have liked to have read more about the above and not so much about Princeton and it's Ivy League traditions/obsessions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ho-hum... Not worth the talk that it received","review":"The first problem with the books is that it takes 157 pages of reading before it really goes anywhere. Some may argue that it was \\"character development\\", but after discussing it with several serious English Lit types we all agreed it was a lot of wasted paper. I feel that the authors had a great time at Princeton and that the eating clubs was the highlight of their time there (pity). I kept hearing how this was going to be the next Da Vinci Code - same genre people, so we can compare - but it was anything but. I think the authors need some more practice. I do not recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whether compared to DVC or not - DON'T BOTHER !","review":"What the heck - I read it all the way through. Sure enough, it was a disappointment, and not worth the time. (Gee, maybe I should have scanned some Amazon.com reviews first and looked at the overall rating...) Whether you \\"compare\\" it to The DaVinci Code or not, it really doesn't even stand up well on it's own. The plot's implausible, you never really connect with any of the characters enough to care about them, and, unless you're a rather immature high school or college boy, it's basically pretty silly. How did it achieve \\"Best Seller\\" status? Hype, I guess. Sure glad I got it from my library and saved some $.

The story isn't very exciting and doesn't really hold your attention."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too puffed up for its own good","review":"After finding myself skimming at page 11, I knew this wasn't the book for me. The choppy sentences were full of self-satisfied writing and sophomoric discussions about whether to attend a pub crawl or finish a thesis (I can watch Fox TV for that).I think the writers' editor was trying to catch the coat tails of \\"The Da Vinci Code\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Much promise, little delivery","review":"While true that the structure and style of writing was disappointing, immatureand at cross-purposes, one good thing to be said about The Rule of Four was its bringing to light some of the intriguing mysteries of the Hypnerotomacchia Poliphili.The authors constructed the ending for a sequel that would involve further encounters with this fascinating subject, but unless there are significanteditorial interventions and radical improvements in the content & caliber of thewriting, it could prove to be another exercise in frustration for the serious reader.What an exciting read if an author of substance and skill were to take on this arcane and suggestive antiquity!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting idea, poorly written","review":"I bought this book because I thought the premise sounded interesting. I was right; it was an interesting premise and the substance of the 15th century \\"mystery\\" was interesting to me.

I hadn't really read anything about it prior to seeing it on display at the book store. Of course, I did know of the comparisons between it and \\"The Da Vinci Code,\\" but after finishing Rule, I understand why Dan Brown's book has been on the bestseller list since its release and why this one has not. \\"The Rule of Four\\" is just no fun. I kept hoping that the suspense would pick up, but it never did.Even aside from \\"The Da Vinci Code,\\" Rule lacks. The characters all speak like 40 year old professors. I get that they're smart, they attend an Ivy league school, but I found it a big turn-off. They're my age, yet I wouldn't want to be friends with any of them. And I'm supposed to care about them and this mystery.Ultimately, The Hypernowhosywhatsit is interesting, in itself. The fictional story that has been crafted around it is what I didn't like."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just alright","review":"Don't expect a fast moving, action packed plot. This is more of a coming-of-age story than a mystery.I found some bits annoying or unbelievable. The mystery around the Hypnosomething book isn't introduced until well into the story. The jumps in chronology are confusing. And a pair of undergrads solve a mystery that lasted hundreds of years?Overall, this is a good first-time effort for the authors. Nelson DeMille says on the back cover that 'if Scott Fitzgerald, Umberto Eco, and Dan Brown teamed up to write a novel, the result would be' this book. Hmmmmm, no."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trumped up - let down","review":"Unfortunately this book did not live up to any of the hype accorded it so generously on either the jacket or in publishers reviews. The story was slow and tedious and any plot momentum was abruptly cut off at the knees by poorly contructed flash back characterisations. Boredom was accentuated by drawn out descriptions of Princetons architecture, sewer system and intiation processes and the read left me thoroughly unsatisfied as a historical thriller or indeed any genre in which it tries to place itself. Follett, Shea and even Dan Brown are certainly much better value than this unfortunate first work. Steer clear unless you suffer from insomnia. (One star was for the potential of the story line which remained unfulfilled)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ponderous, Pretentious, and Annoying","review":"This may be the most overwritten, confused novel I have (attempted to) read in a long time. The authors seem annoyingly captivated by their own Ivy League pedigrees and fill the book with semi-accurate retellings of Princeton traditions. The authors spare no opportunity to turn a simple thought that could be expressed in a few words into a flowery, paragraph-long exposition. There is no mystery and no connection with any of the contrived characters.Contrary to claims on the back cover, if Fitzgerald, Eco, and Brown got together, they would give this garbage an \\"F\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"This, by far, was the worst book I have read in years.

This book purports to be about a code hidden in some obscure ancient book, but its actually about a bunch of pretentious, self-absorbed Princeton students, written by pretentious, self-absorbed Princeton students. If you care about Dod Hall and the Ivy Club, then by all means, read this book. If however, like 99.9% of the population, you don't care about arcane Princeton trivia, skip it. If you prefer your characters undeveloped with minimal plot, this is the book for you. If however, you would rather read a book that's actually ABOUT something or has some characters that connect with the reader, then you will be far better served by almost any other book in the English language, even \\"The DaVinci Code\\", not exactly a literary masterpiece itself.Seriously, this book sucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a letdown","review":"After a promising first quarter, this story simply fell apart. I must say, however, that this book was well promoted. Hopefully the publishers made their $ quickly, before word of mouth killed the sales."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time & money","review":"The book was recommended by a friend who also liked the San Brown mysteries. The book offers nothing suspenseful and doesn't come to the point. 2/3's of the book references things that happen to students at Princeton. I kept hoping the next chapter would start an adventure with a dramatic event, but it took 200 pages to have the first bit of action and then the next 50 pages reverted to student life.I was very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"just awful","review":"This book really is just dreadful. I thought that the Da Vinci Code was a terrible book until I read this and realised that Dan Brown at least has a sense of pace. Badly written, boring story - the publishers should be ashamed to have mentioned The Secret History in comparision to this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unspellable, but very good","review":"So this is a book about a book, in which students run around in under ground tunnels, while the book they are researching also contains under ground tunnels. There is a lot of this kind of symbolic parallelism between the story of the friends @ Princeton and the mysterious book they are trying to crack. I'm not sure I even got all the levels of parallels. Nevertheless, this was definitely worth my time. I'm tired of books that waste my time with lame prose and half baked ideas. Give me something to chew on! And this one did that. Thanks, Caldwell and Thomson, for some truth in advertising..."},{"rating":"1","title":"nothing like dan brown","review":"I believe this book is a best seller because some critic compared the cryptic puzzles and relation to historic events to the work of Dan Brown. This is nothing like it. It is boring, it has no real plot worth reading, and it draws to heavily on a puzzle that in reality no one could crack. Meanwhile all the references to literature and art weigh this book down significantly. It is not an easy, pleasureful summer read by any means...I didn't even finish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont Waste Your Time- No Really","review":"I was so excited when I first began reading this book. It's been a year since the DaVinci Code and I was looking forward to a good mystery with some puzzles mixed with theology. Boy was I dissapointed. There was about 1/3rd or less mystery and excitement, mostly friendship with others on the campus of Princeton. At times wonderfully written, but mostly contrived, confusing, and dull. Even the secret, when finally revealed, was anticlimactic. I felt like saying \\"So WHAT????\\" This was like a good movie concept turned into a \\"B\\" movie because of bad direction and low budget. Sad. It could have been great had the two authors not spent so much time on thier college relationships."},{"rating":"1","title":"YAWWWN !!!","review":"Should be retitled \\"How not to write a book\\"!

Not even close. I gave it a two because I reserve one star for books that are so bad I can't finish them. I had to see what the ancient text revealed and that was the only reason I finished the book. The only reason!I do not recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intricately woven mystery","review":"Although it's popular to compare this novel to DaVinci Code, that's a cheesy flave-of-the-month cop-out, since the books are so vastly different in scope, plot, characterization, and most of all, mystery. A more apt comparison may be The Club Dumas by Arturo Perez-Reverte, upon which the film The Ninth Gate was based. Here we have a love of the source material - ancient manuscripts - a bibliophile's dream combined in the fascinatingly wrought plot. It's an exciting read, filled with surprises, and when the final page is turned, ultimately far more satisfying than any pop-culture trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most boring book I've read in years","review":"I just can't understand how this book could get such good reviews. Comparisons with The Name of Rose are outrageous for a great author such Umberto Eco is. The Da Vinci Code keeps you stuck to the book, the Rule of Four bores you to death with details about college life that are neither relevant to the story nor interesting to anyone who has not been at Princeton. The two young authors have way to go to raise interest in the European public (I invite you to look at the UK reviews). Is there perhaps a riddle in the book that unveil the true story I haven't found and other reviewers here have?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hyper ......HYPE","review":"What in the world was all the hype about? I forced myself to finish reading this because I ran out and purchased it (at an actual physically tangible bookstore to boot!) after a friend's recommendation.

Don't waste your money...but if you must, pick up a copy at a second hand store because that's where my copy's headed."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was okay... But not worth the read.","review":"In short, the book doesn't really get very exciting until the middle, until then we get lengthy histories about the characters, and about the book Hypnerotomachia. And when it does get exciting, the authors \\"fizzle\\" it out with lame flashbacks and side plots that have nothing to do with anything (like Tom and Katie's relationship, rediculously too much information about their relationship which has little to do with anything at all since it doesn't contribute to the plot). I bought this book with the hope of it being like the \\"Da Vinci Code\\" but it is nothing of the sort. The book rambles on and doesn't have any closure, you're left wondering and wanting to know more about the Hypnerotomachia, what the whole story was about. In the end, you will feel ripped off because nothing finishes, it is as if the authors are preparing us for a sequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mixing these genres just doesn't work....","review":"I find myself a little confused on how to write a review for this book. While the read was easy and I found myself looking forward to picking up where I left off, I see now that I was searching for the content this story needed but never developed. Perhaps it was authors stab at trying to write an original Fitzgeraldesque novel and spicing it up with some mystery that would appeal to a broader audience. The only problem is, without writing a thousand page novel, there is no way to get the Fitzgerald type character development they are looking for and still have a solid story unfold, leaving a pretty hollow book with the reader really desiring a lot more. Don't get me wrong, there are glimpses of good writing, perhaps with time the author/s will develop better story telling abilities.Needless to say, I'm surprised at the popularity of this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Read","review":"there are a lot of folks giving this book bad reviews because it is not \\"the da Vinci Code \\". please note: this book is SIMILAR to \\"the da Vinci Code\\" but it is not the same book. thank goodness....if you want \\"the da Vinci Code\\" buy another book by dan brown. if you want to read about solving Renaissance puzzles, then i can not recommend this book enough.excellent first work for the authors."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!!","review":"I have never been compelled to write a review before, however, this book was such a disappointment after all the publicity it had received that I felt it was time for a first. The story line was lacking and never came together properly. There was little suspense, just unfulfilled expectations that it would get better.

It doesn't even deserve one star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brutal","review":"I have never written a review online for any product before, but as soon as I finished this book I felt compelled to put this out there. This was easily the worst book I have ever read. It had so much potential to evolve into something interesting, but alas, it never did. Do not waste your time or money. You can't get either back.

Don't waste your money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"It Might Better Be Titled the Rule of Snooze","review":"Normally, I love these kinds of books. Katherine Neville's, The Eight and the Magic Circle were my favorite books until the Da Vinci Code came along. However, I found this book ponderous. Perhaps if I'd been a Princeton alum or even an Ivy Leaguer, I'd have been more interested. The plotting plods along, the mysterious coding in the Hypnerotomachia Poliphili seems poorly integrated into the text and the love story is stilted. The book is far more plausible in pace and plot than the Da Vinci code, but the thrills simply aren't there.

I just started it today. It seemed interesting at first, but it just didn't go anywhere. It was as though I was getting on an escalator that was going somewhere, but soon discoverered it was just a treadmill, going nowhere. I was so bored after about 40 pages I almost quit right there. But I was determined to give it more of a try. After 106 pages, nothing had changed, nothing had happened. I quit. It was a waste of time.

If you're looking for a book that is in the league of The Da Vinci Code you probably want to keep looking. This book completely lacks originality.

I should have listened to my gut. It took me 2 weeks to get to page 200 which is a rarity for me. This is one of the most boring books I have read.

Negative 5 stars! My copy is for sale on Ebay."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trying too hard","review":"I wanted to like this book, but it just didn't pull me in. More hype than content, and nowhere near as good as Perez-Reverte's, The Club Dumas or The Flanders Panel. A lot of people are trying to get on the DaVinci code bandwagon and I'm afraid we will see a lot more of this sort of story, some good, some bad. The clues in this story were so far fetched that no one but the authors could have found them and the subject matter was too obscure to be entertaining. Good try, but no blue ribbon."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is worthwhile--despite the recent bad reviews","review":"This book is more similar to The Secret History, by Donna Tartt, than anything written by Dan Brown. This book is not a page turner, and the writing wanders around time and space too much. At times I was a bit confused about what was happening when, and there was no reason plotwise for this to happen. Overall the prose is good, though sometimes forced, but there are some lovely and insightful tidbits in it, and the ending is excellent. Although I agree with the reviews that say this book is too long, and the characters are not very round or sympathetic, the key decision (to choose an academic passion or a full life with loved ones) of the main character is very deep and engaging, and this combined with the ending, which I only wish were not fiction, make this book worth reading. With a more discriminating editor, this book would have been a five-star masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy, fun, and very engaging","review":"I think its a bit unfair to keep comparing this to Brown's _Davinci_Code_. It doesn't have the same feel, same pacing, or even the same scale. In fact, I think this one is much more enjoyable. The main character's viewpoint is easily adoptable, and his insights are by turns clever, witty, poignant and melancholy. Very appropos of a thoughtful college grad. The story was a bit predictable -- no real novelty here -- but it's solid, well told, and easy. One of the best summertime read-it-on-the-beach books I've had the pleasure to gulp down. I ate the whole thing in a day, and couldn't recommend it enough to the friends I was vacationing with. You'll love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS IS NOT THE DA VINCI CODE","review":"Well I got hooked on Dan Brown. Read all his books. His thrillers are well-written and interesting. This book, however, is very disappointing. The authors are not to adept at weaving a stort together, and the characters are poorly drawn. Sorry to say that this is not an exciting summer read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whether compared to DVC or not - DON'T BOTHER !","review":"What the heck - I read it all the way through. Sure enough, it was a disappointment, and not worth the time. (Gee, maybe I should have scanned some Amazon.com reviews first and looked at the overall rating...) Whether you \\"compare\\" it to The DaVinci Code or not, it really doesn't even stand up well on it's own. The plot's implausible, you never really connect with any of the characters enough to care about them, and, unless you're a rather immature high school or college boy, it's basically pretty silly. How did it rate \\"Best Seller\\" status? Hype, I guess. Sure glad I got it from my library and saved some $. (Sorry Amazon.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"These guys aren't prodigies","review":"I had high hopes with this book. For a book that took several years to write, it certainly didn't have much to show for the effort. The actual deciphering of the code is so anticlimactic, and the final secret so blase that I almost groaned in disappointment.A lot of people liked Da Vinci Code, but I liked Angels and Demons better (both by one author). So if that means anything, so be it. This book doesn't come anywhere close. The life described in Princeton is made to sound normal, but for most of us that didn't go to Ivy League schools, it doesn't give a lot to identify with. Isn't that especially important when the book is in first person narrative? All the while I'm reading the \\"I\\" of the book, I'm thinking, \\"thats not me...\\"So... nice try guys. How about a little more meat on the plate next time you come up with a serving?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Incomprehensible","review":"This is an incomprehensible book that two Ivy League graduates have written about two Ivy League students trying to de-cipher an incomprehensible book - the Hypnerotomachia. The authors note often that many scholars gave up in frustration trying to figure out what the Hypnerotomachia was about. I suspect that many more people have tossed this book aside in frustration after trying unsuccessfully to follow the story line and find some reason to care about the main characters. Aside from the plot the book reads like it was written by someone who had spent too much time in an English Lit class, trying to ooze meaning out of every last word and phrase. Perhaps they have purposely written such an impenetrable book, hoping to create their own Hypnerotomachia that people will spend centuries trying to understand. Perhaps there is a secret hidden deep within its pages. If so, good luck to the \\"gentle readers\\" who try to figure this one out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rather complex","review":"If you are expecting something along the lines of Dan Brown or National Treasure, this is not it. If you have some familiarity with the Humanist era, especially Italian history, the story is intersting. The twists and turns, both of the current day story and the history, can be difficult to follow. Some of the ramblings of the primary character almost seem to have a \\"stream of conciousness\\" feeling, also making it a bit difficult to follow. Still, if you are interested in the era, and in DaVinci Code like stories, it is worthwhile to finish."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth reading","review":"I saw this book on the bestsellers rack and bought it on a whim. The Rule of Four gets off to a slow start and often drifts from the action to give lengthy and often boring descriptions of each characters background. Where the book really starts to pick up is towards the end of the story, where a few twists happen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what it seems","review":"If you are looking for the next Da Vinci Code, don't look here. Despite what the book promotes itself as, it is not a high speed thriller. This is a confusing, frustrating, and boring book. If you really want to read a good thriller try \\"The Genesis Code\\" by John Case, otherwise just save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I read the Da Vinci Code and Angels and Demons in two days.I've been reading the Rule of Four for a week now, and it is so boring that I don't think I'll be able to finish it.

What a waste of my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"a product of hype and good marketing","review":"This is a mediocre book that seems to have benefitted from good marketing and a lot of hype in the wake of The Da Vinci Code.I do not believe the book bears any comparison to the works of Dan Brown, even though it had the plot potential. To me, the narrative seemed disjointed and there were many pages of what I would characterize as just fill, words that really didn't advance the story or help us to know the characters better.Unfortunately, before I got to the end, which to me bordered on being silly, I realized I actually didn't care much how it all turned out.

Just read the da Vinci Code again, im sure it will be entirely more entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh no! a lame attempt to the Da Vinci Code remake","review":"I concur with the others in that this book is a total waste of your money and your time. It took a great deal of effort to finish it. I bought it on the Helsinki-Stockholm night ferry thinking this would make wonderful reading hours after having finished the outstanding Da Vinci Code and Angels and Demons from Dan Brown.Sure, when I read the reviews on the backcover I was mislead into thinking it was going to be exciting and that it was on a Da Vinci code class. I knew it was going to be a copycat attempt of some unknown authors into trying to cash out and tag along the success of truly interesting books (Da Vinci Code). WRONG!!!! the story was slow, the plot quite boring, the \\"code\\" was lame.I don't know why I even bother to write the review. Oh yes! it is to warn others from making the same mistake!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the hype","review":"I bought this book based on the rave reviews it received, especially compared to Dan Brown's works. Sorry - this book doesn't hold a candle to Brown's works. I had to read over 3/4 of the book to find any excitement at all. It was fair to compare it to Umberto Eco's works - just as boring. If you want excitement, check out anything by Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child."},{"rating":"1","title":"a total borefest!","review":"this book is a total borefest. this is boredom in its book form. this is nothing compared to dan brown's books. it lacks the excitement, the intrigues, the historical accounts, the descriptive narrative, the breath-taking plot. this book is a perfect cure for insomnia"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even close to Dan Brown's novels...","review":"In my opinion, it would be really hard to write a book as good as either the Da Vinci Code or the Angels and Demons, but this book didn't even come close. The only reason I didn't put it down after reading the first half because I like to finish the books I start. The first half was boooooring! I wanted to read about the secrets hidden in the 500 year old book not about life on campus at Princeton. And I had to go back some pages a few times too as I got confused about who was who? It did get better in the second half, a little more exciting, but I'm glad it wasn't any longer :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"most overrated book of the decade","review":"I am sorry for the time I spent reading this book hoping that it will change at some point.."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"Okay, I haven't quite finished the book.

The character development is forced and comes from nowhere, leading to nowhere. The dust jacket's comparison to Umberto Eco is offensive. Dan Brown is a tolerable writer but at least he's entertaining where as these guys have produced a first rate yawner. This is just simple a boring book and in the end nothing really happens.Don't believe the hype.

It is a boring book. When something finally does happen to a charater you don't care. There are times when you don't know if you are reading about present time or history.

I do not recommend this book.If you want good books read Dan Brown or Vince Flynn."},{"rating":"1","title":"No comparison to The DaVinci Code","review":"Do not waste your time or money on this book.

I could have read the last 50 pages and gotten what I did out of the entire book. I thought the ending was ok but boy what a dissappointment the rest was.Don't waste your time.

Boy, was I wrong.The first 100 pages are filled with flashbacks that are not relevant to the story. I nearly put it down for good but it started to get better at that point. However, the author only devotes about 75 pages to the mystery of the ancient book the main characters are trying to decipher. The last 100 pages were somewhat more interesting.Althought the premise is good, the author trys to combine a Davinci Code-like plot with a coming of age story-it doesn't work, believe me.

It has it's own right. It's not as fast-paced as DVC. It's purely narrative. There are some part of the book where Tom Sullivan the narrator drifts away. There are some parts that are amusing, there are some parts that are dragging. And the mystery of the Hypnerotomachia doesn't seem to be a mystery at all. Maybe it's just me, it probably didn't meet my standards because I expected it to be high-octane and breathless like DVC or A&D;, based from what the advertisements said.Readers who are patient should read this, but if you are looking for high-octane action or fast-paced controversialthriller, this book is not for you. It's a light read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"This book, which promises to be like a Dan Brown Novel, is not even close.

It is about four guys at Princeton. The book repeats itself over and over agian. Something shocking happens, like a murder, and it isn't mentioned again for a few chapters.

And that sums up the book for me: boring and uninteresting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Send this story to Dan Brown for a re-write!","review":"Just finished this book -- interesting topic, but written horribly. No sub-plots whatsoever. Many chapters are written as a stream-of-conscienceness and could actually be removed. The authors attempt to introduce some form of suspense in the final few chapters, but fail in the end to satisfactorily resolve anything, since is ends with the obvious platform setting for next book without regard to appropriately finishing this one. Not even the codebreaking is explained in an interesting way.

Well, it wasn't. If the writers had bothered to spend as much time developing a story and interesting characters as they did going on and on describing Princeton Univeristy, it may have been a good read. As it stands, it's pretty much a love letter to Princeton that digresses occasionally to tell a poorly conceived story about uncovering secrets contained in a Renaissance era manuscript by a couple of boring undergrads with all the sophistication of a Hardy Boys mystery.Stick with Dan Brown or if you really like to read, Umberto Eco.

And how does anyone involved in the marketing of this tedious, painfully slow snooze have the nerve to call it suspense? The comparison to Da Vinci Code would be laughable, if it wasn't snookering so many people into a mind-numbingly dull experience. DVC may have all sorts of flaws, but it sure was a breathless page-turner. While Rule of Four has an intriguing premise (albeit the fourth such novel to hit stores this year), the execution is terrible. I would not have finished it if I wasn't so curious to discover why it was so well reviewed. I kept thinking, surely there will be some brilliant twist--something!--to make this garbage worthwhile. Alas, there wasn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do NOT fall into this marketing trap","review":"I'll keep it short: A useless, tedious book the publishers/authors threw on the market, disguised as a \\"Da Vinci Code\\"-type thriller, to milk the market hype.

I was very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting Premise; Bad Writing","review":"I am stunned to read people comparing this book to Umberto Eco. It is insulting to Eco. This book reads like an undergraduate writing project. It has an interesting premise, but that is about it. The writing is dull and the characters are wooden and not really likable. I know they don't re-make books like they do movies, but if a good writer re-made this book it might actually be interesting.I applaud the authors for getting this published and making money on it.

The biggest problem is that the coming-of-age story is banal in the extreme: poorly written and tedious. The literary thriller part is reasonably intriguing but you really have to slog through a lot of other meaninglessness to enjoy it. In fact, I skipped entire sections towards the end and didn't miss anything at all. The fact that the authors are young and intelligent really shows: the writing is by turns erudite (the thriller parts) and sophmoric (the personal parts). Overall I would not recommend this book; I desperately wanted to enjoy it but was hugely disappointed. By the way, I think this book merits 2 stars; I gave it 1 to bring the overall average more in line with what I think it deserves."},{"rating":"1","title":"yuck!","review":"This is the most boring, poorly written book I have read in a long time.

What a mess - who cares about endless boring details of the Princeton experience?? Choppy, repetitive, confusing, unbelievable circumstances and poor story telling combined with a story that has no payoff - I get angry thinking of how I wasted my time with this book because of any comparisons to Dan Brown. Did these guys not have an editor or anyone who read this prior to printing? Avoid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull","review":"I'm embarrassed to admit that I only read this because of my enjoyment of The Da Vinci Code. The mystery and/or suspense is completely lost with useless descriptions of college life. There are too many male characters, and most of the time it's hard to remember who they are and what they have to do with the story. The so-called romance is a ridiculous diversion that seems to suit no other purpose but to fill up pages and include a female. I had to force myself to finish this book. This is not a must-read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Such a Letdown","review":"I saved this book for the holiday season. Curled up by the fire, I could hardly wait....good thing I had a stack of backups. If you went to Princeton (and are a man) I think you might get a kick out of it. The majority of the book is devoted to the development of the relationship of the two main characters during their time at Princeton undergrad. The mystery that had been billed as the compelling part of this book was lacking, uninspiring, and short. I had to force myself to keep reading hoping that it would be worth the effort in the end--it was not. There are so many books out there in this genre that will give you so much more enjoyment."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Disappointment","review":"I was totally disappointed while reading this book. I kept hoping that it would get exciting. As soon as the book would pick up another section would appear that was wordy, overly descriptive and even boring at times.The romantic part of the story could have been good but that was also lacking in interest. All in all - read The Da Vinci Code and leave this one in the bookstores.

I was quite disappointed. For first-time authors, the pair's prose is beautiful, yet not verbose. They found the balance between Brown and Bronte. This is all good and well, except for the plot. I spent most of the book waiting for a good plot twist. I got one....in the last 30 pages of the book.

The best comes in the middle of the book where the mystery begins to unfold and the characters address the riddles. It is at this point that this book most closely resembles The DaVinci Code.However, the ending ruins all of the gains of the rest of the book. The authors resort to a cliche so well-worn that I am surprised the editors accepted it. In a book with a different tone, it may have gone over well. But in this book it falls flat and takes you completely out of the narrative. The characters' final actions make little sense given the cursory treatment of their motivations in the preceding portion.Ultimately the clever mystery can not overcome the ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't believe the hype...","review":"...on the dust cover.

The gameplay is strategic: you fight your way up to spawn points and capture them by taking out nearby enemies and then standing on them for a few seconds. There is a system of \\"tickets\\", and the first team to lose all their tickets loses. Since you are always losing tickets, you slow that loss down by taking spawn points and killing enemies. You speed up your loss of tickets by losing spawn points, letting the enemy gain ground, or dying. This game also has a class system with medics, engineers, assault, scout, and anti-tank. Throw in the vehicles and you have limitless possibilities. The only downfall of this game is that it needs a pretty good computer.

Using teamwork against to take over positions on the battlefield and using several different weapons to do so, and up to 64 players at the same time.

I have literally quit playing other games and spent all my time online with this one. The strengths are the diversity of the options that you can play as, and the simplicity of the interface and commands. All of the vehicles are controlled with the same keys and the infantry all use a simple point and shoot firing system. For those who want more complex, the radio message function keys can get fairly complicated. Trying to remember the various combinations to request support or warn other players has gotten me shot a few times. The only other caution that I have is that to fly the airplanes, you really should have a joystick. It can be done without, but it's difficult. Overall, this is a thoroughly enjoyable shooter, with many elements of stategy that surprise the user.

The envioronments you play in are very close to what those battlefields really looked like.

The controls are relatively easy, the play is outstanding, and the graphics are top-notch.Now, as other reviewers have said, this game is very very heavy duty. You will need at the minimum a gigahertz processor, with a pretty heavy duty video card. I have a 2.26 ghz p4 with a radeon 8500 128 ddr memory and it runs very smooth.I am totally addicted to this game. My one complaint about this game is the lack of voice communication. I understand that the game was network-intensive enough already, but I think voice would make this game sooo much better.Still a 5 star game though!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"BF1942 is a GREAT GAME!!","review":"I have to say that Battlefield 1942 is a great game!!BYW- It does work on Win 2000 contrary to what it says here!"},{"rating":"1","title":"OK, this isn't an honest review because.....","review":"It locks up my machine 80% of the time.To start with after you install the game you have to jump through a bunch of hoops at File Planet etc. to get a patch.After all that I have to reboot 3 out of 4 times starting the game.

It comes as all other hoses do, wrapped in a tight circle. The problem is that it never relaxes and while you are working, it tries to roll itself back up into a tight little circle. This hose gets wrapped up and caught on itself because of this so when you try to stretch it out to its supposed length, it is nearly impossible to do. God forbid you are trying to use two hoses at once for two separate guns. They just entangle with each other and double the problem.I would rather lug around a heavier rubber hose than deal with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great!","review":"A great hose for any application.

The 1/4\\" hose is great for most air nailers and is especially handy if you do any detail work.

I attach these hoses to heavier duty rubber style and then put the compressor where I don't need to hear it all day long. They are really light weight and easy to keep clean and kink free.

I guess because of that I expected more from this commentary. I simply did not find much new in this work. Most of Dr. Witherington's observations are what any astute layperson would arrive at on their own. If you are new to reading Mark then this book would probably be of some help in that it will introduce you to major themes and ideas. On the other hand, if you are moderately conversant with modern Markan scholarship, and you are looking for more insight, as well as a more detailed reading of the text, you would do better to look elsewhere. In particular I would suggest either Morna Hooker's superb \\"The Gospel According to St. Mark\\", or Ched Myer's challenging \\"Binding the Strong Man, A Political Reading of Mark's Story of Jesus\\". Both offer much more serious scholarship and research."},{"rating":"1","title":"An insult of a book! Put the tree back in the forest!","review":"Gross errors throughout this unfortunate book. Errors range from the innocuous and incorrect spellings to grammar mistakes to awkward and inappropriate translations.

'Evitalo como si fuera una enfermedad.'"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Start, Bad Finish","review":"The book started off well, but it ended badly. The author presented himself as objective, but in reality he was obviously biast against Prophet Muhammad. In the beginning he was fair to the Prophet and was apparant that he did alot of homework for the book, at least in the beginning. But as the book went on, the author dove into speculation and conjecture w/o any solid evidence to back his claims. His attacks on Prophet Muhammad were baseless and showed his lack of knowledge on the Prophet himself, but only showed his biast against Islam which wasnt apparant in the beginning. I recommend Karen Armstrong's \\"Muhammad\\" It was much more fair and balanced on the Prophet than many western writers choose to be, propelling the myths of the Prophet Muhammad for thier mostly Christain audiences."},{"rating":"1","title":"Understanding Islam requires understanding Christianity","review":"The biggest problem here is that Phipps does not discuss the Christian and Jewish sources of Muhammad's revelation. Muhammad thought he was a prophet in the Jewish sense and when the Jews of Arabia rejected him he decided to pretend he was more a follower of Abraham than were the Jews. It is clear here that both Islam and Christianity were attempts to steal the religion of the Jews and make them unbelievers despite their pretense of belief. This has great meaning today when Islam is the enemy of the Christian West and of Israel. Islam is a Judaeo-Christian heresy and not a religion in its own right.The Jews have suffered from Christians and Muslims for the same reason: they are made to be bad believers, yet Christians have in fact become polytheistic with their Trinity and Muslims have become Jew-haters and bible distorters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you all serious?","review":"This book is incredibly dull and unerotic (and don't say it wasn't meant to be a sexy novel; just look at the cover and front page). The two lead characters, Wynne and Paula, have unbelievably charmed work lives and are supposed to be sophisticated business women. Yet they show the emotional maturity of 12 year olds. POTENTIAL SPOILER: Paula freaks out and won't forgive Wynne for having a one night stand with her while Wynne is still living with someone she doesn't love and is going to dump anyway. The road back to love is fraught with dull lesbian drama."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be honest people!","review":"I read so many reviews about this book and find they are overly exuberant at best. This is NOT one of Macgregor's best efforts. I am sorry I trusted these reviews and spent $9.99 on this weak story. I found myself very confused about which character she was writing about half the time. If you would like to read a well written novel by this author, I would recommend trying the Shaken series or the House on Sandstone. It would be nice to start seeing some honesty in these reviews when we as consumers are spending our hard earned money on these stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting, Informative, Trivia Book","review":"This interesting trivia-style book discusses basic odds and chances written in an easy question-and-answer format. Subjects range all over the map, from liklihood of marital success and crime victimization, to turning gray by the time you are 50. There are questions about health problems, the workplace, attracting the opposite sex, length of athletic careers, etc. In short, interesting information attractively presented, though a few answers have changed over time since this book arrived in 1990. My brother read from these pages during a recent dinner, and we had fun chiming in with our guesses (sometimes debating the book's answers). This is a fun and readable look at many questions from everyday life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely thunderous","review":"I understand why the previous reviewer didn't like this album; this is the kind of music that pounds so hard that it shakes the fillings right out of your teeth. (That said, there is also some gorgeous cello and pump organ work on this album). This album suffers quite unfairly by starting with its weakest track, which is indeed almost like machine shop noise; I don't know what the band was thinking. When I first bought this album, I almost took it back. But I finally listened all the way through, and was converted -- in fact, over time Nucleus has grown to be one of the albums I listen to most often. Skip over that first track, and you'll find the rest of the album is absolutely killer, melodically thunderous work with crashing mellotron and crunching bass guitar. Very heavy stuff, and very well played."},{"rating":"2","title":"So worth it!","review":"I have wanted the Wustof Culinar knives for many years, and finally decided to start with the 8-inch Chef's Knife and add as I go along.

The band is composed of 7 Italians, who I believe are from the Florence area. The lead singer, who has a strong voice, writes all of the songs, plays guitar, and on looks alone could fit into Primus. There are two other guitars, one of which is alternately ditched for a piano/synthesizer. There is also one main drummer and one percussionist as well as a bassist. The infectious enthusiasm of this group comes across clearly on cd, and is wonderful to listen to, even if you don't speak the language. I would highly reccommend this cd to anyone who likes World sounds, like Manu Chao, Cafe Tacuba, Ozomatli or even the Gipsy Kings. I promise that you will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"They Skipped CAB 3 and Went Straight for CAB 4!","review":"I have been a fusion fan since the 70s.

L size is 35inches extended 2inches, just right for me when empty stomach but tight when full stomach.I tried them on in swimming pool.

Donovan, the Scottish minstrel, has often been accused of being a Dylan wannabe. \\"Fairy Tale\\", recorded in 1965, proves Donovan to have carved-out a unique musical idenity before the folk rock explosion in the USA. All of the material is strong and the classics are \\"Sunny Googe Street\\", \\"Try For the Sun\\", \\"Universal Soldier\\", and of course, \\"Colors.\\" Donovan went on to enormous popularity in the States with his cosmic mish-mash of world music. He even had three quarters of Led Zep as a back-up band before that band was formed.

They are VERY flimsy and are difficult to snap shut because the two sides don't really match up well on any of the cases.

I will probably be throwing these away as soon as I find better ones.

Snoop Dogg was higher than fifteen geriatrics with glaucoma and still spun a freestyle far superior to anything Durst could write (most of Durst's verses were spent saying \\"baby\\" at the end of each line, it's just sad.)

Their cover of Behind Blue Eyes is disgraceful. First, they took out the 'heavy' part and lyrics and replaced it with that L.I.M.P. Discover crap. Then they add that ridiculous last verse with new lyrics that in no way fit in with the theme of the song. I understand trying to add your own spin to a cover and not just playing it 'by the numbers' but this song is a complete slap in the face to the Who. To top things off, they didn't even spell Pete's name right in the credits. It's TownsHend, not Townsend. Rumour has it that the band only picked the song because they wanted to cover an old hit and it was the easiest one to cover out of a list of potential songs. In conclusion, WORST BAND EVER. Listen to real music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Results May Suck","review":"I could talk about how bad this album is and how much Limp Bizkit sucks, but it seems dozens of people have already made their point across pretty nicely. Instead, I have a comparison to make of everyone's most hated front-man. You know who Fred Durst reminds me of? A 21st century version of Vanilla Ice. Like Vanilla, Fred tries so hard to have a \\"thug\\" image that he ends up being a parody of himself. Also, like Vanilla, he can't rap for his life (or sing for that matter). And lastly, Fred has made the worst music today since, you guessed it, Vanilla Ice. Come to think of it, have you ever seen both Fred Durst and Vanilla Ice in the same area at the same time? Hmmmmm..

No wait, that was the smell of crap coming from the radio playing a Limp Bizkit song."},{"rating":"1","title":"I HATE THIS CD!","review":"I FREKIN HATE THIS CD I HOPE FRED DURST WOULD GET HIT BY A TRAIN SO HE WOULDS STOP MAKING THESE TERRIBLE RECORDS-PLEASE FRED JUST STOP AND MAKE THIS LIMP BIZKIT CURSE ON THE WORLD STOP NOW!!!!

The bottom line is i used to like limp bizkit, (before i had any knowledge of what real music was) but now i really, truely don't.

I listened to it through a couple times, and then tried to sell it. Suprise suprise, noone would buy it. Theyre not Limp Bizkit anymore at all. They used to melt hard rock and rap in a good way, but now they sound more like the dave matthews band than they do Limp Bizkit. Not just musically, lyrically this album is horrible too. \\"Id love to sniff on them panties now\\" and \\"I took a lot of crap as a little boy\\" I mean..just awful.

If you are looking for the original testosterone driven limp bizkit, may I suggest buying one of their different albums.

I understand some people listen to these noise polluters when they are \\"angry\\" or need to be \\"pumped up\\" might i suggest Rage Against the Machine, Alice in Chains, or Audioslave for the anger management, and possibly some GNR,early Aerosmith, or Van Halen(with David Lee Roth) for the energy kick.

Fred can't rap (...) and he needs to stop trying because it's really annoying. a great CD is korn's first CD it's their best and even they went thru their changes but they're still good. you might also wanna try the deftones first and second CD's b/c they are some great CD's. bottom line is limp bizkit is ok for a few songs here and there, their first CD is the best all around besides that just get the good songs off your friends and don't waste the money on the CD's."},{"rating":"1","title":"mmmmmmm.....","review":"OK, where do i start? I first heard about Limp Bizkit after the success of 'significant other', which was a phenomenal record. They turned into a bit of a pop band with their 'chocolate starfish' record, gettin all these hit singles, yet i still gave them upmost respect. This album is a little hard to judge. I do give them some credit for trying, but really, the days of the bizkit are over!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I have to agree with the majority","review":"Its terrible, in most aspects. There are three good songs, the rest just suck.Eat you aliveBuild a BridgeBehind blue eyesThose are the only good songs. Limp Bizkit is the biggest example of how alot of bands start out good and just get progressively worse, never rising back up again. 3 Dollar bill ya'll was awesome, Significant Other was great, Hot Dog was \\"eh\\" and the new one is just bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could There Be A Worse Band Or Frontman??","review":"This cd sucks, I dont even own it but Limp Bizkit has to be one of the absolute worst bands to ever emerge. Fred Durst lives in a fantasy world, this guy likes to think he gets all the women. If anybody actually watched a show at the Playboy Mansion a few years back that had this loser as a guest, WOW it was just flat out BAD. Here is this loser with no talen what so ever trying to \\"mack\\" i guess thats the \\"cool\\" word on the playmates and they looked at this guy like he was a complete and utter idiot, not to mention how bad they all made him look when he tried. That was my comic relief for thet night.Anybody that bought this, owns this, or even likes this band should be drug out and shot."},{"rating":"1","title":"LIMP BIZKIT SUCKS D*CK","review":"If you want real talent and some heavy metal check out Black Label Society not this disgrace to genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is sad","review":"More trashy rap rock from Limp Dyck.

And trust me, they sound much better playing it than Limp Bizkit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh no!","review":"I don't love limp. I do however like them, despite what my friends and most members of the music community say. I have the other three discs and they are all good enough to keep around. So, when this one came out, I picked it up. Boo! I can't even defend them anymore. I understand that they want to be a serious rock band but all of Fred's public stunts make them more of a show than a band. And what, was he madly in love with Britney Spears? Get over it already. I enjoy the new guitarist very much and he comes from snot, a band I really like. These aren't limp bizkit songs. I don't recommend them to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"ANOYING!

A bit closer to the old Bizkit. Too bad some people wouldn't know good music even if it bit them in the face. Definately pick it up if you like some good gutteral screaming and awesome music. Check out the guitarist (ex-snot guitarist) too, totally awesome. Enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened","review":"I am huge Bizkit fan, but not anymore.

I mean, all of a sudden he's bragging about who he's been sleeping with, who he wishes he was with (his pathetic Wayne's World come ons to Halle Berry), and whining about the pratfalls of being a famous person. On a Philly radio station, he unleashed a string of obscenities at the interviewer after said DJ asked about the less than overwhelming acceptance of \\"Results.\\" (\\"There will be the smart people who will appreciate me and c-s-kers like you that won't.) Well, stop worrying Fred, you'll be hanging out with the likes of Winger real soon.This is possibly the whiniest album this side of Dashboard Confessional. Fred, give it up. The teenage mooks that thought the juvenile butt joke rants on \\"Chocolate Starfish\\" were the height of rebelliousness have grown up; and covering \\"Behind Blue Eyes\\" doesn't make you an artiste. Now get outta my face, ya blubbering slob."},{"rating":"1","title":"Limp Bizkit is the worst rock band of all time","review":"It was almost as if Fred Durst was sitting around in a studio saying,\\"I wonder just how bad we can suck without being struck down by lightning for bringing one more evil onto the earth. When my friend played this album for me i sat in awe suddenly realizing what it meant to be \\"the worst band of all time\\". For the next few nights i laid awake in my bed wondering if it was a joke and i was supposed to be laughing, maybe Fred Durst thought it would be funny to try and make the worst music possible and see how many people would actually buy it. Or maybe its just a simple case of the apocolypse. I still havent figured this out. I suppose the only reason this cd hasnt been made as illegal as heroin is The Who cover in which Fred Durst trys to gather sympathy from the masses and not be shot for crimes against humanity. Please do not buy this cd and encourage Fred to (gulp) make another album. ahhhh!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute sh*t","review":"So one day, I'm at the movies, I was buying some snacks when I get a phone call, it's my friend, he recommends some Limp Bizkit! I told him that I never like LB, however, he told me that I should check out Results May Vary, he said it was their heaviest abd most mature album, I still wasn't convinced, so he had me borrow it from one of his friends, So I take it to my house, told him I would give it back in about an hour and tell him what I think, so I take a look at the front cover, and simply looking at it I say to myself, \\"Most mature??\\" so I give it a listen, WHAT A PIECE OF SH*T!!!!, It's not the most mature album (all their albums are probably VERY immature) and HEAVIEST!!!! HA HA HA HA!!! This was nothing more than a joke played on me, I don't recommend this piece of crap to anyone, the biggest problem with Limp Bizkit, is Limp Bizkit itself! Bad album, I'll leave it at that"},{"rating":"1","title":"results may not vary","review":"fred durst, you're glory days are over, so quit, no wonder this record was sold for 59 cents on amazon sellers, coz this is simply dull, i mean it sounds the same like their previous records, nu metal died in the year 2001 or 2002. so stop pretending that you guys still rock coz u don't. nu metal days very annoying............"},{"rating":"1","title":"God, This Really Sucks...","review":"Limp Bisquick have done it again. Seriously, I though \\"Chocolate Starfish\\" was bad enough with its generic and recycled riffs used over and over. That album was bad, but this? This is just a sin against nature.Here's an overview of some songs on this record:\\"Eat You Alive\\" - Retarded lyrics and mundane music.\\"Gimme The Mic\\" - Obviously a Beastie Boys ripoff.\\"Almost Over\\" - Fred needs to find a thesaurus and use words other than 'little'.\\"Red Light Green Light\\" - Wow, I almost blew a gasket when hearing this. Snoop Dogg teams up with Durst on this one.\\"Behind Blue Eyes\\" - Fred Durst should be stoned to death for butchering a classic. Have you seen the video? Fred Durst and Halle Berry are just French-kissing enough to piss off the Who.Man, these guys suck. Trent Reznor was right. Fred Durst is the scum of the earth and this album proves it. Definitely beats \\"St. Anguish\\" to the worst of 2003 list.(...)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Crap","review":"Limp Bizkit is just a group of losers trying to be cool who end up looking stupid. This album sucks, they practically ruined a The Who classic (Behind Blue Eyes), and Fred Durst tries to be cool, and fails miserably."},{"rating":"1","title":"BIG disappointment.","review":"I bought this album hoping that it would be better or at least something worth listening to like Significant Other, or Chocolate Starfish. But no, I was v. disappointed after listening to it. If I could, I would return the CD and get refund. There are probably only a couple of songs in this album that are worth listening to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Baby?","review":"That would appear to be Fred's new favourite word. Gone are the F bombs he was dropping all over their other cds and now he's saying baby, I can't decide which one's worse, just listen to Red Light to see what I mean. I didn't think they could get worse but this cd proves it. The other guitarist from Snot made a much better choice in joining Soulfly. Anyways this cd is all uninspired crap that fails to provoke even an ounce of thought or emotion. The biggest low point was the cover of \\"Behind Blue Eyes\\". What were The Who thinking letting LB cover that? Not only can Fred not sing but adding the spelling of Limp Bizkit (sorry I forgot they're not limpbizkit?) into the song was just a slap in the face to music. Don't waste your money on this cd, if I could give it negative stars I would."},{"rating":"1","title":"how far they have fallen","review":"once upon a time a long time ago they used to be my favorite band right when i started gettting into heavy metal and stuff but soon i grew to dislike them heavily, know there are about two songs by them i like. Fred Durst is widely despised and doesn't care as he keeps producing music that no one will by. This cd is awful do not buy it Fred Durst stop humilating yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the hell?","review":"Man, It's hard to count how many times me and my friends have dissed limp biskit. They just suck. They try to sound like metal on this album. On the eat you alive they try to sound like pantera by screaming. Nobody can top the great brutalness in pantera. Otherwise limp bizkit sucks and fred durst is a poser. He's also stupid. In gimmie the mic, he says there is no room for posers, it's time for some real performers. Well he is just dissing himself. Do us all a favor and get real metal. you know Black sabbath, Metallica, Megadeth, Pantera, Led zeppelin, acdc, van halen , etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Greatest Band Ever Assembled","review":"Really Wow great music from a legendary band, what garbage MTV sellouts and fakes.

Limp Bizkit bites.After the song \\"rollin\\" every other song they have ever came out with ... sucks. This review is also coming from someone from their own home town ...Their marketing plan to get you to buy the album ??? Cuss as much as possible .. thats pretty sad and obvious.

I could be wrong but I doubt it !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry Fred You Suck","review":"Man Fred try everthing and suck anyway. This Kind of Music Sucks if you tell this is cool ypu suck too. so If you Watch Headbanger you will see True Metal not this wannabe metal guys like Korn, Good Charllote,Avril,New Found Glory and Hoobastand. This Why Metal don't take serious because this Stupid Punk Kid If you wanna hear real Music Hear NEVERMORE, Hatebreed, arch Enemy, In Flames, Killswitch Engage, The Haunted and Evergrey this are the best there is and the best there was and the best ever will be ^m^(oo)^m^"},{"rating":"1","title":"Results didn't vary, this album is A LET DOWN!","review":"No one is a bigger limp fan than me. Yes the band has gotten older and wants to be recognized as a TRUE rock band, but too many artists try to change their sound, to show how good they think they can be. Besides eat you alive, there isn't one song with the same energy as we have come to expect from Fred and the boys. Artists forget what got them famous and why we love their music. To wait as long as we had to for this album makes it all the worse. Talk about slow songs, I didn't buy a simon and Garfunkel cd, I thought I was buyong LIMP BIZKIT. Where is the energy Fred? Where is the lyrics besides the word \\" Baby\\" every other song. Big let down dude. I can only hope there is a remix album , that speeds these S L O W songs up. Get back what made you or at least make an album sooner. Im going to throw this one out and pretend it was never made. Don't buy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"You need less testosterone and less beer, Fred.","review":"Lame. That's the best I can describe Limp Bisquik's new album. Even the front cover design has the typical macho male boorishness we've come to despise. I know Kurt Cobain certainly despised the type of machismo Durst oozes. In all irony, can you believe Durst actually has a tattoo of Cobain on his chest? Neither could I, but on VH1, he showed it. As for the CD... well, Durst ain't called Limp for nothing."},{"rating":"1","title":"The suckiest sucks that ever sucked","review":"Lets make this short and sweet. Fred has very awful vocals in this one, can,t growl, scream and his melodic singing in worse than what you get in a karoeoke bar. The guitarring without Wes(he is not that great inside of Limp Bikit eitherway) is just below bland. Bass and drumming is as good as nothing, not special at all. DJ should just perform at parties and weddings. Song are just bad to worst. Avoid this album or band."},{"rating":"1","title":"This sucks","review":"The only good song is \\"Behind Blue Eyes\\". Everything else sucks. Want real music? Listen to Lacuna Coil, Slayer, Metallica (even the new stuff's better than this crap!), Stone Temple Pilots, Judas Priest, Iron Maiden, Suffocation, Crimson Thorn, Strapping Young Lad, Lamb Of God, Arch Enemy, Dimmu Borgir, Old Man's Child, Ozzy/Black Sabbath, AC/DC, etc., etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"yo bro!jock rock man!","review":"Ahhh man this album rules bro!this is the perfect sound track to smashing beer cans on my head a playing some hardcore football.

Telling people who conclude that a rating of 1 star is warranted for this CD that their opinion is not welcome is about as NON-objective as you can get. If you love it: fine; but how about explaining WHY you loved it, instead of getting all defensive (just like the thousands of other people who review their favorite 'artists' whose work has been bashed [Clay Aiken, Britney, et cetera]). Don't you think then you may be able to persuade potential listeners to buy this CD, which you obviously think is a perfect work of art judging by the five-star rating? It is perfect in your opinion... right? Then explain why your opinion differs from all these folks who gave it a one star review. Thank You."},{"rating":"1","title":"Limp bizkit sucks yet again","review":"Just when you hear the band the album blows. yeah, i actually have listen to this album twice and it is the worst piece of crap i have ever listen to. The only half-decent song is eat you alive. No wonder he is getting garbage thrown at him on stage because he is. He should go to prison for doing the who song \\"behind blue eyes\\" and ban from copying lyrics off of another artists and cds.Oh yeah, go listen to better music like QOTSA, Linkin Park, Audioslave, or Korn way better than this junk from the durst factory."},{"rating":"1","title":"Limp Bizkit Is Done For","review":"To get the record straight, I actually like the first three Limp Bizkit albums, and despise the remix album. I thought that after having a few years to work on their next album that it would be at least as good as the first three, if not better. However, I was totally wrong. This is one of the worst albums I have ever listened to. The \\"lyrics\\" are mostly cursing repeated over and over. Yes, I know that Fred used swearing repeatedly in the other albums, but at least the swearing fit into place there. This album is also very mellow and boring compared to the last three. I think I know why this album failed. If I can remember correctly, I think Limp Bizkit put this entire album together in only one month according to a special I saw on MTV. That's not enough time to make a good album. The bottom line is, I would not recommend buying this album at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Too Bad","review":"I had my doubts, but this isnt that bad an album. While most disagree with me, i liked Red Light-Green Light. My other favorites are Eat You Alive, Gimme The Mic, Build a Bridge, Lonely World, and Phenomenon.

THEN BUY THIS SH**!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic","review":"This album is not worth your money, Limp Bizkit is supossed to be Rap Metal or something like that but to me this is just Rap and hip hop, Fred Durst is not an artist to me he's a great bussines man but not an artist. All he's doing is trying to make money with the \\"fans\\" So don't but this album is pathetic don't make the same mistake i made go ahead and but Slipknot, Slayer or even Korn is better than this.

There is no other way to say it: They suck. Big time.If you want to hear good hard rock listen to Led Zeppelin. If you want to listen to rap then listen to Tupac Shacur but for your mothers sake dont listen to this sad attempt to make some noise and curse a lot.I actually could give this 1.5 just because Behind Blue Eyes is listenable ( all though about ten times poorer than the original ).Oh and by the way: DO NOT buy this cd by any circumstances."},{"rating":"1","title":"Results May Vary?!? You love it or you hate it.","review":"This CD is not good. It's tracks are terribly unoriginal and it just basically sounds strange. Limp Bizkit were never good, Fred Durst can't rap, face it. And Lastly, \\"Behind Blue Eyes\\", possibly their biggest hit on this album is a copy off a song by \\"The Who\\". Fred Durst cannot sing like Tommy. Its not even funny. For some real rock music check out \\"The Who\\", \\"Led Zeppelin\\", \\"The Clash\\", \\"Black Sabbath\\", \\"The Red Hot Chili Peppers\\", and all those classics."},{"rating":"1","title":"GODDAMNIT!!!","review":"As I shake my head in disgust I remember the good days. Before Fred became a bitch. Before Wes gave up hope. Thier debut will always remain a favorite of mine. But if I ran into Fred right now, I would beat him so severly that he might actually gain some understanding of what he has done. The crimes he has commited against music are unforgivable. As for the rest of the band, they too should feel shame, for being a part of this corruption of an artform. Fred and the rest are now no better than the boybands and britneys of this world.At least Wes stayed true."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst album i've ever heard!!!","review":"the whole album is absoloutly SUCK......i hate everysongs.....but i love BEHIND BLUE EYES,that is the best song in the album&for me,that song is the best song in 2003,my whole family love it!!!so it just my opinion,i'm not a fan of them(not hate them too,i'm in between) if you want 2buy this,just do it(u must be a fan of them then u can stand them).....&if you don't,just want 2have a try then don't buy this....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"I have never cared much for ol' freddy but I still listened to this band cause I liked the music.

In my opinion Freddy boy should be banned from the music industry. He has burned way too many bridges and turned his back on some of the bands that helped Limp Bizkit get to where they are today.

The album's very good in most parts. They do a lot of slower songs along with the rockers. I like Eat YOu ALive, the funky REd Light-Green Light, the dramatic Down Another Day and its bridges, and others. I like their remake of the Who's Behind Blue Eyes and Drown (with its early '70s feel) back to back. SOrry that this album didn't sell as strong, but this is a very catchy album most of the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Were's da old Bizkit.","review":"The problem with this album is the change of style. From the heavy guitar driven rap metal of their last album to the soft and uncharacteristic material on this album. Limp Bizkit have gone through a change which will dissapoint even the most hardcore of fans. \\"eat you alive\\" happens to be the only heavy track on the cd and one that represents the band's style. The rest is soft and unoriginal music. I strongly advise that this album be avoided.

And guess what? everyone still hates it. my guess is half of you haven't even listened to it, you just say you have and said it sucked. all most all of you say you liked the old stuff but hate it now since wes left, which you herd someone say in some magazine and now claim it as your own. please i'm sick of this. give the guy a chance. he is obnoxious and going bald. so what? this cd is pretty good. it is catchy as always and more mellow and fred finally limits his rapping to two songs. it isn't like other limp and people should at least give it a chance and not go into it thinking it will suck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total utter crap...Nu metal is FINALLY dead!","review":"I'm glad that nu metal is dead, and no one ever listens to this crap anymore.

I liked only 4 of the tracks and one lyric I found offensive. \\" You want to hear some heavy-ass metal that can penetrate deep in your ear drums? turn it up mother fxxker! turn it up mother fxxker!\\" How the hell can this band think that this is heavy metal?! and if it is I don't want to be a metal-head anymore! You could mabye consider their stuff before chocolate starfish nu-metal, but this is not. so if you want to hear some heavy-ass metal turn it off mother fxxker and put in some killswitch engage mother fxxker. If you still really want a bizkit CD then buy one of the 3 before this, they are much higher quality and in three dollar bill yall (their first CD) they hadn't sold out yet.

From the moment you start listening to this album you will realise how these guys have changed their style. Two to three tracks includung \\"Eat You Alive\\" have fred durst rapping or screaming his lungs out. The rest of the album is considerably soft with no attenpt at raw heavy nu-metal that Limp Bizkit is renowned for. There is no dout that most Limp Bizkit fans fill find this album to be a dissapointment and like me will eventually start asking themselves What happened to these guys?"},{"rating":"1","title":"dosent even deserve half a star","review":"I notice their is a Parental Advisory sticker on this CD and i Figuerd out why.

I liked the previous releases and I did manage (forced myself) to listen to this CD several times. I cringed every time. It's sad that the only glimmer of hope was a cover of \\"Behind Blue Eyes\\" from The Who... and it was completely botched. At the movie theater you can get a refund if you complain loud enough about a movie that sucks. Unfortunately, there is no retribution for the consumer in the music world.

I'm surprised the band hasn't just abandoned Fred Durst and moved on to play their own music, but Fred is the kind of guy who just wants attention. He's just in it for the money, and he wants to impress the fans, if there are any, by making them think he's some kind of bullied little kid, and he thinks they'll feel sorry for him, but he's so wrong. If you want someone to pity you because you've been wronged, then you gain and earn their respect and you don't act like a total p***y at the mic. If he was bullied at school, then why didn't he ever do anything about it? Why does he just keep complaining about it?"},{"rating":"1","title":"It burns!","review":"Oh joy.

Well, at least good rock. I couldn't disagree more. There are a very large number of bands out there that match the quality of the music of the 60s and 70s. In fact, rock has gotten much better than it was in the 80s. (Except for metal, of course) But, unfortunately, kids don't listen to the good stuff, they listen to crap like Limp Bizkit, etc. I say kids because I can't imagine a mature person listening to this garbage. Yes, Behind Blue Eyes is indeed a very beautiful song, but there is nothing new here. It is an exact copy of the Who song (minus the solo, apparently the guitarist can't handle it) anyone with a decent enough voice could do that. So, kids, let me point you to some of the GOOD music out there:Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Beta Band, Paul Oakenfold.........."},{"rating":"1","title":"holy freaking crap...this SUCKS","review":"OK, I was never a fan of Fred, I think he's a no-talent loser. Even so, I could tolorate some of Limp's older songs. I thought this might not be half-bad. I was going to rate this a 1-star cd, but then I heard something horrible: Fred had the NERVE to cover one of my favorite Who songs ever!! and Fred killed it and pissed on it's grave. I cannot tell you the ANGER I felt when I heard this. The Who were the greatest rock band in history, and Pete Townshend has written some of the best music of the past 40 years. And Fred thinks he can sing one of their songs!/! SHAME on you!!!!

He thinks he's the toughest guy in music, but all that he did is insult a bunch of bands, so that the frontmen of those bands hate him. (coughTrentReznorcough) For anyone who wants to hear bands similar to Limp Bizkit, here are some:Nine Inch Nails (Both bands write angry music, but Trent Reznor hates Fred Durst, so much, that just saying that Nine Inch Nails is similar to Limp Bizkit, could get me killed by Trent Reznor.)Glassjaw (Daryl Palumbo kicks Fred Durst's ass)"},{"rating":"1","title":"-27 stars actually","review":"If you enjoy listening to cows getting r*ped, you will love this cd.

There were several moments where I thought, \\"Haven't I heard a better version of this before?\\" Also, I like Snoop Dogg and he can't even save the track \\"Greenlight\\" or whatever......I think it's about failing driving school or something. And finally, there's this one track where Fred rhymes \\"baby\\" with......\\"baby\\" like 100 times in his rap. I hope Limp Bizkit retires to party with Playmates all day and not make any more music for the love of the money, cause they sold out a long time ago."},{"rating":"1","title":"s**t on a stick","review":"Boy howdy, if you thought music couldn't get any worse than crazy town and KoRn, think again. Limp Bizkit is perhaps one of the worst modern rock bands to ever play, and in a world of Metallica's, crossfade's and underOATH's, thats one hell of an insult. Needless to say, this album sucks a**, and even with an open mind, I still couldn't find one thing to like (except for maybe the hidden track on song 9 \\"give it up\\"). If you want some descent modern rock albums for your collection, check out: Breaking Benjamin's \\"We are not alone\\", 12 stones' \\"potters field\\" or Staind's \\"break the cycle\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Decent","review":"I used to be obbsessed with BIzkit, but now its Good charlotte(big change). This cd is good, but what really makes it are Almost Over, Build A Bridge, Underneath the Gun,and Down another Day. I am not that in to the metal side of them anymore. If you like metal you will like most of this album. If you like softer nicer songs you will like 25% of this album.

Basically the more you listen the better it gets. I think too many people judge the bizkits on their opinion of Freddy and that's wrong IMHO. Musically this is a far more refreshing alternative then I expected and it's going to take some time for Mike to settle in and have an impact on the sound etc. Don't slam \`em just because its not this or that - applaud them for trying in the first place. Thumbs up from me anyhows."},{"rating":"2","title":"not as fresh as the last 2 but still rockin","review":"I heard the tracks over and over again on the Leak at the MTV website. I am headed to pick my CD up. Though songs arent as fresh as the last two were but i am too faithful a Durst fan to let this wait. Slower pace in most songs is evident. And most of the energetic Rollin' sorta jams are absent except for Eat you alive which sadly delivers lesser than hoped. But all in all Limp Fans wont be disappointed. Wes will be missed but the bass guitar still grinds and Lethal does the deed with the drums helping all around. Down Another day, Almost over (cool), red light green light with Snoop are decent tracks. As i said i'll have my copy before i get home."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"Love it.

The new guitarist is good he fills up wes borland's place really well. The only good song in this album that is \\"Limp Bizkit\\" is Eat You Alive. It's one of their best songs ever. The rest is just like N'Sync attempting rock. Behind blue eyes what kind of trash is that. This is certainy not limp bizkit. What happened to the real rock in their first 2 albums three dollar bill being in my opinion the best then significant other. What is wrong with them?

Is it somewhat entertaining?.......no. Should you at least dl and burn?......only if you want to hurt your ears. No honestly this CD sounds nothing like their other crap...

He consistently ignores any evidence of any wrongdoing by any leftist, Communist or fellow traveler. It seems that he would have the reader believe that there never was ANY espionage going on at this time. For a more interesting book-one backed up by thorough source material-read\\"Bombshell\\" by Albright and Kunstel.There is no doubt that the hysteria that swept the country at this time was the cause of wrongful prosecutions and harrassment by government of those on the political left but this really is not the book to learn about these facts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice, comfortable shoe","review":"I am very happy with these shoes and would only add that they seem to run true to size.

The games graphics are so so but the gameplay and sound more than make up for it. The sound is very good, it's great to hear bugle calls and fifes as the troops march. The gameplay is equally good it gives a complete feel of control over the entire field of battle, my only gripe is that I seem to have a problem with cowards in my army, every time I charge or double time a confederate position my troops scream and run in the other direction, this dosent always happen but it occurs more often than not.

They are colorful.Other than that, I found this book to be a fairly colossal waste of time and, just to reach the end, I was reduced to skimming whole chapters looking for something to motivate me to read more.If you want a great break-out novel, you need to check out something else, like \`War Child' by Lowache.

For a little personal touch...I was one of the first people to hear \\"Little Razorblade\\" played live so I guess it's got a special place in my heart. :) Anywho, I totally recommend this album to anyone who is a fan of fun music that you can dance like a fool to. And definately to any TPS fan who doesn't own the album yet.

Having help will allow you and your family (either if you are married or not) to have more time for yourself and with your loved ones.

I love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredibly Underrated Band -- Buy This CD!","review":"Laguardia's debut--'Welcome to the Middle'--is an incredible album that is well worth the $10. I second the other reviewer's surprise that indie fans haven't given Laguardia the kudos they deserve. Laguardia's sound is unique, but they do remind one of an edgier Radiohead. The lead singer has a distinctive voice that sounds almost like Bob Dylan in some ways. I saw the band several times in 2003 and this year at a couple of venues in DC--Velvet Lounge and the Black Cat--and thought their live performances were outstanding. Recommended without reservations. -Wash, DC"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Amazing","review":"I saw Laguardia live with The Fire Theft(BEST EMO EVER) and they were fantastic.

I've found if I reset it will sometimes start back up but sometimes I have to reset 3 or 4 times in an hour. The first game we got we sent back because it would suddenly start scrolling thru the selections so fast it was simply a matter of pushing the A button and taking what came. And sometimes it wouldn't accept any selection.The replacement worked better but still locks up which is really annoying as I set aside the time to get some exercise and end up repeatedly standing there waiting for it to boot up again.Anyone else have such problems - and how do you deal with it?If it would just work as it's supposed to, I'd give it a rave review, but the frustration overcomes the positives sometimes - like tonight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Everything is lacking","review":"I am a long time veteran of DDR and was excited this morning when I opened my present -a Wii DDR. The song list looked good, and the hand movement idea seemed promising. But when I started playing, I was very dissapointed. All of the songs had been DDRified, and I could not find the menu to turn speed to my usual 1.5 and the strange arrows off. There were arrows that spun, funny ones in ice, and ones that looked like bombs from previous DDR titles. To use your hands, you just sort of twitch. Not dance. I would give a more in depth review but I only played it for so long before I got annoyed with the DDRified music and the seemingly unchangable speed. Get the PS2 one if you can. I recommend DDR Max 2 or DDR Extreme. Supernova is OK too. I think this might be a good option for kids though, but for anyone older than 11, its a big NO."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke within a week!!!","review":"DDR is great fun!! My kids played it all day for Christmas and even got their aunt, uncle & Papa to get up and dance!

We ended up sending it back for a refund. We then bought the Playstation version.DDR is a great game, but avoid the Wii version. Buy the Playstation version instead!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great game for the whole family","review":"This is a great game for the Wii that the whole family can play. I bought an extra dance mat so our two kids wouldn't fight over who gets to take a turn and I'm so glad I did! The set up was easy - the kids did it themselves.

It might take me a while to get used to this one. One thing for sure is that it really gives you a workout!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Fun for all!","review":"This game is a blast! It challenges all levels of \\"dancers\\" and even has a setting that lets two people work together to achieve a higher score. The music selection is fairly broad, however, there are a few songs that you feel the urge to skip over. Another cool feature of the game is that it has a workout mode that will keep track of how many calories you burn while playing! Some of the battle levels are frustrating as the scoring isn't always consistent, but overall it's a great game and is even more fun when you play with others!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best game for a fun work-out.","review":"I love the work-out I get from this game. There is an actual work-out function in which you can input your stats and choose how many calories you want to burn. Then all you have to do is dance, dance and it will tell you when you accomplish your goal. I don't even realize I'm working out, it's just fun dancing to good music. My only complaint would be that there are only so many songs, and as of now, it's not possible to download more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun for mom - and a great workout","review":"I purchased this for my mom as her first \\"new\\" game after she purchased the Wii for herself. She was looking for a Wii Fit still at the time, and wanted to get the Wii to have fun with the grandkids and to maybe have a fun way to stay in shape. I bought her this game with that in mind.The game is a bit more complicated to set up than I'd prefer for her, but definitely is a great workout. She's only had it a few days but is really getting into it. The dancing pad is well-made, and I haven't noticed any problems. We'll definitely have to get an add-on dancing pad for dance-offs!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Difficult but fun","review":"I bought this game to help me get some exercise. I love dancing but I have to say this is the most difficult thing to master.

She's having a hard time with it. The game came with minimal documentation and no instructions, so she's unable to figure out how to use it. She tried going on line for help, but the help she received didn't apply to the version we have so she's still nowhere with it. Our next step will be to recruit the services of one of the neighborhood kids to teach her how to use it.Bottom line: make sure you know how to play it before you get it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two thumbs WAY down","review":"Let me start by saying that I used to LOVE the old DDR game back when it was on Xbox. Great techno music to dance to and fun game modes. THIS game however, exciting dance moves and instead replaces it with the Wii Controller. The music was also VERY low-grade, which was not what I was expecting since I am a big 80s music fan.Maybe it's me whose changed, but this game just doesn't pack the same punch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wii Love it","review":"This is my first DDR purchase, we put off buying one until we had a Wii then waited for the game to come out. This has been great fun for my wife and I (both in our late 20s) and our Wii mooching friends. Not only has it been a lot of fun but its a great work out, be prepared to start sweating with this game. My only disappointment is in the very odd menus and the game settings. I really wish that the high scores could be associated with a real name and saved to the game. I mean really how much more time would that have taken to code? Over all still worth the purchase, if you got some lazy kinds this is a game for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"ITS AWSOmE@@@@@@@@@@@@@@","review":"w00t this game is sooooo c00l. not only did i stay up till 2a.m. playing it, but my mom supported me too. she said i was \\"burning calories\\".normal ddr is boring but playing it on the wii brings it to a whole new level. there are \\"gimmiks\\" which are special commands. this also brings your hands and arms into the game with a jab to the right and a whip to the left.ddr for wii is something you don't want to miss.P.S it's perfect for all ages 8 to 50"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Longtime DDR Fan","review":"I got this for Christmas and was thrilled. Before anything, we had our Wii set up and I was ready for dancing.My first observation upon beginning game play was that I had to turn off the pesky hand movements part of the game. They were really just taking away from the all around experience.Then, I saw the song list and was pretty disappointed. Some of the tracks were really fun..but it seemed mostly to comprise of radio songs with a techno twist.The dances seemed a lot easier and well..it's just not a classic DDR game.After playing for about a month, unlocking some of the better songs, my final say on the game is that looking at it as a game..seperated from it's predecessors, it's alright.Looking at a long history of amazing DDR games though..this is a big let down.Perhaps if we could move back to some of the more \\"DDR like\\" songs the game would be better."},{"rating":"2","title":"GET BACK THE GOOD OLD DAYS!","review":"MY PRODUCT IS THE DANCE DANCE REVOLUTION ON THE WII NINTENDO.

Plus you have the opurtunity to unlock new songs and arenas. The crowd will often \\"request\\" a song and if you win, you can unlock that song. Also the wii mote is added in that certain moves call for you to move your hand up or down along with the foot step. The one thing that does annoy me though is the guy who talks when you dance (like every 20 beats). He says stuff like \\"in danger of failing\\" or \\"awesome,\\" but he annoys me, I just want to hear the music and ignore him. Overall, I really enjoyed the game even though I am horrible at DDR."},{"rating":"2","title":"Working Hard","review":"Getting used to the new additions are a bit tricky, but make for a great challenge.

I did turn off that annoying man's voice and on most dances turn off the hand movements because I could never seem to get them right even when I felt they were right on target, I got booed.

I haven't danced for years except for aerobics so this feels great and I love trying to add my own movements while stepping on the arrows. I love this game!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun New DDR Experience","review":"I've had this game a couple days and it has been SO MUCH FUN!If this is your first DDR experience I suggest playing on an easier difficulty (maybe without the hand movements) until you get better so you don't get overwhelmed. Also the first level in groove circuit mode is a tutorial type song that should help. If you already have one of the older DDR games (I had PS2's Supernova), the new hand movements, special blocks, double taps, new songs etc add alot which makes this one worth adding to your game collection.I WOULD have given this 5 stars, but I would like to see them offer smaller motion sensors that could be strapped securely to your wrists.

Amazon.com apparently doesn't carry the fittings (what's up guys I though you had no shelf space issues? Stock all the parts please). Sparing Amazon some of the blame, there's no reason the manufacturer couldn't include a couple fittings with the hose.

The history offered on the making of the championship team was great, but the self agrandizement that came along with each nugget was more than I'd hoped for.

Recounting his turnaround of a languishing football franchise into a Super Bowl winner, Wolf (along with co-author Paul Attner) shows how he used the very principals he illustrates with his compelling sports analogies. While your organization may not compete on a stage as public as the NFL, you can use the same strategies. If these tactics can help the small-market Packers compete with teams from Chicago, New York and Los Angeles, they can certainly help your firm compete as well. We [...] especially recommend Wolf's \\"stepping stone\\" strategy of incremental improvement, which seems to us the equivalent of building a solid running game while your opponents lob Hail Marys."},{"rating":"1","title":"too small","review":"it is possible too fit my gun in this case, only if I take off barrel.

Chapman's inability to string together a memorable hook or melody in his awful improvised solos is painful to experience. I remember seeing the band at this time, and even then, at the gullible age of 17, I knew I wasn't seeing a tight group.

NO BRAINER! I found the 3 pack replacements filters at Wal-Mart for around $12.99 on sale. The Zero Water filters are close to $60.00. I have well water, cannot use in coffee maker, and this not only does the job...the water tastes great! Highly recommend, and am purchasing now as a gift for my mom!"},{"rating":"2","title":"this filtered pitcher is a bargain","review":"This is an excellent value in a filtered pitcher. Sure, it's not massively huge, but that's a good thing, or else it'd take up too much room in your fridge. We have 4 people in our house, and it's big enough for us. After you fill your glass or pitcher or water bottle, simply stick the Pur pitcher under the tap to re-fill it before sticking it back into the fridge. So really, there's no excuse for it to not always be full of water. If you have a huge family, then just get a standard non-filter pitcher and fill it up with several pitchers of water from the Pur filter to start out with and then keep the Pur topped off.The spout is small enough so that it's easy to fill the tiny openings of water bottles with, without spilling any water. Before going for a walk or jog, I fill my regular water bottle this way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not perfect, but a very good filter!","review":"Filters well, my water tastes great now. I LOVE how, unlike with my old Brita pitcher, the filter locks into place so it doesn't fall out every time you tilt the pitcher. Overall, I'm very satisfied. However, the handle has an unusually thick grip which I had to adjust to holding. Also, you have to remove the whole lid of the pitcher to fill the chamber from your faucet, which feels funny because there's nothing very ergonomic about the lid. That said, my old pitcher had a flip lid for easy filling, and it developed an unbeatable mildew around the hinge, so maybe it's better not to have it. All in all pitcher feels a bit cheap, but it works, and the filter is fantastic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great!","review":"Works great and does its job. Plus it fits really well into my fridge which is always kind of cramped."},{"rating":"2","title":"no complaints after a year","review":"I'm totally satisfied with PUR's taste, and this basic pitcher is the best for 2 people. I don't need a replacement reminder on the top, the filtering slows & you can feel the increased weight of sediment in the filter. I imagine the time a filter lasts may vary with treatment & quality of your community's water supply. originally I was looking at cost savings, but now I'm just glad not to be lugging all those jugs home from the store. I have a small refrigerator, so I prefer to filter water on the counter and pour it into another pitcher to chill."},{"rating":"2","title":"Every household should have this pitcher.","review":"I recently moved into university housing, and the water provided for my area tastes like absolute death. To be more precise, it tastes like sour, chlorinated pool water. Luckily, my roommate had a Pur pitcher that she brought with her from home. I tried some water from it and was amazed. It really does make a difference.This basic pitcher is affordable, makes great tasting water, and is good for the environment. I decided to get one for my mom since she buys boxes upon boxes of bottled water. Less plastic waste, and less money waste. Quite frankly, the majority of drinking water throughout America isn't that great for you, so it's a good idea to have some kind of purifying system. I'm definitely going to have to buy one for myself once I move out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pur CR-6000 2 Stage Oval Water Pitcher","review":"The PUR water filtration pitcher really works.

The more you use a filter, the slower it becomes. One filter lasted 4 months, another lasted 2 weeks - not sure why, but I just replaced it because I couldn't wait.2. When the upper compartment is filled with water, you essentially can't use the pitcher, because the unfiltered water runs out over the top.

When I moved to the city I could not drink tap water, because it smells like pool water, with added chlorine. I've been using a Pur faucet mount water filter, and the water tastes nuetral. However, when I purchased this water pitcher, the water tastes like soap. I almost can't drink it. I feel like I am doing my body harm because of the soap flavor. My feeling is that chemicals are being added through the filtration process. I've run about 10 gallons through it or more, and there is no improvement. I've tried tasting it warm as opposed to cold, but it still has the chemical taste. I never noticed this with any faucet mount filter, only this pitcher. I am about ready to get rid of it, because the chemical after taste is unbearable. Keep in mind, I am only giving my opinion. It is possible that the taste I'm noticing is due to the water being so pure that it has an unussual taste!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good filter for improving taste of well water","review":"This is a good filter for improving the taste and smell of well water. I highly recommend it for anyone who makes coffees in a coffee pot or uses a vegitable steamer. It will add years to your appliances. the only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it requires filling twice to fill a 12 cup pot of coffee. Not such a big thing is you plan ahead. I would like it to hold three additional cups."},{"rating":"1","title":"Filters clog up after 10 days","review":"I bought the pitcher version although I have very clean water, did it to get the fluoride taste out. After 2 weeks, nothing running through. Called Pur, they promised me a filter replacement coupon, and sent me a 2 for 1 instead. Bought new filter, clogged up again after only 10 days. Are they trying to fraud people into buying a new filter every 2 weeks? I had the faucet version, too, for over 6 years, and it holds up to 6 months.

I have a pitcher from about 6 years ago which still works great and is very sturdy. I bought this one last summer to take on a cruise. After I received it, I immediately noticed that this one is half the weight and the plastic so thin, I decided to pack my old one for the cruise and leave this one home. Within 2 weeks the new one (which I keep on my kitchen counter) developed a large crack in the inside \\"blue\\" part. It was almost like it couldn't handle the weight of the water. It was never dropped or bumped. Very disappointed with this."},{"rating":"1","title":"not as good as the older model","review":"The opening (for water to come out) has no cover like the older model that I have.

My wife receives free Dasani purified water at work, but prefers the water filtered by this pitcher. So, she fills those empty bottles with \\"our\\" water and carries them to work or when she is out shopping.I'm a big coffee drinker, and using the water from this pitcher makes the coffee taste much better and less acidic.Now, if I could just get a good promotional price on replacement filters, the deal would be more than perfect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pur filter is slow","review":"This tiny pitcher takes over 8 hours sometimes to filter a load of water.It gets a bonus star because I can pour it while it's still filtering, by holding the lid down with my hand.EDIT 11-28-2007:I bought a replacement Pur filter at Target. This one has a hole in the top of it that is supposed to improve water flow, and it sure does -- I can get two 8oz glasses of water out of it in less than 5 mins. I hope it's filtering properly, at that speed (it does taste good). So I'll leave my review at 2 stars until it becomes apparent that this pitcher is shipping with the improved filter, rather than the old slow one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pitcher Cracked","review":"I agree with a previous reviewer - the pitcher fractured spontaneously. It was not dropped or hit - it just ruptured and leaked water all over. I would not buy another PUR product. It was a 2-4-1 deal at a local grocery store - now I know why......"},{"rating":"1","title":"Particles left in \\"Filtered Water\\" - Worse Taste","review":"After following the presoaking instructions for the filter, the filter deposited many black particles, as well as tiny translucent spheres in the \\"filtered\\" water. Even more, the \\"filtered\\" water tastes worse than straight tap water from the facet! I live in AZ where the tap water is notoriously bad. Unfortunately, going to return this filter, possibly shop for another brand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fits under the bathroom faucet","review":"Love that this fits under the bathroom faucet and that sink is pretty shallow. Don't like that there is no flap covering the pour spout so things can get into the filtered water in the bottom, but this is small enough that you don't usually leave water standing in there for long before using it. Don't try to pour while the water is filtering - that may seem like a no-brainer - the cap will fall right off and spill water everywhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"A useless thing","review":"Perhaps this filter makes water healthier. Perhaps. What I can tell is that it doesn't make it taste better. The water that I get out of this filter is slightly on the bitter side, and tastes far worse than bottled water. I can't really drink it.Other uses? I had an idea of using filtered water for cooking, but it turned out to be impossible because this filter just doesn't produce it quick enough. Other reviewers mentioned mentioned the speed issue, but I couldn't understand what they are talking about before actually buying the thing. What happens is that if you fill it with water for the first time in the morning, the first pint gets filtered pretty quickly, in a couple minutes. The second pint takes longer, and getting the third pint takes about an hour. In the end, when you start cooking, you can't have enough water within a reasonable time.The bottom line is that the filter can't be returned so I'll keep it, but I wish I spent the money on something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Takes forever to filter the water","review":"It takes literally 2 hours for the water to filter through the reservoir. Next time, I'm getting a Brita. Do yourself a favor and don't buy this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not filter quickly","review":"I used he stage one of the PUR systems before and I loved it. Decided to buy this one and when I got it loved it for the first two days. It drained well but then after the second day, it would not filter. I tried another filter and followed all the instructions. The filters were expensive and they were also a hit or miss. Mostly, it takes one entire night to filter seven cups of water. I have resorted to drinking tap water after buying this and have recently ordered another Brita system. The one good thing about this is that there are very few carbon particle leaks in the filter but it doesn't filter. Maybe I got a dud."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Product! Simple Review...","review":"Just got mine yesterday and I'll keep this simple.Pros:*PRICE! (Sorry Brita, not paying $30 for $1 worth of plastic)*Nice size.*No hinged cover to break off. (Just use your thumb when you grab the handle and it'll never come off)*Clear reservoir so you can't over-fill. (if your eyes are open)*Fits in my refrigerator door.Cons:*No flap over the spout so if your refrigerator stinks your water might not taste good. (Not a big deal if you keep your rotting garbage in the trash like most people)Note:If you look up reviews on the filtering capacity of Pur vs. Brita then you'll see that they're basically identical with a slight advantage to Pur for being able to filter our something like 1-3% more chlorine or whatever. *SO* The whole thing boils down to the obvious price difference and the frequent complaints about Brita's hinged covers/tops coming off.Also...Pur's 'replace by' date sticker is dumb looking. I'll use my calendar."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy so far, even though the lid dribbles a little","review":"I bought this to keep in my little work fridge. I wasn't really concerned about the lack of a lid to cover the spout since there really isn't that much food in the fridge to change the taste of the water. The size is really handy for a small work fridge.The only con I've seen so far is that the lid seems to leak a little, especially when both the top and bottom reservoirs are full. It isn't much of a leak, just a few drops. When the top resevoir isn't full, there is no leak.Also, I do like the way the filters twist in, and I also like the o-ring seal.So far, so good! I would have given it five stars, but the lid dribble used up one star. ;)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product","review":"I like this pitcher. makes the water taste really good. you instantly taste the difference. Handle with care though cause the lid is fragile. Also automatically purchase filters cause they have to be changed every two months to keep the good taste."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does the job","review":"I couldn't decide between the Brita Slim Pitcher and the Pur Oval, so bought one of each. And that's not as frivolous as it sounds, because I wanted two anyway so there would always be a cold one ready in the fridge. Both of them seem to filter the water just fine. The Brita top stays on better, but the handle has sharper edges and is less comfortable to hold, especially when it's full. Although I've noticed the little black specks that others have objected to, in our case they stay in the top section and never end up in the glass, so they don't bother us. The Pur has a nicer, rounded handle, but if you're not careful the top has a tendency to fall off, dumping water all over the shelf. No worries, though, because if you just make sure to use two hands and hold the top securely, which is very easy to do, it stays where it belongs and all is well. So, bottom line, I would give maybe a slight edge to the Pur, but either one delivers good-tasting water with a minimum of fuss."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works fine before it breaks","review":"Put me down as another owner who's pitcher simply broke one day. I used it for 3 months or so, everything worked fine during that time--a bit slow to filter but not a big deal. Then last night I pour a glass of water, place it in the fridge, start to walk away and hear a LOUD \\"crack\\"--what was that? Sounded like it came from the fridge. Open the door, the pitcher has a crack running all the way from the top to the bottom. Now, I did not just refill it, it was out of the fridge for seconds so there was no sudden change in temp from air or warmer water--it just broke. This is a problem one hears repeatedly and is clearly a design or quality flaw. Shame on Pur for not addressing the problem and in effect stealing from people."},{"rating":"1","title":"major flaws in useability","review":"The pitcher lid only comes off with force and then flies off - it's not an easy lift off. I thought it was just a matter of getting used to when I bought this but - 2 months later, and it's the same. After reading similar reviews I was forced to concede it just was designed extremely poorly. Now i am trying to replace the filter - (the light telling you when to replace is very useful) and the old filter won't come out! I've tried coercion and force and even had a few friends try their luck when they come over - nada. I remember my old brita - none of these problems , the filter slid right out. The Pur as a pitcher filter is fine but the design flaws almost make me wish I had never bought it. I've been using the old filter now just cause it refuses to come out.

Had used a Brita pitcher years ago, and hated the taste. Pur is far better (though it took some getting used to after Evian.) Haven't had any problems with the unit, or with replacing the filters. Very straightforward, and fairly solid. We have to refill several times a day, and change the filter monthly. Small fridge, so we can't fit the larger dispenser.

Their very different personalities are clearly portrayed in both their professional and their private lives. In and around the main action are dozens of \\"minor\\" characters, all vividly presented. We get an excellent sense of what late Victorian life was REALLY like in London among the theater crowd, AND we get the excellent, clever G&S soundtrack that should make thousands of new fans for DVDs and CDs featuring the operettas of these two amazing men.

But none of that means a thing if you can't bear to hear Gilbert & Sullivan show tunes for 160 minutes, not to mention the onslaught of dry, British humor that would be funny were it not so antiquated. Entertaining? Not in the slightest. \\"Topsy-Turvy\\" should be avoided at all costs by any American under the age of, say, 55.

The story also tries to capture little blurbs of the actors life, however we never learn enough to care about anyone.

This is a different kind of production for Leigh, even so, I enjoyed it. It's as colorful as a Merchant-Ivory production and filled with plenty of good G&S music."},{"rating":"2","title":"No wonder people enjoy working with Mike Leigh","review":"If one already has the older DVD of Topsy-Turvy, should one buy the new Criterion edition? YES! This newly restored print is absolutely gorgeous. Another sufficient reason is watching the movie in Mike Leigh's delightful company as he provides a commentary for his film. As he notes, unlike many directors, he enjoys watching the movies he has made, and this is apparent in his unflaggingly enthusiastic and informative remarks. I missed him when it was over!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Few Days in the Life of G&S","review":"This is a time machine back into Mr. Carte's company in London. If you are not acquainted with G&S;, you are missing works of art equaled only by Mozart, Verdi, Wagner and Joplin. The big illusion with G&S; is that itis easy; nothing is farther from the truth. This movie puts you into the opera company. Be warned, it is highly addictive!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Film! One of the Best Films of 1999!","review":"Topsy Turvy is a marvellous film that is like no other period piece ever made. Elegant, funny and full of GREAT music, Mike Leigh's superb film focuses on the relationship between Gilbert & Sullivan, thier parting of ways over creative differences and thier eventual re-teaming to create The Mikado, thier most beloved work. Leigh and his brilliant company of actors examine every facet of producing a stage show in what has to be the most detailed \\"backstage\\" drama ever made. But the film is more than just about The Mikado, its about the creative process, the joys and hard work involved in such endeavors, and it's also a look at a time when the British Empire \\"peaked\\" and the sun finally began to set on it. This is a real treat from Mike Leigh who normally makes films about contemporary Britain. Yet, in a way, its of a piece with his other works. See this lovely film!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to the humor?","review":"It's amazing how what looks like a documentary on the making of a very funny operetta (which I saw performed at Gordon College a week ago and laughed myself silly) could be so serious! Even the scenes of Mikado being performed have no sense of humor. Throughout you'd think they were staging King Lear!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the most BORING films of 1999","review":"Although I am a big Mike Leigh fan and can appreciate the art of Gilbert and Sullivan, I cannot recommend this movie. I saw it when it first came out in the theaters around 6 months ago and to tell you the truth--the only thing I can remember about it is howing boring it was. It seemed to drag endlessly and for an almost 3-hour film--that was way too long. I usually don't care what the Oscars or the British Oscars do, but keep in mind that neither of them nominated this movie for Best Picture. If the British Oscars didn't nominate it--and this movie IS British--then I think that's saying something about this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"unbelievably long","review":"A real disappointment. This could have been an interesting story - but did we really need an hour and a half to show that G & S had become stagnant (before the Mikado)? Did we really need 15 minutes of scenes from The Sorcerer - this was not relevant to the story at all, other than the fact that the production had been \\"revived\\" since G & S hadn't produced new material. I didn't need to see scenes from the show to understand this. I agree that the costuming etc. was incredible, and there are some amusing moments, but the bottom line is that this film is just way too long and slow."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Glorious and Rare experience","review":"For an old lady who grew up on Gilbert and Sullivan, this film is just a trip to the moon on gossamar wings! A film that just shines - full of humor, irony, wit, and glorious music. Corduner was marvelous as the ecentric Sullivan but in my book, Jim Broadbent stole the show in the more subtle presentation of the complex Gilbert. He deserved the Oscar. But just as amazing, I've never seen any film in which ALL the supporting players were so perfect, so strong.Bravo to the casting director - not one slip. I've seen TT in the theatre, saw it on a video screener, and DVD - DVD is the way to go. Some of the dialogue was lost on screen and VCR - but on DVD - every word was clear. This is a great film - I just wish young people would try it to discover the great Gilbert and Sullivan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Topsy-Turvy Gilbert& Sullivan","review":"This is a beuatiful film, probably Mike Leigh's best - certainly his most colourful.The characters of Gilbert (gruff, impatient and brilliant) and Sullivan (sensuous, carefree and brilliant)are gorgeously painted. Timothy Spall's part as the baritone Richard Temple is superb.This is a surprisingly simple film in which you are swept along and have little idea where it's taking you. Full of surprises, the journey is immensely satisfying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie!","review":"I have never been very interested in Gilbert and Sullivan's creations or Opera in general but I decided to try and watch this on Netflix a while ago. I ordered the Blu-Ray and soundtrack two days later. Topsy-Turvy is a (only)slightly Hollywood-ized recount of the period leading to the creation of G&S's likely most famous work, The Mikado. This has excellent fully-staged excerpts of The Mikado along with very well performed music(Sullivan's arranged for the film) conducted by Carl Davis on what, in the movie, appeared to be period instruments in an authentically sized ensemble. I'm no movie buff but the acting and writing all seemed top notch and three of the leading actors I recognized from the Harry Potter films. I highly recommend it to anyone with even a slight interest in classical music or Opera, though some of the content may be unsuitable for children."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tops","review":"British director Mike Leigh is known for his unique approach to film that requires actors to develop characters before the action actually unfolds. So usually his film are in a contemporary setting. This is the director's foree into historical drama and he knocks it out of the park. Sumptuously styled and brilliantly acted, it covers a crisis period in the working relationship of England's famous Gilbert and Sullivan. Played respectively by Jim Broadbent and Allan Corduner, this flashpoint is painted on the larger canvas of London in High Victorian primness and manners.A fantastic story beautifully rendered!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great entertainment","review":"when i viewed this for the first time, i realized how much i enjoy gilbert & sullivan. everyone should watch it for a greattime."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellently cast, G&S purists will love it!","review":"Mike Leigh went to every painstaking effort to produce this film and the result is a brillinatly-cast, beautifully-staged, utterly-delightful account of the year surrounding the production of Gilbert & Sullivan's comic opera, The Mikado. What can I say about the cast? They are all fabulous! Not one actor is mis-cast in this production. Aside from the obviously first-rate performances of Broadbent and Corduner as the movie's primaries, the supporting cast turns in an outstanding performance. Most notable to me is newcomer Martin Savage as the brilliant (but flawed) George Grossmith. Shirley Henderson is also fabulous as Leonora Braham. Timothy Spall as Richard Temple and Dorothy Adkinson as Jessie Bond also help make the musical numbers in this movie look like part of a Mikado G&S purists would be delighted to see. Even after 2 1/2 hours, this film left me wanting more. Everything about it is splendid!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Right","review":"This is an account of the professional lives of G&S and the D'oyly Carte company. It brings the back stage story of the Savoy Operas to life and the samples of the operas shown are presented in the very finest traditions of G&S. Excellent Blu-ray quality of course and a film you can enjoy over and over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Music Lover","review":"In layman's terms. \\"What a wonderful CD!\\". I bought this about two weeks ago and have not been able to stop listening. Tom Luce has a great voice. The harmonies are gorgeous and lyrics provocative at times. Have never been one to let the production and mixing make my decision on whether or not I liked the artist. But would definately have to say that all of the above and the combination of mixing makes this a wonderful find. The very significant details have not been compromised in order to just get the music out there. The violin/cello/harmonica incorporated with the usual atmosphere have the makings for a wonderful debut. Pick it up. You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great from Begining to End","review":"Since I bought Luce's CD, it has been in my CD player and being played daily. It is great from begining to end. The quality of the writing, musicianship, recording and production is excellent. Luce did a great job putting this CD together...on their own! Check it out, you will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best CDs of 2002!","review":"Awesome CD! Highly recommend - great melodies, use of horns and lyrics. It is better everytime I listen to it! Favorite songs include \\"Numb\\", \\"In the Middle There\\", \\"Long Way Down\\" and \\"Sunniest of Weekends\\". If you like the Counting Crows and Connells, this is a must buy CD. Besides the awesome music, the CD insert has some great photography and artwork/design."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pop genius","review":"The first time I heard \\"Good Day\\", I knew this was going to be a fun album of well crafted pop rock. What I didn't expect was to be blown away by musicianship and songwriting ability displayed on this album. The hidden track, which I've come to know as \\"No Way with Words\\" is haunting, while \\"In the Middle There\\" has to be one of the most interesting pop songs I've heard in a while. The band reminds me of the Philosopher Kings. Both use jazz, pop, rock, funk and reggae to create an amazing piece of artistry. Buy this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chem Bros Rule","review":"I like the Chemical Brothers. Every new CD has 2 or 3 tunes that really do it for me. But their videos in this collection are all excellent. Even the songs that aren't my faves to listen to really grab me in the context of the audio/visual interface. These pieces are uniformly professional, imaginative, creative, entertaining, suprising, and wierd, wierd, wierd. Common threads are there, but each video is different. I'm all for bands getting their A/V geek pals to do vids for them, but Chem Bros have the juice to make it happen on a level of quality you rarely see in the counterculture scene, without losing the tiniest bit of the edge that makes them a great band. Also some great concert footage. I love it. - lgv"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enought Chemicals,Brother","review":"very boring inane methodical beat that goes on and on and on and on and on and on the \\"songs,tunes\\" do not develop its the same beat on and on and on....... visuals are boring if you like good visuals and great pounding progressive rave like music the best is MOby Live (the Remix part of the dvd which goes for about an hour ) or Underworld LIve all the rest from this field that I have (unfortunately) purchased ,like FatBoy and the like,to be honest suck"},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly Good","review":"The best way I can describe the game is \\"one of those basic knock-offs\\". You get that sense when you see the packaging. It is an older game with dated graphics but the gameplay is pretty good, and it delivers on what it is trying to duplicate. Experienced gamers will find little new in this one, but if you are looking for something to spend some time on, this is a good choice. It was suprisingly good. Check around, was a time you could find it in the bargain bin.Hail Flavius!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Journal Owned.","review":"I have been looking for a quality pocket-sized leather journal, i tried the Molskine brand, but the leather is quite thin and tore easily, and the spine fell apart after about a month. The Epica journal is very high quality, feels good in the hand, paper is nice and thick, seems very durable, i highly suggest this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Limp Album","review":"This is one the worsts albums I've ever owned other then A funky Headhunter. Eat you alive is a great track and the only one thats worth listening too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD","review":"This CD is great in fact in my opinion this is one 2003's best. This CD totally took me by surprise i thought it would suck but of course it didn't. I can actually listen to this CD from start to finish without skipping one track, i've listen to this hole CD twice and i've only had it for one day. So if you have any beef with Fred just let it go and listen to this CD, in fact i kinda didn't like Fred Durst that much either but after listening to this CD i respect him as an artist. My favorite tracks are Gimme the Mic, Build a bridge, the only one, and let me down. So buy this CD you won't regret it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fred needs to go away","review":"Don't be fooled, there is nothing new here. It's the same old crap from one of the most untalented people in music. The rest of the band needs to wake up like Wes and move on, they're at least competent. This CD warrents no stars, but that's not fair to the rest of the band. It's time for Durst to sink and fade away so we never have to hear anymore of the crap he puts out and labels music. He's just as vacant as Britney and the Backstreet Boys: its all TRL fluff. There was a reason bizkit got booed off stage at many Summer Sanitarium tour dates. You want real heavy music, pick up the latest from KMFDM or Ministry."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad and awful","review":"Limp Bizkit is gotta be the most overrated and worst band in the world. They don't know where they are headed for. There is nothing original about this album. I mean these guys were pathetic on tour with Metallica. Infact they were pelted from the stage in Chicago. Don't buy this CD and save ur money for some good stuff coming in next few months. The lyrics are awful and music sucks... Stay away... No talent."},{"rating":"2","title":"THEY BROUGHT THAT BEAT BACK!","review":"This is limp bizkits best album yet! the tracks are:1 re-entry2 eat you alive3 gimme the mic4 underneath the gun5 down another day6 almost over7 build a bridge8 red light-green light9 the only one10 let me down11 lonely world12 phenomenon13 creamer {radio is dead}14 head for the barricade15 behind blue eyes16 drowntwo hidden tracks i found are after red light-green light and after behind blue eyes. this album is more a rap album with softer beats. drown is like the only song thats soft and non-rap. they have some heavey songs too like number 1,2,3,7,9,12,14. red light-green light has snoop dogg in it. my fav songs on here are 1,2,3,6,7,8,11,12,13,14. i have alot of favorites on this album also the most so this is my favorite album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rockin' good, and what's wrong with Fred anyway?","review":"I've never really understood why Fred gets so much [animosity] from people. He is just trying to be as successful as he can, and is doing well at it. I always hope that lyrically he will mature some more, as songs like Nookie and Rollin' sound kinda juvenille to me, even though the music is good. He does a little here, and hopefully more in the future. It is cool to listen to a straight up rocker like \\"Eat you Alive\\" and then something smooth with Snoop Dogg on \\"Red Light, Green Light\\" on the same album. For the price you can find it at right now, you can't beat it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Limp Cd EVER!","review":"Well I hae recently heard an advanced copy of the new Limp Cd, and let me tell you, it is horrible, it has maybe three good songs, the album is way too slow for my likeing, it has to be the slowest Limp album ever, I would say not to waste your money on this one"},{"rating":"1","title":"limp bizkit burned out","review":"As a fan of the previous Limp Bizkit albums I'd advise anyone that might purchase this album that it is garbage. One song with a Snoop Dogg cameo does not an album make. This album truly rates less than one star, save your money. I feel thoroughly ripped."},{"rating":"1","title":"hahahaha! These people keep on writing good reviews...","review":"The funny thing here is that people keep on writing good reviews making themselves believe that Limp Bizkit is actually a good band. Cmon' we all know that u really hate them and are just writing to grab our attention...or you really are losers listening to crap like this. I don't want to dis u or insult you, but there are better bands out there. Check out Iron Maiden, Slayer, Ozzy or Megadeth. Limp Bizkit is just a f**ked up piece of sh*t. Fred Durst is a bad singer and an even worse rapper trying to fit in with the black dudes.

ANY BAND WHOSE FIRST SINGLE IS A COVER OF A CLASSIC ROCK SONG SHOULD TELL YOU WHAT THE REST OF THE ALBUM HAS TO OFFER: ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. What's worse is they don't even do The Who justice. He repeats the beginning verse over and over and right when the song is supposed to start to rock he makes out with Hally Berry and it abruptly ends. American rock is suffering because of \\"bands\\" like Limp Bizkit, but far from dead. Ladies and Gentlemen, there are plenty of great rock bands in this country if you just look past the billboard top 40. (Bands that write about real-world situations, not crying over some souless pop star who didn't f**k you after a night at Skybar) Do yourself a favor and do a little searching before you accept what's spoonfed to you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Much Changes with Bizkit","review":"I was never a Bizkit fan though I've listened to the music before and of the 4 albums , well they are all pretty similar lyric wise and in the song arrangements . Results may Vary has some of the better guitar work simply cause there seems to be more emphasis on it and Fred has decided to get back to more of a rock feel , still though this album really doesn't break any new ground for Bizkit and doesn't totally stray from rap ( unfoutunatley ) . Anyway If you're a LB fan it's worth it to get this if you aren't an LB fan you should probably stay away , I am ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe Next Time","review":"Not what I was expecting. Hopefully the next album will be like the past ones. LB should not be known as a \\"soft\\" band but this CD will pigeon hole them under that heading.

I think the band was headed in the wrong direction in their last cd, and Wes left because he didn't like it. Now, with Mike Smith, the band has gone back to the way they should have stayed after their first album, and not gone deeper into the rap-rock world. I'm glad they're back to being a hard rock band, and I'm glad that this is the album the band put out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Music for 13 year-olds","review":"Limp Bizkit is and always has been a band for 13 year olds. People shouldn't expect anything more from them, or less. And no, i havent ever bought a limp bizkit album, im not a hater who buys their albums.(i couldnt believe the rant i read by a previous reviewer, what a knob). Reading the positive reviews for this album it becomes clear who supports this band. On a positive note Limp Bizkit has aquired former Snot guitarist for this album who makes the music listenable in places, but as the critics have been saying fred durst is quite possibly the worst frontman in history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wes WHO????","review":"True to his word....Freddie D came through! This CD truly is their best work yet. This band is going through the natural evolution of ROCK BANDS! Nobody said metalica fell of when their guitarist died. So why should LIMP be any different?!

I felt used after i finished listening to the first half of the album. So.... i lit it on fire and smiled.Fred is a little girl who needs to stop feeling sorry for himself.

If you listen to them long enough you could become permentantly dumb. You could find yourself blindly following masses of people without rationally thinking about it. You could end up replacing letters in words with the letter \\"z\\" for no apparent reason. You could be wearing outdated clothes that never looked good anyway. You could end up living in a trailer park (not that it's a bad thing). If you've gotten this far down (congrats you can read) and don't like your options; there is still a chance for you. Realize your mistake and think for yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't finish the whole cd","review":"Like the title says plus add that I burned it. Durst is, and this comes from knowing him personally AND hating him personally, a selfish twit who makes music like a selfish twit does. This album is beyond the word horrible; it's Durst's usually animosity for womankind when really all he focuses on is womankind to begin with. He's like the little obsessed puppy who, when he gets turned away, goes cries in the corner...except when Durst gets turned away, he writes songs about how much he hates the world. Its really sad...the man needs some help. There's so much in life other than to play the victim everytime. He needs a cold shower and a psychiatrist..."},{"rating":"1","title":"how many times do i need to FLUSH before they go away?","review":"Yea... how many times do I need to flush their albums DOWN THE TOILET before they quit!?!?!? These guys are the most talentless in the world. So many bands these days took influence from previous bands like this, and that is exactly why the state of modern music is as bad as it is. Wes Borland was the only member with any talent. He was thinking, and thinking intelligently at that, when he ditched Bizkit. I sense even more deterioration (if possible), in the future for these posers. I've had to flush 5 Bizkit CD's down the toilet... I hope this band doesn't live to release another album. They've destroyed music's future enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"CRAP","review":"If you are a Limp Bizkit fan, DO NOT BUY THIS CD. This cd does not sound like the Limp Bizkit we know. This is not a nu-metal cd, and the use of acoustic guitars make it even worse.

Just go download Gimme A Mic because its the only song on the cd that Limp Bizkit fans will like."},{"rating":"2","title":"limp bizkit will be around a while","review":"This CD had loads of negative and positive hype. At summer Sanitarium they were booed off stage everywhere they went, well this cd answers the critics of them being a pop culture band, its absolulty more rock orentated.

Even if this cd does not sell well limp bizkit will be around for a long time to come."},{"rating":"1","title":"My brain went Limp and I fell asleep to this CD","review":"This album did not rock my socks. Fred Durst is a wuss. The majority of the songs on this album are slow rock songs like the hit \\"My Way\\". And like that song said, Fred has chosen to do this album his way and it sucks. That's why Wes left because the band was going nowhere fast. They used to get me pumped up....now I put this cd in as I go to sleep.If you're new to Limp Bizkit and like to listen to the radio all day, you will like this album because it sounds like every other band out there.I'd like to slap Fred Durst across the forehead with my \\"limp bizkit\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Limp is back and better than ever","review":"I love this CD. it has a greater rock feel then their previous release, but it is still Limp Bizkit.

Put them out of their misery once and for all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this a joke?","review":"Significant other was an all time classic. Limp Bizkit really had something at the time, but with CS&THFW there was a complete dropoff. Now this useless disc has been released. Eat you alive is badass, but there is nothing else to grasp onto. I was 17 when their debut came out, and i could identify with their first two albums-where is this album's nookie, break stuff, counterfiet, or boiler. The lyrics are childish and without heart. Head for the barricade is unbearable to the point of retarded, and red light green light is plain terrible. LB has let a true fan down. Why has Fred Durst turned into a whiny little girl. This albums sucks. I change my review to one star. Please let the poop dvd and the album that is supposed to be released in the spring totally blow me away."},{"rating":"2","title":"limpbizkit's greatest album!","review":"Wow, this album really is amazing from start to finish! This album is seen by most as being more 'Mellow' than other CDs by limpbizkit, but the songs still have a lot mof energy and every song is quite powerful in its own way. It isn't all 'Mellow' though, Bizkit show they can still rock as hard as ever even without Wes, \\"Gimme The Mic\\" \\"Eat You Alive\\" and \\"Head For The Barricade\\" are some of the heavier songs on the album and really help even things out. Anyone who has ever liked limpbizkit should enjoy at least parts of this album, and i'm sure it will appeal to some who have never liked LB before as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Bizkit is back in town!","review":"After the long hiatus away, Limp Bizkit is back in full force. The record brings out a new side of Fred and the gang. Touching up on old roots with the new songs \\"Eat You Alive\\" and \\"Head For The Barrier\\" and then add a new area of creativity with \\"Build A Bridge\\". I definetly would recomend this cd to all of you wether you love them or not. The only thing I think Limp Bizkit could have done better is sticked squarely on going back to the basics and left off the song with Snoop. But for at such a cheap price and a well produced album I give this a 4 out of 5."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing new sounds as well as solid old sounds","review":"This cd truly surprised me. I had no idea what to expect from the new limpbizkit, but this cd is full of energy and emotion that competely blew me away. I am an old school limpbizkit fan and this cd will appeal to both the hard and soft listener with every song. This cd is a safe bet for anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"These guys are still around?","review":"At least Wes Borland (probably the only one from Limp Bizkit that had any talent to begin with) had some sense when he ditched Limp Bizkit. \\"Results May Vary\\" finds this pretender band doing less of the rap rock thing that helped propel them to platinum plus status and more of a sensitive, so called \\"hard rock\\" that seems to be the current way for bands to find success today. Witness \\"Behind Blue Eyes\\" which features an acoustic guitar backing Fred \\"Yes, I'm still alive and more annoying than ever\\" Durst attempting to put some actual emotion into this stuff that they, and their few remaining fans, call music. Whichever way you cut it though, \\"Results May Vary\\" is yet another album to toss on the scrap heap. You want hard rock with real emotion, soul, and heart? Go listen to Faith No More, Biohazard, Corrosion of Conformity, Down, Audioslave, or Black Label Society, and save yourself some brain cells."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please No More!","review":"I was at a store today and Results May Vary was playing.People were begging the store guy to turn it off.Just plain painful.Atleast in the begining Freddie was funny.Now he is just pathetic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sucks more than a fried chicken drumstick.","review":"This album is so bad, it is idioticSongs are stupid, dull instrument playing, fred douchbagis just like feminem, solos are zero and this Remakeof a classic by the who is a wastefred durst you are finishedDJ Lethal do yourself a favor and depart thisband and go back to whitey ford aka everlastI'm glad this album flopped BIG Time.One Star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quit rapping, Fred.","review":"The only album I liked of LB's was Three Dollar Bill Y'all. The songs on the last couple albums were too pop influenced. The hip-hop has got to go. This album is more of the same, but with a lead guitarist that lacks Wes's talent. Wes Borland is good. Keep an eye out for his new stuff. Don't waste your money on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Limp Bizkit is back!","review":"Fred turns out to be right...Results Do Vary.

I heard it first at the concert in London and even then i could tell it was a good song. Listening to it takes you to another place its full of emotion, i just love it. Red light Green light is full of great beats and Snoop just toook that song to another level. Gimmie the Mic is immpresive but not my favorite. Drown when i first heard it didnt impress me much but now its one of my favorite songs on the album. Over all the album blew me away, each song took me to another level it has to be the best Limp Bizkit album yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heavy with a different sound","review":"I wasn't a huge Limp Bizkit fan until I saw them live this past summer on the Summer Sanitarium tour. Eat You Alive and Gimme The Mic are probably the two heaviest songs on this album, and the rest is somewhat melodic. Limp Bizkit is either a band you like or don't like, and the following concept is very easy to understand; if you don't like them, then don't listen to them. I'd recommend this CD for any Limp Bizkit fan, especially for the price of $9.99 with the bonus DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Retire......please, for our sake.","review":"You should be able to pick up this one in the $4.98 bin soon enough.

You guys say you like metal? then listen to it! Limp Bizkit is no metal.. its crap... You guys just go by stuff you see on MTV.. have you not heard of good bands such as Dream Theater, or Iron Maiden? or some foreign bands like In Flames, or Opeth? whatever.. buy this album if you like, good idea, give them more money so they can make another crappy CD.

MY BIZKIT IS LIMP!!!!","review":"I cant believe people buy into this bands weak music!! It's weak, bland and rehashed!

Some have done poorly and some have done great and I think the new Limp Bizkit is great. Songs like \\"Eat You Alive\\" and \\"gimmie the mic\\" might remind you of old bizkit but new sounds like \\"underneath the gun\\" and \\"behind blue eyes\\" show some of the new style. Another good song is \\"Almost Over\\". I know we all miss Wes and he was great with bizkit but now it's a new era and I think the true bizkit fans will love this CD. It will please all tastes with mellow songs with meaning, heavy hard hitting songs and even a special song with Snoop. If you liked Limp bizkit's other studio albums you will like \\"results may vary\\" It's time to stop hating on Fred and Limp and start giving them some respect."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm loving the new cd","review":"Finally what i've been wanting to hear from bizkit. The boys have gone back to thier roots of good old rock n roll. All the songs are amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"LB Delivers","review":"While the Cd almost lost me on the slow tunes it pulled me back with the last 8 to 9 tracks.My first dislike of the slow tunes was due to my expectations of a front to back Kick A$$ CD. It does do that but in a different way than all the other CD's. After all music is about progression, right? Any one looking for a \\"Significant Other\\" or \\"CSFATHDFW\\" will be disapointed, I for one am glad they continue to progress musically. And the new guitarist, Mike Smith, doesnt let you down. He is as talented as Mr.Borland."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Album-Bring Back Boreland!","review":"There really is nothing that can be said of this album except that I hope Bizkit brings back Wes Boreland. The album is actually painfull to listen to. For starters, I have seen all the documentaries on Bizkit making this album and I think they are in deep trouble. Why is Fred Durst literally telling everyone what to play and how to play it? Where is the creativity and musicianship of anyone? Boreland was creative, or at least wanted to be. This time around it appears that whatever Durst wants, Durst gets. Not a happy mixture for a band. I say, bye bye Limp Bizkit. It was a good ride in the beginning. Now its just \\"that same old gag\\" which is not creative. Time to move on to other bands who are producing quality, CREATIVE music where everyone has an input on the final product. This album is just horrendous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissappointing yet again.....","review":"Cmmon LB, whats up with this album? Thought you says said this was your best record? Its AWFUL! I LOVED 3 dolla bill and significant other but HATED chocoloate starfish but I gave this album a chance cuz Eat you alive is pretty good. Out of all the tracks on here, \\"gimme the mic\\" and \\"drop dead\\" are the only other decent ones. I think its time for LB to just give it up. If you want to listen to a GREAT ALBUM, I suggest the new one from Korn- Take a look in the mirror. Now that is a GREAT record. Will please the old school fans and the new fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"New fan - Results are In","review":"I don't heavy metal, nor did I follow the lb in the 90's, nor do I leave reviews, but I've become pretty obsessed with Fred and limpbizkit, and here I am totally recruited ANYWAY. Started with the Blue Eyes video. Geez Fred is something else. Hmmmm, where were they .....yesterday......?? Unlike all the haterz, I am really enjoying this CD. It's pretty clear the band is maturing, and it's in the lyrics, it's in the music, it's in the awesome blends. For me, the complete grab occurred cuz they HAVE been there and through it, and extended themselves to the rest of us. Whew. Thanks lb, for all this. You go guys. Discover l.i.m.p., I say it!!p.s. Got the whole CD from Apple's iTunes, burned my CD (18 songs for $9.99), have all songs on 2 iPods, iMac & iBook iTunes, plus the CD in AAC awesome quality which goes where my iPods don't, mainly the car. Took all of 10 minutes and no gas!Housework is no longer drudgery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Results Don't Vary... THEY ALL SUCK!","review":"This CD is no more than garbage in a fancy package. Durst says that \\"everyone hates him\\" and if he has that aspect of his life so right how can he get music so wrong? You're not talented Fred Durst, give it up and go enjoy the little money you've left starting an antique victorian wicker shop. Don't buy this album and keep your hard-earned dollars for gas..."},{"rating":"2","title":"From start to finish","review":"This is the first CD I've enjoyed ALL the way through on the first listen!

I don't think so Fred......Results Do Suck!! I want my money back....and just a suggestion....I know rap-rock is \\"out\\" now....but you can't sing dude.....and pleeeeeease don't use these slams to your new CD as material for your next CD....none of us feel bad for you now that you wrote a complete CD about how \\"nobody likes me....everybody hates me....I'm gonna go eat worms\\".......Congrats Fred......you went from Nookie and Break Stuff to filling up used CD bins across the nation!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DAGNABBIT","review":"Sometimes I just NEED the fonk, gets me?

I mean, I am UNDER THE GUN, I wanna go BEHIND BLUE EYES, I am Wes Craven's worst nightmare I gotta have that funk sooooooo bad! And that's why I'll never listen to this waste of time again, because Fred can't write a song out of a paper bag.

But their new sound is great. Not too hard, not too much yelling. Just enough bass, and just enough hardness. Plus some great lyrics and beats.My favorites include 'Build A Bridge', 'Red Light Green Light', 'Let Me Down', 'Lonely World' just to name a few. Every things else is also great.If you dont like LB in the past, buy this album and have a listen i think you'll definately change your mind.***** Outta 5"},{"rating":"2","title":"New Limp Album","review":"Well, so I see Limp hasnt gone totally rap. 'Results May Vary' is an album that Freddy Durst says conveys how he really feels about alot of things, including life and what not. Hearing this, I really didn't expect much from Limp, ESPECIALLY without Wes Borland. Now expecting little from the CD and being an old school TRUE Limp fan from Jacksonville, I was basically forced to buy the CD. I popped it in, expecting to hear Fred shoveling B.S.. I was actually pleasantly suprised. Now I mean, there are many more CD's that I enjoy listening to and keep in constant rotation in my 6 disk changer in my car, but Results May Vary will stay in for awhile. \\"Eat You Alive\\" is a solid radio and MTV hit. Songs like \\"Gimme The Mic\\" and \\"Head For The Barricade\\" make you want to just mosh in your room. Results May Vary also includes a cover of The Who's \\"Behind Blue Eyes\\" which almost is more powerful than The Who's version. This is a CD that I have not regretted buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fred Durst is an idiot!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Limp Bizkit is one of the worst bands in history and Fred Durst has absolutely no talent.Why don't you people get off of this radio friendly mtv crap and go get some real music.And one more thing Fred Durst wishes he had the talent of Trent Reznor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who is Buying This Junk?","review":"This cd is worst than bad, its AWFUL. I can't believe its a hit because everyone I know thinks Fred is a total dud.

Borland must have seen the light."},{"rating":"1","title":"Washed up","review":"Limp Bizkit used to be awesome. Everyone loved them, but Durst messed everything up. Without Wes, I knew the band would plummit, but I didn't think this badly. All the Songs sound like mainstream stuff. It's as if Fred Durst really wants people to like him, so he's copying what the majority of people DO like, except really badley.Don't buy this CD"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"Limp Bizkit used to rock and have phat ass beats. Now their beats are stale and there is no emotion in the music. Fred your fears have confronted you and this album is bland, dry, and downright horrid. It has 2 songs that rock I give it that. But any band that uses \\"Speak N Spell\\" in their music, is starved for ideas. I mean come on. I got about thirty-six cents of enjoyment out of this cd. If you are not a live for Limp Bizkit fan, save your money, this cd is a major flop."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOTAL DISAPPOINTMENT","review":"I used to like limp bizkit because of their hard rock songs. I thought this one would have the same type of music.

Overall, this album sounds like a boyband tries to sing a hard music."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE","review":"This is probably the worst cd I have ever bought. \\"Eat You Alive\\" is the only song on the whole cd even worth listening to.

DO NOT BUY THIS CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Again","review":"I keep trying to get into Limp Bizkit, but the albums just get worse. It's bad enough his claim to fame was a George Micheal song.

Huge disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Behind Blue Eyes ?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?","review":"Cheap-Trick - When you get nothing else to put in your worthless album, add a cover version of a popular song.. everyone else now does it, why would LimpBizkit stay away -\\"Behind Blue Eyes\\" is the result..The worst-rock-band-of-all-time's worst album.

First of all Fred is not talented, second, this isn't heavy or fast, third, it is less intelligent than a snail, and fourth, in your slipknot review, you mentioned Good charlotte as heavy metal and Clay aitkens. NEITHER OF THESE NOR LIMP BIZKIT IS HEAVY METAL, YOU STUPID PEICE OF SH*T. If you want real metal, check out bands like Slayer, ICed Earth, Iron Maiden, Godsmack, Adema, In Flames, Disturbed, Pantera, Type O Negative, Ministry, Superjoint ritual, Biohazzard and old metallica (KILL EM' ALL is their best, don't buy saint anger, it sucks).

I have to say I liked the 1st CD but after that, everything went down hill. First of all Fred Durst has a terrible singing voice. He should stick to yelling. The music is different though i'll have to give them that much. They're moving away from that tired rap/metal formula that was a big part of their last CD. Even with the new guitarist it doesnt help much sorry to say. If you want to hear a good heavy CD then listen to the new Nothingface."},{"rating":"1","title":"ehh..........","review":"I was a fan of Significant other and really liked rollin but was disappointed with Chocolate Starfish. I then liked Eat you alive so went ahead and got results may vary but honestly, it sux. Their cover of the whos behind blue eyes SUX. I heard thats the second single....Boy are they in for it...Drown is probably the only other good song. I don't recommend it at all, if you are a die-hard bizkit fan then get it. I do recommend Korn's: Take a look in the mirror on November 18. Their new song \\"Right Now\\" beats any song on Results May Vary."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"This cd is by far the worst cd ever put out by Limp bizkit.

The Bizkit sound has all grown up now, I was kinda hpoing for the old sound to emerge, yet it is dying in every passing album. But I have no complaints about this one. And by the way, Wes' sound is hardly missed. I think I can get used to the Valium version of Limp (This would be the album's title if I had my way). But I love it anyways."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow,..,.,.,...,<><><><","review":"Still the best band in america-my opinion.

In that stupid song \\"eat you alive\\" he dosent even sing he just talks like a gangster and then screams. You cant have music if you talk and then scream.

And yes, I have heard the whole vile cd, with left me with a bad farting problem. 1 star? Please, I'm being extremely generous to these foul mouths."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible, the reviews dont lie, and im into everything","review":"first song was ok, but then you will be treated to a nice album of droll 70's rehash crap, this album pissed me off so much i gave it to a friend, No wes, no heavy, not worth it"},{"rating":"1","title":"worthlessly terrible","review":"Matthew626 couldn't have said it better. I thought the whole album was drippy, uninspiring, and downright depressing. Every song has this second rate feel, like a bad caricature of their old stuff. Fred Durst is exactly one and the same, and this new guitarist is really bland..he sounded like a backup guitarist on an old Metallica album. I was overwhelmingly surprised that out of 16 songs that there was not one that really grabbed me. I am truly shocked and disgusted that this is what they put out after 3 years of absence. I really could have made something close to it in my backyard in 3 or 4 months. Pretty shameful for a band at their stage of the game. I really was expecting something more in some way. They're done.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you people ok?","review":"Sorry, but Fred what were you thinking? This album is by far not LB's best work.... Yeah there are a few catchy songs for the TLC lovers, but this is not the LB I listened to before."},{"rating":"1","title":"Limp Bizkit are Idiots","review":"Look, someone should shoot Fred Durst. He ruined the Who, and he still can't write a song to save his life. I have not heard this piece of s**t, and I don't want to. Limp Bizkit sucked and always will."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Album Ever Made","review":"This cd is, by far, the worst album I have ever heard. This band somehow has gotten worse with every album release. If this album was instrumental, it would not be completely bad - this is not the case. My beef with this album is Fred Durst. His lyrics and voice are complete garbage. This album is proof that he has no talent/song writing skills. This band's 15 minutes are up. I'm definitely returning this album due to it being defective in terms of the quality of music on it. I feel like I should have been paid to listen to this album. This album deserves zero stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"RESULTS : THIS ALBUM IS CRAP.","review":"This guy and his whole band really annoys me to no end.I have never been a fan of this band and this new release only reminds me of that fact.Fred durst needs to stop whinning and crying like a little baby all the time.There is only one good song on the entire album.The rest are all filler material because they lack talent to make true songs.They need to retire and hopefully soon.DO NOT BUY THIS TRASH!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The long awaited new CD was well worth the wait","review":"\\"Results may Vary\\" is excellent! I didn't think anything could top \\"Significant Other\\" and \\"Chocolate Starfish and the Ice Cream Flavored Water\\", but I was wrong. I love \\"eat you alive\\". Fred did a good job at the remake of \\"Behind Blue Eyes\\". Snoop Dog was a great addition to \\"red light-green light\\". The CD has a wonderful variety. Some of the songs are slow and emotional while others are loud and rockin'. Buy this CD and make yourself very happy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Limp Bizkit is back","review":"At first I listened to the album and hated it because it sounded so different, but after listening to it a couple times it started to really grow on me. This album is a lot more mellow than the previous albums. My favorite songs on the album are \\"underneath the gun\\", \\"down another day\\", and \\"build a bridge\\". Some of the songs really suck like \\"red light-green light\\" and \\"the only one\\". These songs sound like filler songs that were written just to take up time on the cd. Just listen to their lyrics, they are really lame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where next for fred durst??","review":"This really is terrible,terrible stuff,Ive listen to this album twice and i'd rather stick burning matches in my eyes than listen to it again,its muck.can you give an album minus stars?because this album desearves it.I know it might seem im coming down hard on limp bizkit but its just such a dissappointment for me to hear how bad this is,I knew after Wes left that the band as a whole might suffer but I didnt think this much.DONT BUY THIS ALBUM,even if you are a fan,give the money you were going to buy this album with to the homeless guy around the corner because you'll get a whole lot more satisfaction from it...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Limp bizkit has totaly redeemed themselves","review":"I've been a listener of limp bizkit from day one first album best rock album in a decade, second one was ok and the third one i loved at first and hated in the end, then they go make this album by far better then the last two they've came with......Best song is build a bridge, the new guitarest is what limp needed to take it back to there roots and with this album they have great album it's a must have!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome CD","review":"This is a great CD AND is Highly reccommended!!!!!!!!

GREAT CD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Best Songs:Red Light Green LightBehind Blue EyesBuild a Bridge"},{"rating":"2","title":"rap sucks","review":"This album is pretty good. I would have given it 5 stars but I have to take one away for the rapping on the album. If Fred would quit trying to be a rapper and quit having special rapper guests on his records they would be an awesome band. Rap sucks, word to your mutha."},{"rating":"2","title":"An objective review","review":"Seems everyone either loved this disc or hated it.Here's my two cents, and some truly objective comments from someone who is neither for or against LB.The album is solid. Different than their other work, but extremely good.In my opinion, the album should actually be \\"Take me back Brittney\\", but that aside, Fred has shown his poetic side with some fairly nice lyrics.All in all, I would recommend this to anyone who everyone who enjoys LB and to anyone who likes good music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst album in the world.","review":"This has to be one of the dullest and most retarded albums to ever hit stores. I used to really like Limp Bizkit, they at one time were my favorite band, but I have lost all respect for them with the release of this lame excuse of an album. The lyrics on this album are absolutely retarded. Fred Durst still thinks he's cool and hardcore. In Gimme the Mic he says \\"...you wantin' to hear some heavy ass metal that can penetrate deep into your ear drums? Turn it up motherf***er Turn it up motherf***er Turn it up and step into a world that you've never seen when I'm fiending for a microphone I'm a mircrophone fiend.\\" Unfortunately, the album is suprisingly tame and does not deliver the \\"some heavy ass metal that can penetrate deep into your ear drums.\\" The songs are tame and very mediocre and the lyrics are about as stupid as you can get. Skip this album and buy KoRn's \\"Take A Look In The Mirror\\" album coming November 18th. A much better choice for anyone who listens to music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misogynistic trash","review":"If Fred Durst had a brain,he'd be dangerous. RESULTS MAY VARYis basically more of the same from Limp Bizkit-a hateful knuckle-dragging celebration of idiocy bereft of a single intelligentthought. RESULTS MAY VARY made me sick."},{"rating":"1","title":"How can you call this crap amazing????","review":"Holy geez these lyrics are so awful. I'm so sick of hearing about beating people up and the word BABY 53 TIMES a FREAKING song. Fred rushed through the lyrics to meet a deadline and it shows. The music is terrific. It has depth and variety, just well written. But the lyrics destroy it. Maybe it's not Wes they should've kicked out of the band..........."},{"rating":"2","title":"Limp Bizkit's best work to date!!!!!!","review":"For those true LB fans, Reults May Vary is the best work to come from Freddy D and the gang. The CD has an awsome mix of heavy riffs and songs that simply chill. LB seems to have a more mature sound. They have come a long way. Some of my favorites are Underneith the Gun, Eat you alive, red light-green light and Almost over. Durst is a verstile genious. True LB fans will have this CD flowing for quite some time. I can't wait until the next."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS is what metal is all about!","review":"God I love this album. Limp Bizkit is like the best band ever. This album is so brutal and technical. The riffs here are very difficult to play. The drum beats are over 500 bpm and the bass here is so heavy and awesome. And my god! Fred Durst's violent lyrics and vocals are awesome! Best LB album to date! Rock on Limp Bizkit!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! \\\\m/For slow ones I was joking. All that needs to be said is that it's 2006 (this is an edited review) and this still ranks as The Worst. Album. Ever.God hating this band is fun ;)"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Dissapointment","review":"Ok, First things first, I didnt purchase this album, and it was the smartest move i have made in a long time. i have heard it though and the only songs i enjoy are \\"Gimme the mic\\", and \\"Eat you alive\\", the rest of the album is garbage. What happened to the song \\"crack addict\\" they played it at wrestlemania to hype up this album and now it doesnt appear. anyways, this band needs to listen the their original album \\"three dollar bill y'all\\" and then it might remind them how good they can be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unbelievable!!!","review":"I am so pleased at how much Limp Bizkit has grown as Musicians. Mike Smith is truelly a great replacement. This album has been long awaited and Rocks. Red light,Green light with Snoop makes yuou shake your \\"tailfeather\\". Drown, The Only One, Let me Down,and Build a Bridge are so honest and kick a**. Fred has evolved with his writing and you can see it all through this album!!!!I can't wait till you tour!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Im just not feeling it.","review":"Ive been a hardcore Limp fan since Significant other. I even stuck around during that Chocolate Star Fish thing, but like I said, Im just not feeling this album. I started listening to Limp because how unique and hardcore it was and this album just doesnt deliver that. It almost sounds like Coldplay without the piano. As bad as his album sucked, Im sad to say: I miss Wes. My suggestion...just listen to someone elses and make your own decision, thats what I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"its limp bizkit! will always be the shiz-nit. hard core, '04","review":"I like this album because it reminds me of how angry I was when I was 14 and my parents wouldn't by me any cool clothes so I could look bad. I hate posers, which is something Fred and I have in common. And when I was 14, I didn't know how to express my feelings, so I would shout the F word all the time, which people thought was really cool and hard core anyway. And the guitars have distortion, which is hard core. One time I did it for the nookie, which I thought touched the inner tough guy in me. I always wanted to show the world how bad I was by getting on stage with Christian Aguilara and we could all dance and try to hi-5 Eminem, who is just another whiny white boy. It's LIMP BISKIT! F***!

I personally thought the pictures were not the quality that I had been used to and I thought that it was hard to get used to. I had had a Visioneer 7600 for several years and I am going back to Visioneer. Also, I expect to get a manual with my scanner, not have to go on line every time I want to find out something."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scanner has problems, Canon won't fix/admit.","review":"At first, this scanner seemed a good deal, so I bought two. Unfortunately, both scanners seem to suffer the same problem. The motor seems to stall halfway through a scan. You hear a sound like the motor backing up, then it stops. I ended up writing a small BAT file:\\" cd c:\\\\pskill -t ppscanmg.exepskill -t paprport.exeexit \\"To end the scanner's driver process, then I unplug it, and replug it, and attempt to scan again. It takes me several attempts to get the thing to scan one page. I contacted CANON, but they just BS around the problem, never offering a fix.In the end, the scanner does fast good scans, when it decides to work correctly. I wish I would have bought a different brand."},{"rating":"2","title":"LiDE 60 Good Value","review":"The LiDE 60 was easy to set up, and the software installed on my Mac with no problem. The buttons on the scanner automatically call up the needed software application, and the scanner is always ready, coming on as soon as my computer is turned on or brought out of sleep mode. The pdf button is especially appreciated. It converts any document into a pdf file for easy storage, e-mailing or uploading. The scanner is a bit noisy when operating. I use my scanner for light home use, and am satisfied with it. For serious business use, consider a quieter, more heavy-duty scanner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty darn good scanner","review":"After extensive research, this was the scanner for me. I had to fuss around with its settings to get it to scan books, which isn't obvious how to do at first. Compared to the scanners I use at work, this one is fast. I can scan about 100-150 pages in an hour, including the time it takes to save the page as part of a pdf file. It's slower if you don't have USB 2.0 ports. It works great with OCR text recognition. It's slim and light, and with just one cord, it's a good space-saver. The color scanning of pictures makes the colors looks a little duller than the original print versions, but the images are crisp and clear on screen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid product with easy setup!","review":"I needed a scanner that was usb-powered and portable to take with me on the road. I had previously used the LiDE 35 my son had for school, and found it fit the bill, but the scanner had to go back and it isn't readily available anymore. When the LiDE 60 dropped below $70, I figured it was time to buy. Setup was straightforward (iBook running Tiger), the TWAIN drive installed right into Photoshop and the initial scans were excellent. The day after I got the scanner, one job more than paid for it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Canon scanner LiDE 60","review":"I've had this for a couple of years and have had no issues with it. It makes great copies of old (30+years) photographs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Compact Scanner","review":"This is a space saving, user friendly scanner! It has great options for scanning, including multiple scanning with separate files. This is great for doing several small jobs with one scan! Each is its' own file...saves time! It is thin and narrow, fits in a much smaller space than other scanners & yet does large size pages. I love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"ehhh.... I APPROVE!","review":"Okay so yeah the loud screeching of the scanner will probably grind your nerves and test your patience like it did to me, but HEY HEY the price was mighty nice X3. Plus the lid adjusts to what you're scanning in.Also the scanner comes with at least five scanning or picture assist programs to improve the quality and details of the pic. The scanner has three easy fuctions buttons: one for email and two for pics.So overall it was 20 bucks more than my other choice , but i'm very happy with my descision. You can even reduce fading and adjust the backlight so the little detail are more noticeable.To sum up I LIKE this scanner ,not love like. I WAS SOOOOOOOOO happy when i found out that my new scanner is like the same size of my laptop .

They cook like a dream. Outstanding for eggs, french toast, omelettes, etc. Watch the Friday Sales for the best prices on this cookware here at Amazon.com. The non-stick coating will NOT wear off if you follow the manufacturer's instructions that come with the pan. Do not put it in the dishwasher. Do not cook at high temperatures. DO condition the pan occasionally with a small amount of vegetable oil. If you follow these steps you will have a pan you can enjoy for a long, long, time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Versatile Skillet","review":"This is a great pan. It is good thick sturdy pan that heats evenly. Sautes nicely. Easy to clean. No small joints for food to get stuck in. Comfortable handle that attaches firmly to the skillet.

It is perfect size for grilled cheese sandwiches."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"We've warn ours out, it was part of a 12 piece set we got as a wedding gift almost 6 years ago.

I found Aron to be arrogant. And quite frankly, I find it hard to believe that anyone has had so many close calls with death. Hunted by a bear, outrunning avalanches, surviving multiple storms, nearly struck by lightning, and that's by page 50 and it never lets up! And who cares that he graduated at the top of his class? The Steven Venebles and Jon Krakauers out there bring geography, geology, culture, history, wilderness, human relationships and intense realness to their adventures. Aron could have done this with the experiences he has had, but failed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never hit the backcountry or a book with Aron","review":"Arrogant, self indulgent, and reckless - three words that describe Aron Ralston. I don't know what I was expecting, but certainly after such an ordeal I would have thought some genuine appreciation of life would have been learned. His entire account, from the choke stone to the flashbacks, made Aron come across as someone who was \\"asking\\" for trouble and that his luck had finally run out. From the avalanche to the Havasupai experience, Aron never learned to respect the magnitude and power of the wilderness. This account was disappointing at best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Map Sucks on Kindle","review":"After purchasing Ralston's work on my kindle, I began reading and was disgruntled to discover two low res, nearly worthless, maps that would be of great interest to any reader at the onset of a new story.

It was absolutely PAINFUL to read this young person's self-indulgent search for adrenaline and reckless disregard for his friend's life and limbs. He absolutely DID \\"get what I asked for\\". And even though he wrote those words, you don't get the sense that they are sincere. AWFUL and SHAME ON YOU ARON!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"I have never been forced to review something before until I read this book. And perhaps if Aron had stuck to the events of his entrapment, I would still be able to claim a review free life. But he weaves a 320 page self inflating yarn about his life about which only his family would care.No one cares that he was top of his class, or of his reckless previous adventures. He was on the fast track to an accident and it arrived. I am only thankful that no one was hurt trying to rescue him on some stupid mountain climb. He learned nothing from his ordeal and neither will you.It causes nausea that society has rewarded this fool with book and movie deals for being stupid and arrogant. He is a joke. And so is the book... do not read it. You get to read so few books in a lifetime that you should not waste even a second on this one.

I think his accident in Blue John Canyon serves as a reminder of mortality, both to the readers, and hopefully to himself. It was a sign that he needs to slow down. Nonetheless, I admire his dedication to his dream. In today's society, so many people aren't working to live, but living to work. I enjoyed how his coworkers at Intel were amazed that he would leave a great job for the wilderness. I can't say I would have done the same thing. It is a beautiful story. He is lucky to have such great relations with his family. One can tell, by reading the story, that he is very content with his life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Read","review":"This was a well written and intriquing story. Nevermind that the fellow made a mistake. I forgive him of that. We all make mistakes. What was so compelling was just the story of how the human spirit can overcome dire circumstances. I recommend this to anyone who has the least interest in hiking, canyoneering, climbing and in general, outdoor sports of that nature. Once I got to about page 75 or so, it was very hard to put the book down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent fast read. Well written","review":"Just finished this book. Aron's survival of entrapment can be attributed to his methodical, disciplined thinking. This book gives insight into his past experiences (victories and mistakes) in his short yet passionate mountaineering life and how they came into play to survive his entrapment.I close the last page being very encouraged and inspired by his incredible expeirence. Great writing (can't believe Aron wrote this by himself - it flows so smoothly) and incredible photos. A good gift for someone recovering from surgery or just going through tought times. It teaches you to value your relationships and make them right when you can - for tomorrow may be too late. Thanks Aron."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Mom Loved It","review":"I can't say much about the book because I got it for my mother as a gift. She said she loved it and it made the movie more enjoyable to watch. The seller made sure the book was processed and shipped very quickly!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting read, a bit too descriptive.","review":"I initially only bought this book because I enjoyed the film with James Franco and I noticed the price had dropped on the book to only $4. It's a suspenseful read, especially knowing what the eventual end to the story is. Ralston does some great switches in the narrative to describe some of his past conquests as well as describing what was occurring in the rest of the world while he was trapped, a great addition. My main problem with the book would be that, on occasion, Ralston was a bit too descriptive and flowery in his writing, slowing the story down to a snail's pace. Purchase if interested."},{"rating":"2","title":"interesting ordeal, average writing","review":"Ralston's story of survival is truly amazing. When I first heard about it, I had no idea how many days he was stuck, and couldn't imagine how he went about cutting off his own arm. His account sheds light on the whole ordeal, and is pretty interesting.Do not expect \\"Touching the Void\\", or \\"Into Thin Air\\" with this work, however. Between a Rock and a Hard Place has an awkward tempo, and there are plenty of parts of the book where it is obvious Ralstons editor wanted more pages. Lets face it: there is only so much he can come up about being stuck in the same spot for days. It is not exactly a masterpiece of writing, either. I did enjoy the book, but it probably would have been more effective as a short story.As for the four stars, I would probably go 3.5, but they don't do half stars here so rounded up."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted to like this book, but...","review":"While I admire Aron's strength to get through a situation I would not have, there were simply too many issues with this book to give it a good review. Like many others, I found him to come across as quite arrogant. Especially the ending about how all the media wanted to talk to him, the concerts, etc-. I wish he would have learned a bigger lesson than \\"It's not what you do\\" (and even that felt hollow). His flashbacks to past adventure trips were boring (sorry). Later on, i ended up skipping those chapters b/c i just found him to be a thrill seeker & not very admirable. It was interesting to see the background of the search, and what his parents & friends were going though -- that was probably the best part of it & those bits really weren't about him. Again, with all due respect, I wish I could give this a better review..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Detailed, Exciting and Memorable read","review":"If you've see and loved the movie as I did, reading the book is the next logical step. Everything you love about the movie is here and in such great detail. Aron leaves no stone unturned in telling the story of his remarkable experience and his life. I can't recommend this book enough for anyone who loved the movie and even someone who hasn't. The only criticism I have is some of the chapters can get tedious when he's talking about his other outdoor experiences before his most famous one. Other than that, it's a near perfect read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous book for lovers of good writing & GREAT stories","review":"This is one of the best \\"adventure stories\\" I've read, & I've read many--from ALL of Jon Krakauer's to Band of Brothers, & anything in between. This is such a compelling story that the author's \\"just the facts,\\" \\"mechanical engineer\\" writing style is perfect. Mr. Ralston IS an engineer by training, which really shows in his analytical approach to his predicament, his relatively \\"detached\\" evaluation of his options as the clock ticks down on his likelihood of survival, & his execution of the final option. It's a fabulous read for EVERYONE, as there are so many life lessons, both spelled out & between the lines. I could not put it down. The movie, btw, was beautifully true to the book. I actually saw it first, which made me buy the book. It was one of those rare times that the movie & book really made each other \\"better.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly Compelling","review":"Aron's story is one of fear, frustration, bravery and a willingness to survive that is truly captivating.

He has cashed in on his stupidity and misfortune by becoming an \\"inspirational speaker.\\" (Maybe he could also endorse Swiss Army knives, eh?)His book offered a golden opportunity for him to do some good for the world. He had been asked to include a major section of advice for other hikers, on how to prepare, safety, what to take with you, etc. To hell with other people, figured the author; no such useful information was included.The book itself is a pretty good account, though the whole book is pretty skimpy for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"marks on the book","review":"This book arrived with black marks all over it.

So I picked up the book for a week vacation in Costa Rica and read it in...less than 127 hours. Say, 6 1/2 hours. I do not relate to the author who likes to do scary stuff by himself, but his reflections on why he is \\"out there in nature\\" make sense to me. The process he goes through after he is stuck is incredibly pragmatic and soul-searching. A good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a journey!","review":"Excellent book. Very, very detailed - sometimes too detailed for the average non-climber who is not familiar with the vocabulary of an experienced outdoorsman. There are a lot of technical climbing and gear descriptions. The chapters alternate between Mr. Ralston's hike during which he got stuck by the boulder and past expeditions. I especially liked the stalking bear story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just amazing","review":"I really enjoyed this book except for all the climbing detail...too many geographic names of climbing places and such just made my eyes glaze over. He is a true inspiration of the desire to survive."},{"rating":"2","title":"vivid read and true tale of survival","review":"Great read and tale of someone who managed to survive a harrowing experience. Recommended to people who like to get immersed in one mans adventure struggle"},{"rating":"1","title":"So dry and dull...like the desert air he experienced..","review":"Honestly, it was a great documentary if you are interested in his story but nothing truly exciting happens until the last chapter or two of the story...it's so dull to begin with and for me, it was quiet painful to read. I am happy he made it out alive and it's pretty inspirational, but what makes his story so much better than anyone else whose had a tragic accident and lived? Well...if you want to know so bad, put yourself in the agonizing pain and read this 300 page story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying","review":"The author relates many of his previous experiences in addition to being trapped under a rock. He was so careless/reckless, he could have been the inspiration for dumb and dumber. The only surprise in this book is that the author survived as many things as he did. By buying this book, you actually contribute or reinforce the authors stupidity."}]`),C={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:E},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:B,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},N={class:"card-container"},O=["disabled"],x={key:0},H={key:1};function R(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=y("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your SNAP 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",N,[(a(!0),i(w,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(a(),b(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",H,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",x,"See more"))],8,O)):p("",!0)])}const W=d(C,[["render",R],["__scopeId","data-v-29a12c23"]]),j=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"glossary/38.md","filePath":"glossary/38.md"}'),L={name:"glossary/38.md"},P=Object.assign(L,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(W)]))}});export{j as __pageData,P as default};
