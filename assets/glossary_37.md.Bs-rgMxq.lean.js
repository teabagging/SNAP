Her voice has never been her strong suit, so it seems strange to select a genre of music that relies so heavily on the vocals. Also, Nanci's style seems to be getting more and more laid back with each album release, now almost to the point of inducing sleep. I am a long time Nanci fan, and I long for the days when Nanci's sound was more aggressive and challenging. The CD packaging was barren of any extras -- no lyrics, few pictures -- which makes me wonder if there was a reason why Nanci's label put as little into this project as possible.I've been wrong before. I had a similar negative reaction to Flyer, but it eventually became one of my favorite albums of hers.

Nanci is not a natural torch singer, nor do most of these songs conform to conventional understandings of 'torch songs'. Her version of one of the outstanding songs of this genre, 'Wee Small Hours', is successful, but scarcely departs from the version recorded on 'Clock Without Hands'. Something similar could be said about 'Drops From the Faucet', and 'Brave Companion': indeed, the subdued and intimate version of the latter on 'Storms' is more compelling. The three Tom Waits songs are pleasant listening, but the originals convey much more authenticity of feeling.I have all Nanci's albums and, while conceding that some have flaws, feel that all represent considerable achievement. The new album, despite being blessed with Nanci's distinctive sweet, evocative voice, is a disappointment"},{"rating":"1","title":"thud","review":"Nanci is not a torch singer--this was an unfortunate decision to make this album.

I do not use the amplifier bar with this workout because the darn thing keeps on unlocking and I'm concerned that if I execute a move and it unlocks while I'm doing it ,I will get a serious injury.

But I have heard him do far better, and this is a disappointment.The vocals on this album have two directions: low snearing growls and yelps. That's it. It sounds like Mike Patton is trying to start bar fights, and although that may fit in the theme of the album, it doesn't do much for the listener except make him/her think that Patton is a meathead shoving people around. Gone are the complex vocal melodies and depth that made him a cult legend, here we see him riding on the coattails of former work while he builds a reputation as an indie businessman instead of musician.It's sad to see your heroes fall from grace, especially when they're only in their early 30's and have so much left to give. I hope the macho wears off soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trying too hard to be \\"creative.\\"","review":"i must admit that i havent listened to this album. but, however, i have seen them live very recently, and they were really annoying. it semmed like mike patton was just trying his hardest to seem like a creative genious, he was flailing around making noises with his mouth. wow, anyone can do that. as a matter of fact, i think i will put out a record like this and soon i will be hailed as a creative genious. keep an eye out for me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Debut Album","review":"Very good CD from start to finish...Best songs are Good hates a coward,Sweet Smell of Success,Sir Yes Sir, and Laredo.Go buy it cause Mike Patton owns all.

Deliver","review":"This is going to be a short review because this album is basically what you would expect if later-day Faith No More met The Jesus Lizard - an enjoyable kick in the face of an album. The guitar work is distinctly that of Duane Denison and Patton is in the most straight-forward heavy rock mode since _Album of the Year_. The creepiness of some of Patton's vocals is very reminiscent of his best work on _Angel Dust_. Pick this up if you're a fan of either band, or if you want to know who the singers in bands like Papa Roach and Linkin Park are trying to sound like. When it comes to today's \\"hard rock\\" - it all comes back to Patton."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh, now I get it.","review":"The first listen in the car had me thinking it was a pretty good rock record. I usually pick up most Bungler stuff and it was cool to hear Patton flexing some more melodic muscles. But the more I listen to this the more I realize how complicated it really is. Don't let the rock veneer fool you, this is weird, dark music, much more sophisticated than I thought after the first time through. In this sense, it's a little like California. It doesn't sound a thing like it, but the freakiness only becomes apparent after you've given it a little time to ripen. Also, \`Point and Click' sounds a little like Live Skull, and it's been a helluva long time since I've heard anything with that particular influence that was any good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tomahawk","review":"Wow! I had the luck to hear them play this album live, first, but this album is fantastic! Similar vocal stylings to Faith No More and Mr. Bungle, but much more \\"Artistic noise.\\" Mike Patton is pretty heavy on the keyboards and distorted vocals. \\"Sir Yes Sir\\" is a great song, a bit of distortion, \\"God hates a coward,\\" all the songs on this album are very up to par for these huys."},{"rating":"2","title":"A solid hard rock record...","review":"It took me at least five listens to get used to Mike Patton singing within a more traditional song structure.I'm a big Mike Patton fan and a Jesus Lizard fan prior to their Shot album.Tomahawk definately has the mechanical, precise, pounding sound of the Jesus Lizard while now adding the more coherant vocals of Mike Patton over David Yow.As far as Mike Patton's prior work goes - the singing is more similar to Album of the Year than anything else. It's definately more structured than stuff he's been doing with Bungle and Fantomas. I recommend this album and would be happy if this band releases more solid records like this debut."},{"rating":"2","title":"Always Unique","review":"While Tomahawk is being lumped into the \\"super group\\" category by the media, listening to the album leaves no doubt that Mike Patton dominates the proceedings with his screams, whispers, croons and every other trick in his verbal bag. He often uses his voice as an instrument going for a feeling more so than a meaning and it matches very well with the sometimes creepy and even trancy beats and rythyms of the group.Which doesn't mean that they don't rock because they do on songs like Flashback, Jockstrap, and Moloccio but my personal favorites are Point and Click, Honeymoon, and God Hates a Coward which are tensioned filled. If I could compare them with anyone it could be Tool, just without the extra b.s. warped through the mind of Patton.The only reason this cd doesn't get 5 stars, is because like another reviewer I feel some of the songs are too short. Especially Point and Click.Well worth buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty good","review":"I admit i wasn't that impressed with flashback when it was previewed, but the album proved that Tomahawk are overall a really cool listen. There is nothing terribly original, it contains the typical formula for a rock album, but the actual Tomahawk sound is pretty unique. The only downside i can think of is that some of the songs could have been looked at a bit better, some don't seem complete and aren't as long as they could have been like 'Point and Click'. A brilliant track only let down by the length. That's all I can think of that's wrong with this album. Saying this though it is probably one of the least interesting projects Mike Patton has ever done. From what I've heard Peeping Tom is going to be so much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"At least I think I like music...","review":"This album is quite a disappointment, especially after Fantomas. I had high hopes for this other \\"supergroup\\" of Patton's, but it was for naught. This album sounds like FNM's \\"Album of the Year\\" (admit it, that one sucked hard), but not quite that bad. Basically, bland, uninspired, uninventive, yet competant hard rock, which is sad because I know Patton can do better. I can't believe that anyone who's listened to and enjoyed \\"Disco Volante\\", \\"Fantomas\\", \\"The Director's Cut\\", \\"California\\", \\"Mr. Bungle\\", \\"Adult Themes for Voice\\", \\"Panzo Oltranzista\\", and even the barely-listenable-but-admirable Maldoror album, not to mention the majestic \\"Angel Dust\\" and the less majestic but still rockin \\"The Real Thing\\" and \\"King for a Day, Fool for a Lifetime\\", could be the least bit impressed by this extremely unforgettable material."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blech.","review":"Weak effort.

This super addictive CD has had me blasting it for months and while thier newer album \\"Mit Gas\\" is really good I think I am trying to exhaust this album. I can't do it. This is like a new wave Faith No More with a Mr. Bungle lyrical twist. How Ironic. There is some elements of the band Tool or A Perfect Circle that I cannot place. I've even found in it some old Joy Division or Bauhaus in thier production and bass playing. Simply one of the pure funnest albums I've listened to reguardless of familiars. Simply put, this music is simple(weather talented or not) and the lyrics seem to be entirely impulsive and bent with Pattons own lunacy that is never short of entertaining.I recomend this album most highly and for people that can take off some of thier most crucial criticisms enough to recognize the fluidity and nostalgia of something that is so much darn fun!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Patton project...great!","review":"More close to his work in Faith No More, Tomahawk's self titled has some interesting rhythm sections, but stays very simple.Additional madness blasts from nowhere, characteristic of a Bungle's record.

The author has a compiler already coded which he breaks down piece by piece and shows you how the pieces work.Unfortunately, instead of only giving you what you need to know for a specific piece, alot of future material is added too soon because it's already in the code. What would've been good is to trim out that stuff and give examples of code that wasn't part of the complete compiler but explained a specific point and only that point.Too much time is spent explaining pre-existing code that implements the modules in a ready-built compiler, and not enough time is spent describing what each module in a compiler is supposed to do and how you'd do it yourself or alternative ways of implementing functionality.If only there was a compiler book that was halfway between this one and the Dragon book..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly constructed, and teeming with errors.","review":"Considering the nature of the text, I find it most peculiar that Mr Appel doesn't own a java compiler.

Not only does it not teach you anything about compilers, but if you already know something, then it serves to confuse you.The author has tried to explain things using an example and \\"steps\\" through the process of writing a compiler.

If you are looking for a useful book on compilers, I would recomend \\"Compilers\\" by Aho, Sethi and Ulman (the Dragon Book), or \\"Crafting a Compiler\\" by Fisher and LeBlanc.

And never reread what he wrote.To make it even worse the book is full of errors, and bugs in code examples.

However this book reveals nothing new, and saftely treads through the old predujuices seeking to lay entire blame on the shoulders of Chamberlain. The work is convincing in this aim, only if you fail to take a step back from the argument. As with all historical works it is important to have a look in the authors other hand, the one behind his back. It is here that the authors own preconceptions fanish and the truth is clearer. Opinions on History cannot be wholly lifted from one source, and it is important to examine historians who feel different to Ruggiero if a whole understanding is to be gleemed on the topic.

Of course, I had help: I saw it for the first time on \\"Mystery Science Theater 3000\\", and having Mike and the 'Bots mock it incessantly helps one to get through it.

It starts out at an archaelogical dig in Arizona, where the skeleton of a werewolf is unearthed. This starts a chain reaction of werewolves terrorizing the town. In an odd casting move, Martin Sheen's brother Joe Estevez appears early in the film and then seems to disappear! Anyway, eventually, the entire cast seems to be replaced by foreign actors, who can't act and can barely speak! While the make-up on nearly transformed werewolves isn't too bad, the continue to change until becoming ridiculous Halloween mask style creatures with bear bodies.

Keep your eye on a character named Yuri. His hair changes color and style at least six times. Even though the film takes place in Arizona, all the lead actors have European accents.

But the highlight is the ageing security guard turning into a were-wolf as he speeds along in his car. That's got to be a first. It is so totally diabolical, I can't say. Tony Zarandista should be allowed to make another movie, just as long as he promises not to get any better. \\"Geniuses\\", \\"wunderkinds\\" and so forth are ten a penny.

The fight scene was laughable, you could see their punches didn't connect, not even close to connecting. The chase scene with the woman and the \\"werewolf\\" was laughable. The dubbing was pathetic.

I only wish her story would have continued.Siren's story (as well as her character) was a little weak and and Cyn's was fine but both of these could have been secondary characters in Fancy's story.As a Skye fan, I'm glad I bought this book despite the bad reviews."},{"rating":"2","title":"Skye's Legacy","review":"Haven't had a chance to read Vixens yet, but have all the other in Skye's Legacy and absolutly love them.Looking forward to reading Vixens very much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bittersweet but much needed ending","review":"Having diligently followed these families over the years it was very sad to see it come to an end. But it was a necessary end. These families have been strung so far out you take up half the book reciting the family ties. I think it was bizarre to write this in a 3-n-1 book. I don't know why it wasn't just one story line. Its not like all Bertrice Smalls other books didn't have multiple story lines and we managed to follow along. I thought Fancy's story was the strongest and most interesting and should have been the main story in the book with the other cousins as the sub stories. Not a bad read strong start, boring middle, rushed ending but good closure for the story line."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mix of interesting personal stories and boring science","review":"This book really should have been two. I found the first half, where the author explained what it was like for him to 'break into' the Antartic meteorite-searching world, quite interesting. Unfortunately the second half delved into meteorite-recovery statistics in WAY too much detail -- that portion of the book I feel would have been better left out, with the information contained published in scientific journals. Overall I finished this book wishing for more personal stories about 'life in the Antartic' and 'dealing with the science community'. Also I wished something on 'what to look for when on the ice, and how to do recovery correctly' had been included.But it is a \\"better-than-OK\\" addition to my meteorite library. I recommend it for the non-casual meteorite-lover."},{"rating":"2","title":"too complex to fully enjoy","review":"Once more, McCullough has populated her well researched historical novel with too many characters on whom too little time is spent for the audience to understand and appreciate.

This book is BORING. Hundreds of pages of political soap opera with some action here and there. After 400 pages, I just can't suffer through it anymore.

I've never been a big fan of Roman history or culture; I always thought of them as highly overrated. Well, this series is changing my mind. All of these books completely immerse the reader in a world separated by ours by two millenia, but I for one was amazed by how many things haven't changed. I didn't think this book was quite as good as the ones before, perhaps because I didn't find Caesar as interesting as I did Sulla or Marius (I did read McCullough's disclaimer about Caesar's intelligence, looks and physical prowess, but I still find him a little too good to be true). I'm currently halfway through \\"Caesar's Women\\" and can't wait for \\"Caesar\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb","review":"One of the most powerfull books ever written!

Luckily the author has written a good summary of the two previous books, \\"The first man in Rome\\", and \\"The Grass Crown\\". So, it was possible to understand the events leading to the beginning of this book.I like the way the author presents this book and the characters. Being this a historical novel, I appreciate the efforts the author has made to incorporate as much fact as possible into the story.The characters are very real and extremely interesting.The book, though it lacks a central plot, seems to be more like an account of events and dates, but I really enjoyed this change in \\"content\\".I had already read \\"Ceasar's women\\" and I enjoyed that one very much also.I acknowledge Colleen McCollough as a serious writer and I appreciate her quality and precision in her narratives.Great book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious writing style, but pretty good historically","review":"Far below the quality of the first two books. I read it mainly for the historical details since McCullough does seem to get her facts straight, but by the tenth time she used the phrases \\"Fortune's Favorite\\" or \\"favored by fortune\\" I was ready to puke. If only Robert Graves' skill at writing could be combined with McCullough's interest in historical truth!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Scope! Precision! Excellence!","review":"Fortune's Favorites follows some of the great Roman personalities on their respective rises to greatness: Ceasar, Pompey and Crassus, the members of the First Triumvirate (as history calls them). Unfortunately I took a long break in the middle of this book because other reading came up but it stands just as consistent and well-researched as the rest of the First Man in Rome series has been. McCullough gives a great telling of Spartacus and the ineptitude of numerous consuls as well as continuing to develop Caesar as the fully-rounded man he was. Just buy the books, keep reading them, and even for well-educated students of Classics, McCullough always has something more to offer.

If your characters run all over the Realms, then the whole series is recommended. If not, Faith and Avatars, and (probably) Demihuman Deities will be more than enough.My one gripe with the whole series is I don't think the specialty priests were playtested, or playtested enough. Some of them are overly powerful and can run roughshod over a campaign. To all DM's I caution, look carefully at the description of a particular specialty priest before allowing them to be PC's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deities & Demigods with a face lift","review":"A second rate FAITHS & AVATARS.

How much do you know about Sex? How aggressive are you?I was hoping to learn more about myself by taking these tests. The results on some tests are difficult to calculate. But once you muddle through and find your score - you are not really given a good explanation of what your results mean. It tells me very little about myself that I scored with the top 10 percent of those taking the test. I was hoping for explanations of what my answers say about me. This book lacks any deep thought-provoking explanations about your answers. I was hoping for it to say something about my personality. I was looking for more explanation into who I am based on the results of the tests. This book lacks the \\"that's interesting\\" factor from your test results. I was a bit disappointed by that. I took the tests and it seemed to reveal very little about the real me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very informative","review":"This book lacks insight and details. After a given test the author gives you his personal view of the test you just took but doesn't give you an interpretaion of your score results.

From the death and destruction that follows the movie quickly turns to the classic dark and stormy night with a bunch of misguided teens in a bus that has an accident. After checking into the trailer park, things get weird and wonderful. The best parts are with the comic relief zombies... Which is everyone except the kids and the \\"beautiful woman\\". The making of the Jerky scene is some of the best film on record, and the Elvis like singer is comedy gold. There are plenty of scares and laughs at the same time in this movie.The extras are a little light, but the interview with the actors is as good as the movie. If you like bad horror movies, buy this as soon as you can."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty darn good","review":"I was expecting to be let down again, since i had a few flops come my way... This movie is pretty darn cool. Seems the main complaint is that the people in the park aren't zombies. They are, but they aren't. They are the damned - much like 2001 maniacs. This is a story of someone basically selling their soul for revenge, and damning all in the trailer park. They are generally zombies and \\"do\\" eat people, it was mentioned a couple times. They can only be out at night though so they do not follow typical zombie rules. The movie is fun and gory with rockabilly flair. I have basically mentioned 2001 maniacs and that is mostly what this is like, so if you enjoyed that film - this is close to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie","review":"Trace Adkins is awesome in this very entertaining movie.

I thought it would be a real history of Danvers State with photos and interviews. Yes, there are some snippets of interviews that the author did, but in other places he states that he can't reveal what people said about working there- why say that you talked to them then? Also, there is no structure to the book- it is really just a collection of musings by the author about why he thinks he became obsessed with the Hospital-- there is really hardly any text at all. The whole book is really just a showcase of the author's pastel drawings- while they are nice pastels, it was just not what I was expecting.

No exceptions.But does this happen? Of course not! There you sit, suspended in a limbo of horrid film-making for what feels like hours, trapped in an alternate reality of Cheese.This is not a \\"fun\\" bad movie, or a \\"classic\\" bad movie, it's just BAD.

This is live tv and amazing stuff, even 50 years after it was made. Lewis is manic, scarey, mean, vicious and hilarious. Martin is himself - laid back, funny and with that beautiful voice. The lowlight is seeing Jerry's Dad sing. What a ham and it's a great laugh to hear Martin intro him and say he's on not because he's Jerry's Dad, but b/c he's a talented singer in his own right -- yea...right! Anyway, each show ends with a great short version of what I can only imagine was the insantiy of their stage show. Brilliant, but seven hours is toooo short."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm still laughing","review":"These videos are well worth the price for all the enjoyment they have brought.

The writing felt very disjointed for the first 100 pages or so, I didn't understand why the characters were acting as they were; I was frustrated by Marc's unwillingness to be honest with Melanie. I felt like I was missing the backstory tht made these two decide they wanted to start a romance in the first place. But, by the second half I felt like the book had settled into the saddle and I was in for a good ride (read). The second half wasn't good enough to forgive the first half, but the motivations became more clear and the characters felt more realistic. I'll try the next book in the series, but I'm not dedicated to Ms. Carrington's work just yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jose is still searching","review":"Well educated, and certainly talented, Jose lacks the soul to make the transition to anything more than a small venue novelty.

Taken from the incredible album Hate, \\"Hate is all you need\\" stands on its own for its beauty, both lyrically and musically. The Delgados is a band not afraid of pushing the little pieces that conform a song to the very limit to create majestic anthems. Whether it is for the memorable lead track or the precious B-sides, this is truly a CD that, I dare say, every serious collector should own.

I tend to do heavyer work then the average home owner, but needed a cordless drill with a 1/2\\" chuck for my 3/4\\" wood augger bit to drill through studwork on an addition I was building. It works fine when drilling through 1 2X4, and even 2. I was a bit supprised that when I was drilling through 3 boards that the drill didn't stop, but catch fire. Most every other tool that has an electric motor has a thermal override that would cut off if the motor got hot, but this didnt. I only paid $70 for it, and feel that is all it is worth.

The drill's chuck is very inferior and it takes multiple efforts to align drill bits. When drilling, the chuck often loses its grip and the bit just slips. The latest fiasco is the drill's inability to hold the power pack which simply falls out of the drill and crashes to the floor. Very disappointed with the quality of this product and would not recommend to anyone seeking a basic drill. The flashlight is the best thing about this kit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware","review":"Great drill, just don't drop it on a hard floor. I dropped a 1 week old drill on a concrete floor from 4 feet and severely cracked the handle which rendered the drill useless. Hitachi said dropping is not covered by their 5 year \\"professional\\" Warranty. Seems they could have used a more resiliant plastic. My kids have plastic toys you can throw against a concrete wall and they will not crack. Oh well, guess I stay with DeWalt for quality professional power tools. I'd like to see a DIY'er or carpenter that hasn't dropped a tool."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent set","review":"This was the first \\"tool set\\" I bought after moving into our little old house. I've used it for everything imaginable and it's still going after about 4 years. The batteries don't last as long as they used to but there are 2 so I just rotate them. The light has proven to be just as useful as the drill. Torque is good: I've never ran into anything that the drill won't handle from really hard old wood to masonry and porcelain tile. In short I definitely recommend this thing. It's been worth every penny I spent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great tools from hitachi","review":"First off, my wife bought me their 10\\" miter saw last year as a present. Love the saw, going to use it to build my deck this summer. I bought the drill and flashlight combo with a bit of this years tax return. I have so far fixed a screen door, drilled some scrap wood and drove some screws as a test. This drill is great for all that and since im only a DIYer i dont expect to put it or my saw through the kind of use a professional would so i think ill be alright with the battery life and parts wearing out. i also picked up the quick change drill bit and screw driver set and havent had a problem with the chuck as far as that goes.

A spare battery runs $60-$80 and the light - well, that's just a throwaway. So the question is, \\"Do I spend the $60-$80 to replace the battery or do I spend $100-$150 to buy a different power drill?\\" I'm not sure at this point. I'm expecting the battery that is working will die soon too which means it's really $120-$160 to replace both batteries in two years. I'd rather just buy a new Dewalt or something else and take my chances. There. I just talked myself into buying a different drill."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Poor Batteries and Quality","review":"The batteries started showing signs of not holding a charge within about 6 months. And after a year, they discharge completely within a couple days of just sitting. It's not a defect because both batteries are very similar. Also, the chuck quality is poor...it does not operate smoothly making tightening or loosening drills and/or bits difficult.

That drill was a work horse replaced only because the charger stopped working. With the new drill I am disappointed in the amount of work you can do before needing to change batteries. I realize the need to keep the battery small enough for the drill to be manageable, but I estimate getting 2X the amount of time with the old drill VRS. the new before needing to change batteries. . One of the reasons I went with the Ni-Cad battery instead of a lithium was price and the proven technology surrounding the nickel battery.

The focal point is the Kid, with his Panama zoot suit and flashy guitar, and of course the coconuts. Calling these three beauties back-up singers doesn't do them justice. Their synchronized dance moves are very sexy, and they never stop. This band gives it their all and they are obviously having a great time. The Kid's music is very melodic, very catchy, and you will have songs running through your head. The picture quality and sound are improved over the VHS video, but the production shows its age and doesn't quite have the polish of recent concert videos.

First of all, most the apartment spaces were at least 800 square-feet, much larger than most studios I've ever seen. They also assume that everyone has the liberty and means to knock down and/or build walls, refinish floors, and divide the space into actual separate rooms. I did like that the designers presented the floor plans for all the apartments, thus showing that they were actually full-fledged one or even two bedroom apartments. My perception of a studio apartment is a one-room living space, not the glitzy spaces pictured in this book with penthouse views, loft space for days and state of the art kitchens and baths. This book is the equivalent of browsing through Architectural Digest, looking at fancy rooms that are far beyond your budget and are but an unattainable dream."},{"rating":"1","title":"I should have read the editorial review closely.","review":"This is not a book for the average apartment dweller looking for inspiration to decorate within the boundaries of a studio apartment. It is only for architects and designers who have the ability to manipulate their environment by changing the structure of the confined space. It certainly wasn't meant for the average, Ikea joe who needed advice on making the most out of a small situation. I wish I could find an apartment that looked like these, only the rich could afford what was pictured."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful and creative","review":"This is one of my favorite design books. I notice some other reviewers have complained that the apartments shown in this book are beyond their budget (alas, mine too).

Greenblatt's writing is engaging and engrossing. He sets the stage (pun, I suppose, intended) of Elizabethan England as a vivid backdrop to the events of Shakespeare's life. Though, as other reviewers pointed out, the thinness of the data force the author to engage in conjecture, it is fascinating conjecture. Additionally, Shakespeare's writing is delightfully woven into the conjecture, and I found myself again awestruck at his writing - as awestruck as I was the first time I truly began to appreciate it. I highly recommend this book - keep in mind, I'm no Shakespeare scholar, but I suspect that is precisely the audience for which it is intended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for a beginner","review":"Having only general knowledge of William Shakespeare this book helped give me a better understanding of the man and his writings. While others may debate the finer details of this book I can only talk about the easiness of the read. Parts of the book read as a novel and the book in general was a quite easy read. Mr. Greenblatt goes into the stories of those around William and how they and the political realm of the day could help shape Shakespeare into the person he became. While there are occasions where the author goes into realms he is unsure of and makes his own suggestions to what happened he is clear in noting that they are his suggestions and not facts. For this beginner it was a good start to learn more about Shakespeare and gave me an increased desire to read more of his works."},{"rating":"2","title":"As Close as We'll Get","review":"In the jungles of Yucatan, our mystical guide, Pepe, opined that most, if not all, very successful individuals were visitors from outer space who rose above the strivings of ordinary earthlings because of their extraterrestrial powers. Pepe's explanation is most tempting when one seeks to comprehend how an Elizabethan playwright and poet, Will Shakespeare, so far eclipsed every mere earthling before or since the time he visited our planet. But if one isn't satisfied with Pepe's facile philosophy of greatness, read Stephen Greenblatt's masterful biography, Will in the World. He comes closer than the thousands of previous biographers and commentators to a recreation of Shakespeare in the Elizabethan setting, and his outstanding accomplishment may lead some of us to believe that he, too, is an extraterrestrial."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shakespeare's life(?)","review":"Given the paucity of actual documents from him, it is extremely difficult for anyone to construct a definitive biography of William Shakespeare. That has not stopped many folks from attempting to do so, however. This book is another in that train, and I found it fairly well-written, although my attention wandered at times while reading it. The author has done his best in this book, but it is riddled with \\"perhaps\\", \\"possibly\\", \\"it could have\\", and other qualifiers of that ilk. The examination of many of the plays, however, is first-rate, and for that alone the book is worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated Edwardian-style plod","review":"Greenblatt used to be an interesting literary critic 20 years ago, but this book is a mere pot-boiler of a kind that might have been written in about 1910. It is often inaccurate, and never interesting, and highly conservative. The only radical idea was in the first edition, which went so far as to claim that the young Shakespeare would have met wild porcupines in English woods, but an embarrassed Greenblatt has now deleted that bit. So there's no fun left anywhere, just a bland vague ramble through the usual stuff. You'd be much better off buying James Shapiro's '1599' or Park Honan's biography instead. You'd even be better off with Jon Bate's 'Genius of Shakespeare.'"},{"rating":"1","title":"Imagine THIS!","review":"I decided to underline the passages prefaced with \\"let's imagine,\\" \\"may have,\\" \\"supposedly,\\" etc. I'm just beginning Chapter 5 and already, I need a new pencil lead refill.I have just finished reading Greenblatt's Will in the World and must point out the author's mention of certain reference materials used. He says: \\"Though by definition unreliable and often wildly inaccurate, some of the most searching reflections on Shakespeare's life have come in the form of fiction...\\" He then lists some novels and, of all things, the screenplay for the movie Shakespeare in Love. I can only imagine how an Oxfordian scholar would be derided for a similar choice of source material. Unreliable and wildly inaccurate fiction is exactly how I would describe Greenblatt's \\"Pulitzer Prize finalist\\" of a book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A slew of theories","review":"The book is well-written overall. My main disappointment arose when trying to sort out fact from fiction and fiction from conjecture. The author makes a lot of inferences based off of the little information about Shakespeare's life. It seems a lot like PCR (polymerse chain reaction), where a little DNA is taken and amplified so that there is more to work with. This is not a great way to write about a person's life. Unfortunately, it does not end there. He will go on for pages about what may or may not be true. At the end of chapter two, the conclusion was that Shakespeare may have been either Roman Catholic or Protestant. I do not feel that 20+ pages is necessary for a subject with no real known answer. Overall, if one has the time to spend sorting through fact, fiction, and conjecture, there is some good information that can be found."},{"rating":"2","title":"Accessible but hardly ground-breaking","review":"This \\"biography\\" of the world's greatest playwright is a clearly written, accessible introduction to the connections between Shakespeare's work and the few extant details of his life. Greenblatt sometimes is forced to imagine the connective tissue between these two subjects, but of any living commentator he is probably one of the most qualified to do this. A far cry from his penetrating scholarly work, this book usefully collects and condenses many known theories on the links between Shakespeare's writings and his life-story. I would recommend this book to the general reader who is just starting to develop an interest in early modern English literature and Shakespeare's work. For the seasoned reader in this field, however, there is little new here to dine upon.One major caveat: if you have not read Shakespeare's plays and poems, be sure to review them before tackling Greenblatt's book. Otherwise, you will certainly be left in his academic dust."},{"rating":"2","title":"textbook delivered promptly","review":"This was a textbook for a college Shakespeare class I am taking. It arrived quickly and in good shape. I enjoyed reading it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"GREENBLATT MAKES WILL NEFARIOUS TO SELL BOOKS","review":"Despite a strong first half, this book diminishes in the second into a mere hack work instead of a first-rate scholarly piece largely due to Greenblatt's decision to become an A.S.S. [another secular scholar ]and aim at high sales;instead of remaining focused on the greatest writer to ever live, he spices the narrative with little-known saucy tidbits such as the \\"Dark Lady \\"of the sonnets was a negress and Will really DID have a thing for his daughter. These lurid details on top of Greenblatt's firm conviction Shakespeare was bi-sexual only besmirch the great playwright's reputation. To this end, this piece becomes just another post -freudian pscyhoanalysis obssessed with sex. Miss it if you can and read a respectable bio published when scholars had integrity and purposively did not destroy their heroes because of Freud."},{"rating":"1","title":"will we know?","review":"A lot of work, it seems, for very little, since so little is known of shakespeare's life and this book adds nothing except for equivocation. here are thousands, seemingly of the form \\"he may have gone [or done]XXX, or perhaps not...\\" \\"he could have read XXXX, or perhaps...\\"And there's little sense of how, such a rustic could have attainted the heights of expression and knowledge that he did.\\"Will...\\" is a waste."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where's a will....","review":"This is an excellent book, well written and full of facts.

And that's what makes it such marvelous reading. Greenblatt makes no bones about it. He admits that he's working with the scantiest of evidence, but he does a wonderful job with what he has. His guesses may be way off, but they make a lot of sense. We may not know Shakespeare any better as a result, but we do have a splendid picture of the world he lived in. And the language of the book rivals that of its subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shakespeare Imaged","review":"Stephen Greenblatt is a brilliant Renaissance scholar who utilizes his knowledge of that world to create a biography of William Shakespeare. In 400+ pages, Mr. Greenblatt reconstructs the playwright's life out of the merest of clues, for Shakespears lefted very little documentation behind of his life. Legal papers concerning his birth, marriage, children's births and his death constitute the bulk of the surviving documents from that era.The reader is cautioned that \\"Will In The World\\" is a tour de force of conjecture. Mr. Greenblatt may be making an educated and deductive guess but still a guess about the very large gaps of our knowledge of Shakespeare's life. Having said that, the book is so well-research and well-written that it is a nominee for the National Book Award. It is a wonderful introduction to the world of Shakespeare and Elizabethan England."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lengthy, but informative.","review":"I had a somewhat difficult time getting involved in the book in the beginning. However, my love of W. Shakespeare kept me going with many rewards. There is so much more to his life and the influences to his success, than one has ever heard until now.

Even though that there is no specific evidence that the Bard was a secret Catholic the events that unfolded around the area where he grew up could indicate this at least circumstantially. Where the book does take liberates I don't think Stephen Greenblatt is being deliberately sloppy he just knows that in terms of subject mater old Will has been done to death and no one is really going to add anything. So why not write something a little more speculative?Overall-It probably didn't happen but it MIGHT have happened \\"all the world's a stage and men in their time play many parts\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoying William Shakespeare","review":"I found the book to be a very good read.

There is no there there. Buy Shakespeare by Another Name by Mark Anderson instead. It really connects the true author to the plays, explains the motivation behind the stories and themes of Shakespeare and provides a colorful and evocative study of Elizabethan England."},{"rating":"2","title":"pleasant and interesting","review":"A very good read, explaining much about Elizabethan England and the theatre.

Greenblatt has done an excellent job in writing a book that is not only a delight to read, but informative as well. It's not a text crammed with tedious facts; instead it's a backstage pass on what's going on behind the scenes. Greenblatt stimulates your mind as he cleverly unfolds the fascinating details of the life of William Shakespeare."},{"rating":"1","title":"An airy nothingness","review":"Greenblatt begins the book with the words, \\"Let us imagine . . .\\" He then attempts to fabricate a biography of a great writer based on a historical record that leaves doubt about how the writer could have gained the vast knowledge reflected in his plays. Greenblatt hypothesizes event after event that \\"might\\" have happened even though there is absolutely no evidence that it did -- for example, imagining young Shakespeare encountering the Jesuit Edmund Campion. Is this the best Shakespearean scholarship can do? An unconvincing attempt to imagine a biography where there isn't one. Should be listed on the \\"fiction\\" lists.

The story was simply boring at times, and there is nothing that draws you to Mariel as a likeable character as Matthias, Mattimeo, or Martin did, in fact she is fairly close to just being plain annoying. I love Jacques' work and am only strongly criticizing this book because it does not nearly live up to his usual standards. Salamandastron is much better, so I suggest reading this book only to follow in the sequence, because it is not that good at all, and the death of the bad sea pirate character is rather disturbing especially for young children."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why Mice???","review":"This book wasn't worth all the hype given from all the other onliners.

Any fan of the series should read this one. There are plenty of fights and feasts and many nuances in the plot.

He attacked her ship, stole the booty, and brought her to his fort, Terramort. After she washes up on a shore she realizes she had lost consciousness and her memory. She later finds out who did this to her and that is where the hate, anger, and action begin. If you like a book with some action, laughter, and drama, you will love this book.

Unfortunately it's a rather feeble attempt. Although a lot of the images are undeniably beautiful, they are frequently marred by poor editing: camera bumps, abrupt fade outs, digital noise in places and overuse of filter type effects which lend many scenes an odd artificiality ala \\"What Dreams May Come\\". Also as another reviewer points out, the snappy pace of the constantly scudding clouds is more like an MTV music video than a meditation on Nature's serene beauty. What really mars the whole experience is the incredibly insipid music by Suzanne Cianni and Patrick O'Hearn. I'm afraid it's New Age music at its worst (I don't hate all New Age stuf,f BTW) with banal melodies, shopworn chord progressions and unrelentingly cheesy synthesized textures guaranteed to kill off brain cells as you listen.Not recommended except in cases of recent brain surgery."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning timelapse photography & music!","review":"If you love time-lapse photography, this is a surreal and mesmerizing experience-truly a piece of art & beauty.

As \\"A Viewer\\" pointed out, the landscapes may be beautiful but it is far from relaxing.

It's a crying shame to Chinese culture that such a book was made without the guidance of a Chinese chef or even someone well versed in Chinese cuisine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding Action and Material","review":"This is a great video if you enjoy watching bull riding - good production values and tight editing - good stuff worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Broadening Intellectual and Multicultural Understa","review":"This book is an excellent resource for broadening your insight of global cultures, historical events, phrases, names their meanings.

For those of you who might have a cable from another device and it's A/V->Headphone like this one it should work fine. I used them before purchasing this one, the only hang-up was having to insert it just the right amount, NOT all the way in to the Zen 'dock'.

I tried. 3 times. 4th time's the charm!However, this cable was SO good, that it really displayed the flaws of having an off brand media player. My El Cheapo device made all these weird bleeps and rustles when selecting new songs or changing from MP3 to Videos.

The author obviously has been around the block a bit and is now most likely more contemplative than when he first arrived in Thailand. The non-fiction is good reading especially the article on Cambodia, Just One Beer. The fiction is fun and the sexy detective story is a scream!

But in Dean's world it's best you check the table of contents carefully as it's often difficult to tell which from which.

She does not waste the reader's time, but sets out her whole understanding in 128 pages, stating concepts clearly and embellishing with only the most illustrative examples from her real-world experience.Each chapter explores a particular dimension of social relation, examining what one might value and consider when interacting with others. She shows how tradeoffs between differing concerns creates a continuum upon which each culture lies.Even if her generalized distinctions between warm and cold climates are not quite perfect, Lanier's insight helps reveal the values articulated in social interaction, even in one's own culture. She has helped me to see why things are done the way they are, and to appreciate someone's motives when they are done the \\"wrong\\" way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Foreign to Familar","review":"Fantastic book. A very easy read. Interesting stories that allow you to fully understand the differences between cultures.

This book is great for anyone planning on going for a visit, missions trip or to live in a different culture than what they are familiar with.

Both were easy enough to disconnect from the plumbing. Loosening the so-called \\"Quick Lock Sink Mount\\" ring on one of them actually took a little more muscle, but eventually I got the leverage right with the wrench. You're better off with a long allen wrench than with the tool provided with the disposer. The part that also takes a bit of strength is hoisting the disposer back up into place. I almost wished I had used a jack or something for that, so that I could have hands free to position and tighten the quick lock ring. Anyway, it ultimately works out.As to the product itself, it slips right on and mounts easily. Feels like we have a new disposer.One tip - put a few phone books under the disposer when you loosen the quick lock retaining ring, so that when it ultimately falls from the sink (and it will) it falls a short distance and is cushioned by the phone books."},{"rating":"1","title":"no point in it!","review":"whats the point this is sellections of demonic-bad cd and the gathering++great cd and then the first strike is still deadly,point?cheap 2 disc set?another paycheck?just another record company ploy to get you to spend your money and the band makes a couple dollars too.DISC 1:1.

It starts of with Tanzila, an oriental flavoured song with lots of metalic-acoustic guitar in the intro. The bagpipe rhythm comes out strong over the top, with great percussion and an orchestra. Another highlight is El Saltón, which is deep and mystical in the beginning, followed by a killer pipe solo. It also features Hevia's sister on the drum. The hidden bonus track is another gem, it gives visions of mist swirling round and round on a plain. Baños de Budapest is the most diverse song on the album, ranging between haunting bagpipe and slow, echoing drum to shimmering Celtic/Asturian reels. The whole album shines with influences from all over the world. Hevia has done a brilliant job with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"More of the same","review":"Hevia is a fresh new artist that is probably one of the best kept secrets in the recording industry. His first album was a breath of fresh air. His second is more of the same. The quality of musicianship is as good as the first album, but the fresh edge that was there on the first album is not as prevelant on this one. However, if you liked the first you will probably like this one as well. He tries to vary the feel by incorporating the music of different locales. But it just ends up sounding very similar to what we've already heard. Inspite of this what we hear is a continuation of a fresh new sound with a little bit of the edge taken off of it.

Furthermore, some sects believed that at the end of the millennium, judgment day would arrive. Things were very much the same in the year 2000. In this album, Anonymous 4 flawlessly performs music from the Ascension mass that would have been sung at the time- the mass which contains the most references to the end of days outside of Advent- as well as various apocolyptic music texts from the turn of the millennium. Anonymous 4's performance is incomparable. Their unity of sound, smoothness, clarity, and beauty make the CD a pleasure to listen to.

They sound brittle and completely unnatural. I am an amateur sound engineer and I know how this kind of mistake is brought about. You have to adjust the delay of the singer's microphone in a wrong way, too short or too long.The average listener does not know about those things and is prone to attribute the distortions to the singer's voice, which happened to Danielle de Niese's Händel album lately.Poor Amelie, poor Danielle, you did not deserve such carelessness, as you both are divine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost a perfect fit","review":"Almost a perfect fit.

Milbank packs his book with humor and insight in telling the whole tawdry story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't expect Germond & Whitcover","review":"I was hugely disapointed by this book. The 2000 election was one of the most fascinating ever. I was looking forward to reading a great behind the scenes look at the whole process. Jack Germond & Jules Whitcover wrote books of this sort from the 1980-92 elections. I guess I was expecting a similar book. Instead, this is more the story of Dana Milbank covering the campaign. Although there were a few interesting tidbits (the fraternity jokes among Gore staffers forced to share rooms, for example) this book focuses too much on the author's views/judgements and is written from a satirical point of view rather than a historical or investigative look at the strategies that were the 2000 election. For someone who likes fluffy anecdotal impressions of the past campaign this book may be perfect. As for me, I wish Germond & Whitcover were still around writing recaps of Presidential elections."},{"rating":"2","title":"Michael Lewis on Speed!","review":"Political junkies take heed! This book is great fun; a romp through the 2000 political campaign. It's easy to forget in the wake of election day and its aftermath how interesting (at times) this campaign was, particularly when it came to John McCain's \\"straight talking\\", in-your-face moment in the spotlight. Milbank captures the true quirkiness of his subjects, including McCain, and has a way of injecting himself into the story that is quite appealing. Some of this material will be familiar to New Republic Readers, but the vast majority of it seems to be new to the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shouldn't have bought this","review":"I was so excited at first when i opened the package of my mpio 20gb mp3 player. Documentation is bad and provides little information how to operate it properly. The unit almost always hangs when you touch the slider at once when shifting from radio to mp3 music. then i have to use a paper clip to reset and start again. But this erases my preset radio stations. Upgraded firmware didnt help also. Nice clear sounds though. Sturdy body. Nice blue backlight. Battery life too short.

Mine died within a couple of weeks, after I had used it only a dozen times. I suspect the hard drive gave up the ghost, as it froze on boot and couldn't be powered off or anything -- I had to wait for the battery to run down overnight.I found the touchpad and navigation usable but not wonderful. I liked the fact that the HD300 shows up on a computer as a USB mass storage device and songs can be transferred by drag and drop, but was disappointed to find that I still had to run an application on my computer (called MPIO utility) in order to be able to search songs on the player. I was also quite bummed to find that the HD300 has no support at all for custom playlists."},{"rating":"1","title":"This thing is terrible","review":"I got one of these for Christmas and have spent the last few weeks trying to get it to work. There are several major flaws i'd like to point out,-The original firmware is aweful and causes the HD300 to freeze up constantly.-The instruction on how to upgrade the firmware are incorrect. You can eventually dig up the proper way on the internet, and it can be doen in just 8 or so steps involving multiple file copying and windows, but who wants to do all this?-The program that came with it is not the proper program for it, so half the functions don't work.-Once you get past all the freezing problems, and updating problems, then it has all these weird track recognition problems.-The instruction manual is completely useless and in most cases wrong. I believe they just adopted manuals and software from a different product and never really tested anything.-I pushed the reset button on mine and it doesn't even boot up anymore, I guess I have to take it back"},{"rating":"1","title":"NEVER RECEIVED THE CD!!!!!!!","review":"I Received one DVD, which didn't work - well that can happen.I called Amazon and requested a new one.They sent it to a wrong address and it was DELIVERED accordingly to Amazon.Well not to me, and not to my address ...Well amazon wasn't afraid - to charge me for the 2nd CD i never even received.So now I have 1 CD which deosn;t work, 2nd which is somewhere in Ft Lauderdale ... and I have been charged for 2 CDsWAY TO GO AMAZON :("},{"rating":"1","title":"A Trip through Trash","review":"Prince Asel loses his position in this future of corporations turned tiny states.This novel takes some seeds of interesting ideas and then...I don't know what it does.

I have occasionally watched a few minutes of American crime reality TV, where reporters accompany cops in busts or arrests.

Typical New York good cop, bad cop storyline. This is why I didn't give it four stars but I have to give a lot of credit to the actors especially Collin Farrell. He is brilliant in this movie. I have to say, he nailed his performance to the tee. So the story goes: A family of cops, the dad (Jon Voight (Francis Sr.), his two sons (Edward Norton (Ray),Noah Emmerich (Francis Jr.) and their brother in law (Collin Farrell (Jimmy). They were all after this drug dealer who killed four other cops. Ray was thrown in this wild goose chase only to find out that Jimmy was somehow involved. So Jimmy somehow framed Ray (can't spoil the movie too much), they were in this battle of Ray's words against Jimmy. The ending could've been better but overall, it is a pretty good movie.

While the corrupt cop premise is nothing new, the film is surprisingly well-made and engaging, with strong performances by Edward Norton, Colin Farrell, Noah Emmerich, and Jon Voight. My only two problems with the film are the over-the-top violence (I know there are bad cops, but are they *that* sadistic?) and the lazy ending, which is a deus ex machina of sorts. Rather than have the good guys take down the bad guys, they're ultimately brought down by a series of contrived circumstances. Even a cliche stand-off would have been better than that.Bottom line: Despite a lack of originality and a couple other flaws, this is a well-acted cop drama.Richard Yee, author of Deliveries: A Collection"},{"rating":"1","title":"ZzZzZzZz....","review":"I purchased this DVD before ever watching it (something I have vowed I will never do again), and I was right to doubt my choice. Since Edward Norton is my absolute favorite actor, I assumed this movie had to be good. Even if the storyline was just okay, his acting prowess can almost always make a mediocre movie much better. Sadly, such was not the case with Pride and Glory. I didn't feel bad for the guys who lost their brother. The movie just had no depth, no feeling. Plus I fell asleep watching it the first time. I decided to give it a second shot. I found myself so distracted by everything around me that I couldn't even pay attention to the screen! That's how boring it is!

I actually remember being taught by a \\"rap\\" technique in the 80's called \\"wrap-ups\\" that was 100 times more effective: it included worksheets and kinesthetic learning tools. This DVD does not include any strategy.I wanted a new tool to help out my struggling students- I don't mind corny- but I wouldn't even think about using this because it's not even catchy. They go through each number sequentially and this is the extent of the rap: 4 x 1 is 4. 4 x 2 is 8. 4 x 3 is 12. Say that outloud to a beat and call it teaching, but there's no way that this is going to stick in a childs head.Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute!!!!","review":"I just recieved this DVD.

It gives the children another hook to hang their hat on as they are learning basic facts. The more methods in which material can be presented to a child the more likely they are to understand and remember it. I have searched far and wide for a multiplication cd/dvd/vhs to present the multiplication facts in a fun way. This comes pretty close to what I hope to find. My 7 year old daughter is mildly interested in it, I have to suggest that she watch it rather than her askinG to watch it. She will then sit through the whole thing without complaint. My 9 year old son is not at all interested. I think a child under 7 would be more entertained by it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"I was trying to find an alternative to boring multiplication memorization and thought the dvd would contain musical jingles that would stick in her head.

Mencken on Religion, edited by S. T. Joshi. It is of the same high quality as this aqnthology.

The music on \\"Throwing Myself\\" sounds like something Slipknot refused to put on one of their own albums because it was too yielding. The music has no heart and is easy to say this having heard Norma Jean and The Chariot. I still think the vocals are great and that's the only reason for two stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"some of the most generic music EVER","review":"Forget the fact that they are now Normajean aka: bad generic metalcore. Luti-kriss is 10 ten times more bland and boring than NJ. Starting with the vocals... he has no range, his scream sounds like he is trying too hard not to try, and he sounds tired, and he flat out sucks. Now moving on to the guitars, well, i havent heard anything this boring since Dashboard Confessional. No, there isnt a comparison to each others music, its just that Dashboard Confessional plays excruciatingly boring guitar parts, but Lutikriss makes him look like a musical genius. I would say something about the bass, but you cant tell they have a bassist. The drumming... sounds like a 10 year old who just started learning how to stay in rhythym. The production is the only halfway decent thing about this cd. I would without hesitating skip this, and buy the new All Out War or the new BTBAM."},{"rating":"1","title":"It sucks","review":"This CD really sucks bad. I commend them for being a Christian band, because I am a Christian as well. My question is, why bother claiming you're a Christian band when you can't understand one single word they say? How is that uplifting God at all? The words are illegible throughout the entire CD, and the music sounds like something I would picture hearing if I was in Hell. So needless to say, don't waste your money on this CD unless you need something to use as a target with your BB gun."},{"rating":"2","title":"This isn't Ludicrous!","review":"The beginnings of what Norma Jean will be for their Bless the Martyr, Kiss the Child album.

If you have any appreciation for metal/thrash/etc. you will almost definitely love this cd. Honest lyrics with a sincere message, and phenomenally awesome music to back it up. The lead singer is great. my personal favorite is light blue collar. i think this band is a good example of what christian music is capable of being: honest, unique, and AMAZING. you don't have to sacrifice the music to get the message; luti-kriss proves that. in the vein of bands such as zao and blindside, luti-kriss creates a beautiful blend of heavy throat screams, thick harmonious singing, raging guitars, drumming faster than you can shake a stick at, and superiorly powerful lyrics. yay for luti-kriss. check this cd out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD","review":"This is a very impressive cd. It has much variety. I can't quite put my finger on who they sound like, but what does that matter anyway. They have a great low-end bass sound that makes the cd sound huge. Each song has something in it you are not expecting. It's chaotic but stays close to a meolody. I recommend it to any heavy music fan.

They absolutely do give the most incredible show, with the most crowd participation and violent pits I've ever seen. Anyways, I bought this album the day after the concert and it doesn't dissapoint. This is probably the most intense metal I have heard since Pantera's Far Beyond Driven. But unlike Far Beyond Driven, Chimaira come accross with a more polished finish that reminded me of Megadeth's Youthanasia, albeit a little light on solos. This CD is definatly worth buying if you are a fan of Metal in it's purest form. Be sure to check out \\"Down Again,\\" \\"Pure Hatred,\\" \\"Power Trip,\\" and the title track."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful, heavy and totally brilliant heavy metal album...","review":"I saw these guys live a few months back playing alongside the likes of Unearth and madball, and i have to say they were f*****g amazing!

Man, these guys are incredible metal musicians! I saw them last night on the 04 Jagermeister Music Tour with Death By Stereo, Fear Factory and Slipknot. They put on a blistering performance! I would encourage anyone who hasn't seen these guys live to do so.Now onto my review of this cd. Slayer and others are predicting Chimaira to be the next big \\"Thrash Metal\\" band. I would definitely agree. This album is just plain incredible. I would recommend any fan of heavy metal to buy this cd. Some of the noteworthy tracks are Cleansation, Power Trip, Down Again and Pure Hatred. Actually the whole cd just rocks. All of the tracks are strong.This is definitely one of my favorite metal bands that is new. I would also recommend you pick up their other cd \\"Pass Out of Existence.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Well-Rounded","review":"I got into Chimaira not to long ago....and I am completely addicted. I've been listening to Slipknot, OLD Korn, Nothingface, and Manson for years and years......but all of those CD's have been cased for Chimaira. Some people say the vocals aren't that great....but I think they are indeed original. It's a great break away from the constant demon growl. When Chimaira's lead singer screams.....it sounds like what I would. I like music I can connect to in some way, shape, or form. The lyrics don't seem to be as deep as the first album, but songs like \\"Pure Hatred\\" will keep you wanting more.Chimaira is perfect for the metal fans who want to shy away from the classic metal sound which can get very redundant. This is where Chimaira breaks off.The only reason I gave it 4 out of 5 stars is cause it didn't strike me as an instant classic, such as Antichrist Superstar"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"This is a great cd. It does live up to all the hype. Mark Hunter is a great vocalist and the rest of the band is really good too. No wonder they are at the head of the New Wave. These guys should go to ozzfest next year. I can't wait til their next album. Best songs are-Cleansation, Pictures In the Gold Room, Power Trip, Pure Hatred, Dehumanizing Process and Crawl. The only bad track is the last one Implements of Destruction because its too long and its an instrumental and i hate instrumentals. I can see these guys being the future kings of metal. Also check out Otep, Amon Amarth, Nile, Morbid Angel and Norma Jean. Chimaira rule!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting","review":"If you can't get enough Slipknot and don't mind the thought of listening to a clone, this CD is for you!

Only complaint is not enough solos."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Constant Horrific Nightmares\\"","review":"4.5 stars. I first picked up \\"Pass Out of Existence\\" but later, after seeing this album posted on so many Listmania lists here uderscored with due praise, I checked this out. Wow! Simply put, this CRUSHES!!! their first release. While the lead vocals are grating at times, there is enough variation in his rasping shouts and enough emotional power that I rarely got irritated. This album is inspiring when considering the direction of mainstream Heavy Metal these days. Nu-metal is crap! I have a serious question. Who the hell is that drummer? Holy....!!!! Andols Herrick's drumming is incredible, and pummeled me senseless the first time I heard this nearly excellent CD. While the lyrics are cliched, bordering on adolescent, the delivery given by Mark Hunter on vocals makes my negative crititcism almost irrelevant. The riffs here are inventive and induce heart-felt headbanging and thrashing of limbs. The production is also first-rate. I am very impressed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album","review":"This has to be my favorite cd out right now, besides killswitch's new album and God Forbid's latest release. Everything about thisAlbum is great, Some of the best guitar work out there and the drums are amazing. Anyone who says this bands sucks can go to hell.Tom Araya of Slayer was quoted as saying Chimaira will be the next big thing in American Metal and I for one believe it.Cant wait for their next album, its a tribute to the Pioneering band Death and their Vocalist who passed away. They will be Covering their material. The best tracks on here to me were Eyes of a Criminal, Power Trip, Pure Hatred, and Cleansation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome CD","review":"This CD does bring out the best in Chimaira. If you listen to the other 2 CDs they made, you can definitely see progression. Influences are very obvious on this CD in songs like \\"Crawl\\" (Alice In Chains vibe) and the epic \\"Implements of Destruction\\" (Metallica vibe). Like many other reviewers have already said, this is a must-own album if you are a listener of heavy metal. This is as hard as it gets. The only thing that stopped this album from getting 5 stars from me is personal enjoyment from some of the songs. Only 2 of them don't strike me very well, \\"Crawl\\" being one of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"The New Wave Of American Heavy Metal!!!!!!!!","review":"After Pass Out Of Existance, which was a favorite of mine, Chimaira switched gears and went somewhere else, opting for more thrash metal in their sound. The boys had a lot of pressure from their record label Roadrunner, they were even forced to write more songs. All of their anger and frustration came out on this record, and it shows. Produced by Ben Schigel (Switched) and mixed by Colin Richardson (Fear Factory, Machine Head, Napalm Death), this album will get the likeliest of naysayers turning their heads."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chimaira shows what they can do","review":"This was a really good album. I saw Chimaira once opening for Fear Factory and thay puton one helluva show, but I was dissapointed with what I heard from Pass Out Of Existance. This album shows definite musical growth and is WAY heavier. The lenghthy instrumental \\"IMplements of Destruction\\" is very cool, since it blends elements of old Metallica with the newer digital sound of bands like Fear Factory and, well, Chimaira. And although Mark Hunter's lyrics are pretty lame for the most part, His voice makes up for it. This is an album I would recommend for any fan of metal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chimaira owns !","review":"I love chimaira and im happy to say that im going to see them with in flames ,unearth, and, soilwork on june 28th!!

I just can't get into the sound of this band. The sound is best described as uncomfortable; the vocals are weak, and the music really doesn't go anywhere. These guys are trying to be something they are not. This is precisely why American metal has been stuck in a rut since the passing of Chuck Shuldiner (rest in peace); there is nothing new about this. This sounds like everything else out there. They seem mad for the sake of being mad. Why does everybody have to be so mad? Or at least think they have to pretend to be mad? When the guys from Slayer are pissed, I genuinely believe it. I think these guys were in my high school's marching band..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I hadn't listened to the hype...","review":"Take away the awful singer and this wouldn't be a bad album. Unfortunately, the terrible singing and GOD AWFUL lyrics make it impossible for me to enjoy this. The vocals and lyrics are straight out of nu-metal. I can't listen to bands that say \\"blah blah blah I hate everyone.\\" The clean singing is so terrible and gay sounding. I LOVE clean singing. Opeth, shadows fall, Amorphis, Katatonia, these bands have amazing clean vocals. Chimaira's suck. I wish they would ditch this terrible vocalist and become a good band."},{"rating":"1","title":"uninspired plap","review":"Musically, this band is fairly competent. Lyrically, however, Chimaira is an embarassment.

Of course, that was based solely on people's reviews and enthusiasm for this album. I'm really not sure how such a mediocre record has gotten so much attention...everything here is safe and cliched. I feel betrayed. Even if you're not that much of a metalhead, the staleness and unoriginality should send you running.

She obviously knows very little about Jack and understands nothing about the artistic soul. After all, a gloomy artist like Sickert would have been fascinated by the case. She doesn't mention that he lived in rooms years after the murders and was told by the landlord that it had been lived in by the Ripper - of course he would paint it! Also, as for the man leaning over the woman in the painting in Ennui - everyone knew the Ripper was supposed to have approached his victims from the back and slit their throats. The only thing she has proved is that the mischievous letter writing Sickert probably wrote a couple of the 600 hoax letters - big deal!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album","review":"Love this Album, such a tragic loss.

It definitely did not cover me and am I glad that I took a window seat. Everyone advised me to take an aisle seat, so it would be easier to go and change my baby when needed instead of having people get up in order to get out. I luckily took a window seat- thankfully!

I have a poncho I used to use but it was thick and my son got hot under it-this is light and pretty.

As with many romances, the problems melt away (especially hers) in a very romantic but not entirely realistic way.That said, this is a very well-drawn genre romance. While nothing about the plot or characters is especially original, Kent does a good job of developing their characters and their relationship. The emotions of the characters seem very real, and the development of their romance is handled with sensitivity. The depth of emotion portrayed is unusual for a genre romance.It's also a good read, with appealing, likeable characters.

Firstly there is little sophistication,mystery or magic here, Leibers style has deteriorated sharply into dull, long winded self mockery in his advancing years. Secondly Rime isle is a sadly boring, mundane place quite unfitted for our two oh so worldy wise heroes to end their days. Thirdly those self-same heroes themselves have deteriorated into middle age tedium, most alarmingly, rather like their creator appears to have done. If you dont mind all that, then buy the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The demolition of heroes","review":"I liked the 3 previous books about Fafhrad and the Mouser very much, so I was really looking forward for this one. But what a dissapointment! Compared to the crazy, wild adventures in the previous books, in \\"Farewell to Lankhmar\\" nothing really exciting happens. The heroes are sitting around on a small island, and time goes by. Some strange things happen to them, but they are never exciting to the reader, and the two heroes act most time rather stupid. In addition, Leiber gets very obscene sometimes. I have to admit, that the urge to stop reading this book was sometimes very strong, it was only out of loyality towards Fafhrad and the Mouser, that I read it to the end. In summary: If you liked the other Lankhmar stories, don't read this book!

The film is well shot and I really like the colors used in the film; they set the tone for the entire film much like the pale greens did for the Saw films. I will say that in between the scenes of torture, I found the film to be kinda slow and you could see wholes in the plot, but just the sheer uncomfortable feeling you get while watching this movie makes up for that. If your not a die hard horror fan, I have a feeling you might not be able to handle just how brutal this film gets.

She came out with \\"So Done\\", which sounds like a JoJo \\"Leave (Get Out)\\" rip-off!!! Jeannie is really a tacky singer, her \\"Green Iz\\" song is lame, it makes me laugh. She is trying POP/RAGGAE (WHICH SHE SUCKS AT), AND A LITTLE BIT OF ALTERNATIVE/R&B. Her album only debuted at No. 127 on Billboards, which shows right there that she isnt good.

Of course he meets a French woman and so on...I mean this is completely incredible in some ways that they dared to write such a screenplay. A bunch of bad clichés thrown together...Ok it is nice and we had a good time watching it but actually it is very slow-moving and there is really no story.

I'm not sure that it is his fault so much as the script. I had a hard time believing that this \\"heartless, ruthless\\" male chauvinist (his character is ALWAYS staring at a woman's chest or derriere) is what became of the sweet, thoughtful boy that is wonderfully depicted by the young actor.

And the lengths gone to for set decoration and atmosphere were absurd, and needlessly costly. Let's see the guy do this film without so much cash.The idea that Max would want to \\"shag\\" his new-found cousin is deplorable for obvious reasons, but also because that role is played rightfully young, with far more important things on her mind, and it makes Max disgusting.

I had hoped at least that the scenery would make up for a predictable story, but even that didn't make up for the bland, disjointed plot.

All I can say is, how could anyone who read this book make this movie? The only thing that stayed the same was Provence. They emasculated the mystery plot, made Russell Crowe a supersucessful trader instead of a broke ex-trader who needed to borrow money from Charley to get to France, etc. Contrived plot changes for dramatic effect are just stupid--running Fanny off the road, falling into the swimming pool, and the little car are three things that the book didn't need.

It turned out to be a wonderful discovery. This movie deals with the questions that do, or should, determine how we live our lives. Here we are able to watch as a man re-evaluates the meaning of success, and ultimately opts for contentment over competition. In the end it's hard for the viewer to argue with his choices. The story includes several eclectic characters that add to its entertainment value. As a bonus, the cinematography is outstanding.

I mean you have an A-list actor and director in Crowe and Scott respectively, and this \\"intoxicating\\" vineyard in France as the backdrop of the story, with ROMANCE being the main theme. At no point was I emotionally connected to any of the characters. The French Chic was hardly in the movie, about 1:30 mins in she becomes a \\"major player\\". I kept looking at my DVD running time wondering when this alleged ROMANCE was going to develop! That being said you have the typical filler characters (the daughter, the vitners assistant) blah blah blah. They spent too much time with Crowe going back and forth about selling the place, without ever developing the emotional/romantic connection that he was \\"awoken\\" too. For all the men, I urge you to pass this up when you and the lady are browsing the new releases, just tell them some guy on [...] told you \\"it sucked\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing redeemable","review":"This would be characterized as a guilty pleasure movie, because it is innocent and pretty in its all-too-ditsy story line. After all, Crowe's superficial charm winning over the smart, sexy, unobtainable woman was not really grounded in any convincing moves or even modification in his demeanor. No greater truth was reached. The plot revolving around the girl who was supposedly heiress to the land was irritating, and again no knowledge was gained (beyond all doubt, at least) before the resolution is reached. So, I look at it as that, a simple movie to watch when one doesn't feel like thinking. As such, there is a single moment I considered mildly entertaining, which was the expulsion of the Americans from the restaurant after they verbally defiled the menu... yes, Americans are slobs without any appreciation for the sublime... that's been established.

Esen, a unique and reclusive shape-shifter and Paul, her only friend, take a rare vacation, as a number political intrigues take shape. Avoiding capture while simultaneously preventing a war keeps Esen and Paul busy. With enough rivalry to fill a Regency Romance, and enough adventures to rival classical space operas, the plot keeps moving through a plethora of twists, while the reader is tempted to laugh at Esen, and frequently with Esen. Despite occasionally convoluted misunderstandings, this is an enjoyable, fast, touching and funny sequel to charming novel, full of trademark exotic and attractive aliens."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality","review":"Poor quality construction -- the bristles on mine started falling apart on the first use.

It works great, and looks spiffy. Unfortunately the LCD went stupid last week - still on, but an unreadable garbled screen. I contacted Tripp Lite via e-mail with the serial number and within 24 hours they had a replacement shipped out to me. The best part was that they said \\"no need to return the old one - please just recycle the battery\\".So while I would normally be tweaked that the LCD only lasted 4 months, I'm thrilled that I will now have a perfectly good spare (albeit with a bad screen) for no extra cost."},{"rating":"1","title":"Used to be my #1 favorite","review":"Don't know if my body chemistry has changed or if the perfume was just old but I do NOT care for this any longer.

Was overall disappointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Songs of Distant Earth","review":"Arthur C. Clarke's Songs of Distant Earth was, unfortunatly, a bit disappointing. The ideas, on which the story is based, e.g. the sun going nova prematurly, are geniunly worrying and interestingly handled. Unfortunatly, the story itself left little to be exited about, as one chapter seems to drag into the next. By the time I was half way into the book, I found it about as exiting as watching foot fungus evolve sentience. I have to give two stars for the brilliant ideas and the realistic depiction of space travel, but the story and characters let it down. If your a Sci-fi buff, defidently give it a try, you might like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"What is there not to like?","review":"Not his best work but very good book in its own right.

I really recommend its reading, especially together with the music composed by Mike Oldfield for the book (cd with the same title). It is also recommendable for people who are not so much into sci-fi because of its beauty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought Provoking","review":"The story served as an adequate vehicle to put forth some very interesting and thought provoking ideas about space travel and the time frames involved, without jumping to warp speeds. Character development was a bit thin, with some characters that were not needed at all. I think the book's best asset will be to inspire new writings with closer inspection of the ideas put forth. Overall, an entertaining read with plenty of ideas to ponder and expand on. Isn't that what good science fiction should do?"},{"rating":"2","title":"good story, if occasionally slow","review":"This is a very good hard sci-fi novel, about a colony of humans on a distant planet that is visited by the remnants of the human race fleeing catastrophe. Having been seeded long long before, this colony had lost touch with the home world and developed a culture of its own, highly civilised and quite benign - they are peaceful and pursue their pleasures in an open and innocent way. However, underneath their oceans, an incredible transformation is taking place, perhaps one of the most significant in the history of the human race. Then the fleeing ships arrives, shaking things up with new ideas and desires. While avoiding spectacular adventure, this quiet novel is quite fascinating and chock full of intricately related ideas and systems, which are what Clarke portrays the best.Warmly recommended. It is an intellectual adventure to read this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Always a good read","review":"As with all Arthur C Clarke stories this was a well-written and well thought out Story that stands alone as one of the great science-fiction works of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book, Sad though...","review":"A great book all around, and interesting characters, even though they're peaceful. What I liked most about this book was that it was believeable, and therefore seemed more realistic than a normal book. One downfall to the realism is that the book has sad sections. If this book was written any other way, it would have been ruined. A good book to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting, but missing a few things.","review":"I am new to Arthur C. Clarke, but I have a good idea of his style of writing. This book deals more with what happens in the future rather than the events at the stories setting. The only thing that I really didn't like was that the book held you in suspense because you thought a major event would take place but that event never occurs. A good interesting story that lacks a climax. I reccomend this book to people who like thought more than action or at least don't mind not having much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Interesting Concept","review":"I first purchased this in May 1987.

Does anyone know of a sequel??"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"It seemed very short, but it was very 'out their' and had a very good writing style.

Clarke has done a fantastic job with this book. A wonderful story of the end of the world, and survival of the species, this novel has great depth and character development. We also get a taste of sociological strength, as we see two divergent social groups of humans interacting through necessity. As usual, A.C.Clarke does a masterful job of combining scifi with a great story, compelling characters, and a bit of tragedy thrown in, but not without the hopeful ending. I have read most of his work, and this book draws me back at least every couple of years. I would say that Songs of Distant Earth is one of his all-time greates works in character development and human drama. I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good book.(this review is specific to the mass-market paperback)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Satisfying Odyssey","review":"The Songs of Distant Earth is undoubtably one of the best works Clarke has given in years. Many sci-fi readers and writers tend to forget that storytelling also involves believable characters who move us, and not just science. This book has the most profoundly believable and moving characters Clarke has ever produced. Clarke is visually as well as emotionally evocative, and one can't help but be moved by the tragic circumstance which befalls our hero. It actually feels like this story could happen to any one of us. A truly great read"},{"rating":"2","title":"The BEST...","review":"Any book that can explain away organized religion (I almost converted to the idea of Alpha the utterly indifferent), expalin away organized politics (not government), explain the missing nutrino problem (what appears to be actual now 15 years later is just as amazing, but far less satifying), explain zero point energy and create a world as wonderful as Tarna deserves to be called the best. I do think this is my favorite Arthur C. Clarke book (and I rate it up there with Moving Mars by Greg Bear).You could do much worse than reading this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting premise, poorly developed characters","review":"The basic premise of the book is tantalizing enough - Man seeks to colonize distant stars as Earth is consumed by the sun. Unfortunately, the book is poorly executed. Characters are hastily constructed with little or no depth. Love triangles have a sterile feel that lets you shrug your shoulders and care for no party in particular. While the ambiance of the novel is attractive enough - interstellar travel, a space elevator cameo, a new planet to explore - the actual action occurring within the setting is of very little interest or substance. Clarke does manage to cobble together snippets of philosophical thought - 90% of humans in this future world are bisexual, God has (to the relief of mankind) finally been dispensed with, etc.My lasting impression is that the novel, quite simply, is utterly without a \\"good story\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing","review":"The book was to confusing because there were too many chapters and they were some of them weer too short. The book talk about one topic then a different topic and so on. I didn't get the book becasue I was so confused of what they were talking about. I think this book was poor because it had nosense in the book and there were characters that were confusing when they speak. So this is my review about this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skim-Worthy","review":"As in the equal of the film on top of milk.There's a great premise here, of the destruction of Earth, and the meeting of remnant colonies from different eras. Not original, but a great premise nonetheless. However, the greatness of the premise only magnifies the tragedy of the novel development. Or rather, the lack thereof. For there is no real development here. It was incredibly disappointing. All of the answers you hope for are not included- in fact there are an increasing number of questions raised in the book. It is like the TV show Lost, if there was never a second season. It is as if Clarke came up with the first half of the book and forgot to finish it.This book is filled with long, drawn out romances that are neither interesting nor relevant. It is incredibly anti-Theist, seeking to attack any idea or person who is stupid enough to believe in a god. All this is ignorable if only it had a semblance of a plot; if events progressed, and the storyline completed. It doesn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprisingly outdated","review":"The engineering prophecies were not so much outdated--they were the most interesting part of the novel. It was the blatant anti-religion message that Clarke harped on rather obsessively, as well as the Harlequin-styled romantic passages that could have taken place anywhere, not just on another planet, but more likely in a preachy romance novel. I remembered Clarke as better than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Expect Big Things From Lance Dixon.","review":"Andominii is a great first effort by Lance Dixon. His talent is reminiscent of Richard Bach, author of Jonathan Livingston Seagull, who has the rare ability of being able to entertain and enlighten readers all at the same time. Lance's remarkable insights into truth, combined with formadable story telling capabilities and a genuine gift for verse, result in truly moving passages. Expect big things from Lance Dixon in both his life and his work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting look at a Draftee division","review":"While most US division where pre-war regular Army, or National Guard formations the 88th was formed from manpower pool the draft produced. The author has a personal connection to the division (his father commanded it), and tells its story with a great level of detail. While the story is not as colorful as some of the Guard formations (books on the 29th, 45th and 30th have more of a regional flavor) it still covered some new ground about these unique formations. If the reader is familiar with the Army's WWII manpower and unit/personnel formation policies, some parts of the begining of the book can be skipped."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst MST3K episodes...","review":"Forgive me for saying so, all you MSTies out there like myself, but isn't this movie just a little TOO bad? I mean, even if Joel and the Bots were in their best-ever form (which they absolutely aren't in this episode), would it really be worth it to sit through this cinematic atrocity? Well, maybe if they were as funny as in Pod People, one of their best, but still when a movie is just too bad, it seems like the writers have too much to work with and just work on the obvious (e.g. bad music, long senseless scenes, corny dialouge, no plot whatsoever). But as in Pod People, where its bad, but its production values are just good enough to have the MST3K writers sweat a bit, the episode seems to be much better than usual.I would provide some of the best lines from this episode, but there really aren't any. By the by, stay away from CATALINA CAPER also, for similar reasons."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sidehackers is Better","review":"Much like Sidehackers, this is a season 2 episode starring Ross Hagan in a biker movie. Only there are much more drugs in this one and - believe it or not - much less plot. Actually, it has less plot than darn near any movie I've ever seen. Less plot than Incredibly Strange Creatures even.Hellcats really is one of the worst movies out there. Heck, it's even worse than Girl in Gold Boots.I still consider it to be an episode worth owning, like all the other MST3K DVD releases (except The Atomic Brain). As the old saying goes, even a mediocre episode of MST3K is way better than the best episodes of other shows. If you're on a limited budget though, and can only choose Hellcats or Sidehackers, go with Sidehackers.(On a side note, Ross Hagan's name in Sidehackers is Rommel, and I don't even know what his name is in this one. The movie never bothers to tell the audience I guess.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brought to you by Sgt. Exposition and Detective Plot Point.","review":"This is without a doubt one of the worst movies ever forced upon the inhabitants of the SOL. It concerns a guy getting revenge on the gangsters who killed his brother. He does this by joining a outlaw motorcycle gang, where drugs and alcohol are the staples of life. Joel and the 'bots rip this movie to shreds, among the oddities of this film are: an exciting off-camera motorcycle race, endless scenes of people riding motorcyles and an odd fight scene near the end.

As it is, it is not worth watching unless you want to study Streep's inspired acting job in this otherwise epic disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meryl Amazing, Movie Not So Much","review":"The only reason to watch this movie is because Meryl Streep puts on another amazing performance. Brilliant as always, if you are a fan of her as an actress you will enjoy seeing her fully become the character. The reason I rate the movie lowly though, as I am a big fan of Margaret Thatcher and I thought this movie sold her short. Thatcher became powerful when politics was still really an old boys club and policies helped to steer England on a successful course. Unfortunately, the director probably isn't an conservative and therefore steers away from any positive portrayal of her ideas. Therefore, Thatcher comes across as kind of weak as you don't really see all that she accomplished. Without the policies playing more of a central role, the movie just felt flat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hugely Disappointed","review":"Dreadful film making. I can imagine the outcry if the story of Reagan was told in a similar way. I was really looking forward to learning the story of Maggie, but hated the time given to 'current' story / dementia (not sure if it is even accurate) and the focus on aspects of her later life that are so unimportant. I rarely tune out during a movie, and didn't expect to on this one, but I did. It's a real shame as the actresses were great. It totally deserves the number of one star reviews it is getting. What an opportunity missed. Hopefully someone one day will tell Maggie's story properly. I was never a fan of the lady, but wanted to see the story of a strong British PM done right.

That's what this movie does to Margo Thatcher. I read a review that said it was a \\"lefty's wet dream\\" but I don't understand how NOT telling her story serves anyone's purpose? And that's what this story is guilty of. I gave it 2 stars only because Streep was great as an actress. You can't blame the woman that the movie went nowhere.

Supposedly she became prime minister only due to her stubborn bullying during a backlash against the labor and liberal parties. It's obvious these filmmakers hate her with a passion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This movie focused too much on the end of Ms. Thatcher's life instead of telling the story of the remarkable things that she did while she served as Prime Minister. Once again the Hollywood leftist elite told the story the way they wanted it to be remembered. I was expecting the story of an exceptional woman who accomplished amazing things during a tumultuous time. Instead, the story focused on what Ms. Thatcher MAY be like now-- elderly, delusional, and confused. I kept waiting for the movie to go into the main story, and it never did. I'm so glad we didn't buy this movie on DVD as it would have been a tremendous waste of money and storage space.In the long term, people will remember Margaret Thatcher as the great person that she was, long after they will have forgotten everything about the people who made this disappointing movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"interesting and entertaining","review":"i would recomend this movie. meryl Streep is a very good actress.the move was interesting, educational and entertaing all at the same time"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was really looking foward to this movie because I love Meryl Streep and I was interested to see the story of an important woman in history. While Streep's acting was great, the storyline was somewhat flat.

There was very little of that. It seemed like 90% of the movie was spent showing her elderly state of dementia. Yes, Meryl Streep did a superb acting job, as always. But I walked out of the theatre wishing I had not wasted my money watching it. What a huge disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Missed Opportunity","review":"I was extremely disappointed with this movie. While Streep's performance was amazing I just shake my head at the approach of the filmmakers. A looming historical figure like Margaret Thatcher deserves a better film depicting her life.Like many other reviewers I grew weary of the hallucinations and would have preferred a simple telling of Lady Thatcher's fascinating life and politics. I never felt as if we got a chance to know anyone in the movie, including Thatcher herself. The only version we see consistently is the Thatcher suffering from dementia. I find that insulting.The movie glosses over most of her time in office as Prime Minister. Where was the Cold War? I believe the Falkland Islands got 5-7 minutes of screen time. Shocking!A sad telling of an incredible story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not about Thatcher but of an old woman with dementia","review":"Not a movie about Margaret Thatcher but of an old woman with dementia who lived through the Thatcher years. The reasoning and arguments for Thatcher's politics are never explored through constant, yet fleeting flashbacks to oppositional flashpoints in her career. Revelations of her intelligence, personality, character, wit, convictions, passions, and the whys of her political philosophy are all left unexamined. I learned zilch about the Iron Lady from this movie. Essentially a venue for Streep to pick up an oscar for effectively capturing some of the mannerisms of an aged Thatcher."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disastrous and Unfair","review":"I was appalled by this movie. It did not accentuate Lady Thatcher's enormous accomplishments. Rather it emphasized her battle with Alzheimer's disease, portraying her as a lost soul.

Shame on the producers for trying to make a conservative political figure so pathetic!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"As others have said, Meryl Streep is a great actress. However, the film I believe had a political agenda. In sum, the film's message was that Mrs. Thatcher's efforts were a failure. It would have been interesting if the story took off from her father's forewarning of the post-war socialism emerging in Great Britain, and indeed throughout Europe now, and its current economic state. She wanted to reduce the climate of populace dependency and inspire citizens to be productive and contributors to the national economy. Mrs. Thatcher was a visionary and has left an enduring legacy whose efforts reestablished Britain as a world-power and improved its economic position. I was not impressed with this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrid","review":"Don't waste your time. I'm sitting here with my family; everyone had high hopes. Everyone hates it!

If you haven't seen it yet go see it she gave one of the most touching and gripping performances of the year! A+"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Iron Lady","review":"Every once in a while, a movie comes along that will compel me to say, \\"It's worth seeing for the acting alone,\\" and if ever there was a prime example of this phenomenon, it was last year's The Iron Lady. In The Iron Lady, Meryl Streep plays former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher with the same chameleonic grace she harnessed for her portrayal of Julia Child in 2009's Julie & Julia. Told primarily in flashback, Phyllida Lloyd's portrait begins in Thatcher's youth, then traces her rise to power and chronicles her involvement in certain key historical events. To get a sense of my opinion of the film, consider the following: Lloyd's only other feature directorial effort, 2008's ABBA-themed musical Mamma Mia, is actually better The Iron Lady, but for her work on the latter, Streep took home Best Actress honors from the Golden Globes, the BAFTAs, and the Academy Awards. In other words, The Iron Lady is worth seeing for the acting alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forget the politics and accuracy; it's just boring","review":"1. I'll make this review short and sweet: forget the politics and forget the pro / con arguments regarding the \\"accuracy\\" of this movie. Yes, those are important things for a movie that deals with someone's life. But the overwhelming issue with this movie is even more basic; it's just a dreadfully boring movie. Furthermore, this lamest of movies is exacerbated by the terrible method of film making (at least in this case) where the scenes go from the present (ie demented state) to the past.2. Bottomline: to all potential folks interested in watching this movie (and it doesn't matter if your liberal, conservative or unclear), just do yourself a huge favor and bypass this movie because it's just simply boring and semi-confused."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great acting, lousy story.","review":"Meryl Streep did an amazing job in her role, amazing performance. However, we did not like this ,movie due to the horrible writing. This could have been such a good movie about the rise of Margret Thatcher. Instead the primary focus was her going senile, most people will have problems as the age. We were disappointed that the director chose to capitalize on her aging problems instead of delivering a solid story about this historical woman, I'm glad we rented this. This is one we will never watch again. Real disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good performance but many details were ommitted","review":"Streep's performance was superb, which rightfully earned her an Academy Award in her portrayal of The Iron Lady in her twilight. The film was a contrast between Thatcher's mental decline in her old age with her iron determination against a phalanx of \\"good ole boys---no women allowed,\\" Argentinian dictators, Soviet dictators, IRA terrorists and leftist psychopaths. Contrary to so much leftist propaganda and caricature (no to mention historical falsehoods),Thatcher did so much good for Britain and we only get a glimpse of it---and that glimpse is not very detailed and ever so brief. I understand the movie's emphasis and its accurate portrayal, but there was so much more that they could have focused on instead. Maybe some day we will get a full treatment of her career; that will be an awesome movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit disappointed.","review":"I admire Mrs Thatcher, very much. I found this to be very sad and a bit depressing. It's the way the writer and/or director chose us to view Mrs. Thatchers thoughts, ways and life style.

Not having these expectations, I thought the script was well done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Meryl gave her usual sterling performance with what she had to work with, which was not much. This should have been a really good story about a marvelous woman and her time in office, when she WAS the Iron Lady, not her older years and failing abilities. I found it sad and disappointing, not at all what was expected. The author did her a disservice by almost ignoring her accomplishments and focusing on the wrong part of her life."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disservice to a great leader in the free world.","review":"The Iron Lady was a poor representation of Margaret Thatcher's great accomplishments as a strong conservative leader from 1979 to 1990. Leave it to Hollywood and Meryl Streep to portray this great woman as a doughty old lady living with her memories of the past. Don't waste your time watching this movie if you want to learn about Margaret Thatcher during her three terms as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.Meryl Streep won the Oscar for her portrayal as Margaret Thatcher and I give Ms. Streep credit for her acting. Too bad The Iron Lady script didn't give the actress material to better portray this outstanding woman and her politial career. Perhaps, that was the goal for all involved."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whoever wrote the screenplay must've been on LSD!","review":"As has been reported many times before, this movie focused way too much on Margaret Thatcher's dementia. Regardless of how one might feel about Margaret Thatcher politically, she was coherent for most if not all of the time she was in office. All that said, Meryl Streep's portrayal was truly stellar and worthy of award! We rented this movie via Amazon ($2.00 cheaper than iTunes!) and I'm glad we did, as this is not the kind of movie I would ever want to see again. All in all, an unsatisfying piece of entertainment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Couldn't believe that the story about such an important figure--the first and only woman prime minister of England focused on her delusional end! I doubt that much of it was even true. Was this in a way sexist? It reminded me how the rumor began that Thatcher and the Queen were very much at odds with each other. Both denied it. Thatcher said the story of two powerful women being at odds with each other was just too good not to make up. I think that pretty much applies to most of this movie. Streep of course was awesome. Not enough for me though to give this a pass."},{"rating":"2","title":"The movie was great... for what it was....","review":"The story of Margaret Thatcher was good. It may have not gone into all of her accomplishments as it should have, but the story was good, and I thought it made her appear as a great leader."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning Portrayal","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed the portrayal of Margaret Thatcher. She was portrayed as she would have wanted to be. In the movie, we had the opportunity to travel through her grief experience as she said goodbye to her husband - a privilege few have. She was a remarkable woman who lived her life according to her beliefs. Streep portrayed her as she was - authoritarian, autocratic, a bit arrogant. Streep gave insight into the inner mind and heart of Thatcher."},{"rating":"2","title":"Meryl Streep is the ULTIMATE ACTRESS","review":"Last week my husband and I watched this film. As always Meryl Streep was wonderful as the \\"Iron Lady\\".Although the film was a little choppy in that it did not fully develop the relationship between daughter and mother in the absence of the obvious favorite \\"son\\", I found it to be very enlightening from a historical stand-point.I realize it took artistic license in some cases, but all in all I thought it was a very well written film and again, the acting was wonderful by Ms. Streep and the supporting cast as well!(We purchased the actual DVD. We did not use the instant video option.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"The BIG SNOOZE","review":"I very much like Meryl Streep, too, but this was one of the most BORING and negative films I've ever seen. I was determined to see it through to the end, but I was able to do so only by repeatedly putting it on \\"pause,\\" then leaving the room to wash dishes or make a snack or read my horoscope. The film's structure - incessantly jumping back and forth between Ms. Thatcher's memories and her present mental state - did not make the story any better or more interesting either. That technique just made it harder to follow the story. I understand that Ms. Thatcher was perceived as a leader and a very strong woman (iron-willed), but this film presented a very unflattering portrait of her as a selfish and self-centered woman, whose attitude seemed to be \\"it's my way or the highway.\\" The way she dressed down Geoffrey Howe (Anthony Head) at a cabinet meeting was brutal, rude, and insensitive, and just plain bully behavior."},{"rating":"1","title":"They should have called the movie the Crazy Lady","review":"The movie focused heavily on her dementia in later life and only outlined the challenges she faced as Prime Minister. Her time as PM was filled with dramatic events that could have made the movie compelling and yet they only outlined a few of them and hardly ever showed how she responded to those events. It felt like they were trying to marginalize her time as PM, and I never felt invested in the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad, depressing, boring movie.","review":"Sad, depressing, boring, movie. Kept waiting for it to better; to so show some of the great moments in history. Could not take it. Stopped watching. I want my money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"The makeup artists were good, but...","review":"It seemed that the intent of the movie was to portray Lady Thatcher as little more than a power-hungry and selfish person who, as a conservative, was out of touch with everything and everybody. Rather than focusing on her accomplishments or place in history, most of the movie is devoted to alzheimer's disease. Kudos to the makeup artists. The rest was very disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked it","review":"Born in the 70s I have vague memories of Thatcher and Reagan. I liked how they portrayed the subject matter, mostly in flashbacks. It brought a sense of time to the piece and was original. The flashbacks to me brought a sense of humanity to Thatcher, with the typical young to middle age Thatcher portrayed in snippets instead of taking all of the film. I like the idea that we will all end up like she was in the film, old and nearing death. However she had good memories and very proud achievements to reflect on, and at least for me made me reflect a bit on what I may be like in 40 more years if I live that long. The bits with her husband, and her children I thought brought her humanity to the stage, and not just the political achievements she had. It was original, had some human depth, and portrayed a human being in the frailty of old age which some people may find disconcerting. If you want something more than the Biography channel type of standard fare, then check it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"They Are Right: One Star","review":"I am sorry, I really wanted to like this film.

Had Meryl not done such a phenomenal acting job I would have given this 0-1 stars. I expected this movie would bash Margaret Thatcher because she was head of the Conservative Party but this went beyond that. It was bizzare and almost Felliniesk with the whole movie revolving around her implied dementia and halucinations of her long dead husband. It never stopped.Here we have a movie about one of the strongest women of modern times rising up through an all boys club and becoming the longest reigning PM of Britian and all it want to show is her declining years in a delerium!?!?!? What is going on? I would have loved to have known how her career came about, who helped what brought her to her convictions, her relationship with Reagan. I could go on but what's the point. It was horrible and I cannot recommend this movie, despite the outstanding performance of Myrel Streep."},{"rating":"1","title":"A truly awful movie","review":"\\"The Iron Lady\\" provided Meryl Streep with an excellent opportunity to play an individual suffering from dementia. However, it was a chronically poor interpretation of the life and times of Margaret Thatcher. So much is missing. If you do not already have extensive knowledge of Britain and British domestic policy in the 1970s and 80s (which most American audiences will not...) this film will mean nothing to you. The Miner's Strike and her relationships with Arthur Scargill and Ronald Reagan were barely touched upon! Yes, Meryl Streep is a great actor but we already knew that...\\"The Iron Lady\\" seems to have been made solely to win Streep another Oscar but that is not the reason I go and see movies. The emphasis on the least significant period of Thatcher's life has come at the expense of doing justice to the career of an important individual and a crucial period in Britain's history. Very, very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Iron Lady insulted!","review":"This movie is a travesty. I bought it unseen because Meryl Streep is one of my favorite actresses and I anticipated a great story about a great lady and one of the best Prime Ministers Britain has ever had. Instead what I got was an insult to the memory and history of this woman. The movie focuses far too much on her illness after she retired from government service, and very little on the substance and successes of her time in office. I'm sure Meryl Streep deserved her Oscar for her acting since she was very convincing as the Margaret Thatcher I remember in office, but she's not responsible for the content and the ridiculous way the movie kept jumping about from one time period to another. If you are buying this as a historical portrait of a fine leader, then give it a pass. If it's a diary of a fallen heroine suffering the misery of senile dementia you're looking for then enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Movie is a total bore","review":"I wouldn't waste my money purchasing this movie. If you really want to see it, wait til it comes out on TV or at least when it's available at a Red Box where it'll only cost you just over a dollar to rent it. We found this movie extremely boring, really didn't think the movie would be more about dementia/alzheimers and not more emphasis of the contributions this woman had in history. Even though Meryl Streep is a brilliant actress, my husband and I felt we should've picked one of the other movies at the theatre the night we went as this one was just plain boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Appauling Disrespectful and Shameful","review":"This movie gravely disrespected one of history's greatest leaders and pioneering women of modern times - Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. A women who understood how stand up for solid moral values. Understood what honor is, to do the right thing whether or not it was popular or it might cost you. Ultimately, this was a ridiculous political farce trying to demean value and character based living and leadership by portraying it as an old, drunken, and insane thing of the past. In this time, and especially in our country, the need for leadership based in good character, integrity, the courage to fight for the \\"general welfare\\" and not for what is just good for me, and to be willing to be unpopular for the sake of truth is paramount. This was a pitiful attempt to discredit this desperately needed philosophical position of leadership. Shame on Streep for this defaming portrayal of a historical figure who should be lauded and emulated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge Disapointment!","review":"This was poorly produce movie. The producer obvious intent was to make her look as bad as possible. They focused on the end of her life instead of the time she was in office. The political intent was obvious."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Confused and Bad Movie","review":"Why was this movie made? It is a confused jumble of scenes of Streep playing Margaret Thatcher as a long retired, senile eldely woman. That she was elected Prime Minister three times, survived IRA assassination attempts, was a long time friend and ally of President Ronald Reagan, is all relegated to the back third of the movie.This is arrogant Hollywood nonsense. If a \\"biopic\\" of Reagan or PM Tony Blair were treated this way, it would draw anger or laughter. Instead, Streep wins an Oscar for a farce.Whether the viewer was a supporter or opponent, she was a dominant political figure. You wouldn't know it from this mess. A younger generation will skip it all together having no idea what they are watching. What a missed opportunity.Maybe the backroom script battles should have been filmed instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disparagement of the success of a conservative leader","review":"We pre-ordered this DVD 3 months ago it just came. I was surprised to see that the film is an attack on the successful and conservative prime minister of Britain. It is silly, long and boring. I should have known it would have liberal anti-Thatcher slant when Meryl Streep got the academy award.There isn't much to attack her with over cutting taxes and busting the labor unions. Unfortunately, however there are many ridiculous fabricated conversations between Margaret and the ghost of her late husband; too much.The film portrays Mrs. Thatcher as a cold woman who was rude to allies in cabinet meetings and who sent soldiers to fight and die in the Falklands.There were so many flash backs; it was disjointed and a huge disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Story, Very Poor Presentation","review":"Margaret Thatcher is a very interesting lady and her life is amazing. I don't mind movies that do flashbacks, but this one goes back-and-forth so much that a few times I wasn't sure where we were on the timeline. Confusing method of telling a great story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Movie!","review":"This is an excellent movie! Acting: superb! Mrs. Thatcher's words go straight to the heart. A tell-it-like-it-is type of lady. I will buy this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie and Effective Concept","review":"The life of Margaret Thatcher, told in flashbacks to all periods of her life as the reflections of a woman in mental decline who is also recently widowed - a very eerie concept that I found spellbinding - I don't agree with those who say this story moves too slowly. This was a fascinating history lesson, especially for those who are not British and for whom her political stances in Great Britain were unknown. Meryl Streep is nothing short of perfect; a performance where the actor/actress disappears and the character emerges - we need more performances of this caliber, regardless of the subject matter. The supporting cast, especially Jim Broadbent, who weaves in and out of Thatcher/Streep's consciousness as the movie progresses, is excellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Iron Lady","review":"The Iron Lady is the worst picture of the year! The writer, director, and Meryl Streep used their far left political views to dismiss Margret Thatcher's greatness down to an old lady who is loosing her mind to dementia. Using flash back story telling to show her rise to becoming Prime Minister of England, the story line leans left and does not give Margret Thatcher her due as a great conservative leader. I walked away from this movie disappointed. My recommendation is don't buy this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disrespectful Movie","review":"Why does a movie about a great woman like Margaret Thatcher focus on the sad decline that occurs as a result of dementia? That's like making a movie about Alexander the Great and focusing the majority of the movie on his last days while dying in bed. A total waste of an opportunity to tell the story of one of the most influential people in the past 100 years while having at your disposal the services of perhaps the greatest actress of all time! The achievements of Margaret Thatcher and the pivotal moments in history that she helped shape should have been thoroughly explored so that current and future generations would have something to remember.

It cut in and out of her life which I suppose was as an elderly woman, portraying her somewhat with dementia and delusions with some info from flashbacks? to the time that she was Prime Minister and how she got there. There were four of us watching this we all came away wondering what that was about. It felt like a Dali painting you know its supposed to be a woman but the parts are all over the place.Margaret Thatcher was a fascinating woman she deserved better....Meryl Streep, the real selling point in the trailer was, as usual fabulous."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of time","review":"This movie is so disappointing..i was looking forward to seeing this movie because I admire Margaret Thatcher so much. I was disappointed in Meryl Streep for portraying Margaret Thatcher as a demented old woman, instead of the strong world leader that Margaret Thatcher was. It is disgusting to me to see Margaret Thatcher portrayed this way. Hollywood obviously disliked Margaret Thatcher's conservative politics so they chose to portray her this way. It shows how morally bankrupt Hollywood is when they cannot tell the truth about one of the truly great women leaders in the history of the world."},{"rating":"1","title":"A missed opportunity","review":"The movie had a lot of promise but essentially fails if its task is to provide a fair portrayal of the former U.K. prime minister Thatcher. Ms. Thatcher's accomplishments are substantial and have influenced the world greatly. The movie's primary focus is her battle with Alzheimer's and the movie is a series of flashbacks as perceived through the veil of the illness. Why the illness is so important to the movie maker, I am not sure but I can only suspect a desire to diminish the stature of the prime minister or of her accomplishments. A chronological movie would have been a much more accurate portrayal. Mere minutes are spent on key events such as the battle of the Falklands, the end of cold war, and many others.Meryl Streep does a good job in her role as Ms. Thatcher as she often does in any role.You might find some nuggets of value in this movie but don't make it your sole source of information about Margaret Thatcher."},{"rating":"1","title":"it opens on a strong note and then???","review":"After the first 5-10 minutes into the movie, I was expecting a blockbuster. Just like the Titanic, the movie opens up with the senile thatcher similar to the old lady Rose we see in the beginning of Titanic. No one wants to see Rose as an old woman tell a tale about her life in the present (i'd rather ready Thatchers biography....we want to actually experience the trip on the Titanic--the final voyage that leads to its demise and her survival (who cares if Rose is a fictional character)....the point is I was expecting to see more of Thatcher's life (the big moments...actually PLAYED out...)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring telling of a great story","review":"Marget Thacher is a woman of thinking and action. Yet this movie is all idle talk and superficial feeling. This movie is the opposite of who she is. She was the first woman head of state of an industrialized country.

The story line is confused and the continual \\"visions\\" of her dead husband become tedious. The script seems incomplete and the editing is absolutely dreadful.

Apparently she had some form of dementia. We only get a brief moment on the Falklands War. We get some archival footage that is accurate. Less accurate are some of the staged sections depicting attacks by Irish Nationalists/Republicans. The car MP Neave is blown up in should be blue, not red. The INLA took him out. When the Provos trashed out the hotel in Brighton where the Conservative Party was holding a meeting I thought the filmaker could have covered it better.

Because after about twenty minutes of watching it, I had to bail.If a more depressing film got made that year, I don't know which it was. But \\"The Iron Lady?\\" What were they thinking when they made this?Spoiler Alert!!! The first quarter or so of the film is mainly Mrs. Thatcher shown in serious decline -- just hours away, it seemed, from complete absorption in senile dementia. And the only relief provided from that -- for the audience, that is --was by brief flashbacks of what she was sketchily able to remember about her past.Now, like her or not, one has to admit that Mrs Thatcher lived an interesting life. Certainly one that was worth a biography or two. Given that, though, why one that focuses so on a tragic closing episode?Like I said, however, I didn't watch \\"The Iron Lady\\" in its entirety. Couldn't.

Those of us who remember her as Prime Minister and even lived in Great Britain at that time and watched her on TV saw a different person. Still I think the movie was done well and Meryl Streep really captured the character with hair, makeup, mannerisms, and voice. I liked Jim Broadbent in the role of the older Dennis Thatcher. She truly will be an unforgettable leader who really stood for conservative values and wouldn't back down under the most political pressures."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Gripping Autobiography","review":"The Iron Lady was very entertaining in that it documented the life of Margaret Thatcher from her humble beginning as a shop keeper's daughter to the most powerful woman in the free world.

Meryl Streep's award-winning portrayal cannot save \\"The Iron Lady\\" (2011) from its bad filmmaking technique. Pretentiously directed, clumsily scripted and choppily edited, this cinematic travesty does a tremendous disservice to Margaret Thatcher and Streep's remarkable talents. A squandered opportunity to capture the life and times of Britain's first woman prime minister."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING Amazon Purchase","review":"Despite the talent of Meryl Streep and the many other performances which I have enjoyed by her, I was totally disapointed. This movie does not live up to the rave reviews received by many. I was also disappointed with the historical aspect of this film, where there appears to be great spans of Mrs. Thatcher's life omitted with way too much attention towards her decling years. The Devil Wears Prada still remains my favorite Streep movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass on this one","review":"Streep gives her usual fine performance, although she sounds a bit like her rendition of Julia Childs. The real problem with this film is that it makes no attempt to teach us anything about Margaret Thatcher and how and why she came to be what she is. Instead the script dwells on ghosts, delusions, declining health, and what we are supposed to believe was an unreasonable, domineering drive. Unfortunately the film can be used to illustrate what we mean by a \\"Hollywood\\" version of a famous and influential person's life. Perhaps someday there will be an attempt to probe Mrs. Thatcher's life and the influences that made her who she became in a serious way, but this is not it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring movie","review":"I found the approach of focusing on an elderly Margaret Thatcher in her declining years and flashing back to events in her life very unpleasant and disjointed. This was a Lady who had an enormous effect on her country and it would have made a compelling film to present her life story in a normal progression with minimal emphasis on her post prime minister days."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating and Disturbing","review":"I wanted to like this movie, I really did. It has some great moments, but the whole movie revolves around MT's dementia and it moves at an agonizing pace. After the first ten minutes you want to tell the director, \\"okay Maggie is getting old and her mental faculties are no longer 100% we get it, move on\\" but the movie continues to bludgeon you with it in almost every scene. Another issue I had was there were some attempts at cinematic imagery, that were unevenly applied. When combine those with the constant portrayal of MT's dementia it was very difficult to figure out what was supposed to be historical and what was the director attempting to be \\"artful\\". Great sets, good acting, mediocre cinematography, substandard plot and metering."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zero Stars","review":"Can I give a review with zero stars?

So much of the movie was focused on Thatcher's supposed dementia in her old age rather than on her conflicts or achievements. I can't for the life of me understand why Meryl Streep agreed to do this crap movie. Perhaps she felt she couldn't pass up the chance to play m. thatcher. Well she should've waited for the next m. thatcher screenply to come along. As talented as she is even her perfection could not save this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"The lost time and money I will not get back","review":"I had to stop watching and walk away. I was very disappointed, I was expecting so much more. SInce the Oscar was won. Sorry, it was a very undeserving win. I am upset with the voters for making me think the movie was worth watching. It was disjointed, slow and hard to follow. It was a waste of an opportunity to show why she was the Iron Lady, all I saw was a sad confused alone woman, who talked to her dead husband, whom we had a hard time following was not there.

This should have been more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sqaundered Opportunity","review":"Such a waste of resources! Maggie Thatcher is one of my heroes and I was so looking forward to seeing at least a semi-accurate portrayal of her by Hollywood's most accomplished actress. What I saw instead was a dispiriting depiction of a mere shadow of the \\"Iron Lady\\". For the first 20 minutes of the film we must endure an image of the stooped, aged, confused figure of the former Prime Minister wandering from room to room and trying to outwit her keepers for the occasional solo stroll to the corner convenience store. I breathed a sigh of relief when the film finally transitioned to a younger portion of her life. But the respite was frustratingly brief. The film continued its bewildering \\"ping-pong\\" format throughout to its vacuous conclusion.

It keeps jumping around to different parts of her life in a random order. I am not a history buff, so it was difficult for me to follow and know what was going on in the movie. My husband loves history and enjoyed the movie much more than I did because he could follow along, but since this is my opinion I only gave it two stars.

I knew very little about Margaret Thatcher before watching The Iron Lady & was hoping for a much better historical account of her place in Brittish & world politics.

Margaret Thatcher as The Iron Lady is very interesting, but we get only tiny tastes of the famous Steep powers of impersonation of Ms. Thatcher in her heyday. However, those snippets are no substitute for a fully fledged, well acted, character biopic.

The actor was wonderful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Iron Lady","review":"Mery Streep gives an awesome performance as usual in this film. In Iron Lady, former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher is an elderly woman who suffers with dimentia. In her mental state, she frequently converses with her beloved deceased husband when no one is nearby to overhear. The movie flashes back and forth from present day to earlier times and touches on her personal life as well as her political ambitions. Scenes from her formative years as the daughter of a grocer give glimpses into the formation of her political thought. It was in this environment that she learned firsthand the value of a hard earned dollar. No doubt, that life experience contributed to her grit as an adult. The movie may be lackluster for some but I enjoyed seeing the old girl again via Meryl Streep."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was like looking back in time.

This movie stinks, plain and simple. There was so much more they could have done with this movie. There are mountains of material and accomplishments for Margret Thatcher. Why didn't they do a lot more like \\"Evita\\" but without the musical. Prime Minister Thatcher was a great and accomplished lady. This movie did her such an injustice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific all around","review":"One expects Meryl Streep to be fantastic, and she did win the Academy Award for her portrayal of Margaret Thatcher in \\"Iron Lady\\" so I certainly expected that her performance would be great. But \\"fantastic\\" and \\"great\\" only begin to describe this performance in which the actress almost at times disappears, leaving only Margaret Thatcher on the screen, and an aged and infirm Thatcher at that. Streep is so incredible, just a perfect performance in a very interesting and enjoyable movie.Thumbs up to the makeup artists as well, whose work here is invisible. If you had never seen Meryl Streep before, you'd assume she looks just as she does in this movie.The cast all around is terrific, the script is tight and interesting. The drama is leavened at times with humor and spirit, at times piercing in its sadness, but always, always interesting.Recommendation: Absolutely, two thumbs way up."},{"rating":"1","title":"ABSOLUTE RUBBISH","review":"Here is a great lady, who made great contributions to her country and the world. Approximately two-thirds of this movie is absolute dribble about Margaret seeing her dead husband, forgetting who she is, where she is or what day it is. There is precious little in this film that really focuses on her great accomplishments. Today, we in America need heroes and heroines. It appears that the job of Hollywood is to do all they can to diminish anyone we could look up to. The same happened in the movie \\"J Edgar\\" where the main focus of the movie was on him being gay and dressing up in women's clothes. It appears that anyone who has done great things, Hollywood makes movies about them to totally discredit them as human beings in an effort to smear those who we could look up to as our heroes or heroines. Hollywood: Shame on you!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Some history, but too much dementia","review":"The movie lacks focus.Fine acting by Streep.First 20 to 30 minutes are like the Sargasso Sea;drifting and wondering, \\"When does this movie begin and what is it about?\\"Once the history begins it becomes a little interesting and picks up some momentum.Not a well-done film for any reason.After thinking about it, I side with those who are angry that the movie slights the living M.Thatcher by the emphasis on her mental issues in later life while she still lives.The focus tends to the negative, and once again, so tiringly, the \\"media\\" craps on \\"Conservatism\\" and a Conservative Icon.I'm happy that I rented this instead of purchased.The movie is basically a stinker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Review of Iron Lady","review":"This was a TERRIBLE movie! Very disappointing. I did not want to see a movie about Margaret Thatcher in her dotage. Meryl Streep did a good job of portraying her as the prime minister, but the way the movie presented things was disjointed and I thought that picturing her as a senile old lady was demeaning to the memory of her as a powerful political and historical figure."},{"rating":"1","title":"fiction","review":"I was NOT happy with this film. Yes, Meryl Streep was brilliant, but the plot? meh.first of all, it doesn't pertain at all to historical facts.

She turned in her usual outstanding performance and deserves the Oscar. Certainly she didn't have much to work with. The screenplay was awful!The movie opens with Thatcher as an elderly woman. Then it flashes back to her childhood, when she got into Oxford and when she met Denis Thatcher. My problem is the back and forth between elderly woman and MP and Prime Minister. They spent too much time on her as an elderly woman and less on her rise in Parliament. Also, they kept bringing Denis' ghost back after he died and that really confused things!Don't waste your money buying this. Nothing against Streep, but she should have had some input into the screenplay. They didn't touch much on her political career at all. They didn't explore her friendship with Reagan or her relationship with the Queen. Get this on DVD. It's not worth the money and I wish I hadn't bouught it.

It's a platform for Streep's admittedly top-notch impersonation. I say \\"impersonation\\" rather than \\"performance' because the complete lack of depth to the film gives her no character arc and no dimension. It's Oscar bait at its least satisfying. You'll get more insight into Thatcher by reading her Wikipedia entry, and there's nothing in Streep's performance you didn't see in her Oscar clip. Check out an old episode of \\"Spitting Image\\" instead for a far more interesting take on Thatcher."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another partisan hack job out of Hollywood","review":"Meryl Streep revising history and doing a hack job on one of the greatest leaders of the 20th century. Unfortuanately, Hollywood types are incapable of producing anything without their political slant.

She had the opporunity to make a great moview but ended up making a obvious hack job."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrid portrayal","review":"This is one of the worst movies ever made about Lady Thatcher. It portrays her as an almost insignificant and pitiful weak woman who is out of her mind. Further, her actions with Reagan to bring about the end of the cold war are all but unmentioned.

Very little substance to this movie. I would not recommend this movie unless you want to see some good acting about dementia/delirium.The analogy to this would be a movie about Reagan that spent 3/4 of it showing him unable to take care of himself.

The story was not compelling. They do some artsy-fartsy movie stuff with Thatcher talking to her dead husband. This is fine if the rest of the movie is interesting - but it isn't. The politics are not interesting, the characters are not interesting and there is no story of interest to follow. I fell asleep half way through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Agree with the bulk of reviewers: Streep = A, Movie = C-","review":"This movie uses the fairly common framing device of telling the story via flashbacks from the viewpoint of the aged subject of the film. In this case, I agree with many reviews that far too much of the movie focuses on the elderly, dementia afflicted Thatcher and not nearly enough on her achievements in rising to be the first female Prime Minister of Great Britain. Whether this was politically motivated or simply an artistic choice to focus on the more intimate, poignant end of life for a power figure, I don't know, but the movie suffered for it. It's unavoidable to compare and contrast this with other recent bio-pics of 20th century British figures such as The King's Speech and The Queen, which both come off FAR more cohesively than this fragmented film does.Streep gives her usual fantastic performance of course, but I wish I'd read reviews before watching this to at least be prepared for a huge disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"SLOW odd film","review":"This movie was very slow and strange with Lady Thatcher's hallucinations of her deceased husband.

This begins the delightful blending of mythologies that makes the story so unique. Not only does he travel to Elfland to meet the Faery Queen (and receive her \\"gift\\" of only being able to tell the truth), he also travels to the fabled Asgard, world of the gods of the Norse pantheon--most notably Loki, who is portrayed with a malice and madness that are faithful to the archetype of the trickster.Tomas is a real and believable hero, as well as a real and believable person, and the denizens of Faery are eerie and otherwordly.

I was especially looking for some good stories about the making of \\"Hello, Dolly!\\" but that experience was pretty much given short shrift in the book. What I found consistently dull was the actor's frequent references to sexual matters and certain bodily functions which I found neither amusing nor interesting, certainly not topics that you would enjoy sharing with several million people whom you don't know.

The other two books, in particular Basics, were written long after Elements and thus are much more incompassing, including theory and practice, and Basics by Chandler even has a glossary at the back.

I would not recommend this product unless you want to try your luck, I used the previously review to make my decision and was hoping for a better solution than having to lose my ipod to a refurbished one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't Work For My Mini..","review":"The reviews on this product were pretty positive, so I thought I'd give it a shot. The directions were easy enough to follow, but I had to chip up the cover a bit in order to get the top and bottom open with the instrument they provided. In the end, the new battery never worked. After charging it in the wall, the screen would just blink if I plugged it into my computer, and the iPod itself would never turn on. I think I was better off beforehand. At least my old battery gave me a couple hours of playtime."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read-aloud","review":"As a fourth grade teacher, I always searched for good read-alouds that would appeal to both girls and boys. Betsy Byars is such a gifted author that when I saw her name on this book I gave it a try. It was such a favorite that I read it to twelve years' worth of classes.... and never got tired of the story myself! One of Byars' great talents is making her characters believable. There wasn't a false note in any of the characters of this book. A seemingly minor character, Petie, contributes great \\"laugh out loud\\" humor to the story. The story itself has deep felt emotions, tension, interesting characters, suspense, descriptive sense of place - all the qualities of a book you'd enjoy and remember. Each of the other reviews of this book have given the plot line, so I won't repeat it. I consider this one of my favorite childrens' books."},{"rating":"2","title":"A review by Mona Nightshade","review":"Tony is a boy that has never done anything ecxeptional.His father tells him that his parents are going on a bike tour of Europe, and Tony will have to stay on a farm (with pigs) with his aunt and uncle.

The aunt and uncle decide they have to kill the foxes so they don't eat any of their animals. Tom try's to save the foxes from his aunt and uncle. Tom is a city boy and turns to love his uncle's farm. I give this book two stars because this book is very dull and boring since the characters are not fun and not much happens throughout this book.

The main characters are Tome, (the boy) Uncle Fred, and the fox. His uncle Fred wants to kill the fox because the fox is killing thier chickens.The author Besty Byars does a splended job of putting details in to explain the story clearly. The illastrator Ed Marinex draws very good pictures.I give this book 4 stars because they didn't really do a good job explaining what the characters look liked, but they did give lots of details.If you want to know more about this book get it at you local library and ask for The Midnight Fox."},{"rating":"2","title":"Midnight fox","review":"The midnight fox is about a boy who goes to a farm and then sees the fox the fox is in danger can the boy save the fox from hunters or will he watch the fox die. this book is about courage and wisdom and sadness.

Obviously \\"Music\\" is a highlight but listeners who are not so keen on this masterpiece will find different types of songs to satisfy their appetite. Obviously John is still around making music albeit usually now in a supporting capacity (Tina Turner)but it would be great to see some new output or rereleases.

It gives absolutely the closest shave possible without tearing up anybody's skin. About a year and a half ago I started having trouble finding this razor at all of my local stores, WalMart, CVS, Walgreen's, etc... I found these on line last year and ordered them-I was extremely pleased with the quality and price. This last order was a BIG disappointment. The plastic handle has changed (smaller and more difficult to grip even though the packaging says otherwise), but the blades are not the same. These new Bic Comfort Twins do NOT give a close shave. We are all having to reshave the areas to get a closer shave and then my skin is irritated. Of course by shaving an area twice the blades wear out faster hence more sales? I will probably try one more order from another source to see if I can find the \\"old\\" razors and if not I'll buy another brand locally."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do NOT buy this, because you enjoyed The Secretary Movie","review":"I cannot really evaluate this book on its own merits, because I bought it primarily for its connection to the movie The Secretary. Personally, I did not enjoy any of the short stories much at all, however, I was not really prepared for their bleakness, given the expectations I had from the movie. I suppose it's inevitable that the connection between this book and a successful movie would be exploited, but the themes and premises of the two could not be more at odds. While the movie is a funny, endearing and ultimately normalizing look into a productive BDSM relationship, the short story is a grim and alienating account of sexual harassment, perversion and the destructive nature of sexual compulsion. I think it's audacious that any connection between the two is being emphasized to promote sales."},{"rating":"2","title":"Serious Writing--Not Erotica","review":"Mary Gaitskill understands compulsion well. She takes you along the fringe and down the dark alleys of sexual urgency without pandering or exploiting. These stories are not designed to titillate, although some of them may. There is nothing mechanical, cliched, or pornographic about them. They are stories about the desire for intimacy--or at least some sense of contact--and the difficulty of achieving it. Stories of passion mixed with cold calculation. Is this the \\"other\\"? Or is this you and me? The harsh light of \\"perverseness\\" throws these issues into even sharper relief. A particulary fine example of this is the ironically titled story, \\"A Romantic Weekend,\\" which manages to be both sad and comical. Gaitskill takes a detached view of her characters, but is not pitiless. Her ability to sketch them so precisely presupposes a degree of affection, or acceptance."},{"rating":"1","title":"normal people? no!","review":"Enough with the intellectual high minded reviews. These are short stories about loosers. This book is about the seamier, scummier parts of low life living. Stories about people who enjoy the misery in their lives, who have lousy jobs and refuse to aspire to better themselves, people who cheat and lie and admire themselves for it. Not only that; most of them are physically unattractive to add to the misery. There is nothing pretty or nice in any part of these stories; rooms are dirty and messy, the streets are miserable. why oh why would anyone want to read this? I read 3 stories hoping for some light; none; tried another; I suggest; don't bother."},{"rating":"2","title":"Your Neighbor's Secret Life?","review":"A collection of short stories about people whose idiosyncracies do not conform to society's view of \\"acceptable behavior,\\" but who live essentially normal lives and who are for the most part indistinguishable from the man or women next door. As one might expect in a collection of short stories, not each story is of equal merit, but I found only one (Daisy's Valentine) which I would rate subpar. In my subjective view, the other eight ranged from excellent (Trying To Be, Secretary) to good (Something Nice, Other Factors, Heaven,) to above average (Connection, A Roamtic Weekend, An Affair Ended). Secretary was made into the movie of the same name and Heaven seemed more of an outline for a novel than a short story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disturbed Reader","review":"I read this book for my college English class.. and I wasn't sure what to think (which is bad when you're trying to write a paper... as I'm trying to right now). Gaitskill is an amazing writer; there's no doubt about that. The book is shocking not because of the events, but because of how it reenforces and verifies that these events do indeed happen in American culture. Personally, I walked into the book feeling like quite the angel and left feeling quite devirginized by the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring.","review":"Boring. There's nothing more to say but I have to fill up the required word count. This book was barely readable.

The new scent is NOT the same. Fortunately, I only ordered two, but it has an \\"off\\" smell that is not pleasant. I have an old bottle of the original in the dark tan bottle and am able to do a \\"smell\\" test. Trust me. The new stuff is NOT the same and is not a good fragrance in my opinion. And the difference is not \\"minute\\" as someone else said in their review. Their smeller must not be very strong. I am searching for the product in the original tan bottle before I will buy some. Otherwise, I will have to do without."},{"rating":"1","title":"Synthetic, cheap ingredients","review":"I just bought some diffuser and a bag of potpourri. I've been using the original off and on for about 50 years--since Claire Burke was making it herself. I thought the dried stuff in the bag looked odd. It used to be all rose petals, lavender, something with blue petals, cinnamons spices, etc. in very fine pieces. The last time I bought it the pieces were bigger, but it still smelled okay. This new version resembles whole walnuts and hunks of wood soaked in some kind of synthetically produced version of the real scent. There's no way this could be used for making sachets, which is what I wanted. The diffuser smells almost medicinal. I doubt there is anything in the recipe that includes actual plant matter.It's obvious that this is NOT the original Claire Burke recipe. Whoever is manufacturing this stuff should be ashamed to even use the name on the label. Claire must be spinning in her grave."},{"rating":"1","title":"not the same","review":"Since the company was sold to an american company the fragrance does not hold up as well as it used too. Frangrance does not last very long either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Claire Burke Vapourri Room Spray","review":"I have used this product for many years. It gives your surroundings a delightful, spicy fragrance, which reminds me of a spring day. The can lasts forever without losing its fragrance. The stores that I frequent no longer carry the Claire Burke products, so I was thrilled to find it on Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smells Like Cinnamon.","review":"I don't understand why this products is so expensive and has such rave reviews. The bottle is nice looking and the label is pretty but this just smells like cinnamon.

When the product first came out, many moons ago...., it was the best of the best. Unfortunately, after the original Claire Burke was sold to this current manufacturer, the formula was changed and is no longer as delicate and as \\"powdery\\" as it used to be. It is still very pleasant and one of my favorites."},{"rating":"1","title":"Claire Burke Original Vapourri","review":"About fifteen years ago, I was introduced to Claire Burke's Home Original Vapourri. The smell was heavenly and it was all I used for years. It has a wonderful scent and kept my house smelling fresh for hours. I hadn't used it for about five years and decided to buy somemore. The one I received smells like the formula had been changed from the original Claire Burke I used before. Needless to say, I will never buy this product again. What a huge disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Claire Burked Original is not \\"original\\" anymore!","review":"I ordered a CASE (first and last time doing something like that) of my favorite home spray, Claire Burke Original Vapourri ... and it smells NOTHING like it used to! The new formula is definitely not an improvement over the old, lovely one. In fact, I can't stand the new smell. I wonder why the new company felt they had to tinker with something that was so perfect???"},{"rating":"2","title":"Like having my own little boutique shop in my home","review":"I was first introduced to Claire Burke's Original scent many, many years ago. It seems that every little gift shop and boutique used this as their signature fragrance. Therefore, I still associate it with the simple pleasures of browsing through lovely things in feminine surroundings. And even though Claire Burke has some other great fragrances, the Original is still my favorite.I actually have this fragrance in votives, potpourri, lotion, and Vapourri. Unlike many room freshening sprays, Claire Burke Vapourri lasts a very long time. A few short sprays and your home will smell good all day long.Their website describes the Original fragrance as a scent of roses, lavender and spice blended with patchouli and vetiver. All I know is that it makes my home smell and feel warm, cozy, and feminine. After all these years, I never get tired of walking into my home and being welcomed by this lovely fragrance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scratching? Mixing?

It is quite intense and not for the faint hearted, but it is without doubt one of the best pieces of TV I've ever seen. The writing (apart from the scene where Tim finds out Diane is staying in Enlgand!) is fantastic, as is the acting; it is a veritable who's who of great actors who moved on to star in other mainstream series. If you want drama, thrller, action, deep character development as well as TV that actually makes you think, and proves that there really is no black and white in life, then Oz is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"really disappointed","review":"I bought the dvd series and they were delivered in a timely manner as promised. i'm grateful for that. My issue is season 4 of the series has episodes on both sides of discs.

With great characters fights, and even an interesting plot, this is a great choice for action anime fans. Not only that, the DVD presentation is on this disc is particularly good, with animated menus, trailers, photo galleries, and other extras. Viz and Pioneer went all out with this one. Another surprising point is that although the japanese 5.1 track is higher quality overall, I find that I enjoy some of the English voice actors better (esp. Morrigan and Dimitri). This is a rarity in most anime and makes watching this film in dub or sub equally enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pointless but cool anyways...","review":"I watched volume 2 of this series really not understanding the point of some of the characters. Granted, the first volume wasn't anymore great at introducing them, the second one seems to just pour character after character onto the screen for video game fans to drool over. But all that aside, Vol. 2 of this series is awesome because of it's one saving grace...original characters that can really fight. The action sequences are just flat out eye candy for any Darkstalker or Anime fan. Don't pay too much attention to the plot and you'll be fine (Note-the story seems rushed at the end). The dialouge also seems a little funny because of the mention of \\"The Dark\\" in every sentence and the philosophical aura behind each word some characters say (i.e. Donovan)comes off meaningful at some points, yet will leave you scratching your head saying \\"huh\\" at others.

Sound quality is excellent, even on the old TV shots, and some of the newer TV shots the sound is even better. \\"Elenor\\" played on a television show is presented here where the band actually performs the tune instead of lip-syncing the hit (an all too common practice)and give a crackerjack performance, to boot!

I just could not get past the gimmicks or the giddiness. I tried reading it a couple different times. This writing style might work for some, but it did not for me. If you want a book with a story as well as an opportunity to learn, then I would recommend two current books-\\"Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell\\" and \\"The Falls\\".

I suppose that his obsessive streak is what makes him who he is. As for an old-fashioned Carteresque archaeological dig mystery though, this really isn't one of those, but it is a good story.The story is intriguing, the ending is as noted by others: twisted, horrible and hilarious by turns.This would be a good beach book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh!

It was only by intense determination that I managed to read the rest of the book, only to confirm that my hypothesis was true. I realize that this was how it was intended, but the ploy did not work with me.I didn't find the book humorous, mentally challenging or even interesting. I think the subject had such promise, but the writing style was tedious. It dragged on, and the ending was weak.I you still feel compelled to read this, get it at the local Library. I'm certainly glad I did!"},{"rating":"2","title":"the best of the Mid East","review":"An intriguing novel in an old tradition, that with letters from a myriad of characters falls into place rather obliquely. The reader is left to think and rethink, depending on the letter writer.

It leaves the reader with some unanswered questions, which is , after all , all in the fun---fun? This is about murder.

The archaeologists (I loved Carter) who were tangential to this story were excellent. The story....well....I think it is well plotted, and I enjoyed being on an archaeological dig in the early fifties, courtesy of the author. One thing I must commend the author on...I appreciate his use of different type faces for each of the voices in this novel.So...This book is both a mystery, and a mystery solved. The reader is allowed to find out the truth of the mystery....although I am still not sure whether the participants are.I recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unexpected and mesmerizing","review":"Totally unexpected and one of the most memorable books I've read. The story is written like a spiral, bringing the reader closer and closer to the truth about the main character, who believes he has found a pharaoh's tomb to rival Tut's (being excavated nearby by his rival Howard Carter). Wild, horrifying, vivid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Egyptologist=tedious","review":"I actually began reading this book three seperate times. I'm not typically the type to not finish what I've started, but the dense prose and pompous voices of the characters were extremely off-putting. Some reviewers have said that they found the haughty nature of the characters amusing, but frankly it makes the characters unlikable. I'm even more upset by the reviews listed on the back of this book which exclaim it to be a \\"gripping tale\\" or an \\"engulfing detective story\\". Totally false on both counts! While I wouldn't say no to a refund, what I really want back is any brain space any memory of this story might be taking up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read something else","review":"Arthur Phillips created an awesome plot for his novel, but trying to read it at times was like pulling teeth. Normally once I pick a book up I can't bring myself to put it down... this book however, i couldn't bring myself to keep reading even whe i was bedridden for three days with nothing else to do.The theory behind this plot was amazing, but the story-line was way too convoluted, and the huge twist was entirely too predictable.

That's where I give the one star - I'll give the author that much. But honestly, the story itself really irritated me. I am so in agreement with Reviewer #1, I didn't like anyone, you wanted the story to get a move on - I skipped alot of Trilipush's ramblings cuz they were so besides the point - until later when it really was informative. I did finish it tho, same as Reviewer #1, wanted to see what ended up happening. but I just didn't care once I finally got there. I was just glad to be done.Now I have images of this book in my head and I want them OUT. OH and for the reviewers quoted on the book cover about it being funny & darkly humorous - I don't get it. I did not find any of it funny. Really, an unpleasant book.Not planning on picking up any more books by this author anytime soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and Predictable","review":"I had high hopes for this book when I first heard about it. The topic of Egypt is always an engaging one if it's well-executed. Sadly, in this instance, it is not. There is a lot of promise in the way several different stories and voices are intertwined throughout the text, but ultimately the execution falls short. The result is a series of delusional narratives which seem to have a humorous aim, but they end up being kind of sad. The \\"surprises\\" in the plot were easy to predict, as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very frustrating","review":"There are bits of true insight in this book, particularly in how Phillips understands how issues of wealth and class twist people in ways that are not global but distinctive to their personality. And the end is horrifying.But the middle 200-250 pages of this book are completely insufferable. I had to force myself to read it, and it took me nearly two months of fits and starts to do so.It's a shame. Phillips needs to show some respect for his readers and drop his urge for Shyamalan style shenanigans. It's just cheesy and tedious, a problem his occasionally skillful prose can't cover for long."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Egyptologist","review":"I'm sorry to disappoint any potential reader or offend the writer, but the plot is poorly thought out and the attempt at flashbacks, to present day, to the in-between, have a confusing effect on the reader. The story became very predictable early on, and all the long winded attempts at establishing the characters simply failed, save for 1 or 2 characters. About half-way through, the book became engrossing, but then the author sends us on another flashback and all goes awry. I only read the entire book because I purchased it, and I didn't want to waste my money. With the hype I read in some reviews, and my utter amazement with all things Egyptian, I thought the book would be more appealing to me. In my opinion, save your money and borrow the book from your local library. You'll be happy you did!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Drab and irritating.","review":"Having read a favorable review of Phillips' second novel earlier in the year, I placed a hold on the book at my local library since it appeared to be in great demand.However, having just finished it, I was pretty disappointed.- It IS overrated.- I figured out the \\"mystery\\" 40 pages into the book.- I loathed every single character.- The novel is written in letter/journal style.Nothing quite wrong with the last bit on the list, but I've never much cared for novels written in letter form (even Stephen King's novella version of Jerusalem's Lot or Stoker's Dracula didn't quite suit my reading style).Now, were these things Mr. Phillips intention, he has succeeded. But I struggled to finish the book, growing bored and restless (and quite irritated with the stupid characters). Of course, most of his characters weren't really meant to be likeable (I think), but overall this was somewhat of a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious and predictable","review":"Ingenious premise and narrative devices but becomes insufferably tedious and way too precious after first 80-90 pages.

I don't think I'll bother reading Prague or Angelika."},{"rating":"1","title":"obvious plot, arrogant characters","review":"The supposed plot \\"twist\\" is obvious from very early in the book. There are no emphatic charaters and the main character (who mostly tells the story via his journals and letters) is so unlikable that I didn't really care what happened to him. It was a chore to finish reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this and move on","review":"Had it figured out on page 40. Worse, the book is unengaging, and the switching from point-of-view to point-of-view seems contrived and tedious. Nancy Pearl, famous librarian at the Seattle Public Library says she gives a book 50 pages to engage her, and if it does not she moves on. I should have moved on."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of talent","review":"The \\"twist\\" is apparent from so far off that I actually hung on till the end, assuming that something more interesting would happen -- that surely there was more to it than I suspected. Alas, no. Much, much too simplistic and predictable, like a weak joke that goes on for hours -- which is a pity, because the author has real skill.This is one of the books I literally threw at the wall after I finished, so great was my disappointment at having wasted my time. Mr. Phillips! Please write another book: one that respects the reader's intellect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this book!","review":"This is a brilliantly constructed book. Previous reviewers who have panned the book for being \\"predictable\\" in plot are, to me, missing the point. The book is not so much about concealing from the reader Trilibush's true identity (agreeably, pretty easy to figure out early on) as it is a careful, sometimes hilarious, sometimes absurd, increasingly dark revelation of Trilibush's mental unraveling. Delusional thinking, truth (and history) as a manifestation of one's perceptions and points of view, and the quest for immortality are pervasive themes throughout the book. Simply a great read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious","review":"I have not read Prague, and perhaps I should because I disliked the Egyptologist as much as the previous reviewer disliked Prague. The Egyptologist actually begins with an intriguing premise; the two diarists with histories that converge has potential. Unfortunately, the author drags out the story as Trilipush descends into complete insanity. The \\"surprise\\" ending is obvious about a third of the way through the book, but I couldn't believe it could be that transparent and trudged through to the end just because I was convinced there had to be something else. But no. I can't believe this book would have been published if not for the success of Prague. I'm reasonably certain the author had to be high to continue ad infinitum in his tedious vein with little variation in pace or plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Scatologist","review":"Arthur Phillips' The Egyptologist is disappointing on many counts. As a mystery, it is very obvious. There is no need to read all the way to the end to find out what happened, although some after the fact additions in the form of a lost letter from a previously unused narrator do add a bit of clarity. The two major narrators describing the story and their variant perspectives on the story, which were meant to be humorous, came off as tedious and self-absorbed. I found myself skipping many pages. The Egyptology side of the story was weak, as was the description of the settings in Luxor and Cairo. Some people might find the idea of Egyptologist discovering a porn-star king and his tomb amusing, but the book could be retitled the Scatologist. I'll take Death on the Nile any day over this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!","review":"I had a very hard time getting through this book. The author spent way to much time on certain particular subjects to the point of boredom. Do not read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"annoying","review":"The idea was intriguing. A bit slow but semi-interesting for the first 350 pages. Then the author, through character narrative, offers 4 or 5 ending scenarios. Then takes them all back. Then offers a very annoying and vague ending through 'letters' from very distant characters. I was so annoyed and dissatisfied by this book. I'd recommend it only to people I didn't like. I totally agree with the reviewer who said this book was published only because the author produced Prague. To the author I'd say: Look it's all fiction. Don't tease the reader with 5 fake endings and then offer the 'real' ending. All fake endings are real endings in fiction. You spoiled the finale completely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snooze","review":"I couldn't even finish this bore fest. And I almost never walk away from a bad movie or novel.

I wouldn't recommend this book to a friend, and i regret the time spent reading it. boo hoo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"I picked up this book to read during my recovery from surgery, based on the jacket reviews. There is now way I would have finished it if I had anything else in the house to read. The plot is very weak and very boring. There is no mystery at all, you will have it figured out by page 25. This author seems to think that if his language is cute enough, that readers will like the book. He does have a certain literary flair and some of the character discriptions are great. But this isn't enough. I'll sell you my copy very cheap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing Narrative","review":"This book, tries to tell a narrative with an arrogant set of characters that don't blend well from one change to the next. You spend the first half trying to figure out one redeeming quality about the main author and the point of the letters to one's love who seems to hate him, and then if you can make it to the end you are absolutely dissapointed. I actually through the book down in disgust several times and only made myself pick it up because I've never not finished a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A real stinker","review":"50 pages into this book I thought seriously about doing something I've never done before: stop reading and throw it in the recycle bin. Against my better judgment, I finished it. With each agonizing chapter I thought \\"surely, SURELY this will get better.\\" Lured by the book jacket's promised surprise ending and the decidedly undeserved critical praise it received, I persevered. Yes, I skipped some passages... okay pages. When I finally finished it I was so relieved that it was over I couldn't be bothered to disappointed by it.Bottom line: An interesting story idea that becomes bogged down by lame attempts at intrigue, vague references to sadomasochism thrown in at incongruous times, and a distracting switching between narrators."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can I get those hours of my life back?","review":"So I don't like writing negative reviews, but this book was a disappointment. As someone who minored in Egyptology and is usually a sucker for all things Ancient Egypt, I figured liking this book would be a no-brainer. It started out interestingly enough; dashing brit convinces boston family to back his expedition to find the next Tut's tomb. Unfortunately the tale gets bogged down by a plot that moves at a snail's pace and is very predictable. The real history of excavations and plundering in Egypt from 1800- 1920s is fascinating and full of eccentric characters and lucky strikes. So my advice is to find a biography of Howard Carter or Belzoni and skip The Egyptologist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor book to follow","review":"Honestly, I found this book terrible. The whole first 80 pages is dreadful to read. The thing that is most aggravating is the organization of the book. Phillips attempts to construct his novel by various methods like diaries, letters, etc but they are just thrown out at you with no organization at all. This makes the reader work too hard to determine the facts of what is being written and just confusing. It makes it even more confusing since all the characters seem to have a blood relation, where some old characters are dead, newer relatives keep switching in and out of the story,and the setting keeps changing from past to current. It is a good common concept in letting you figure out the story but there needs to be more information and organization. There is not even chapters in the book! Book is very slow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as his first novel","review":"I was looking forward to reading this book, having enjoyed Aurthur Phillips first novel, Prague. Too bad this was disappointed me.Many passages are much too long, which makes the book feel unending. worse is that the book takes the form of a detective novel, but the pieces fall into place much too soon, which compounds the feeling that it is overlong. Worst is that the characters are badly developed and unlikeable.There are, however, a few things to like in this book, Arthur Philips has interesting ideas and a sense of humor, but I cannot recommend reading the entire novel for a handful of worthwhile scenes."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great listen","review":"Many have already given reviews. I listened to this book in audio on a two day trip. It is interesting to see how people delude and translate events to their own ends, all of us. I love audio books as the characters come to life. I don't know if I could have read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish on one star!","review":"This book is just a load of [bull]...I did manage to read more that two chapters and I did manage to smile a time or two. However, I must say poor Thomas Jefferson to be so ill used, not to mention quotes that served a better purpose when orginally read.Unless you have more money and time than you know what to do with, don't waste any of it. Thank God I was able to borrow a copy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everyone should read this","review":"This is a book everyone should read. Not because everyone would agree with it or stomach it. Most readers will likely have a hard time with it's anti-politically correct viewpoint. But, the book has some powerful and fresh new views about the role of the federal government and the amazing impact that religion (or secular and divine mysticism, as the author calls it) has on politics in America and elsewhere. It is very funny at times, very gutwrenching at times, and loaded with many new insights that have caused me to at least ponder my paradigms."},{"rating":"2","title":"Increases herbicide effectiveness","review":"Bonide Turbo Spreader Sticker helps the herbicide stick to the weed. Imagine adding something sticky like honey to your weed-killer. Since the weed-killer chemical is absorbed through the leaves of the weed, it is important that the chemical stick to the leafy portion of the weed, and not just drip off immediately. I think you can add this to any liquid herbicide, and it will increase it's effectiveness. It also helps prevent run-off because of its sticky properties, it helps the herbicide stay localized even in the event of rain. You use a very small amount of it, so it lasts a long time. This is also called a Nonionic Surfactant, etc. Useful for all weeds, but particularly helpful for those weeds that grow faster than grass and stick up above the lawn top-surface. If it is worth using herbicide, it is worth making sure that it sticks to the weed for maximum killing properties."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Stuff!","review":"I purchased product based on another reviewers recommendation. I needed something to mix with Tenacity Herbicide, and after spending $80 on Tenacity I am pleased that this product helped my herbicide to \\"stick\\" to the grass so it would actually work. I had used Triclopyr and various weed killers in the past with poor results. From now on, I will be mixing this product in with my various weed killers when directed. I think this product would help make most of them more effective, especially when your product needs to work thru the foliage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good soundtrack for a ok movie.","review":"I saw this movie when I was younger and I have always liked the music in it. The combinations of Rock, Folk, and 80's synthesizer give this score and edgy and exciting sound. The music fits the action on screen and carries the emotion of the events very well. Even if you are not familier with the move, but are into movie scores with more rock and less orchestral feel then you will likely enjoy this soundtrack."},{"rating":"1","title":"timerider","review":"I would love to review this cd but unfortunately I ordered it and you guys kept sending me the DVD.

The goal in this edition is a literal \\"scholarly\\" translation. But those who really wish to weigh Tocqueville's exact choice of words will probably want to read the book in the original French. The introduction is very good.Tocqueville himself is still well worth reading today, although many of the early chapters can be skimmed. It is justifiably considered a classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the same edition I ordered","review":"I received a different copy of the book, for which I probably paid more money.

Further, it is easy to implement during the conversion process. So WHY isn't that feature implemented? I'm sure it's simple LAZINESS on the part of MobileReference - it might take a programmer a few minutes.

GIVEN BY A MAN WHO HAS SEEN REVOLUTIONS LEAD TO TERROR AND MAYHEM. ALL-IN-ALL IT WAS VERY GOOD... YET NOT EXACTLY EXCITING."},{"rating":"1","title":"Find another edition.","review":"I have three complaints about this edition of Tocqueville:1) Nowhere in the book is the translator credited. This violates basic principles of publication and scholarship.2) This is in fact an abridged version of the original English-language translation by Henry Reeve, dating from sometime before 1862. Unless you want to re-create the experience of a modern Frenchman confronted with de Tocqueville's somewhat archaic French by reading the text in somewhat archaic English, I would seek out any of the more recent translations: there are at least three.3) The ellipses, that is, the abridgements, have sometimes been made to conceal some of the author's less flattering views America. In fact I suspect this is a \\"patriotic\\" abridgement. For example, in the second chapter of part one, Heffner has omitted references to some of the excesses of Puritan law in New England which the notoriously even-handed Tocqueville had cited."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get the Library of America Edition","review":"This 170-year-old book by a young French aristocrat remains one of the most frequently quoted analyses of what Toqueville famously calls America's \\"habits of the heart.\\"If you're interested in reading Toqueville for yourself and not through the eyes of some commentator, what version should you get?Instead of this one, I recommend the Library of America editionTocqueville: Democracy in America (Library of America). First, the translation by Arthur Goldhammer is smoother and more comprehensible, without informality or paraphrase. Second, the Goldhammer translation is not burdened by political leanings or excessively scholarly apparatus. Third--and not unimportant--the Library of America volume is smaller and easier to hold and provides a more pleasant reading experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"abridgement should not equate inquisition","review":"As a former reviewer has stated this edition takes quite a bit of liberty in excising the less flattering aspects of Tocqueville's views of America. In fact the entire section on race-relations has been excised --perhaps it was deemed too controversial? This kind of editing is even more unacceptable in our age of open communications and hopefully open minds. Find another edition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading Publication Information","review":"I bought this book for my Kindle so that I could use it as a source in my POLS 497 Senior Seminar in Political Science final research paper at American Military University. I have no beef with de Tocqueville, mind you. His work is as brilliant as ever. BUT, the listing on Amazon said this is a BANTAM CLASSIC published in 2010, which led me to expect those little accoutrements, like page numbers, and a real copyright date. Instead, there are no page numbers, and where the Bantam Classic copyright notice should be, I instead found this: \\"copyright 2002, Western Standard Pulbishing [...]\\".Now, I did not buy a book from OriginalSources.com. I bought a book from Bantam Classics, at least that is what the misleading publication information caused me to believe. Now I am not even sure if I can use this book as a source, because it gives false publication information. OUCH! Not happy, Amazon. Just another reminder of why I use Apple's iBooks WAY more often."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very dry for the interest subject","review":"The book was edited in 1994 and does not reflect the latest changes in the law, especially European one (including Eastern Europe). In addition it is very dry. The best part of the book is the history of law development and description of judicial system in France, Germany and England. But thats it! Only West European law is reviewed; nothing about Islamic law, law of African countries (I would like to have brief description at least); the description of Russian law is laughable,no insight.Bottom line, if you have a choice DO NOT buy it or buy a used one..."},{"rating":"2","title":"WHOPPING VISUAL EPIC OF EMOTIONAL TRUTH","review":"In answer to reviewer \\"Baitmann's Bat\\" -- All history and all art is a lie in that it is a literary or visual construct. Same with film. Even documentaries must be interpreted and edited and framed. There is no such thing as 'objective truth' for a human life. This is a stirring epic. A huge visual treat. And a terrific story about an incredible human who really lived. I think it has emotional truth and is worth seeing. Don't be misled by this reviewer.

What a disappointment!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Proof that Russel should be in Mad Max 4","review":"Okay, maybe they shouldn't make Mad Max 4 anyway- but after seeing Heaven's Burning I'm convinced that Russel is THE Man. This movie is as quirky and entertaining in an Australian kind of way as Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels is in an English way. It contains shockingly funny horrific scenes with a nice character study thrown in. Crowe doesn't play the \\"always in control\\" bloke we've seen in some of his other films, including the magnificent Gladiator where he was a slave who was always in control. He's a fella who gets hurt and has no idea what's gonna happen next. And neither do we. Sure, certain things have to happen, but these are mixed in with completely unexpected (often little) things that humanize everyone. I mean, that poor dog! If you haven't seen it, don't worry.

Seriously."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zombiez","review":"Don't waste your time or money on this movie. Bad from start to finish...I did make it through it. Low-budget, bad script, bad acting and bad effects. If I could I'd rate it zero, I would.I love a large selection of horror films, but this one just fell short on every level. The only thing that was going for Zombiez was the art work on the DVD cover."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've felt more satisified after buying a losing lottery ticket...","review":"than after watching this movie.No plot, no explanation of what's going on, just a lot of people (they're supposed to be zombies) with absolutely no make up running around with rubber knives and knocking people down and killing them.I can not believe this made it to film.1) What caused the zombies to rise?2) Zombies using knives?3) Zombies don't even look dead---they look like raving idiots.Not one redeeming factor about this movie---not one!I was looking for a movie to rent and saw nothing, settled on this because the cover looked cool and I love real zombie movies (which this is not!)I spent $4 to rent it and would have been better off wadding that $4 up and throwing it on the floor.Do not buy this movie, don't even rent it. If you do rent it, don't bother watching it. It's not even funny, not even stupid funny. I had to give it one star, if I had my choice, I'd have given it zero, it doesn't even deserve to be called a 1 star movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Phew!

Most of the movie concerns following the main character around as she runs away. There is this hilarious part, in a sad stupid kind of way, where she makes a molotov cocktail and the zombiez wait around for her. The real anticipation is to see if this movie can get any worse. My recommendation: if you have anything else to do, watching paint dry comes to mind, do it first."},{"rating":"1","title":"For the sake of GOD ....","review":"what the hell were the people who made this thinking, wait I KNOW but Im not allowed to post anything deragatory, if thats how its spelt.

As instruments go, this is by far a great (and affordable) instrument to pick up. The LJ Hutchen Sax is inexpensive and excellent quality. I really enjoy the sound quality.As far as the instrument construction goes, the pads are all proportionally sized, properly spaced, and form good seals. This is the chief concern for saxophones as air leaks are fatal for the sax.Great instrument.

I started searching for a \\"pretty\\" sax and soon realized the colored instruments were considered junk by most. I searched for name brand saxophones like Yamaha and Selmar. They were good, but expensive for a beginner. Then I noticed all the positive reviews for the LJ Hutchen sax. I contacted Hyson Music who are selling it for $359.00 and ordered one. It shipped the next day and was delivered in great condition. My son, in 6th grade band, said it plays better than the Yamaha saxophone he has been using from the school.The cons? You will need to get a separate cleaning kit, and you might want a more comfortable neck strap."},{"rating":"2","title":"sax","review":"Hyson Music is a fantastic company to do bussiness with instrument is high quality .Would reccommend this seller to anybody looking for costumer care."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get what you pay for?","review":"Hard to believe this item is so well reviewed. I suckered for the price and now have an instrument that is not only difficult to play but impossible to tune! I took it to a professional musical instruments shop and threw away some more money as they could not tune it. It is discordant with play-along's. A lemon? Or did I just get what I paid for? Either way, painful to the wallet. Going to bite the big-bucks bullet and get a Yamaha."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Sax","review":"I am very new to the world of saxophone and I have been strugging with the alto sax I bought overseas 4 years ago. I wasn't pleased with it, so I decided to research for a better one. I read reviews on different types of saxophones and I found that the LJ Hutchen Eb is the type of sax I need. I ordered one and the instrument was delivered as promised and on time. On my first try of the instrument, I noticed a big sound difference between my old sax and the LJ Hutchen sax. The quality of LJ Hutchen sound is fantastic and very much better than my old one. In addition, I didn't use greater energy to play it as I was doing with my old junk. If you are looking for a reliable alto saxophone, especially, if you are a beginner, try out LJ Hutchen sax first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Falls short of expectations","review":"The tone of this book is condescending to say the least, and compared to other screenwriting books does not equip the reader with the confidence to write a screenplay. The \\"e-alerts\\", \\"e-facts\\" and \\"essentials\\" sidebars are simply present to fill out the book and do not complement the text at all. This, and other similar books, could do well to invest more time in the sample scripts included."},{"rating":"1","title":"interesting and disappointing","review":"I watched this DVD last week and the best thing about it was that i could remember watching some of these performances on tv in the early seventies when i lived in Holland and watched the German live music show Beatclub on saturday afternoon, beatclub later on became musikladen, but i think the majority of these clips were from the beatclub era. From memory there should be much better material available than what we get here. Some of the clips are ok, but on the majority the sound is dreadful and it only has historical an sentimental value. I was thinking of buying other musik laden titles but after this I think i'll give them a miss. If you want good sounding historical stuff buy Woodstock orthe Great Whistle test compilation. Highlights for me were Santana and Procol Harum with an outstanding performance by BJ wilson, their drummer."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS HAS BEEN REISSUED AS BEST OF BEAT CLUB VOL 1","review":"THIS HAS BEEN REISSUED AS THE BEST OF THE BEAT CLUB VOLUME 1.

It doesn't get too much into detail about higher limit games, but beginners don't need to worry about that yet. It does a great job of explaining different types of major poker games. It also tells you a key aspect of the game that I think it equally as important as knowing the game, and that's self control and money management. The glossary in the back is also useful. The only down side to this book is it doesn't get into great detail on betting structure. When I first read this book, I noticed the most popular low limit game fo Texas Hold 'Em (1-4-8-8), is not really talk about. Overall, if you are new to the game of Poker, and want to learn the essentials, GET THIS BOOK!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not quite as good as some others","review":"This is a fair book, but it is not near as good as Peter O. Steiner's \\"Thursday Night Poker.\\" Andy Nelson's book can't decide whether it is for beginners or advanced, so it tries to fit advanced technique into too short of space. It barely scratches the surface of any of the topics it brings up. When it doesn't do that, it simply says, \\"Play so tight that you don't even have to think. Fold 99% of your hands.\\" That does not make for a fun night, in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Real Deal!","review":"This grenade launcher is Great! Just prime with green gas, load the airsoft BB's, load into your airsoft grenade launcher, and then lie in wait.

Not only are the shorts fun for us younger generation to watch, but those who actually saw them first-hand will enjoy re-watching them as well. We watched the video with my boyfriend's parents (who are in their mid-50s), and they got a kick out of seeing the shorts now. A few of the shorts on Vol. 3 are a little boring, but the ones about bread sales and a delayed honeymoon make up for th rest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother....stick with Volumes 1 & 2","review":"Of the three MST3K \\"Shorts,\\" this has got to be the most disappointing. Not sure if they were running out of material to use here, but just about the only one which is worthwhile and somewhat funny is \\"Is this Love?\\" ...unfortunately it's very brief. \\"Speech-Using Your Voice\\" is rather amusing too, but then the collection goes to the boring \\"Out of This World\\" and the selling one for Anheiser Busch, plus some other very lame ones. If there is a Volume 4, I would hope they could dreg up some better stuff than this...something on par with Volume 1 or 2, which were hilarious."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was worth the wait","review":"This one had a lot of laugh out loud moments.The only one I thought was boring was \\"The selling wizard\\" Mike and the 'bots were trying their darndest to find something,anything funny about this one.My favorite riff in the short \\"Is this love?\\" (They think that marriage is all about hand holding and gazing into each others eyes.Mike-It's the stench of amonia from the piles of [feces] filled diapers!).\\"Design for Dreaming\\" was the weirdest thing I've ever seen it made me laugh so hard(Mike-will someone please invent Rock and Roll?)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Top Shelf Jazz","review":"John Abercrombie sounds great on this album.

Thank you to Bryce Courtenay for writing this novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not available to purchase from Africa?????","review":"I am listening to the audio of this book from my home in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. It is a great book, and I wanted to purchase the kindle version so that I can read it when I can't use the audio. I couldn't believe it when I learned that a book about Africa cannot be purchased while in Africa. It is restricted only for purchase from the United States. Really????"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book changed my life","review":"I read The Power of One when I was a freshman in high school, and it changed my life; it changed the way I view myself and the world, and it gave me the strength to pursue things I might have been afraid to try. I take Courtenay's philosophy of the power of one to heart--\\"that inside each of us there burns a flame of independence that must never be allowed to go out--that as long as it exists within us we cannot be destroyed...\\" I saw the movie first--no comparison. I also recently read Tandia, the sequel, and while it was a wonderful book as well, in my mind it didn't measure up. I tell everyone to read The Power of One, hoping it will change them forever, as it changed me."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hated this book!","review":"The Power of One is an epic story that simply is not believable. Five-year-olds don't do math for 12-year-olds, for example; nor do they have the kind of insight that PeeKay shows as a five-year-old. In fact, few adults have that kind of maturity. Many of the adults in the book are not good and certainly don't act in Peekay's interest -- Peekay is sent to a boarding school where he's two years younger than anyone else and is English at a Boer school What do we suppose would happen? Of course he'll be treated badly. It's a soap opera, and not a very good one. I read it for a book club and considered it a huge waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"this is crap","review":"this book is all about snakes, and fat people, and is disgusting and makes fun of black people."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book that will change your life forever!","review":"This book grabs you from the very beginning and pulls you into the sad yet ultimately triumphant tale of Peekay. Courtenay brilliantly develops all of his characters (My favorite is the professor.)and teaches us the tenacity and endurance of the human will. This book gives courage to the underdogs and the underprivileged. I have given this book to a number of students and friends and every single one has been changed by the experience. Of all the books I have recommended to my students, this one gets the best reviews by far. It should be a part of the school curriculum. Warning: Courtenay's other books fall far short of the superiority of this work. This book should NEVER be compared to the movie with the same name. The movie pales in comparison."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great story about the power of the individual!!","review":"First off, the book The Power Of One is a great read!!! Bryce Courtney has an easy to read writting style, he brings you into South Africa, places you beside the characters and you can't help but get caught up in the story. The Power Of One is about the Individual being important, how everybody has the power to make a difference in this world. As for the ending, it couldn't have been any better!!! When I finished the book, I had a big smile on my face and I said, \\"now that was an awsome book!\\" Read it, you'll really enjoy it and you will understand why it has so many great reviews on this site!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book changed my life!","review":"When my parents were getting a divorce I was going through some very hard times. My older brother gave me his copy to read. Now at age 18, my brother never received his copy back and I read parts of The Power of One almost every day. Peekay is like a hero to me. THe fact that he was able to overcome so much striff and still survive have made me realise that if I set my mind ot accoplishing a goal, anything can happen including myself becoming the welterweight champion of the world if my heart so desires. B.C. is a great author and in my opinion a great man. What I wouldn't give to meet him one day. The Power of One is the best book I have ever read. For all of those who haven't read it yet, read it tomorrow you won't regret it despite what some may say."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spectacular","review":"One of the best book you will EVER read. Funny, touching, interesting, astounding - need I say more, a true inspiration.... I was recommended this book by Sophie Martin-Canning, author of 'Kissed By The Angels', which also is a truly remarkable book (see review). The Power Of One inspired her to write her work of wonder. It's inspired me (along with Ms Martin-Canning) to follow my dreams, let it inspire you too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, PUH-LEEZE!","review":"Oh, puh-leeze! A kid gets horribly picked on at 5 years old then turns into an multi-lingual intellectual genius, a boxing hero, a rugby master, a classical pianist, tells the snooty prep school they're doing it all wrong so they change their methods, promotes prison reform for jailed Africans, gets somebody to start a school for African adults during apartheid, unites all South African tribes under the banner of being their white hero, has one guy do all the work to create mutliple businesses for him so he doesn't have to worry about money, has 2 guys die for him, and, oh yeah, becomes the best \\"grizzly\\" the copper miners have ever seen and all before he turns 20.

You won't want to put it down until you finish!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorites","review":"This book is a beautiful masterpiece that tells about the sad life a young bot who was born in the wrong era and the wrong color. It tells about his suffering through boarding school and the torment he gets from the other boys.

He proves him self to be strong enough to come over not only his past, but the harsh world he knows where aparthied rules over all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book, a little disturbing","review":"At first I didn't think I'd like the book due to the descriptions of abuse in the beginning, but it got better and I couldn't put it down. I'm looking for the sequel. This was our local book club (Driftless Area Literary Society) selection. We talked about it for nearly two hours--unusual for us! I gave it a \\"4\\" because it wasn't as quite as wonderful as Gone With the Wind."},{"rating":"2","title":"a wonderful descritpion","review":"Bryce Courtenay uses such wonderful decriptive language to show the reader a feeling that peekay feels. The reader knows exactly what he is feeling. When i read this book i couldn't put it down. I read it in three weeks and i was only twelve and couldn't quite understand all of the aspects of the book. But i still could understand enough to absoutly love this book and go on to read his other books and love them also."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was a great book.","review":"The power of one was a great book and I couldn't put it down, the book that follows it which is Tandia is just as good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bravo, bravo, bravissimo!!","review":"The most compelling, engrossing, powerful book I have ever read. Style-wise, I like it because it's not too demanding, with the vocab and style, great for most ages. Flawless. Plot-wise, the story is so realistic, that I was at the point of asking- is this fiction? The characters were engaging, and Peekay was a perfect protagonist. Courtenay must be commended for his research, knowledge, and expression of South Africa!! Beautiful. Inspirational. Life-changing."},{"rating":"2","title":"The triumph of the human spirit over adversity.","review":"I must say that The Power Of One is one of the most satisfying books I have read. Courtenay cleverly crafts this remarkable story about a young 'rooinek' (English) boy, Peekay, growing up in the turbulent and violently divided South Africa of the 1930's. Peekay's traumatic childhood experiences, along with the long-lasting friendships he builds, help him to overcome adversity and unite all the tribes of South Africa - white and black. Using the metaphor of boxing for human survival, Courtenay shows us how Peekay learns the Power of One, the greatest power of a human being. This novel, although large in size, is quite easily read as Courtenay wastes no words. Every person around the world should read it, as the principles and morals portrayed in this story are universal."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved this book","review":"I loved this book.I read a lot for fun, across many genres and eras. Of all the books I've read in the last ten years, this one jumps out. I simply did not want it to end. Even more so, I wanted to be Peekay (the main character) ... learning about cacti, boxing in the ring, etc. These comments may not make sense to anyone who has not yet read the book. But, if I was to on a desert island and had the choice of only one work of fiction to read again, this would be it. Absadoodle!(While the book is wonderful, it is not sugar-coated. Expect to squirm a little now and then.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"A cute story, if you don't expect much","review":"I loved the first few chapters of \\"The Power of One.\\" Courtenay's writing was beautiful, and the story was compelling. But as the plot progressed, I became disenchanted with the novel. I was forced to suspend all disbelief and accept that Peekay, the protagonist, was both blessed and extremely talented, although at many points he lacks charm and charisma. I was simply annoyed when Courtenay suggests that all black South Africans will unite under Peekay, a young white boy who they regard as a mystical and savior-like figure. If you read simply to immerse yourself in a plot and another time and place, then you may enjoy this book. However, if you're looking for a thought-provoking, intelligent and interesting novel about South Africa, I'd recommend something by J. M. Coetzee instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"More than just boxing","review":"This is one of the most satisfying reads I have ever indulged in. I am an avid reader and \\"The Power Of One\\" is definitely on my top ten list. Set in South Africa, the book follows the journey a young English boy takes to become the welterweight boxing champion of the world. Though by reading the short synopisis, you might not be interested, it goes far beyond a boy's aspirations to become a boxer. It delves into racial issues, childhood problems, and the traumas of growing up. It touches the heart in a way few books can these days. Truly a worthwhile read."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Power of One","review":"After hearing so much about this book, when I finally picked it up to read it I was expecting great things. I wasn't disappointed. This book really kept my attention. I really admired Peekay's dedication and motivation. I can relate to him in some ways, like always wanting to be the best. I would definately reccomend this book to others, it was well worth the time spent reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I know I am in the minority here.","review":"Okay, so this book does follow all the conventions of an epic or the hero's journey that we all learned about in high school--you get the supernatural, the mentor-guides, the entrance into the womb-like space of the cave. In the end, however, the writing is trite. He actually writes basically, \\"They passed like trains in the night.\\" The narrator, Peekay, for all of his concern about naming, seems little concerned about the naming of black females, only white males. All of the black women are named in relation to him. All. And in the end, I find that just a tad disturbing, especially if I am to swallow that he is this \\"leader of Africa\\"--the reluctant voice of the people, etc. etc.On the other hand, this is a fast read, and in actuallity a somewhat good read for late junior high school students, early high school students about the power of believing in yourself. Just read with a discerning eye."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unrealistic and dull","review":"This book is overly sentimental and maudlin. Hardly anything bad happens to the main character after the first few chapters. I REALLY wanted him to die! And now there's a sequel!

Unless you have a lot of extra time, don't waste your time reading this."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Book","review":"This book is simply the best book i have ever had the priviledge to read. Bryce Courtenay surely wrote a masterpiece when he created this story. You follow the life of a young man in Africa, an englishman in the boer community he finds himself out of place and even more so when WWII comes around. His hardships are endless yet he still finds ways to stay positive and keep moving forward. The story is inspirational and moving, a true page-turner of our time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning \\"live out loud\\" book--a rough-edged beauty","review":"This is one of my favorite books--it makes you want to go out and LIVE! It's beauty stems from the eloquent portrayal of a young boy's life and through his eyes we are introduced to both the horrors of the South African apartheid era as well as the enduring humanity that miraculously manifests itself in spite of awful repressive social and political conditions. This story is a reminder of the greatness and enduring beauty of the human spirit that can overcome all of our differences if only we let it..."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"The Power of One\\" by Bryce Courtenay","review":"Very moving story and written so well I was even becoming interested in boxing. I will certainly read it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"From a true perspective","review":"This book is undoubtedly the best book i have read in my life. Having lived in South Africa my entire adolescent life, I understand the importance of this novel. Its hard for many white people to comprehend what happened in South Africa and this book is a shocking real interpretation. And for many black people its hard to comprehend that there were white people who felt differently to the government.this book was a learning experience for me and I recommend it to anyone who is interested in an emotional experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Readers of all Genres","review":"\\"The Power of One\\" is both inspirational and well written. The first time I saw it, I did not think much of it. It was assigned as a summer reading assignment for school and I was not expecting to like this book at all. But, by the time I finished it I was reduced to tears of both joy and tears of pain. The tortures and joys that the character went through were immense and the emotional struggles were written extremly well. The author portrayed all aspects and ages of the main character well and also why he grew up the way he did. This book is great for readers of all genres because it is written so well, and if you are an experienced or tasteful reader you can not find fault with either the story line nor the characters. It is a wonderful work of art that will stimulate the mind of all readers. So weather you read science fiction or history, pick this book up, for it is amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Book I've Ever Read!","review":"I read a lot of books. But this one is a WOW! This book captivated me, and I laughed out loud, cried, and enjoyed each page thoroughly. My husband, who prefers magazines, read it and he could not put it down. This book is powerful in its storytelling, and profound in its character development. Though it has been made into a movie, I don't want to see it, because nothing could be as wonderful as the written word in this book. I am off to buy copies for Christmas gifts this year. Read this book yourself, and pass it on."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book for teens and older that you will love.","review":"I just finished the book this morning. Loved it and did not want it to end. I liked the language, descriptions as well as the characters and story. Would be great for a book club, any man, women or teen should enjoy. Who'd have thought this fifty something woman would so enjoy a book about a boy growing up with a dream of boxing? Reminded me somewhat of Kiterunner."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Power of One","review":"South Africa is a country that has had its fair share of struggles. Many of these struggles are the same struggles of the main character. There is the history of bad blood between the British and the Boers. Peekay experiences this early in life at grade school. Further on in life he realizes the oppression of the blacks. Even in high school he tries to start a program to educate the Africans. These conflicts even fall in chronological order as they did in Africa. From an early age Peekay spoke English, Afrikaans and Zulu fluently. His Childhood nanny was a Zulu woman. Most of his time spent learning to box was spent in the Boer prison. Peekay is himself a part of everything that is South African. He is the personification of South Africa."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book of my life!","review":"I have read this book 4 times. I have also read every one of Bryce Courtenay's other books. The Potato Factory is excellent as well. But the Power of One is my favorite book . . . EVER. I read at leat 20 - 30 novels each year. I still think of the characters from this book. I leave for South Africa in a few days and I'm reading this book once more. This is a great book also for high school kids - even boys! If you want your high schooler to read a book and you can't find one he will like - try this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"This book has to be the most incredible books that I have ever had the pleasure of reading. Given to me as a High School graduation present, I was intimidated by the length of Courtenay's Novel. I then found that I became so immersed in it that I would spend hours a day reading it, and unable to go to sleep at night because I was so excited to read on. This book is a great read for anyone who enjoys reading, and an even greater read for young men who do not think they enjoy to read. This is one inspiring book that can change the way you look at the World and the challenges that you face in your life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some style but no substance","review":"Seeing all the rave reviews for this book made me feel a need to add some balance to save others from purchasing this mental comfort food. IF YOU MUST READ IT, GET IT FROM THE LIBRARY!When I read the book the action carried it along, but when I'd finished it I was totally unsatisfied. At even the low level of self-examination of the book itself the plot was unrealistic. It was all too easy. The hero had everything work out just right for him. He never suffered real setbacks and everything he touched turned to gold.If you accept the message of this book, eternal vigilance is more than you need to pay for freedom; if anything goes wrong the good guys will always win through. Yuk!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk Novel","review":"If The Power of One was a western, first person, and like this protagonist told of his great and fast intelligence, draw, and pugilism it would be printed in paperback only, no. 10 font, and considered a junk novel. This is a simple minded read, with a thin plot and a self possessed central character. I would not rank it as a great literary accomplishment. But apparently I'm in a minority."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Story of a Boy With More Adventures than Huck Finn","review":"Set in Pro-Nazi South Africa during World War II, this novel combines historical fact with the compelling story of a young boy named Peekay. After being sent to boarding school, his life drastically changed from a safe, nurturing family to world where he is the enemy. Peekay is confronted with prejudice and superstition, yet perseveres through unbelieable odds by believing in himself, and the power of one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engrossing","review":"I first read this book for mandatory summer reading in high school about six years ago. I thought it was an excellent novel and I promised myself I would read it again. I picked it up in the bookstore over this past Christmas and after two years of college, I think it still holds the same meaings that it did six years ago, but deeper. I don't want to be superficial and say that this book has changed my life, but it has definitel changed my thinking. If you don't read this book, you don't know what you're missing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read highly recommended for ex-South africans","review":"A great book for all South and Ex-South Africans"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Greatest book ever written","review":"i read this book about 2 years ago just before i started my 8th grade year. i began the book because i had fallen in love with the movie and wanted to read what the story was actually about. and WOW, it just made everything in my life so much simplier. it is such a moving book. everything about it is just so mindbogling how Peekay manages to live through it all and not be bitter, his losses just cut you to the quick, you just want to cry for him. i gave this book to my friend last year and she completely agreed with me that Peekay and Doc and Geel Peit and Hoppy are simply the greatest people you could ever hope to meet and have influence your life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Onoshobishobi Ingelosi!!","review":"All I have to say is this book is awesome!! I am in ninth grade and would not have read this if my English teacher had not assigned it. I'm really glad she did, because this is my new favorite book. I liked the end, when... well, I'll let you read the book for yourself. Peekay inspired me to want to box. I also look up to him with a great respect because of all he went through. He had such a hard life and managed to avenge his best friend, Grandpa Chook, but it would be harder to \\"fix\\" the rest of his life. In short, this is a coming of age story that is very descriptive at the interesting parts and short at the \\"boring\\" parts. I really liked this book, and would definetly reccommend it to anyone who wanted to read about World War II, South Africa, or boxing."},{"rating":"1","title":"This edition does the book no justice","review":"This edition does the book no justice. I read the original version, and the story is so much more poignant and well-written in that edition that I was astonished by this one. The editing was terrible and removed a lot of the humor of the original. Definitely do not buy this version.Otherwise, The Power Of One is one of my favorite novels. It is moving, emotional, and surprisingly humorous at times. The storyline is inspirational and touching. Not only does it tell the story of Peekay's triumphs, but it tells the story of South Africa itself throughout World War II. It's an excellent novel, and one that I highly recommend to fans of all genres."},{"rating":"2","title":"a phenomenal read!","review":"Being a voracious reader, I consume many books not worth rating. This is the best written book I have read in the last few years.The editoral tells the storyline. The power of one may be more than just the influence of one person on the world. It also summons the reader to question the arbitrary man-made divisions between men, the making the \\"one\\" of humanity into facets. These facets were along colorlines, religious pursuits, occupations, etc. I found refreshing the valued relationships between old and young throughout the book. If you haven't read this, treat yourself!"},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST MANDATORY READING-- EVER!","review":"From the unconventional mother role, to the silent friendship Peekay has extremely unique relationships with others throughout his life. His rare connections to others makes him a boy who matured at a young age into an independent man. His independence from others makes him loyal to his dreams and a success. In the mist of obstacles, the power of one is ultimately unbreakable in the story of Peekay's life."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Greatest book ever written","review":"I read this book when I was in Middle School.

However that turned out to be a bad idea because I got there and ended up spending the first two days I was there in my hotel room reading the book. When I got back to the states, I joined my local boxing gym. Truly the greatest book I've ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well done Bryce Courteney","review":"I can't decide why I like this book,I think it is because feel sorry for Peekay. Peekay is a little white boy who grew up with his mum and a nanny. When Peekay's mum leaves to go into care, Peekay goes to boarding school. After a traumatic time at boarding school being bullied he and his new nickname, Pisskop, leave to go home. I would recommend this book to all but you will need a box of tissues nearby if you are anything like me. Five stars for sure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply wonderful","review":"This is a great story of life that will take you on a rollercoaster of emotions. This is a must read for anyone who has a beating heart. The book will also teach you about history, South Africa and race just to name a few things."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant!","review":"The story of the life of one boy's struggle to grow up in a divided and intolerant South Africa, Bryce Courtenay's The Power Of One is undoubtedly one of the classics of it's time. Courtenay's characterisation and plot development are brilliant, and as you read through the pages you find yourself being drawn into the world of Peekay, feeling his pain and happiness as if it were your own. Peekay's experiences, both good and bad, along with the guidance of the numerous human mentors, help shape Peekay into a man of amazing character and integrity. As the reader journey's with Peekay they learn a valluabe lesson - that the strength of one person can be enough to ovrcome enormous odds and that the power that lies within all of us can allow to get us through. The Power Of One and its equally brilliant sequel Tandia will both enspire and intregue you, and I could not recommend them more highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very rich","review":"I really loved this book when I read it in 12 years ago in high school. All my friends had read it and I remember chastising them for not telling me how great it was.I might have missed out on reading it!The only critcism (if you could call it that) would be to say that it is so rich in adventure that I have only been able to read it once - I normally read my books over and over - but this book was different for me.Truly one of the greats."},{"rating":"2","title":"Misrable plot, but it keeps you reading.","review":"This can be described as a book with an excess of words, but still makes it point. Its plot is very weak, but its concept is good. The author does a good job showing the Apartheid issue through the eyes of an English boy, instead of the Bantu or Afrikaner. This unique perspective is, however, the only thing keeping this book up. If you have a lot of time, you should read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"First the head, then the heart.","review":"Powerfully shares the importance of quality persons in children's lives and some way to overcome being bullied."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful and beautiful","review":"This is one of my all-time favorite books.

This story could realte to a great number of people in many different ways. Wonderful aspects of enemies and friendship."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poor ending to a great book","review":"The movie based on this book is probably one of my all-time favorites. Knowing that the book is usually better than the movie I was very excited to find a copy of this at one of our library book sales. However, I put off reading it for several years.In my opinion, while the book is very good, in this case I still like the movie version better. The book was very long, and yet the ending was very unsatisfying. In fact the ending alone moved this book from a 5 star review to a 4 star. However, there was an interesting cast of characters that were never mentioned in the movie that added greatly to the story. So definitely worth the read, but would be disappointing if you are expecting a written version of the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Regarding \\"The Power of One\\"","review":"The Power of One is a great book.

They were \\"lack luster\\", not very memorable, they sound like a dumbed down and angrier depeche mode to me. They do have a different sound from most new bands but they have predictable time signatures, don't really ever stray from convention, and the overall musicianship isn't very impressive. They don't sound like Tool at all to me, mainlt in that Tool are great musically, having one of the best drummers alive, and this band is mediocre at best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"These guys know how to put out an amazing album, and they have an awesome live show to back it up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sir Derek Is Magnificent!","review":"I saw this RSC version of Cyrano de Bergerac on Broadway back in the 1980's with Sir Derek Jacobi and Sinead Cusack in tandem with Shakespeare's Much Ado About Nothing.

I cannot emphasize how incredible Sir Derek Jacobi was in this role (he never gives anything less than a great performance!). I've seen just about everything he's ever done on the stage both in New York and in London. How could this video not be available on DVD?

Honestly, the first few weeks, I was thinking that this one was not my favorite, but, being over half-way now I am really enjoying it. It is a very in-depth study on the life of Paul - from his beginnings to the end. There is a lot of history of the Jewish culture as well as about the early church - as it all relates to Paul and his ministry. Beth has a way of pulling things out of the scriptures that I wouldn't have thought of on my own, shedding a whole new light on passages. I also enjoy in this study how at the end of each study day she has a 'How does God want you to respond to what He showed you today.' question in the column - making me think more about how I can apply what we just went over! I would recommend this study - as well her others!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Uneven","review":"Although the chapters by Hofman, Jerison and Roth are worth reading as well a few others the book reads like too many standard biology treatise in evolution. That is, it is a forum for those who have a very good memory and would like to share taxa with you. Unfortunately they are devoid of any original thoughts or perhaps they were afraid to share them. This kind of book does indeed give biology a bad name. It is a 2001 copywright and already reads like it has years of dust on it. Save for a few exceptions you are better off watching grass grow if you want to learn something original. Save your $125 and photocopy the last 3 articles and buy Allmans Evolving Brains for a light read light years ahead of this pile of insipid drival."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty, but only a rehash of Tempest of the 80s","review":"For a game whose gameplay is avaliable in many freeware offerings, this mostly offers just eye candy. (Albeit *very* pretty eye candy.) If you've already purchased a NUON enabled DVD player, and you come across this in the bargain bin, it wouldn't be a bad pick if you liked the original Tempest. But, as a fan of the original, this wasn't worth full price to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Minter's masterpiece","review":"One of the greatest shooters ever, only available on a defunct console that hides inside a dvd player. It's criminal how many will never get the chance to play Tempest 3000 as it's the absolute pinnacle of the Tempest template. 2000 on the Atari Jaguar is cleaner to look at, and certainly beats it in gameplay terms if you can source a rotary controller, but 3000 is more immersive, and that's where the magic lies. As soon as it loads you're hit with an explosion of neon pyrotechnics and a deep, manacing soundtrack that combines dance/rave, sci-fi and 80s videogaming. Add some of the tightest gaming mechanics ever programmed and it all comes together to create an experience where you simply become unaware of anything outside of the game. And that's what Tempest 3000 is all about; the experience. There's nothing else like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great story, but too many mistakes and too biased","review":"If you are looking for a great story on one of the American Revolution's Heros this book should satisfy that desire. That being said, this book is filled with mistakes. Over and over again I caught mistakes he made on the American Revolution, since I am very familiar with that time period.The book is also far too biased. Lafayette is shown as being the hero of conflict he was involved in and everyone else as being incompetent. Lafayette was a great man, no doubt, but Unger makes him seem as though he was a god.To Unger's credit he does make Lafayette's life very interesting, especially to those who have little background knowledge on his life, I would imagine.All in all a good story, but not a good history book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly researched","review":"This is one of those \\"fast-paced\\" narratives that is long on drama, but short on quality research. Should not be used as a reference at all for Lafayette's experiences during the American Revolution, especially for the 1781 Virginia campaign. Very inaccurate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Factual errors are inexcusable!","review":"This book is apparently not well researched and has at least three errors so far and I am not a fifth finished with it.For one on page 71: \\"After signing the treaty, (The Treaty of Alliance between the United States and France) Franklin, Deane, and Adams were officially presented to the king...\\"Unger means Arthur Lee, not Adams. The treaty was signed on February 6, 1778, the presentation ceremony was March 22. John Adams didn't arrive in Paris until April 8.This is pitiful and I could list the other errors and I certainly will if it is requested. But I resent the time involved to do it, they are not my errors! Why the Library Journal claims this is a \\"well-researched\\" biography one can only speculate. The (few?) errors make the whole suspect. A sad event for publishing. Perhaps we should wait another 20 years for an accurate book."},{"rating":"2","title":"well researched","review":"Generally, Revolutionary War biographies don't contain new information for me, especially those related to General Washington. The Unger book is an historical account that is a delight to read. It would seem that Lafayette saved every scrap of correspondence from Washington, and Unger has brought a very personal element to the history of the War. The story of Lafayette's attempt to share the American ideals after his return to France is a compelling account of a man who never gave up his dreams,until the day he died."},{"rating":"2","title":"Le Marquis est magnifique!","review":"Recently completed this very well researched and well presented biography! The book is easiliy readable, but not simplistic, detailing many aspects of both the American and French Revolutions, and the Marquis de Lafayette's involvement in both.The author takes something of a \\" glass half full \\" approach to this prominent historic figure, presenting him often as the\\" Last Knight \\" and finding little fault in his actions, but the amazing early American reaction to his heroism and belief in democractic ideals justifies this approach. An excellent text for any American or European history buff!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gripping reading","review":"Fascinating book about a man I knew only by name and whose name and dedication to the fight for independence is not as well known as it should be.

This means that the printer will only work for another couple months before it tells me I need a new cartridge.

Acting, editing, directing, writing, lighting, music, sound, best boying, etc.It's a no budget production that deserves no stars.

It focuses only on the legal historyof 20th Century Creationism.

We anticipated a great performance since it had received rave reviews. Instruments sounded great. The sets looked wonderful. Vocals were VERY muted. It didn't do justice to a group we've listened to many times and have recommended to our friends. It sounded like an \\"amateurish\\" effort and not up to their high standards.

Sorry, I wouldn't advise anyone to buy this DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor stage production and recording","review":"I love Secret Garden's music, but this DVD is a big disappointment: poor stage lighting and cluttered stage settings. Compared to other concert DVDs I have (e.g., Josh Graban and Sarah Brightman), this concert production and recording were poor.I don't feel this DVD adds much value to a simple CD. This DVD is sitting on my shelf and collecting dust. Sad.I hope Secret Garden's next DVD will be better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I have read some good revues about Secret Garden playing with some great female singers and had great expectations to this production. Well, I was disappointed. The sound was not good. In general I love the sound of crisp string sound from violins and other bowed string instruments.

I enjoy modern instrument performances of music from this period (for instance Mozart's piano concertos, where a period fortepiano is frequently overwhelmed by the orchestra, even a period insturment orchestra. However, I think period fortepianos are preferable in chamber music.The balance and clarity of these recordings is superb. Three different period fortepianos are used, adding to the sense of progression not just in Haydn's compositions, but also the color and texture of the music as influenced by the choice of instrument.As usual, Brilliant Classics offers a great value for the money as well. Informative liner notes, sturdy cardboard sleeves for each of the ten discs, and the set takes up less than two inches of shelf space.Highest of recommendations."},{"rating":"2","title":"sissi","review":"the quality was excellent and the box really pretty to keep for my collection.

Pooh's Learning Library does this with the help of the gentle, sweet Pooh characters. This workbook progresses through the lessons in continuing stories that maintain the personalities of the characters and their familiar relationships perfectly. Each activity is labeled for concepts taught which is extremely helpful to the parent and there are resource guides in each section as well. The graphics are lush and very well rendered. A generous book with 192 pages of fun and reward stickers your child will easily understand what is expected of him due to the logical way the activity is laid out. With glue, scissors, and pencil at the ready, you'll have everything you need in a Pre-K workbook to teach reading, math, language, writing, and fine motor skills.

The first disc is my favorite, there are a lot of really good episodes on it (The Thin White Line, Brian Goes To Hollywood, And The Wiener Is.., Lethal Weapons) It doesn't stop there, though. The second disc has one of the episodes I would have to site as one of my overall favorites from the show (Screwed The Pooch) and Emission: Impossible. I would recommend this in addition to Seasons 1 and 2, they are both so good, you just have to own them both."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite TV show ever","review":"Family Guy is in my opinion, the funniest show ever made.

The shows are that funny that you will watch them numerous times quoting your favorite scenes as they appear.

Well this second (and last) dvd set of Family Guy is extremely funny. More outrageous laughs like seeing the tragic effects of child stardom on Elroy Jetson to seeing ALF reminisce about his drug problems on E! True Hollywood Stories.There are even funnier lines in this set as well. The Weinstein episode was really funny too,and now I see what all the hype was about.It also featured the voice of Ben Stein who I think is really funny.Of course,as a Catholic,I didn't care too much for how the nuns were depicted.But hey,with Family Guy EVERYONE is a target!So you just have to take it with a grain of salt and laugh.The extra features were nice on this set as well.So buy this dvd set already!It's freakin' funny!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lucky there's a Family Guy.....","review":"When I first saw this show, I couldn't get interested.

I laughed so hard at this one particular episode that I literally stopped breathing for a full minute. So I had to hunt the rest of them down to see what I had been missing, and have not been disappointed. I went through [alot] to get volume one (2 Best Buys and 2 Circuit Citys were sold out...they had no idea it was so popular), but I have it in all it's creamy yellow goodness.

It speaks volumes about a show when, by far, the most interesting character is the familiy dog. You might laugh here and there in between the celebrity cheap-shots and painfully typical movie parodies but I would'nt hold my breath. It's no mystery why this show was cancelled nor is it a shame. Bottom line: the Family Guy is to the Simpson's, as Schlitz is to Dom Perignon."},{"rating":"1","title":"GOOD LORD PEOPLE!","review":"WHAT'S THE MATTER PEOPLE?

It tries so hard to be funny, and succeeds *maybe* 10% of the time. The rest is just unfunny and forced. It's low-rent humor aimed at people that think they're smart but really have no idea what \\"funny\\" is. A Simpsons ripoff that is slightly funnier than cancer mixed with AIDS, and nothing else.

The stories are good, you get to know what to expect from the characters and it's just great. I have watched this DVD set more than anything else I own. I have probably 95% of the entire DVD memorized.It's worth it. Get this DVD. It will have you laughing for many years."},{"rating":"2","title":"A season of continuous laughs","review":"As everyone now knows, Family Guy was cancelled after it's third season, but brought back a few years later due to popular DVD sales and high (re-run) ratings on Cartoon Network. Season 3 was the last before Fox decided to drop the show. But this season didn't lack substance or comedy. It was just as funny if not better than the previous two. Seth Macfarlane continued to hit home with joke after joke in this laugh out loud comedy. With the typical animated comedy dysfunctional family, Seth Macfarlane has managed to create more than just a Simpsons knockoff, he has created an entirely new, fresh, and funny show, and Season 3 is no excuse. He brings in new material, new ideas, new jokes, and even more comedy. This season continues to set the bar higher for the Family Guy series, much like the previous two seasons did, and offers continuous laughs throughout every episode."},{"rating":"2","title":"Giggidy Giggidy Giggidy","review":"Hilarious, funny, super funny, hilarious, I thought I'd die laughing.

Stewie used to be my favorite character, but he's not as evil anymore. I nearly died when I saw him try to comfort Peter at that sporting event. Disgusting.This show does better without recurring themes, like when Peter's boss dies and he's a fisherman. AWFUL. We have to put up with that idiocy for the rest of the season.Family Guy was absolutely hilarious the first 2 seasons, but it ran out of steam very quickly. But, how long can you outright copy other shows (King of the Hill, The Simpsons, South Park, Futurama, etc.) and still be funny?"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Show Was Cancelled. . .","review":". . .because it was a poor excuse for comedy. Unlike others, I felt there was very little redeeming value to Family Guy. I can sit through an entire episode and not have the urge to laugh -- not even once. And that speaks very poorly for the quality of said show. The writers seemingly tried too hard to be irreverent, and the product they produced could easily be equated with what the family dog, Brian, left on the rug. Often the writers would resort to jokes about rabbis which not only bordered on antisemitic but were so unfunny one would have to wonder whether they were purposely trying to write crap. If you're looking for a crude, irreverent, yet funny animated comedy turn to South Park. Or, better yet, skip directly to the most creative, well written and produced animated comedies since The Simpsons, Futurama and King of the Hill. Remember, you can easily tune to Cartoon Network's Adult Swim if you're craving the dismal, dubious comedy of Family Guy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not buying this dvd is a sin","review":"I was watching family guy since the beginning. I bought both DVD box sets and love the show to death. its so good you can watch the same episode each day for the next month and still laugh so hard at that episode that you cry. This show is crude, insanely low brow, and it is on the edge of being sent so late-night tv. But it's still pure genius. Each episode just as funny as the last. Now on to the DVD. the on-screen layout is fantastic. (One small annoyance, there is no play all button). the extras are good (although there could have been more) and the unaired episode is hilarious (the producers were worried about this episode from the beginning, so when it was finished, they sent copies to several rabbis, who all found it acceptable and funny, but fox still turned it down).WHY FOX CANCELED THIS SHOW I HAVE NO IDEA!! AND THERE ABOUT TO DO THE SAME THING TO FUTURAMA!! WHY OH WHY???? In summation, buy this DVD, now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Family Guy fun continues.","review":"The fun continues with this second box set from the third season.

I don't get many of them, but I'm no film expert.Volume 2, while good, is just not *as* good as Volume 1. The funniest episodes are in the first Volume. There is a lot of Broadway musical stuff in Volume 2, which has always been one of the things that bugs me about the show. When characters break out into song, I change the channel.If you like that sort of thing, go for it.

I was kind of depressed because one of my dear loved ones died, but watching this cheered me up a lot. I laughed so hard sometimes, that I even forget what I'm laughing about....anyway, this is just a masterpiece for anything about comedy or funny drama, because some scenes are a little over dramatic, but then it breaks into funny again. The people you would most enjoy is Peter the fat dad, Stewie the evil baby, Chris the huge adolescent, and Brian the drunk dog. This will cheer anybody up. Well, it has some cruel jokes like sex jokes in it, and may contain disturbing and offensive language, or images, so I suggest only 12-21 year olds that have a good sense of humor to watch it.

There are also a couple of dubs of Son House songs like Death Letter and Walkin' Blues which are more powerful musically, if not as raw and emotional vocally as the originals.

It quit working within 6 weeks. The litter box lid never did fit correctly, and the unit just stopped running.Littermaid sent a replacement. The lid on the replacement wouldn't close either and the tracks for the rake were out of alignment. After some fine tuning, the unit worked for THREE days before quitting.Perhaps this is a good idea whose time has not yet arrived.

The product jams constantly, causing me to have to scoop out the problem. Also, the rake mechanism is jerky, and at times, it literally shoots the s*** out onto the bathroom floor. And if your cat's stools are not firm, they stick in the rake. So you have to take the top of the unit off, turn it upside down, and clean it with a wet cloth. YUCK! Unless you buy the additional privacy tent, odors are just as bad as with an ordinary box. The only plus is that my cats get a kick out of watching it run."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good, but not Great","review":"I loved this item for the first few months and then it broke down for whatever reason.

So I gave up and tossed it and pray that someone else (who understands what the phone is for) will make another version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product! Can't go back to regular boxes.","review":"I started buying the littermaid back when I owned 1 cat. I have since grown to a 5 cat family and have had several units. I recently purchased the designer series. We had 2 megas and one unit did stop working after 3 years. But what do you expect with 5 cats that each can on the average use the box 5 to 10 times a day. I have read many of the reviews and can see why some folks would be disappointed. Do not expect this to be something that requires no maintanence, you do have to manage and keep up on it. It is advertised as \\"no more scooping\\" not not more cleaning! The motor is not as loud as some of the other reviewers have mentioned. The cats acclimate very quickly to it. With proper care this will last you years! I also have just seen the latest product Littermaid Elite with a steel rake and ionic air cleaner. I would have tried that one has I known it was available, looks like they made a few improvments on an already great product."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't buy it!","review":"ok, here's the deal:I have 2 cats. We bought this item in January 2005, it is now March 2005 and it's already not working. The rake gets stuck, and it stops moving (which completely negates it's purpose), it gets very dirty and is difficult to clean, when you remove the plastic 'tray' it sprays dirty litter on you if you're not careful, and the plug is ultra cheap and broke on us (which makes me wonder about the manufacture of the rest of the product). Now, if the rake moves at all, it makes a horrible noise. And even in the beginning it didn't work very well. The 'refuse' would stick to the rake and it wouldn't go anywhere, and the rest of it would stick to the bottom of the pan.I must say, I am severely dissapointed with this product. We bought it for 160$, and it sucks. Don't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sounds good but isn't","review":"I got this litter box for two primary reasons, to keep the dogs out of the litter box, and to keep a constantly clean litter box with 3 cats.The box has about a 10 minute delay after the cat uses the box before it \\"sweeps\\" the litter. This is too long, since by that time, if the dogs want into the box, they have smelled it and are already into it. The timer cannot be changed. Also, if you have a curious cat, they keep getting into the box & delaying the sweeping, or get in the box without using it causing constant sweeping.Also, if the cat's feces is anything but full firm, it gets on the litter rake, and you have to take it apart to clean, which is much worse than manually scooping the box.Additionally, 2 of the 3 cats will go to the standard litter boxes, since they don't like the automatic one. One is scared to death of the auto litterbox and won't go within 15 feet of it.I had so hoped this would be the perfect product, but it has some definite draw backs."},{"rating":"1","title":"cannot be repaired!!","review":"I have bought seven littermaid automatic mega self cleaning litter boxes over the years, and all but one have broken for the same reason---they continue to rake without stopping. A tiny red plastic piece breaks off into the litter. This small part is part of the control of the rake--without it you cannot stop the raking.

I bought the original, and it worked for about 10 months then the rake jammed and refused to move. Since I have 3 cats, I decided maybe the Mega Maid would solve the problem. Instead it worked even worse. The rake leaves gaps allowing waste to slip by and be caught on the return trip behind the rake. And after 11 months the wires to the rake broke. I've soldered them back together 4 times now, but they continued to break, and on the last repair attempt the circuit board cracked so the unit is useless.Great idea, very poorly made and designed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works Ok...Not Worth the Money","review":"My LitterMaid worked for approximately 8 months before stopping all together. Now it is a worthless plastic pale. If you pay a lot for this it is not worth it. I found that it did work most of the time but required a good deal of cleaning and upkeep. I was more involved in cleaning the litter more times with the LitterMaid than without it in many circumstances. It is also VERY LOUD. It must be placed somewhere that is not in close proximity to anyone sleeping or they will be waken up several times a night. When it worked it was a nice gadget to have. Unfortunatley, it did not work 100% very often."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a nightmare!","review":"i now have two kitties and decided to take the leap into the self cleaning litter box world since i live alone and travel enough. i thought i was splurging for a good model but it turned out to be a big headache. the littermaid mega never seemed to work right. the first problem was that it would continue to rake the box over and over even though the dirty litter had been removed (and it's LOUD). it has come off the track about 10 times, the rake is constantly filled with waste and the most recent problem is that the rake is now stuck at the dumping position. i've had it for TWO WEEKS. would not recommend. also, don't bother with batteries, they last about 3 days."},{"rating":"1","title":"good book, i guess","review":"this book had a good story.

Oh well, she's still a bang up detective and the two work comfortably together. King develops her characters well.

Also, King went heavily into descriptions on several occasions, yet I had a hard time following her. I had to reread several passages because they were so mired in detail I lost sight of the big picture. I never did get a feel for the characters.

I'm happy to have been made aware of Andy Kaufmann.Being a Jim Carrey fan, especially of his more serious acting, I enjoyed the movie from the first to the last second. More than anything it shows Jim Carrey's wide range as an actor. He does the wonderfully obnoxious Tony Clifton, the awkward nerdy private Andy and the sensitive, cancer-struck Andy.

Andy is portrayed, perhaps accurately, perhaps not, as an obnoxious self-centered boor. If that is truly who Andy was then, I suppose, Jim Carrey did an excellent job of portraying him. Having said that, I must state that I was very disappointed with the content of the movie. I expected it to be a celebration of Andy's life and it was anything but that.

I rented this movie and I've got to say that I just couldn't wait till it was over. I should've just taken the money, laid it on the table, and lit it on fire....I would've enjoyed that more than the movie...and it wouldn't have wasted so much of my time.

This film is a sort-of biography, not a comedy.Carrey is wooden and mechanical in his characterization of Andy Kaufman, whose life really wasn't that interesting anyway (so, why the heck make a movie about him? )You will find yourself waiting for the comedy to start -- trust me, it won't. And the mediocre comedy re-enactments won't be powerful enough to make you laugh. Avoid this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why was this film made?","review":"Was Andy Kaufman the most unfunny man on TV in that rather empty period of comedy in the late seventies? And then to make a film about his life! I vaguely remember watching his cliche \\"foreign guy\\" portrayal in Taxi when I was a child and I didn't find him funny at seven years old! Throughout the film, I found myself hoping to catch glimpses of the real Jim Carrey, and yet was left only with this somewhat creepy portrayal of a guy that had the sense of humour of a second hand sofa. Viewed in the year 2001, Andy Kaufman comes across not so much as shocking but just a little sad. So congratulations to Jim Carrey for a really convincing performance, but please stick to your own humour next time - it beats the pants off Andy Kaufman!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Deport Milos Forman","review":"What a piece of crap! I mean, what a piece of crap! Andy Kaufman was only one of the two most exciting comedians of the 20th century and what does he get? This piece of crap! Utterly predictable and formulaic, it changes the facts of his life to make it LESS interesting than it actually was (the Carnegie Hall concert, which this movie offers of an example of how Andy came to show his love for his fans as he faced death blah blah blah, happened years earlier). Andy would have been disgusted by this flat, tame, unimaginative film, representative of everything he wanted to destroy. The fact that this abomination passes itself off as a TRIBUTE to the great man's memory is most sickening of all. A pox on everyone involved, from Jim Carrey to REM. Go see videos of the real Andy doing his thing, and stay away from this monstrosity, which is the worst thing to happen to Andy since cancer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yeah, sure he acted it well, but highly overated.","review":"In my opinion Jim Carrey has truly acted in two movies, Truman Show, and Man on the Moon. I still did not like Man on the Moon though. I find that when movies are accurate in depicting a biography, (which Man on the Moon was) they sometimes lose what an audience wants to see in a film. This was a funny movie. However, when I say that Jim Carrey acted in Man on the Moon I am saying that he acted in a comical character, I do not feel that he acted in any drama scenes. Truman Show was a comedy yet it still had drama scenes. I'm sure many people disagree with me but this is just how I feel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your time and money","review":"...this is the absolute worst movie I have ever seen, four thumbs down.

It's supposed to be a biography of Andy Kaufman, but the movie only goes into the shallowest of details, spending most of its energies to progress from one comedic routine to the next. While these comedic scenes are often funny in their wackiness, they're forgettable, and certainly don't make me want to become more like Andy Kaufman, apparently the director's ambition...The approach seems problematic. Jim Carrey was more or less put in the role of re-enacting Andy Kaufman's \\"greatest hits\\".

Really explains some things about the real Andy Kaufman but the performance by Jim Carrey is just UNBELIEVABLE! You forget you're watching an imitation of Andy Kaufman.

I remembered when Kauffman first appeared on SNL and did the Mighty Mouse routine. I loved it.

Why?1) Jim Carrey is not convincing is Kaufman. Carrey is tall and lanky. Kaufman was short and shlubby. Also, throughout the movie, Carrey gives this weird, letcherous leer that I suppose means that he is pulling a fiendish prank on us, the audience. It's more of a distraction than anything else.2) Danny DeVito plays his manager, yet there are scenes of Kaufman on the set of Taxi with the origional players. How strange is that?3) Not unlike the the Belushi bio-pic, Wired, the only way to appreciate Kaufman's comedy bits is to watch the origionals on vhs. Any immitations, even with Carrey, are by definition second-rate.4) Dare I say it: Kaufman wasn't that great! His stunts and hijinks were more the result of his LACK of talent. His routines reflect his inability to ENTERTAIN the audience, instead of irritating them. The pseudo-intellectualising of Kaufman after his death is the REALLY laughable thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"One star for Jim's excellent job, but....","review":"Jim Carrey's acting is great. So good that you can forget its Jim. I liked The Truman Show, so I thought I'd give this one a chance. The problem here for me is that I never was a fan of Andy, and was always not even interested in seeing a movie about Andy. But, I gave it a chance after seeing Jim's other work.---the bottom line is that I don't like Andy's \\"comedy\\" and never did, and this film presents Andy's \\"comedy.\\" The film will give you insight into what Andy was like when he did not do his act, and I found that as unagreeable as his \\"comedy.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as i heard....","review":"Man on the moon was an excelent biography, but a very poor and boring comedy.

When I was about five, I would watch reruns of Taxi on Nick at Night and saw the genius that is Andy Kaufman. When I heard about this film, I was determined to rent it when it came out on video. When I rented this modern masterpiece, I discovered that Mr. Kaufman's life was much different than it seemed. This heartfelt movie was a sweeping drama about the life of Andy Kaufman and his friends. Jim Carrey gives the best performance of his career, which should have given him at least a nomination for the little gold guy, if not the statue. Courtney Love gives a surprisingly good performance as Lynn, Andy's girlfriend, and Danny Devito is brilliant. But, Jim still steals the show. I enjoyed seeing the cast of Taxi in the film and also Lorne Michaels. But be careful.

I find it really difficult to find a movie that's perfect for all our family to watch at Christmas, but this this one will do the trick. I'm definitely going to show it this year.

The theme of 2 men - one straight, one gay, experiencing how it felt to be in each others shoes, is probably not original but was portrayed in an amusing and catchy way. The opening sequence showed just how much young minds can be influenced by bigoted people and the end sequence portrayed the irony of how people change their views. I would give a special mention to Kirsten Lea who gave an endearing performance as the bewildered girlfriend who finds the love of her life changing before her just as she's ready to commit.

In a time when every movie seems to rehash the same old story, this put a whole new spin on the Freaky Friday device. And it was also really moving and touching in all the right places. It is a really solid throughout. From a comedy standpoint, Tom Arnold steals this movie, and seems to have made it better than it should've been. He is hilarious - and surprisingly sweet in very scene, which makes me think he is a much deeper actor than I had given him credit for in the past.

Also, the red flip-up lens broke off with normal use. Also, if you are going to use this headlamp because you need the red light to save your night vision, be advised that the shade of red isn't as deep as a red LED -- it's more of an orange.

I'd recommend it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great performance - terrible mastering","review":"Unfortunately, this famous recording is sabotaged by the mastering. A result of the ridiculous collaboration between EMI and Callas' horrid sister Jackie, who claimed ownership of Callas live performances (like that could be true!!!!) this mastering, copied from either Verona or AS-Disc, is a few minutes too long due to a downward drift in pitch; its on three CDs while more consistently pitched versions on Melodram or Legato are on two. Look for the Legato version - its sounds better than the Melodram. But avoid this set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maria's early days","review":"I feel that this recording of Maria Callas as Norma is something that every Callas fan should have in their collection. It represents her early years as a fresh and exciting singer. Some of the cuts that the conductor decided to make, I did not enjoy but other than that, I reall felt that the opera was performed well by all the vocalists. THanks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Earlier Callas","review":"If there was a 'best' list of 'Norma' recordings to choose from in the Callas recorded legacy, this one would have to rate very high. The vocal 'flaws' are minimal, dealing mostly with the famous Callas nervousness and tendency to rush at the beginning of the performance, but later, the revealing passages are glorious. Vittorio Gui, the conductor, is a most sympathetic conductor and the other singers in the cast (including a very young Joan Sutherland) give fine support. Ebe Stignani, near the end of her career, brings the experience of a whole career to her performance. The greatest asset is the tenor, Mirto Picchi, a vast improvement over a couple of the Pollione's Callas was confronted with in other performances of this opera which have, unfortunately, also been recorded. Enjoyable listening for 'Norma' and Callas fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Casta Diva in a Tin Can","review":"This was the first \\"Norma\\" I ever purchased, and it turned me off to live opera recordings for a LONG time (I am still wary of them and investigate them carefully).While I recognize that Norma was a great Callas role (I am not a Callas fan), unfortunately, this 1952 does not show it. In fact, the entire recording sounds like it was recorded in a tin can, and there is an annoying (though periodic) hiss. The volume balance is also a problem--some tracks are inaudible while others will blast you into the next room.The moral of the story is, pick another \\"Norma\\" to purchase (preferably the Sutherland/Horne one)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Old School Still Hits HARD!","review":"There is no shortage of CD's out there claiming to have the right mix of \\"essential\\" old school funk. Of course most of them have the same old jams and are predictable to the point of boredom. Old School Vol 1 is exactly what it claims to be; a selection of classic tunes and choice tracks from back in the day. After wearing out the grooves myself I recommend that this compilation is the one you should purchase if you want to remember just how great funk used to be (I mean Double Dutch Bus, Atomic Dog, Flashlight, etc) or want an intro to a genre that Dropped a Bomb on an entire generation. This one will keep the party happenin' for sure!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The First of the Series","review":"When I purchased this one I was happy to find that there were more to follow. I am not that old but this music takes you back to the times when music was music. I love these songs and I love listening to them over and over again.

A great buy and I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the cd.","review":"I love this cd, the only thing I didn't like was the fact that Rob Base was on it.

However, where present, the illustrations are excellent.I think the authors did a very commendable job on material."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible book","review":"I won't say this is the worst Math book I have ever used, but it is certainly up there. No nearly enough examples. He proves the theorems and then throws 15 exercises at you with having done even one. Of course, on some chapters, he does have \\"some' examples, but not nearly enough.

It is a big hassle to try to attach to your cage and in the end it doesn't stay secured for 5 minutes. The velcro pieces don't stick to anything. The plastic scratches by just unrolling it.

I found this product to be a big waste of money and of packaging."},{"rating":"2","title":"great","review":"I got this for my nine year old daughter and she loves it.

It's nice to have these great songs available again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really an exceptional collection","review":"I was given this (impossibly beautiful) Subterranean edition a few weeks ago, and I am mighty grateful for it. By and large, this is one of the strongest short story collections I've ever gotten my hands on - and I highly recommend it for a bit of late-night reading over a glass of wine.It was my personal (and by no means authoritative) opinion that the first and last few stories are the strongest in the compilation; I felt a little let down by a few of the middle ones. One or two felt like filler, and a couple others read like some brilliant beginnings to much longer pieces that I was disappointed not to have at my disposal. But this is absolutely the worst that can be said for it.Beware of purchasing it as a gift. You might be reluctant to pass it on to its intended recipient."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nay","review":"Caitlin Kiernan's writing shows no growth whatsoever. For all intents and purposes these stories are the same ones as in Tales of Pain Of Wonder with different titles and names. It's tiresome. It seems like the author cannot come to the grips with the fact that the 1990s are long over.Avoid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Starting to go downhill.","review":"The best, most succinct way I can describe this book is, \\"The magic is gone.\\" I was disappointed that almost no time was spent in fiction, and the whole thing with Landon felt flat. I loved The Well of Lost Plots so, so much that this book just made me a little sad. Still good, and still clever, but. Something is missing. Nevertheless, I do not regret reading it, but I would recommend the first three books in this series much more strongly than I would recommend this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Can't Handle It","review":"It was only after I had engaged that author that I realized this was the fourth in a loosly connected series. I am not sure, however, that reading the priors were necessary. I just could not get into the text. It took so much work to sort out what was happening, I gave up. Some called the book funny, I called it redicuous. It's not my genre and maybe my mood was too serious, but it seemed a confusing waste of time to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Probably my favorite Thursday Next","review":"Maybe it's because everything gets tied together so well (including one very surprising revelation I will not name) or because I thought The Well of Lost Plots was fairly flawed, but this is my favorite Thursday Next book, I think. Maybe it's just the hilarious rendition of Hamlet in modern England!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Something Rotten","review":"The Thursday Next series is madder than the Mad Hatter's Tea Party, Miss Haversham, and the state of the nations gas prices all mixed together and multiplied by 100. It's hyperactive, zany, and insane. And that is why I love it so.Thursday Next has had it working within the book world. So, she takes her son Friday and pet dodos ,and moves in with her mother. She has a massive bank overdraft to pay, a husband to have uneradicated, and the world to save from a madman fictional character, Chancellor Yorrick Kaine. Along the way she avoids slapstick assassignation attempts, a dithering Hamlet, Prince of Denmark, and cloned Shakespeares. And that ain't even the half of it!It's mad, I tell you, and it's delightful. You should read the whole amazingly crazy series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Great Thursday Next Tale","review":"This is a great book! Fforde delivers again with all of the humor, wit and genre-bending acrobactics that made the first three novels so entertaining. The Thursday Next books are the PERFECT leisure reading for folks of a literary turn who also enjoy fun books and genres.I want to thank Jasper Fforde for all of the Thursday Next novels, but I appreciated this one especially because our heroine is that rarest of modern characters, the heroic mother and wife. It's so wonderful to know that mothers of small children can still save the world and take on the bad guys in between naps and snacktime!Fforde does a great job tying up all the loose ends of the previous three novels, while still maintaining the hilarious literary pop-culture noir tone that has made these books so unusual and so much fun. As it appears that this novel is the last of series, you can buy the whole set at once and keep up with the running gags and plots with ease!"},{"rating":"2","title":"really should be four and a half stars","review":"I'm not going to summarize this book as the other reviewer has already done a very effective job of that. I am just going to say that jasper fforde has, once again, aspired to new heights of comic brilliance. from referring to the nazis as \\"evil yet nattily dressed agressors\\" to hamlet's \\"to espresso or to latte, that is the question soliloquey (please pardon the sp., it's a bit late) to politics shows named \\"evade the question\\", fforde is unparalleled at coming up with not just six impossible things, but six million billion trillion things before breakfast. major points to the reigning master of the literary in joke.I recommend this book, and all the others in this breathtakingly brilliant series, to anyone with a deep appreciation for classic literature and a healthy sense of humor. should be required reading for ALL english majors."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a powerful & convenient vacuum (for bare floors)","review":"This vacuum is powerful (11 amps) & convenient (small & lightweight with a retractable power cord).

I have stone floors, two area rugs and a 1000sq ft (temporary)house to clean. The Eureka could not pick up fallen dog hair, nor the dust for which I bought it for. The bags are so puny, that an Ant could not make a home of it. The power that drives the suction stops at the coiled hose.End result, had one good Eureka, one that was not worth the postage.

Jame becomes more enmeshed in the politics of her race as she tries to find a place among them. Torisen takes more of a back seat here than he does in 'Seeker's Mask' and the plot follows Jame's story. It is clear that Tori is a deeply conflicted man and I hope it won't be as many years again before we see how he handles his problems. I don't want to give any spoilers in a review--those who have followed the story this far will want to read for themselves and will not be disappointed. I rate it only 4 stars, because I think Hodgell can top this--I compare her to herself since I'd need more than 5 stars to compare her to most other authors in the fantasy genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent sequel to Jame's adventures","review":"I gave it only 4/5 because I want more!!! :-) But seriously, it doesn't stand on its own. You need to read the first books in the series. That said, it's a fine sequel, and leaves you wanting MORE! NOW!If you're a fan of PC Hodgell's works, you won't bother reading the review. You'll buy the book anyway, and you won't be disappointed.If you haven't read Hodgell before, buy \\"God Stalk\\" (or \\"Dark of the Gods,\\" ISBN 1592221149 which contains both God Stalk & its sequel Dark of the Moon) then \\"Seeker's Mask\\" (ISBN 1892065347)Let me throw a few phrases to convey the atmosphere: Richly textured, darkly comic, occassional slapstick, finely crafted world, likeable characters, imaginative and original, intelligent, suspenseful, page-turner. If those words don't resonate with you, don't bother with this series. But if they do, you've got my highest recommendation.

Rockwell is one of the rare actors that can display range. In this movie, he plays a humble, blue-collar 'country-bumpkin' who may not be educated or have been graced with the opportunities and status of those he mows lawns for, but nonetheless, has a keen sense of reality and truth about him. He truly brings heart to the movie and Misca Barton doesn't do too bad of job herself. It's a movie about friendship, societal differences/conflict, as well as the misunderstanding and prejudice that occurs when the two collide. Be prepared to be have your heart wrenched, yet lifted. A great addition to any collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Htown is now on the map!","review":"Wow the book was on point with no dull moment from begining to end so yes you should read it if you haven't.

I had tried all the usual ways (sticking the pill into cheese or dog treats, putting it on the back of her tongue and holding her mouth shut, etc.), so I was willing to try anything.There's nothing unusual about these treats that makes a dog eat them any differently than anything else. So, I stick the pill in, my dog starts chewing the pill pocket, and soon she's foaming at the mouth because she bit into the pill.If your dog wolfs down food without chewing, this product will work, but is probably unnecessary.

It was an exquisite surprise, especially to a tenor who longs to hear singers who don't blast their audiences away. Mr. Cutler takes the top place of my favorite tenors now right beside Nicolai Gedda: The tone is relaxed, beautifully balanced, and his diction is impeccable. The musicianship was just a tiny bit bland, but then it's hard to judge from a recording. I'd recommend this album to anyone, and I hope one day to pass along the praise in person. Taking his cue, I'm now working up the Liederkreis, too, an enchanting cycle by Schuman. As my sisters-in-law say, \\"Why sing Schubert? Sing SCHUMANN!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"What grows in Iowa...","review":"Bradley Moore is one top knotch accompanist and Mr. Cutler was fortunate to have him. his is a disappointing debut album, it fell short of expectation after hearing the Met broadcast of La Juive in December. His voice is so incredibly effected that there is no connection between the singer and the text. And thus, it immediately resonates as FALSE to the listener. One wants to be swept away in music, not question if Mr Cutler too much of a juvenile to understand the emotions he is singing about.To his credit, Mr. Cutler has solid technique. Unfortunately, technique does not make an artist. The fundamental element that is deficient here in both the cd and in the artist is HEART. If Mr. Cutler would only bother connecting with others, unveiling their humanity and revealing his own, then he would surely avoid the self conscious/self indulgent errors of relying solely on technique. Heart and humanity make an artist, a lesson Mr. Cutler is in dire need of learning."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good!","review":"The plot itself was extremely exciting and interesting.

Personally, I like their first album, 'And The Waters Opened' a tad better. Tough to describe, but try experimental / kraut-like. Some just might simply tag it as 'World Music'. Two best tracks are the title cut \\"Dharana\\" and the seventeen minute epic \\"The Voice Of Silence\\" (nearly worth the price of admission alone). Line-up: Peter Michael Hamel - keyboards & organ, Robert Detree (Embryo) - acoustic guitar, Gary L.

Descendants of the Great Merlin and the Lady of the Lake, Gavin and Tamara must unite against the dark evil force that threatens not only their lives, but the very exsistence of Avalon the way we know it.Catherine Anne Collins, in her first published novel gives us a nail biting, edge-of-your-seat treat into the mystical world of Avalon. Around every corner lurks danger for the two ancestors who must solve the mystery or lose their very lives at the hands of the Dark Lady. Fighting against logic, can Tamara learn to believe in the magic that surrounds her before it is too late? Can Gavin win the race against time to stop the evil curse and once again gain control over the sword Excalibur, or will he fail like his many descendents?Destined to be one of the best books of the year.

The AI is the worst from ANY game, and that's as low as you can go, if I tell a team member topick a lock, it takes him five minutes to do so, the controls arehorrible, worst than Max Payne, and those are pretty bad. Take myadvice, don't buy this, don't even waste five bucks on renting it, if a unfortunate freind bought this, don't even borrow his.

I haven't had this much fun in awhile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good gameplay, runs on almost all systems, etc.","review":"SWAT 3 has great gameplay, combined with good controls and a realistic AI. Also worth noting is that the AI enemies are placed in random locations throughout the maps, allowing for more interesting replays of missions (the bad guys aren't always in the same spot!).Another thing that's worth noting is that the game will run on almost any system (Celeron processor? No problem!). I've personally observed it running at fast rates on fairly old computers that have Celeron processors.The only downside to the game is its infamous last mission. The last mission tries to force the player to move quickly through the map (due to a timer), in a failed attempt to delay the time that it takes for someone to complete the game. This only results in the last mission not encouraging the player traits that are so heavily encouraged in previous missions: patience and strategy.Over all, though, it's a great game. I recommend that you buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keyboard ok.. mouse weighs a ton!","review":"Sorry Microsoft.. go back to the drawing board on this one.

The mouse isn't the best design -- it doesn't quite fit my hand -- but the extra buttons are great (although I doubt everyone would use them). It's also slightly heavier than a traditional mouse, but not enough to bother me. The keyboard is fantastic -- it's quiet and the shortcut keys are very handy.

Regardless of whether it weighs 5 oz. or 15, it's by far the heaviest mouse I've ever had to use. My hand and arm are worn out after an hour of use.I kind of like the keyboard, though. It seems to work pretty well and haslots of features for a lower-cost keyboard, including the \\"special function\\" keys such as email, home page, etc. (I didn't understand how great these can be until you get used to them). My only problme is that the function key functions for Outlook are switched around (and hard-labeled), and the \\"Send\\"/Receive key doesn't seem to work.Overall, though, I'd pass on this combo. Find one with a mouse that only uses 1 AAA battery instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was a disaster!","review":"After following the installation directions, the mouse would not respond and I could not override it with the keyboard, so my computer was frozen and completely down. The product is not identified on the box or manual but there is a support e-mail number listed on the box which I immediately wrote to from another computer, but I never received a reply. I was finally able to re-install my original mouse (you had to uninstall the mouse to install the wireless one) and get my computer going again. If Ihadn't been able to do this, I would have had to use my recovery CD and entirely re-install all the original programs and lose new programs and data. This was very scary time for me.

I would give it a 1 star but they did have a couple of woman Masons that had some what of an opinion.They mentioned Napoleon was a Mason but didn't give any background on him, I was waiting thoughout for that.

Takako Minekawa's music is quite often playful, but I don't think I'd call it shallow, by any means. There are some over-the-top sugar-coated songs in here catalog, but I'm pretty sure that's intentional. She also balances this stuff out with some very weird and glitchy songs, and some pretty dark material as well.I consider \\"Roomic Cube\\" to be a pretty solid release, and a pretty decent introduction to Takako in general. From there, I'd suggest picking up \\"Maxi-On,\\" which is my personal favorite. I think that her music is a lot deeper than these reviews are letting on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Money","review":"This album is entertaining for the first listen, but then becomes unbearably saccharrine.

Well, not so quick.Cited references from this volume might be the only (+) that I will credit to the piece. The organization of the book is extremely perplexing and weird. It is not very easy to find a reaction that I desire. In fact, the details for transformation are disappointingly little. If you plan to get this book with the same expectation, you should turn to Jerry March's Advanced Organic Chemistry or the Beilstein Cross-Fire Organic Reaction and Compounds software.

A few special effects look slightly dated today, but mostly it's aged well and is still very enjoyable and nostalgic. The superb music (by Tangerine Dream) is particularly memorable. Contrary to what others may have said, the series has never been released on DVD anywhere. Any DVDs advertised are unofficial, recorded from TV and will be transfers from VHS tape to DVD (not good quality), as the series has not been on TV for some years (since 2001).

Silly.There wasn't an interesting story during the entire run, just lots of flash; TV will never learn that if the story is good everything else will fall into place. Each episode was the same.

The author presents a view of southeast Asia as the cradle of civilization with the technology and culture of an Ice Age southeast Asian subcontinent spreading north and west at the time when the sea levels rose following the melting of the Ice Age glaciers. An interesting idea, but without real support of actual archaeological excavation on the part of Dr. Oppenheimer (a pediatrician). The author picks and chooses data from many sources to suit his theories. A questionable technique to say the least. The second half of the book reviews the legends and myths of various cultures concerning creation, floods, Cain & Able stories an so forth.

The Marines are still Marines and the real life nation-states are still represented (with a few modifications for flavor.)In fact, the Legacy Trilogy reads and feels just like the Heritage books.

Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. Has been more frustrating than anything and by the time I figured it out, it was outside the return policy... great idea, bad execution."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its Accurate","review":"Best thing about this themometer is that it is accurate. Set my chicken to 165 and it's perfectly done and juicy everytime with no red. Steaks at 135 and it's perfect. Biggest problem is that it takes a few minutes to get the two units in sync with each other. Its also difficult to tell if the probe unit is off. Recognizing if it is on is easy. Hold the button and it with flash red while the display unit will beep when the themometer is on. It's cumbersome to work with. Also it doesn't use a lot of battery power. Have used the unit for 8 months now and have only used on set of batteries."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hit or miss; great when it works","review":"It's true you get what you pay for. This thing rocked for the first 4 hours of a brisket smoke; it froze up on me after that. Couldn't get it working until I took the batteries out and put them back in. Happened again with smoking some chicken thighs a week later, and everything else I've used to cook it with. If I could, I would return it. It gets the 2 stars cause I know how to get it working again, and thus, I don't end up over cooking my food."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not too reliable.","review":"I have used this for one year. It is very difficult to get to broadcast to the remote. I keep thinking it is the batteries, so I replace them and the transmitter still cannot reach the receiver. Not a good investment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazingly poor design","review":"I'm beginning to lose faith in Amazon reviews as this thing has quite a few good ones, but I found it to be really badly designed. What do you do with a digital thermometer every time you use it? You turn it on. This thing has *microscopic* on/off buttons...on the back! And then there is the setup routine. I have to go find the printed instructions every time. Why not print the instructions right on both units? And not in 2pt font! Mine stopped taking the temperature after only four uses. It syncs up, shows the temp, and then sits there and the temp never changes. It is really clumsy as a replacement for the simple \\"pen\\" style ones for use in the kitchen. And the beep....oh, the beep. Why must things beep?! It wakes the neighbors. Unbelievable. If you buy one just remember: you only have 30 days to get a full refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken on arrival","review":"The thermometer was defective on arrival. I dutifully inserted the batteries as instructed and then tried to register or sync the thermometer with the monitor but it kept failing to register the temperature. The temperature kept reading \\"HHH\\" or \\"too hot to read.\\" I repeated the attempt multiple times but kept getting the same reading. According to the manual, this indicates that there is a \\"short\\" in the circuit and damage to the product.I promptly returned the product. It's a shame because the product sounds so good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete Piece of Garbage","review":"Takes several dozen tries to connect the transmitter to the receiver, and even then will only stay connected for a couple minutes or less. Right out of the box this product feels cheap, as if it isn't going to work, and then what do you know, it doesn't! This product deserves those three dreaded little letters: B.T.F.(built to fail!). Product receives one star because zero is not an option."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too cheap to keep","review":"I didn't expect much from this product, but it still disappointed. The main problem is poor design. Even though the specs say it has a 42\\" cord, it's really only 39.5\\". This means that the sending unit won't sit toward the back of a standard countertop. Since the unit is so light and cheaply made it won't stay put on the countertop.Operation is difficult at best. You have to turn the transmitter on and then press the TX button using a sharp pointed object. You can't really tell if the unit is on or off, except by watching for the light to blink. In other words, press the button and watch for the blink. To turn it off, press the button and wait for it not to blink.I'm returning this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works well but batteries are a pain to change","review":"This Thermometer combo works well, but has the flaw of needing a screwdriver to change the batteries. This is a pain in the butt when you are trying to keep track of something on the grill and the batteries need to be changed! It is an additional step that has left it laying dead in the drawer."},{"rating":"1","title":"D.O.A.","review":"Temperature reading was not accurate at all. Then for no reason the temperature display was reading several hundred degrees in a 70 degree room. The receiver side had a slide off battery compartment while on the transmitter side you had to remove four little micro screws to install the batteries, that was very inconvenient, looks like there engineering department needs to get on the same page.Will never buy this brand again."},{"rating":"1","title":"No stars","review":"This RediCheck was terrible and I ended up returning it. It worked for about 10 minutes and then failed to communicate with the sending unit at all.. Would beep work for about 2 sec, then nothing... I gave up on it and ordered a better product. All in all, I bought it for the price and ended up getting what I paid for I guess."},{"rating":"1","title":"gift gone bad","review":"Product was given as a gift but found out later that it did not work. The units did not communicate with each other.Waiting to receive a refund to the recipient so he could make another purchase of a similar item."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't be dumb like I am.","review":"You should know that if you put the thermometer in the oven, it gets hot.Don't cook some steak in the oven, then reach in when it's done to pull out the probe with your bare hands before removing the steak. That is dumb. Don't do that. You will burn yourself.Other than not being impervious to heat, works exactly as intended."},{"rating":"2","title":"This one's a keeper","review":"Used to have oregon scientific unit. It worked fine the first cuppla' times. Then it went down,turned on it would show 90 deg. put the probe into the freezer,down to 65deg. This new RediCheck is the best. The temp that it shows I believe is right on. I felt good enough to build a nice walnut case for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheap but does the job = value","review":"This unit feels cheap and is cheap. But it works!The plastic is crappy and feels brittle. The clips on the back feel like they will break in you hands.The features are basic ... perhaps too basic:There is no warning that you are out of range however it's range is sufficient to cover our house. When you exceed the range the temperature just stops going up requiring you to keep half an eye on it.There it no auto shut off so remember to turn it off after use.There really needs to be a case to store this in (keep the packaging and keep using in mind when you cut it free).I think the probe cable is better quality than some more expensive units as it has a braided steel housing.For the price I am happy with the product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Remote thermometer","review":"Works great. only 2 buttons.

It may be released later but niot as part of Martin's special. Luckily I held off ordering any of the cd'sI will attempt to contact Mike to see if that session will be released, only part was shown during the red, white and blues episode, there was more information in the interview after the initial show, I taped it and watched it, so I'll be waiting to see if that session is releaded."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong track listing!","review":"The track listing is wrong!

There is something seductive, nostalgic, and mesmerizing about Sex and a Girl and I remember when it ended feeling like I just had to see it again. So for years after that I searched for it on TV again, on line, in stores, but nothing. Then I was finally able to purchase it on Amazon and it is a comfort and joy to own it and watch it any time. The best things about this film are the costume and set designs, they give off the vibe of living in the '70s. The acting isn't cheesy and the storyline is actually intriguing. So, if you are lucky enough to happen upon this not well known flick I strongly suggest watching it and recommending it to others so that more and more people can have the pleasure of watching this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fooled.","review":"I was UNABLE to watch the copy I ordered here since there are around 20,000 SCRATCHES on it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Long Live Dark Shadows","review":"I loved Angelique.

I am hoping to return it. The photos come out with a greenish haze and are not very focused. I tried photos inside, outside and in my office and they all turned out the same. I also had difficulty installing the camera on my HP tower. I contacted Logitech support and it took 2 days for the first reply which was that i needed to call in from 7am to 5pm PST.

Sure, the camera can produce 1.3 mp images, but only by internally transforming 640x480 to 1280x960. lemme repeat this, this camera only takes 640x480 (350kpixel) pictures. I was not satisfied with the quality of the upsampled pictures. Also forget about using this indoors. The slow shutter speed and lack of a flash will make every picture a dark, blurry mess. On the good side, the Pocket Digital is truly slim and light, and easily rides in any pocket. The aluminum case protects the lens and electronics well. After deciding I didn't want to deal with the poor performance of this camera, I returned it and bought a Pocket digital 130."},{"rating":"1","title":"I want a refund","review":"What a waste of money. 1.3 megapixels, true -- the pictures come out at 1280x1024 resolution. quality however, so insanely bad, cant believe I spent $56 on this camera. $56 is a lot of money, this camera isnt even worth $10.

First of all it can fit in your pocket or even in your wallet. Second of all it has a sliding cover for the lense. It also has a sweet silver look. When you go to download pictures to your computer you only have to click and your pictures are downloaded. The product even charges while it is plugged into the usb port. The camera also comes with a cd of drivers and programs to make it possible to dwnload your pictures. Along with these good features are the bad ones.

As a direct result of the editing, the storyline lurches instead of flows from scene to scene. The plot makes very little sense and is extremely difficult to follow.

This book is full of subjective statements about facts, wrong or inexistent documentation in many of its assertions, and a clear bias in its writing. Paul Johnson tries to convince us that the History of the U.S. has been a difficult journey with a magical, divine end. Statements like 'for the first time in human history', 'the most important achievement of mankind', 'unknown in the rest of the world' abound.I was looking forward to finishing the book already after twenty pages.

This book manages to misspell Walter Raleigh's name and Pierpont Morgan's name in the table of contents, and more follows. Harper Collins really needs to proof the books that they scan and digitize, particularly since books like Johnson's cost more than most ebooks.

While definitely not the final word on everything, I adamently recommend this book for supplementary reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Balanced History","review":"At last, we have a balanced treatment of the history of the United States. Most histories available today are products of politically correct liberal historians who are more concerned with an ideological treatment than an impartial treatment. Johnson does not think that FDR and JFK are the greatest presidents that ever lived. The nitpickers love to point out the small factual errors that Johnson made. However, they fail to note that he captured the spirit of the American people.If you enjoy the editorials in The Wall Street Journal, you will love this history of the American people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Full of unuseful facts about history.","review":"Johnson's book is full of interesting but not really useful facts about elite people in American history. He blends the facts with information of the elite, such as George Washington. I found that Johnson's book left about the little people in the history of the U.S., the people he talked about the most were the elite and polictical powers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific but full of typos and inaccuracies","review":"Johnson's \\"Modern Times\\" was, in the opinion of Richard Nixon and plenty of other people worth listening to, the best nonfiction book of the Eighties. It sold an amazing 6 million copies.The rest of his books, while always interesting, aren't in that class, but then, what is?His History of the American People is lively and sweeping, with lots of fascinating idiosyncratic looks at entertainment and the arts. The problem is that the proofreading and fact-checking are shameful. Johnson is getting on in years, so he's making more minor mistakes. Since this book was a guaranteed best seller, the publisher should have hired some starving American History Ph.D. to read the manuscript and fix all the little faith-sapping things wrong with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"a good read","review":"Johnson's conservative treatise couldn't be more opposite to Zinn's...\\"A History of the American People.\\" Obviously, depending on what end of the political spectrum you are on, one book will appeal to you more. The one main difference between the two is that while Zinn is skeptical of everything and even admits to his hero's shortcomings...Johnson refuses to look at conservative leaders objectively and honestly...Regardless, Johnson's book is well written and covers some details Zinn misses -- it is a good, if opinionated, read (which makes it more fun!). I recommend reading Zinn and Johnson only for those well versed in history, able to know that Zinn and Johnson are writing through their own lenses, and can differentiate between fact and fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Narrative Synthesis of American History","review":"Paul Johnson seems to turn out one vast doorstop of a book after another, and few subjects in Western history escape his curiosity. This work is a warm, rich, easy-reading narrative of the United States from the early settlers to the present day. It is no secret that Johnson - like many British writers - is a religious man, and his faith makes him particularly insightful at describing the religiosity that is such a vital part of the American foundation. Johnson's interest in art and culture and his gift for the telling anecdote make this a book that should be read, not simply referred to."},{"rating":"2","title":"HAHAHA","review":"I spend my summer reading the book, and Paul's unrelenting effords to uncover the mystic journey of the Republic were fascinating and satisifying. Organized loosely into five chapters, the book flows smoothly with intertwining themes. It's not a \\"balanced\\" and rigid text book, but a fairytale full of fahterly advice about morality and justice. And Stories about artists, architecture, writers, businessmen, politicians, scientists weave together a most colorful and fun-to-look-at USA hall-of-fame. BUT: Criticisms for FDR and fondness towards Reagen, though entertaining, seemed like sections from British tabloids."},{"rating":"1","title":"bizarre reading of American history; badly researched.","review":"It is difficullt to swallow a purported \\"history\\" of the American people that extols the virtues of Harding, Coolidge and Nixon as first rate presidents at the same time as it castigates Franklin Delano Roosevelt as a \\"bad\\" president. It becomes more difficult when these and other outlandinsh revisonist concepts are offered in the context of a badly researched book. For one who attempts to write a history of the American people to confuse and combine the identities of Confederate Generals Albert Sidney Johnston and Joseph Johnston shows that the author just doesn't have a real grasp of his subject. This is one of several factual errors that are annoying to the knowledgeable reader, an annoyance that is compounded when the book moves into the 20th century and presents a point of view that just doesn't make sense.This book is bad history."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Over-simplification of History","review":"One must give some credit to Johnson for his ambitious attempt to narrate American History in one book. That said, the result is a frighteningly simplistic, depth-free \\"listing\\" of events. Worse, where he tries his pen at explanations of important moments in US history (particularly recent history), his point of view seems to come from Mars instead of London.Johnson displays an amazing lack of understanding of American politics and law. He chides American leaders and policy makers for their naivete, and he almost chuckles \\"I told you so\\" at America's international \\"failures\\" (as defined by himself) -- all attitudes that one associates with pre-WWII England, before the American rescue of the British way of life.A project of this magnitude would be vastly better if written dispassionately and without sly commentary. His slant of history makes the read much less enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Writing","review":"Yes, it is full of opinions but you can't deny that this is great writing. It is Paul Johnson at his most even paced and readable. Unfortunately, the post civil war through the present gets shorted and he does spend an inordinate amount of time with the U.S. presidents. No matter - I soaked up every page."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't get too close...............","review":"Don't get too close to the present with this book! I found the first half very engaging and thought-provoking. I didn't disagree with any of his interpretations until we got into the 20th century and oh my gosh! Warren G. Harding was a fine president? FDR was a Commie who ruined America? Nixon didn't know about Watergate? I can't imagine (because I stopped reading) that Reagan would be anything less than a combination of Jesus, Charlemagne and Sister Theresa, and anybody who opposed Reaganomics must be clones of Charles Manson. Mr. Johnson seems to be able to carefully weigh and consider evidence from long ago, but when he gets towards modern times, he becomes a Rush Limbaugh-sputtering and spitting clown. But read up until the 20th century and you'll be rewarded. And as a high school U.S. History teacher, I might even assign some of the later chapters to illustrate how bizarre some thinking has gotten in this age of Political Extremism and Quackery."},{"rating":"1","title":"A History of the American People","review":"The first 700 pages of this history are great! Unfortunately the last 300 pages reveal the author's biases!

Does anyone wonder why GWB would award Paul Johnson the PMH, especially since GHWB was denigrated so thoroughly?"},{"rating":"1","title":"He knows what he's talking about, but........","review":"I found this book to be informative but extremley boring. It's not very well written, and the theme shifts very rapidly and quite often. While the book does go in chronological order, the sub-topics jump around a lot and it makes the whole book rather confusing. For example, on one page he'll be talking about Benjamin Franklin's relations to the west, and on the next page he'll be discussing the Indians and what crops they grew. There's no real order to it all....the information is there, it just isn't well written. This book was VERY VERY hard to read. While I did learn a lot from it, it was an unpleasurable experience and I would not reccomend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing trying to be elegant history book ~","review":"Confusing confusing! may be is not the author's fault.

After reading reviews complaining that it was too liberal, I decided to have a look at Johnson's book for a different perspective. I have been surprised and saddened by Johnson's tone. Unfortunately his book is not written from a scholarly perspective of investigating the complexity of American history with the purpose of illuminating the truth. All history is biased to some extent, but the language used by Johnson is beyond persuasive- its arrogant. I was hoping to find a reasonable presentation of a conservative perspective of historical events, but this book is written with such narrow mindedness that it reads more like an extended diatribe. I find it sad that talented historians sabotage their works with such strongly divisive motives."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost track along the way","review":"When I first started reading this book I thought I would stand the fact that is was too long. It was well informed, interesting and at times entertaining. My feeling was that I would rate it with at least 4 stars. Somewhere along the way I think Johnson lost track of his argument. He started covering too much material with no structure and stating very personal points of view as facts. When I got to the Great Depression I decided to quit. I realized there were more better informed books out there and that I was wasting my time.

Mr. Johnson's obvious prejudices obscured any accuracies that the text might contain, and renders the book to the \\"feel good about your political bent\\" reading list, and not of much value for any true student of history. Don't get me wrong, I am a registered Republican, and this is not a rant against conservatism, but the tone and FDR/Kennedy bashing in this book is offensive and hardly what I consider the work of intellectual objectivity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written,rife with conservative cliches","review":"As a recently immigrated European and now American Citizen,I have become fascinated by the history of this wonderful country Paul Johnson does not write well,analyses poorly and is very fragmentary and unorganized in his text(It is as if he has pasted several small pieces of prose together,each covering a subject,person or worse an opinion.) His analysis of complex historical epochs is far from intellectual and he likes platitudes.The errors are very bothersome also suggesting sloppy work.This book is not recommended A very boring read and a disgrace.America is great but Paul Johnson is not able to tell us why"},{"rating":"2","title":"review for purchase of A History of the American People","review":"It would've been nice to know what edition this was but it wasn't particularly important this time.

I almost tripped over my jaw (which was on the floor) as I made my way downstairs to write this. Not once in the 4 or 5 pages devoted to Nixon and Watergate (a witchhunt, in Johnson's delueded opinion) is any mention made of wrongdoing on Nixon's part. No mention, for instance, is made of Nixon's attempt to obstruct justice by attempting to have the CIA stop the FBI's work on the break-in. I don't know what this says about the objectivity of the earlier chapters, some of which I have read and enjoyed. Not being a great student of American history, I have nothing with which to their objectivity. But this Nixon debacle does not offer me any encourgagement.(1 star rating based entirely on the Nixon stuff)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Book","review":"Paul Johnson presents this text with an academic yet readable approach to the subject matter.

It deals with all aspects of our history, from the high points to the low points of our past. It is both opinionated and intellectually honest. Mr. Johnson admits that he opinionated at the very beginning. His views are not fashionable but he does not try to make it fashionable."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fantastic read!!","review":"After reading some of the previous reviews I was a bit skeptical about the book but ordered it anyway - and boy am I glad I did. What a fantastic story. Johnson writes history that is both readable and entertaining. While there are some factual errors this does not deter from the books greatness.

Both books are also much larger than what I've just written, they're new, dark, and deeply truthful perspectives on Japanese society in general.'Gold Rush' (like 'Out') is also an incredibly good read.

I had to put a piece of rubber to keep a distance between the fan and the laptop.The fans are extremely noisy and really annoyed the hell out of my roommate who wanted to throw the cooler out the window. And as loud as they were, it did NOTHING to cool off my laptop.My laptop actually shut off several times from the heat while the fan was actually running.Plus, after a month or so of keeping with this garbage, the UBS line started to die to the point that the fans only worked when I played around with the wires.

I was very happy to see that a newer model had come out, and at a cheaper price even, but BOY, did that lower price come at a cost! No more 4-port USB hub, no more aluminum cooling plate, no more nice reclining footies or flip-out footies to help machine get more ventilation. If I had got it myself, I'd have sent it back immediately as a misrepresentation, but unfortunately I had someone bring it to Mexico for me since I couldn't come to the USA to get it myself.

It's not as good as some of the $35-50 versions but you get what you pay for. The 3 fans do a decent job of moving air around under the laptop and keep things pretty cool. There are also feet on the pad which help keep the laptop raised a little to increase air intake. The unit is VERY quiet, but even with 3 fans it doesn't move a huge amount of air. On the downside the plastic over the fans is thin and if the laptop is misplaced you'll heard a buzz (as the plastic hits the fan) or sometimes the fan will just stop. Unlike the photos the unit I got has 3 VERY bright blue LCD lights in the front that get annoying. I covered them with some electrical tape."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bum Fans","review":"lasted about a week and then the fans started making noises.

It seemed to do the job although the plastic surface was too slippery. It had pads on the top to supposedly stop the laptop from slipping off the cooler. They weren't very effective. I ended up cutting up several pieces of sponge to prevent the computer from doing that. Also the power cord that attaches to the computer had a tendency to disconnect. No big deal though. I bought a later model which I disliked intensly for one reason. The bottom of the later model is not covered rendering it very uncomfortable in my lap. The edges of the exposed bottom of the cooling pad dig into my legs.

With the desk cooling fans, one side was slightly warm and the other completely cool.The Kinamax works a little and does keep my laptop fans from turning on as much but knowing what's possible I can't say this is a product I will keep. Probably will return it. The fan isn't loud but it's more noticeable than the other.Update 2/6/12 - This thing just keeps running louder and louder.

A few minutes of troubleshooting and I found that the grills on the fans were put on backwards which put pressure on the fans, which kept them from being able to spin. Once I flipped them, it worked.The other really bad thing about the design is that it completely takes the \\"laptop\\" out of \\"laptop computer\\".

It's made of light plastic, kinda cheaply made, so I'll have to see how well it holds up. It's true that it has a lip on the front which would interfere with some front loading disk drives and such, and it does also have a very short usb cord coming from the back of the unit. For a MacBook, tho, there's no problem. The front lip holds the computer well and the disk slot and release button for the screen are easily clear of interference.

There is NO reason this cord shouldn't be permanently connected and internally wired at the one side, and only need to plug into the computer with the USB end. Mine stopped working and I had to take it apart and solder the wires together inside the unit myself in order to make it work.I'd pass on this unit and look for one that is hard wired so you don't have to worry about the connection.

I didn't really have great expectations of this cooler, but bought it...extremely cheap plastic, what sounded to me like underpowered fan motors and probably the only redeeming feature it had to it per cooling, was that it raised the bottom of your notebook at an angle.I would definitely NOT recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT at all silent..very poor assembly","review":"the fans are not fitted tightly and properly(i.e. not parallel to the base and top) as they make very irritating noise even when the laptop is not mounted and even at the slightest tilt or movement....The noise is not something that we can ignore....it is very irritating...Also the quality of plastic used for fan guard should have been more strong.....Though I have reported the problem to the seller and I got a refund i guess it is not worth trying as the seller himself told me that he found the same problems with new pieces in his store.IF these problems are fixed then it may be worth the money....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good while it lasts","review":"This item pushes A LOT of air and really keeps your laptop cool; however my fan died in about six months after purchasing, and when I contacted the company, they were a load of bull. They said I was responsible for the shipping to their factory, then if they didn't find anything wrong with it, I had to pay a restocking fee for them to ship me a new one.

As of this morning, I threw it into the recycle bin within 3 months of purchase. I would say that I should have brought those \\"made in china\\" laptop cooler as it's cheaper and more reliable.The main problem with the product is that the cooling fan fails to spin when I plug it into my USB port and will only work after a lot of twitching of the USB connector. Apparently, it's due to some defective design that cause this problem to happen. And it didn't just happen to me. Another colleague of mine who have brought the same product has the same problem as well.So far, I have tried to communicate with the manufacturer and as of yesterday, I didn't receive any respond from them.So to all prospective customers, I won't recommend this product as you can get cheaper and more reliable stuff out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"cheap plastic fan to cool your laptop.","review":"just as the above suggests. cheap plastic. if your laptop is heavy, the thing might bend on you and if you drop it from a mere height of a foot, you might break or crack it. it takes up your valuable usb port and isn't all the quiet, esp if you dropped it or it's bent or it's on an angle which makes the fan all sound it's grinding. yeah... i ended up swapping the one i had at work which they provided with the one i bought for myself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well it's still running...","review":"I can't say much about this thing, essentially it's a large - empty and light housing for two computer fans.

However that aside after breaking it, saudering it and gluing it back together, the fact that it still works amazes me. So it's a very reliable product nearest I can tell, but it's got a very low quality standard. Still it keeps my lappy cool when I'm gaming so I can't really complain. Though I would recommend you find one with 3 to 4 fans, two just ain't enough for a desktop replacement. Oh and it's hard as hell to clean dust from if you aren't willing to take it apart.

I believe that the laptop weight (5.4lbs) was too much for the laptop cooler.

No Longer sound like Jet Engine!","review":"My slightly older Sony Vaio always sounded like an Airline Terminal. The loud fan inside ate power and stuggled to cool the older Pentium 4 processor. I finally realized that the noise was caused by a fan which was sitting directly on top of the table, with no air to get inside. Raising the notebook to get access to air did not help. Then I found this Vantec LapCool3 on Amazon, it quickly arrived from TigerDirect, and now the machine is always quiet and runs faster. I think this elegant USB devise is saving the life of my Vaio. The notebook is a little bigger than the LapCool, so it's Maybe more wobbly on top of it, and the notepook is higher on the table, but these are not important gripes compared to the silence that we now have without my Vaio sounding like a jet engine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Pad and Price... BUT","review":"This is a great cooling pad, but the plug to the base is too loose. I have to jiggle mine around to get it to turn on, and then I can't touch it.

Because I didn't feel like returning it and having to wait for Amazon to process a return or exchange, I decided to just glue it back on... Which worked for about 2 minutes, at which point it fell the hell back off. And on top of it falling apart, the fan is open on the bottom(not eclosed).

Backhaus rewards his listeners with a mature, even autumnal artistic sensibility which suffers no corresponding lack of youthful vibrancy. I would describe these as authoritative performances. Nice sound, too.Incidentally, in my set, Disc 1 is mislabeled Disc 2, and vice-versa.

It leaves anything difficult to pick up, i.e. staples, sand, ice melt salt, etc. behind to be picked up by hand. It also takes several passes to pick anything that other vacuums(cheaper vacuums), in my experience, will pick up easily. I'm not sure what most of the folks leaving 5 star reviews are looking for in a vac, but they must be masochistic to like this hunk of junk.

The cord has a big end on it so it requires a good size hole but comes with a rubber cork that is on the wire to plug up the hole preety good. The other issue I have is how it locks or tightens and loosens. The handle can go past the fulltighten spot to fully loosen again if over tightened. It doesn't cause an issue if you over thighten but just makes you retighten it again.

It has been fitted to my boat and been out on 3 trips so far. The bracket allows you to lower the antenna when you don't need it which is handy, especially if you store your boat in the garage. Reception seems clear so far. My only complaint would be that while the fitting on the end of the antenna that connects to your marine radio is excellent it is quite large (approx 3/4\\") and is molded so you would have to cut into it to separate from the coaxial cable. Therefore if you need to pass the antenna through the side of the boat to route the line you will need to make a larger hole than you may really want to (coaxial cable is on 1/4\\" diameter). I was lucky in that I already had an outlet that I could use. If I hadn't I guess I would have cut the fitting off and bought an after market one - although that would have been ashamed.

The book fills in a lot of the gaps left by the certification books, so it makes a good companion to them. This book and Toby and Anthony Velte's Beginning Cisco guide are two of the best MIS books I've seen, especially for readability, as the Cisco-written certification books, although they have the best coverage of the topics needed for certification, still, I have to admit are pretty dull. As one person said, they all sound like they were written by the same person--such as Joe Friday from Dragnet. Shaughnessy and the Velte's should have been subcontracted to edit them or rewrite them--they could have livened things up quite a bit. In fact, the writing is about as lively as Cisco's stock has been lately. Anyway, this and Velte's book are very worthwhile adding to your library. These will be books you actually read instead of them just sitting on the shelf looking impressive."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you can buy only one book about Cisco...","review":"This is the first time I ever write a review for any book. You are lucky if this is your first Cisco book. I have been looking for book like this two years ago when I started studying for computer networking and MCSE. I just started starting Cisco for CCNA a month ago, and this is a just in time for me to have this book. If you have this book, you have a good start to be CCNA or CCIE. Remember this, you don't have to be CNE or MCSE or whatever Certification before getting Cisco Certification.If you can buy only one book about Cisco, let this be the one. This book is for serious beginners."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful and extremely informative","review":"This is the book I have been looking for. It is not a CCNA test prep. It IS a concise and informative reference into routing and transmission protocols. It covers everything you need to know to understand the way routers and the internet actually work. I found the book easy to read and very concise in the material covered. If you are looking to learn about the internet and how routers and routing works, then this book is a great start."},{"rating":"2","title":"A well-written, thorough book.","review":"This book is a great resource for covering the basics of all aspects of WANs.

I would NOT recommend this as a study guide for the CCNA test but as a beginning point for the test.

I plugged it in and turned on the radio - sounded good and got good reception, even of hard-to-get stations. Put in a CD - could not read three out of four discs. I popped in a tape - noticeable deterioration of sound quality. Ah well. I put on a record - sound quality plummeted! At that point it sounded like distant music broadcast from a tin can.

Myself an three of my friends have receive this as a gift, and it is not a good one. Unless you plug it in via the headphone jack to a good stereo or computer speakers, the sound for the record player is awful. No bass, tinny sound. The turntable is automatic, meaning it picks up at the \\"end\\" of a record and brings the stylus back \\"home\\", but it picks it up before all of my 7\\" (45) records are done playing. It has a cheap needle that literally skips around the record- it leaves little marks on the vinyl and makes listening to records a chore and unenjoyable.This might be okay for someone who just wants to take a trip down memory lane with some of their old vinyl, but it is not a good purchase for someone who wants to listen to new records which have good sound quality.Thanks for nothing, Emerson."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice stereo system","review":"I love it!

So I don't give much regard for reviews that complain about the sound quality. However, for our unit, the turntable belt broke after just a couple of uses. I measured the belt length to be 21.5 inches- couldn't find one on Amazon. If your belt breaks consider what it will cost you for shipping and service if you have to send it in. I would expect a product for this price should last at least 5 years of moderate use. This one didn't last for more than 2 records.Update: With some effort I replaced the turntable belt.

Characters are irrational to the point of seeming to be bi-polar.3. Drop all of the gratuitous \\"F\\" and \\"S\\" words and loose 5-10% of the book.4. Too many pointless and inappropriate discussions of the virtues/evils of conservatives and liberals. I was expecting an entertaining survival tale, not fifty repetitions of the author's political philosophy."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time and money.","review":"This book is poorly researched, poorly written and completely unbelieveable.

Within 24 hours from the time his wife and children's blood began to coagulate on the bedroom floor he was in orgasmic bliss with a prostitute who politely declined his kiss as to not offend him with her foul breath resulting from her last customer. Gee, what a guy, what a gal, what a story. Believe me it gets much worse. If you are considering purchasing this book, save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fictional tale that seems too real.","review":"At first I was hesitant about reading a \\"fictional tale\\" however, the story line was compelling enough for me to check it out. As I read the story, I almost felt as though I was reading the author's view of what the future holds for us. Though scary, I don't think he was too far off.

I immediately bought all six novels (despite the unleavened presence of Miss Mapp in one of them). That was fourteen years ago. My copies of these works are now dog-earred, and I'm surprised the ink hasn't faded from excessive eye contact. Elizabeth Mapp embodies the perfect villain, and reading Lucia's triumphs over her is a balm to the soul. The characters of Benson's supporting cast become just as real and vivid as do his leads. One wishes to transport to Tilling of the 20's and 30's and participate in the machinations of the two ladies. I even learned to play bridge to enrich my apprehension of the texture of these novels. Read one! You'll soon be hooked."},{"rating":"2","title":"another devoted fan","review":"Queen Lucia, like the other books in the series, is sardonic, eloquent, and bawdy. It's wonderful read.

Of course, the novels friendships are accompanied by bushels of backbiting, gallons of gossip and mountains of malice -- all with a lighthearted, humorous and loving touch. Does that sound unlikely? Just try one of these series and see how successfully Benson plies his wit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Queen Lucia","review":"I enjoy the British writing style as well as Benson's humor. Those who enjoyed the Mapp and Lucia tv series will also enjoy Queen Lucia."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well, maybe 2 1/2...","review":"I found Mr. Benson's silly little novel, Queen Lucia, not to my taste or liking. I started feeling guilty about half way and became convinced my brain was headed into sugar shock. True cerebral cortex cotton candy. I know, I know.....it's a comedy of manners involving upper middle class small town England. And although I found it charmingly humorous at times--those were, I'm afraid, few and far between. Of course, maybe that's because I grew up in a town similar to the one depicted (on this side of the Atlantic) and, therefore, found myself rolling my eyes at many of the absurdities detailed in the book. Will I read another? Most doubtful. There are far too many ways I would prefer to spend my time--whether reading or whatever.I'm glad so many people seemed to enjoy this book. My hopes were fairly high. However, I find the comparison of this book/series to Jane Austen most vexing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful, no redeeming interest whatsoever","review":"eBook downloaded free from Gutenberg. Emmeline Lucas aka La Lucia rules the social life of her small English town and exemplifies, in her own mind at least, a cultural ideal.What a perfectly horrible story.

Troma took a bizarre but interesting idea and transformed in into 4 hrs (feels like it) of tape which was more interesting when it was blank. The same dumb, predictable, overused 'gags' that you've seen too many times elsewhere are poorly repeated. There is an attempt at characterization but it never gets past 1.5 dimensions - not flat but damn close. Special effects are minimalistic at best.

By the way, I did some extensive research myself and spent the extra money on something a little better that average, the only reason to buy this machine is the power head and it is critically flawed.

It cleaned well when it worked. Here are my problems:1. The canister easily overturns when trying to move around corners. It needs two swivel wheels or needs to be balanced better.2. After a few months of use, the carpet attachment started to squeak from what sounded like the wheels. Annoying for a product that is only a few months old.3. A few months later, only 6 short months after the unit was purchased, the carpet attachment quit. The brush won't turn because it is rubbing plastic on plastic. It is poorly constructed. It smells like burnt rubber when I try to use the carpet attachment. You will notice that the canister is made in Sweden but the wand and floor/carpet attachments are made in China. They should have spent a few more dollars and had the entire thing made in Sweden."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"At first we were very happy: the suction on the vac is very strong, the roller also very effective, and the hepa filtration seemed to be working perfectly. Within a week or two the wheels on the powernozzle began to squeak. And now, just a little under two months(!) after we bought it, the roller brush is not working at all. Because the design of the roller is to have plastic end pins inserted in and spinning in a plastic holder, they wear, get hot and melt. What a teribble design. Maybe the better metal roller on the more expensive Eurekas work better, but this one seems to be fatally flawed. Not recommended except, perhaps, if you have little or no rugs and carpet to do. But why pay for such an expensive powernozzle then?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Flawed Engineering!","review":"The design of the beater brush system on this machine suffers from a fundamentally flawed design. The beater brush bearing surface is felt on plastic. The drive belt applies a significant lateral load on the beater brush. Inevitably, the plastic on the housing gets hot and melts. In some instances this is likely to result in fire if you have hair or lint in your carpets."},{"rating":"1","title":"Designed for short life","review":"A great vacuum at first, but I've encountered the same problems as others have. Wheels have become very squeaky, terrible rubber or plastic smell, picks up little. I'd like to check the brush roll belt, but the user manual is deficient and sort of punts, saying that for some models you remove 4 screws from the bottom side, then turn the unit over (sic?). I see only 2 screws, and they're not flathead or philips or allen. Apparently designed to discourage customers from fixing, more money for Eureka technicians. Talk about planned obsolescence, this one takes the cake.

First off it tips very easily. One tug on the hose and it flips over on it's back like a dead beetle.Secondly, the power brush isn't powerful enough to spin. Never mind the hi/medium/low pile carpet settings. I use it on low pile commercial grade loop carpet and the spinner barely spins when set on high. If it is set on medium or low the spinner doesnt spin at all and the air smells with the foul smell of burning rubber.Eureka used to be known as a high quality vacuum, or so I thought.

All of South Korea is represented and highlights the various interets in the country. I am surprised that while roads and highways are represented on the map they are NOT labled. Furthermore I am equally surprised that an extremely poor map of Seoul is given with very little detail. The roads in Korea can be confusing and with no labels you are being set up for failure if you try and drive here. No subway map is given and what a shame as Seoul has a great subway system but many of the maps in the subway stations are in korean. You would be better off printing a map off the internet than wasting your time with this map.

The strength of Douglas is in creating interesting, albeit rather predictable, characters. However, Garroway (the protagonist) holds few, if any, suprises, and while being somewhat likable, is rather two-dimensional. I was disappointed that the author doesn't develop relationships to any great degree, with most characters being little more than ships passing in the night.Both \\"Star Corps\\" and \\"Battlespace\\" revolve to a greater or lesser extent around the mythical \\"Hunters of the Dawn\\" - a race that thrives by dispatching up-and-coming species. It is against this backdrop that \\"Battlespace\\" takes place - and it is because of this backdrop that the ease with which the marines dispatch the Xul ends this book in a most unfulfilling way.

The evolution from no profanity to profound profanity (Murphy) has in some cases made comedy funnier and better. However, this entertainer simply isn't funny. Now, I know comedy, like music, is a personal taste. What I find funny others won't. Music I like. . .others won't. But, go back and watch Richard Pryor or Eddie Murphy and when you have tears rolling down your face from laughing so hard you can't breathe, you realize how little talent is displayed here.

If you are someone who has written off electronic music as 'soulless', peep this album right here. Juan Atkins along with Derrick May, Carl Craig, and those zany Germans Mouse on Mars are part of a handful of techno artists who make music that really communicates something 'human'(?) to the listener. That is the genius of their music and why so much other electronic muzak is just a soundtrack to an automaton's nightclub/cafe d-elevator ride to oblivion.

Our granddaughter is just a year old however she loves this set. She's definitely not the doll type and I was hoping this would appeal to her, and it does. It takes quite the beating, however, it's holding up beautifully. I'm thinking of buying additional block sets to add to this.I definitely would recommend this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleased beyond...","review":"We have four kids. And we bought it for our youngest when he turned 2 (now 7) to this day all four kids play with them (ages 12-11-9-7). I have to admit that we had to go out and buy 3 bags extra of the blocks. Not because they got lost or broke but because the kids needed more for their imagination creations. They are easy to find and put away. They are big enough that when you make something the kids can then play with it. We haven't used the wagon for years and now have 2 totes full of the blocks. Any blocks you buy your kids should be big like these. I think that is why they continue to play with them. We have bought some for our neices and nephews who always go straight for the totes when they come here. And once again I am here to get another for my nieces 1 yr birthday present. This is MONEY WELL SPENT..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great toy","review":"My son got this for his first birthday. He enjoys banging the blocks together. While he is still too young to really build with the blocks, he likes to take apart what his dad and I build for him. The blocks are colorful and hold his interest longer than a lot of other toys."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great idea","review":"We bought the wagon for my son when he was one years old. It was a great place to store the bocks then when summer came the wagon went outside and my kids love it. They use it in the sand box and to pull there dolls and move there toys. Its a perfect wagon for young kids and you get mega block too, which I totally love. It's worth every penny."},{"rating":"2","title":"mega fun!!!!!!","review":"this was a gift for my son last christmas and he loves it. he still plays with it to this day. he tries to build things it great for a childs develpment."},{"rating":"1","title":"My 2 year old never played with bloks & wagon tips backward","review":"The only thing my daughter wanted to do with this toy was be pulled around in the wagon. Invariably she ended up getting flipped over backward. The wagon isn't designed to tow children their heads are too heavy & cause it to flip over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea bad execution","review":"I had been watching this toy for a long time hoping it might go on sale, but when we were going to the beach I decided to get it. My kids love the full size wagon and they loved the idea of having a little one they could play with inside. The main problem I have is the all the wheels don't turn, maybe mine was defective, but it makes it difficult to pull. The weight of the wagon is so light also that it easily lifts off the ground making it harder to pull. Maybe I just got a bad one, but with so much to do did not have time to return it. It sits in the corner, the kids don't even use it as they have learned it is simply a source of frustration."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of our most-used toys","review":"I chose this toy because it felt like a twofer: wagon and construction. I was not disappointed.This wagon may as well have been surgically attached to our daughter from 9-11 months. She used it as a push toy as she was working up the courage to let go and walk on her own.Now that she is 1, she uses it much more for building. Mega Bloks are much easier to build with than Legos (even Quattros) because they fit together more loosely. The handle has pegs to you can begin building on top of it -- she loves that feature.Note that the wagon is the pefect size for a tot to climb in it -- not the safest thing but they will learn the consequences on their own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for toddlers","review":"I bought this toy for my daughter's 1st birthday...altho the she didn't play with it miuch the first 6-8 months...she now plays with the blocks all the time. The only thing that I don't like is that my daughter will empty the wagon out and then try to get in the wagon...which then falls over with her in it. But that's a 2 year old for ya :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Grandaughter LOVED IT!","review":"Our grandaughter received this for her 2nd BIRTHDAY. She was so thrilled with it she wanted to take all the blocks to bed with her! Our daughter was surprised what a good size it is. We had no idea as you cannot tell from a pc pic. All I can say is that we are very happy that the MEGA BLOCK WAGON made such a hit with our grandaughter!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally...","review":"This offering by Travis takes the very best of what \\"Brit-pop\\" has had to offer North American audiences in recent years and elevates its best elements to an entirely new level. There will be inevitable comparisons to Radiohead, some warranted, but what Travis offers is a delightfully accessible collection of raw, melodic truth. THE MAN WHO achieves the improbable balance of a soothing, hard hitting album, completely honest while utterly accessible. Oasis' feuds and Radiohead's concepts have garnered music headlines in America in recent years, but Travis has pronounced their arrival with marvellous, subtle craftsmanship, and these gems are more than worthy of the huge audiences they're about to receive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Fine Brit Pop Album.","review":"Travis is by far one the best U.K. Bands, yet they are still ignored by American listeners.. The Man Who has been on the top of U.K. music scence by the strenght of its first five singles.. In fact, it has been sold for 3,000,000 copies in U.K alone.. Travis also win two Brit Awards for this album.. Most of you might say, Who care? Well, folks! Good music is hard to find now a day. I bet that you can not find any similar music on U.S. radio station. They are playing those boysbands, pop princesses, second rated hip-hop, and tireless number of grunges. I think U.S. Radio should consider putting Travis singles on their rotation. Anyway, I hope that Travis would climb up the Billboard chart.. If they are not in top ten, I will move across the pond.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perhaps the Album of 1999","review":"On their first album all they wanted to do is rock - now Travis are a lot more sedate, perhaps melancholy, and certainly better for it. This album was released for months before slowly climbing to the top of the UK charts and staying there - a sign that its success was achieved by the quality of the songs rather than aggressive marketing.Songs such as \\"Driftwood\\" and \\"Why does it always rain on me?\\" are songs that you just can't forget, and are set to become classics, and the rest of the album shows that these were no flukes. Without a doubt 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Man Who Review - Brilliant album","review":"One of the best albums of the 90's it compete's with Oasis, Stereophonics, Blur, The Verve. There are no fill in songs all brilliant, with Driftwood, Turn and Why does it always rain on me? as the stand out songs. But as I said they are all good songs. You won't be dissapointed and if your in to the Brit Pop/Indie scene you will enjoy this a lot. Even if your not still buy it. amazing."},{"rating":"1","title":"The soundtrack for Dawson's Creek","review":"OK....I am a big Radiohead fan, so when I heard the comparisons I picked this one up. THESE GUYS ARE NOT RADIOHEAD. Not even close. The only similarity is the singer's voices....and the fact that almost every track on The Man Who sounds like a softer variation of \\"Paranoid Android\\" or \\"No Surprises\\". Further, almost every track on here sounds like the one before it, the only one that stood out was \\"Writing to Reach You.\\" This album caters to a teen audience...the whole thing can easily provide the soundtrack to Dawson's Creek. I can just see Dawson giving Joey that last meaningful look before breaking with her, while \\"Slide Show\\" plays softly in the background. C'mon. Radiohead? NO. And Oasis would kick these guys around and use them for wallpaper. This album is more like the Beatles Anthology CDs...lots of short sweet little tunes thought up by their creators in a matter of minutes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cry me a river...","review":"Don't get me wrong, this record has some good songs on it, at and times can be very enjoyable, but come on, how much contrived emotion can you cram into a album. \\"writing to reach you\\" is good and I like \\"driftwood\\" but songs like \\"why does it always rain on me\\" are just palthetic. The sound is stale and the lead singer is putting on such a fake, tortured \\"whoa is me\\" facade that it seems like he is going to burst into tears at every minute. And i can see some comparisons to radiohead, but if you think that the emotion present in this CD can match a good radiohead song like \\"high and dry\\" then you are sorely mistaken.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Tip.....","review":"A line which perhaps sums up this album: \\"I can see the tunnel at the end of all these lights.....\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Thom Yorke? Try David Gates from Bread! Still a great CD","review":"It's amusing to read all those reviews about how much Travis' lead singer sounds like Thom Yorke of Radiohead. If we want to get that picky, we could say both of them rip off David Gates' vocal style. Listen to 'Everything I Own' or 'Sweet Surrender' and you'll see. That aside, 'The Man Who' is a great CD, including the bonus tracks. It's hard to resist to the pop appeal of 'Writing to Reach You', 'Driftwood' or 'Why Does It Always Rain on Me?\\" It's easy listening with a kick, not the lifeless, soulless dreck you hear on the 'lite rock' stations. Fans of Radiohead, Bread (yes, Bread) or Belle and Sebastian should like this CD. One of the best pop releases of '00 so far."},{"rating":"2","title":"great Scottish group","review":"I must admit, i have not listened to the whole album...just 3 or 4 tracks..but that was enough to prove to me that Travis are gonna be huge! I know they've sold millions in the Uk, but here in australia they are just beginning to play \\"why does it always rain on me?\\". This is the most reflective and philosophical song i've heard in a while. Its truly fantastic that even my dad's singing it! The other tracks i've heard are amazing. Check out their version of Britney's \\"baby one more time\\". Its hilarious."},{"rating":"1","title":"looked good on paper...","review":"i bought this because it sounded like it would be great - however, on listening, i was amazed at how bland it sounded. everything about this record is just 'ok', as in C or C+. it's like belle and sebastian - without the irony. it's like the housemartins - with no edginess. it's like radiohead - without the depth.i think that travis are kind of a 'light' version of all their influences that might be perfect for for the 11-17 year old audience who are still impressed by cute blue-eyed men, or as a stepping stone away from boy groups and girl groups up to the next level of pop music.they have some talent in the song writing and playing department and they may actually produce some good music in the future. unfortunately, this just isn't it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely overhyped and full of boring filler","review":"Like so many people I liked their hits Turn and Why Does It ALways Rain On Me?, so I expected a pretty good CD. I was to be seriously disappionted. The songs on here are generally slow and plodding, and an attempt at infusing passion which just doesn't work. The Fear has to be the gloomiest song I've ever heard although Luv comes close. Worse, they're incredibly derivative. When I realised that As You Are borrows the tune of She's Electric by Oasis I thought they were taking the mickey, and the way they think the lyrics of Slide Show, nodding to Beck, Oasis and the Manic Steet Preachers, are very clever, but in reality they are naff. I'm sure there's more I haven't noticed, and when people say the songs sound like you've heard them before, it's because you have. A million times. What a waste of money,"},{"rating":"1","title":"The man who thinks this album's overated","review":"How on earth is this still in the top 10 in Britain after a year of its release. I brought this after hearing why does it always rain on me which i quite liked but even that got boring after a while. The only good tracks i have to say are Turn, Slide Show and blue flashing light(the secret track). But other than that the albums not up to standerds. If the public could bands like Muse and Coldplay then the man who whould be nowhere. Frans whiney voice does not help either.Take my advice dont follow what the charts say. If you want some great indie bands then take Muses Showbiz, Embraces Drawn from memory and Coldplays parachutes but dont waste your money on an album with 3 good songs on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Bad...for a Radiohead Tribute","review":"What's all the blather about?Is it listenable? Sure. Catchy even? You betcha. Demonstrates nose for songcraft? Uhhuh. Swipes it all from Radiohead? Cha-ching!Greatest form of flattery, my foot. This thing is planet of the apes, all the way. Granted, they're not as clueless as Bush. But, ...masterpiece? Best record of the year? Come now! To your senses all.The lyrics are on the Jewel side of stupid; the melodies on the Squeeze side of novel.I just don't get it.

Not recommended for hard rockers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good...But not Coldplay","review":"I bought this CD because I LOVE Coldplay and Travis has been compared to Coldplay in reviews. Well...in short, they're definitely NOT Coldplay, but they're still nice to listen to. I would compare them more with U2 or Sting. Either way, an enjoyable listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lyrical and Wonderful","review":"This is beguiling music at its best. Travis are currently one of the hottest bands in the UK. They write melodic music that grabs you from the outset. You will be humming \\"Why Does it Always Rain on Me?\\" for days. This is not the album for you if you are into N'Sync, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Saviors of Britpop in America","review":"Words cannot do this album justice. Fran Healy's words are simple but more heartfelt than anything Thom Yorke has penned since \\"Fake Plastic Trees.\\" These songs are of pure, raw emotion and will affect you like no other band. \\"Turn,\\" \\"Writing To Reach You,\\" and every other song for that matter are songs for the ages and seep into your soul with mellow Britpop perfection. If this band is not the biggest British band in America within a couple months I'll be very surprised. Everyone just buy this album, it has value far beyond the money you pay for it. You may not learn anything and you may not be challenged to think but you will feel something special, and that's all the validation this brilliant record needs."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this album, I love Fran Healy, I love Travis","review":"What is there to say about this other than it's bloody brillant! I loved every song instantly and Frannie's voice is so beautiful who wouldn't want to listen to him.Everyone should have a copy of this album in their collection of cd's, it's one which will remain timeless and original, with such tunes as 'Writing to reach you', 'As you are', 'Driftwood' and 'Luv'. Travis goes through all the ranges of emotion and still manages to keep you mellow and peaceful. I could go on raving about them forever and I'm probably a little biased due to the fact that they are my favourite band, but seriously go out and buy this CD and decided for yourself. I'm completely hooked."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tremendous","review":"I'm surprised that even the five star reviews for this album aren't more ecstatic. It's not the best of all time, but the lyrics are quite amazing. The melodies are all strong. The sound is interesting and engrossing. I think Driftwood is my favorite track but they are all very, very good. It's difficult to find an album with not one song that sounds forced, but this is close. Everyone talks about the Radiohead comparison, but i don't see why it matters. This is a fantastic album, and that's that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry I purchased this","review":"I found this cd too quiet and introspective for my tastes right now. This is not to say this band has no talent or that others will feel as I do. Most of the other reviews here are glowing, so this cd just doesn't click with me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Bad, Not Great","review":"having finally heard the whole album i have to admit i was a bit disappointed Travis merely sound like a James cover band that doesn't even have the originality to make songs sound different almost all songs on this cd sound the same. Each song on its own sounds ok but put them all together and it gts a bit boring. If you really have to spend your money I suggest you by a cd by James or dare I even say it Oasis."},{"rating":"2","title":"best cd of 2000 hands down.","review":"a band i love (the Gufs) covered writing to reach you and I heard why does it always rain on me on Gilmore Girls, needless to say I was intrigued. This disc is godd from start to finish, it never gets tiring or old and if i had to pick one cd from 2000 to get stuck in my car cd player, this would be it."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST CD I OWN","review":"I have no clue why the rating isn't 5 stars for this album. Every single track is great. Its the kind of cd where you don't skip to certain songs, because you love every single one of them. The really cool thing about Travis is that they're not so image-obsessed like the rest of the music industry. As Fran Healy says, \\"Music is art. The industry is concerned with image, not art, but that's gonna change.\\" He went on to say how Pink Floyd could go out into the open unrecognized, and how he and the rest of the band can do the same, because they're not image-promoting, but music promoting. If music is art, this is a masterpiece. If anyone is curious why its called \\"The Man Who,\\" its taken from the title of the book \\"The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat.\\" If there is one album to buy this year, its this one. The reason why Travis isn't so popular in the US is because our music industry is so image-obsessed, and Travis doesn't fall into that category."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bleh.","review":"I guess if you like the sounds of Keane you might like this album. I liked their single, \\"Sing\\", from the Invisible Band, so I figured why not try a complete album? However I'm very bored with this cd. Coldplay is more my cup of tea. This is much too sleepy and not pretty enough to be interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of My All Time Favorites","review":"Just as my title states, this is one of my favorite albums of all time. I don't think this album should widely be considered of that high status, but for me personally it is a perfect listening. The songs have a rare beautiful and haunting quality that their latest record lacks, and as on the secret tracks, they still know how to pull off a rocker. This album is consistenly solid from start to finish, my personal highlight of the album is track 8 (i think) called \\"Luv\\", a bittersweet song about falling in love unexpectedly, wonderful. This is definitely an album to purchase. Dan."},{"rating":"2","title":"sad and very british- in s good way...","review":"this is a one man band - I think - the lead singer, with his sad voice and words, writes about himself, his lonlyness and sadness. personaly, I feel very connected to his songs, but I fear it will scare off others. but this is a wintery-beutiful CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS IS A PERFECT ALBUM, espically on a rainy day!","review":"Travis is a great band, but they are not known in the US. I heard them at an Oasis concert, and I was blown away. This album is one of those rare albums that you will listen to the whole way through. The kind of album, that you grow old with. They have some similarites to Radiohead, and thats a good thing. The music and moving and emotional. In a time, where everyone puts out crap after crap, and adding all these sounds and effects to pump up their music, this album is a breath of fresh air. The songs are soft and sutle, just like the lyrics. They come from the heart and you can feel the bands emotion through the music, and you can feel their energy from the music. You should give them a chance, it took me three days to get into the whole album. Some songs require the listener to listen to more than once, but then you get hooked. This is the perfect album to listen to on a rainy day, and wonder \\"Why Does It Always Rain On Me?\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drifting into a deep sleep","review":"As a friend commented when hearing this album 'Is that the Verve'. Travis is yet another band that sounds like another band. This album is so lifeless and dull, it makes me wonder why record companies are pushing bands like this when there are so many good bands out there that are itching to get a recording deal. 'Driftwood' and 'Why does it always rain on me' sound ok but need some magic pumped into them. The world needs more happy cheerful music, not this stuff that makes you wonder what is happening to music. An unwise purchase on my behalf."},{"rating":"1","title":"Campfire Music","review":"As a singles band I would rate Travis however as an album band they are boring whinning Scots and should be left to the Scottish Highlands. Every song pretty much sounds the same, an annoying singer, a couple of acoustic guitars, percussion and the odd other instrument. The music is downtempo and uninteresting, not much originality either. I recon you would get the same effect sitting around a campfire with an acoustic guitar, and then you would probably sing to better songs. The music is too imposing and depressingly bad to sleep to and too boring to play around company, so what do you do with it? Throw this album in the fire, at least it might impress those around you."},{"rating":"1","title":"HOW IS THIS LIKE RADIOHEAD?","review":"And since when is Radiohead bad? They are one of the best bands of the most recent decade. Radiohead will be around next year.

The first song I heard was their cover of \\"hit me baby one more time\\", which I found pretty good actually, and bit comical as well. Unfortunately, their own material soon started whistling past my ears on the radio. Songs like \\"Turn\\" and the exceptionally bad, britpop-ish and slow \\"why does it always rain on me\\". About a week ago I heard their album, and I do believe I tried listening to it without my recent britpop prejudice (can anyone blame me?). But what I heard, was probably one of the most overrated recordings in years. Travis are basically as unoriginal as it can get, plus they sound phenomenally alike all a the other hyped up british bands around these days (for example the band with the parachutes album). I think this is quite a shame really, because if Travis had a little \\"soul\\", their music could easily work. But this is simply mediocre pop music at its worst. To be avoided!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Travis are overratic bubble gum","review":"If you are thinking about buyuing this, Don't, The songs are all pretty much the same,this is drab and dreary rock at it's worst.

The voices are down right annoying. The story is absolutly rediculous. Take my advise pass on this one and get \\"Ninja Scroll\\" instead.

What did U.S. Manga do to this movie! In its original 3-part form, Yotoden is a wonderful, fast-paced anime with a gripping and involving storyline that keeps you hooked to the very end. In this version, however, over 30 minutes of fantastic (and necessary) footage has been inexplicably cut, resulting in a movie that is totally disjointed and difficult to follow. Major plot and character developments have been removed in a careless and seemingly desultory fashion and scenes have been rearranged in a futile attempt to tie together the now-jumbled storyline. Couple this with a horrible dubbing job and subtitles done by someone who is obviously painfully unfamiliar with the linguistic nuances of Japanese in reference to historical events and you have a nearly unwatchable anime. Thank you very much, US Manga, for taking the finest in Japanimation and mutilating it for Western consumption."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite anime movie of all time","review":"Although this was one of the first anime movies I had seen, it has remained my favorite throughout these years.

But the the movie rambled on from subject to subject, time period to time period, and the plot twist toward the end was so inaudible, that only a computer could understand it completely. I never know the intentions of any of the three shadow warriors, and it is impossible to keep track of the seven obero ninjas (unlike the 8 devils of Kimon in \\"Ninja Scroll\\") and the love between Sakon and Ayama was not very beleivable. This movie needed a better introduction, and more time to straigten out the plot. 189 minutes would be more suitable than a meager 89 minutes. Throw in irritating cheesy fight music, fights in which you don't know who is who, and plot twists involving characters who were never really in the movie that much in the first place, and you have one dissapointing movie that could have ranked among great Ninja movies like \\"Ninja Scroll,\\" or \\"The Dagger of Kamui.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Too sad","review":"This anime is by far one of the worse I have ever seen.

Even with low expectations, this kettle was awful! It is not what I would consider yellow but so pale as to be more of a cream color, with a slight yellow tinge. It chipped within a week of CAREFUL use. There is no way to pour without DRIPPING and spilling much of the water that comes out!

Investigation reveals that Judge Blackwell was a sexual sadist, with many people wishing him dead. But using the discarded Bertillon method of identification, Eleanor Roosevelt finds the murderer. It is a racier and faster-moving tale than many in this series, but it still gives us a window to view that long-ago time and its people.

Joni doesn't do bad as well, but you feel the rate of the CD falling on the \\"intimate\\" songs, the ones without the band. BUT...if you've never heard Jaco's fantastic playing on \\"On France they kiss on main street\\" or on \\"Watching the dry cleaner\\" YOU SIMPLY STILL DON'T KNOW WHAT BASS IS ALL ABOUT.But, as an album, it's too long, filled with some other songs that are not really inspired.The 4 stars go to the \\"band\\" songs of the album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Joni's Jazz","review":"I've always loved this CD. Joni is at a plateau in her career here, having moved from folky singer/songwriter to Jazz influenced singer. She probably started slipping a bit after this. Her voice here is perfect, and her phrasing is as always truly unique.Favourite track for me is \\"In France they Kiss on Main Street\\". Pat Methany plays wonderful guitar and the band are really powerful. However 'Coyote' 'Hejira' and 'Goodbye Pork Pie Hat' are all great in there own ways.The band is phenomenal, Michael Brecker is on Sax, Jaco Pastorius Bass, together with Lyle Mays on Keyboards and Don Alias on drums. This is a one-off Jazz super-group that only ever worked together for this tour, and never recorded in the studio as a unit.If you like Joni Mitchell's Jazz side this is an essential purchase and you can buy the DVD of this as well, which is well worth getting."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great CD for all Joni Fans","review":"I agree with another reviewer that this is a fantastic group. It is a rather strange grouping. Jaco on bass, Pat Metheny on guitar, Lyle Mays on keyboards, Don Alias on drums and percussion, and Michael Brecker on sax. You wouldn't think of these guys on a pop stage. Not that Joni really is pop. Joni soars with these guys underneath. It is also very interesting to hear Pat play in this forum. But to tell the truth, this is an absolute tour de force for Jaco. Hejira and Coyote particularly are given life by Jaco. What a great album. When it first came out it didn't leave my stereo for about 2 months."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still don't have this album?","review":"Joni Mitchell is great. In this live album she gives all her prodigious talent and her voice is better than in studio albums. By her side a bounch of the best musicians ever on the same stage (Jako Pastorius, Michael Brecker, Pat Matheny, Don Alias, Lyle Mays). Though every single song is worth the purchase, \\"The dry cleaner of Des Moines\\" and \\"Black crow\\" are wonderful jewels: this music will never grow old with time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hot & Spicy","review":"I had this complete live concert on CED (remember the stylus video player in the early 80s?) Since then, I've searched the video banks for the video concert, either on VHS or DVD (would love to get it on DVD, but not offered). Anyway, you will find the best musicians at their best here.Including Joni and the Persuasions singing together the song, Shadows and Light. A piece is missing from this album where Joco plays a solo. He won me over as a fan after that. Pat, Lyle, Michael and the rest tee off. Love this album. It's one of a kind"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cracked CD covrer","review":"The music is great. The CD was packaged in a bubble wrap emvolope. This protects from impact but not twisting or compresseve loads. The plastic CD case was almost broaken in half. The CD is fine, but when the jewl case falls appart the CD will get damaged. I will get a replacement for the case, but the replacements are not the same, and you usualy loose the art that inserts into the case."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deeply disappointing","review":"I've been a fan of Joni Mitchell since the early seventies, but this is a concert performance free from any evidence of joy, unstudied spontaneity or audience interaction. A self-gratifying performance from Miss Mitchell, massively inferior to her Miles of Aisles concert album. Adding insult to injury, the quality of the recording on this CD is inferior: Muddy and indistinct. For compulsive collectors only."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why?","review":"I hate to say negative things about Joni, but man-this album is far from decent. I'm not the type who gets freaked out about \\"change\\", but I truly wish she would have just kept Max Bennett and John Guerin (even if they did divorce). No offense to Jaco, but his \\"fretless\\" sound can get out of control. Especially on sweet tracks like \\"In france\\" and \\"edith and the kingpin\\". It really doesn't fit. The whole sound just kinda makes me sick. If you want a good live Joni album, get \\"Miles of Ailes\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Information but No Color","review":"Among the art books I own, this is the least used and that's a sad fact. I generally read art books from cover to cover when I first get them and this one was no exception. The information given about early modernist art is in-depth, complete and, I feel, required reading for any artist. However, when I go back to one as reference and realize the entire book has only 8 color plates in over 300 pages, I generally drop it in search of another which shows the art as it was meant to be seen. I fully understand that this is probably a college textbook and costs may have been a concern, but modernists works were not only unique for their use of shape, line and composition, they were also considered groundbreaking for their use of color. To show so little of it is a misstep in an otherwise decent book."},{"rating":"1","title":"makes Czech even more difficult","review":"(Note, the other review of this item is actually a review of a Berlitz package.)The audio tape in this package is the most bizarre and useless example of the genre I've encountered.

However, I would have liked to see more words and detail, especially in the food section. Once I thought I was ordering a typical czech fried pork steak--it turned out to be liver!The tapes were a joke for the most part.

That it is generic, not to mention intensely stupid, is not why I hated it quite as much as I did, however. That is because the movie could have, with another revision or two to the script, had some very interesting things to say about race and vengeance (think <em>Candyman</em> here, naturally), but that part came off as nothing more than a confused muddle at best, a plot device at worst. Depending on which of the two interpretations you go with, the movie is either incompetent in the former case or offensively racist in the latter. I chose to at least give the screenwriter the benefit of the doubt. *"},{"rating":"1","title":"Plasterhead","review":"This movie had a good story but the movie kept going on with nothing really happening. Plasterhead would appear but really do nothing important. He was probably the dumbest horror villian i've ever seen. The few death scenes are decent but nothing that made me stand up and say cool. The last half hour really gets dark and you can barely see the movie.Overall, didnt have bad acting and there is a story. However, it goes nowhere and I really wouldnt recommend it to anyone who is looking for gore and killings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have had help","review":"This book is not very well written. The author should have had the help of an experienced writer. Unfortunately it reads like a soap opera instead of a holocaust survivor story. There are other stories of this type that are much more worth reading. I do not recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent handbook to aquarium fish","review":"While this book does devote a small section to setup and maintenance of an aquarium, this book works best as a reference guide for species info. Hundreds and hundreds of very nice pictures are augmented with good information on each species' water and food requirements, temperament, maximum size, and miscellaneous background information. I've found a few species missing from this book, but even with over 870 species there are bound to be a few left out.I highly recommend this for anyone looking for good, consolodated information on hundreds of fish. It's also good for those trips to the fish store when you don't trust the teenage attendant to give you accurate information about that one fish you really like."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very comprehensive, but hard to read.","review":"This book is very comprehensive. It covers over 870 species of fishes. The fishes are arranged in alphabetical order of their scientific names. In my opinion, this is not a very way to present the fishes. There is no organization at all. Who can memorize the scientific names? I would rather see all the tetras in one section, and all the cichlids in another. If you want a book mainly for fish identification, the mini-atlas or the full atlas may be better choices. Some of the photos are in poor quality.

The songs sound like leftovers from \\"The Dude\\" and other more successful albums,produced and arranged by Quincy Jones.Only \\"Believe in Yourself,\\" magnificently performed by the legendary Lena Horne, has any lasting value.Perhaps, the failure of this producation to be major hit put a damper on any Broadway revivals of the show that spawned the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"WIZ AWAY from this one !","review":"Upon it's release, this movie sank at the BOX OFFICE faster than the real TITANIC SHIP ! The reason is partly due to the Diva Ross not being the proper age to portray the lead that was done on broadway by STEPHANIE MILLS. On this soundtrack, La DIVA ROSS is vocally out of her tone deaf league. Her vocals are horribly weak and uninterresting thus below the caliber of this powerful BROADWAY show.Stay clear from this product for it has aged bad and now truly smells of rotten cheese."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soon As I Get...Home","review":"The remastered version of the movie soundtrack is a must-have for Diana fans, Michael fans, Quincy fans, or anyone who needs to be simultaneously uplifted and entertained. Controversy over casting notwithstanding, Miss Ross delivers vocally on this CD. \\"Soon As I Get Home\\", \\"Be A Lion\\", \\"Believe In Yourself\\", and the masterpiece \\"Home\\" are among her most shining moments, and she blows away costars and choir alike on \\"A Brand New Day\\". Other highlights include Michael's haunting \\"You Can't Win\\", the rousing \\"Don't Nobody Bring Me No Bad News\\", and Lena Horne's \\"Believe In Yourself\\".

I want to point out that this is NOT a \\"male-bashing\\" book. Although the authors are all women, the editors and translators are 2 men and 2 women, and characters of both genders are portrayed as a mixture of good and bad, i.e. human. The characters are to an extent a reflection of their society, but they are dealing with problems (alcohol, drugs, divorce, child abuse, etc.) that are not unique to any society. The stories show great sensitivity and compassion and in addition reveal more about life in a country that many Americans know little about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful, insightful book.","review":"I received this book from a friend in 1990.

I underlined passages, wrote notes on pages, and each time I read it, I feel like I'm getting in touch with myself again.It's an extremely good feeling when you can read your own thoughts and views on the world from someone else.. from someone you don't know.

Since it's very personal , it creates a connection which makes you believe that YOU had a hand in writing this book . Maybe , when you read it first , you'll enjoy it just for the book that it is .

I enjoy it because of its unique style and don't feel pressured to read the book a certain way, and because of the way it is formatted, one may skip around and read, re-read, bits and pieces. I've noticed that most of the negative comments of the book come from people who claim to have read the book in two hours, which I think is not enough time to appreciate what the author has to say.

Despite a few weaknesses, which includes wavering on the days of creation, this commentary may be the best contemporary, exegetical commentary on the opening chapters of Genesis.

TFL measure by a \\"slurp of this\\" and cup (not a measuring cup, mind you) of that, a knob of butter, etc. There are a few dishes I've attempted (with some variations) and will likely try more. But they all look interesting and harken back to a way that few people cook anymore. The ladies are charming, witty and clever and it's all unscripted.

Perhaps that's because there isn't anything to notice, and there is nothing to pay attention too.Just one more thing, DON'T CHANGE THE CHANNEL!

This book is also a welcome relief from the usual vilification of this great man and the system that for six glorious years turned around the injustices of Versailles and the decadence of the Weimar Republic and gave peace and prosperity to the German people.Colin Jordan's writings are not a historical document but a vibrant exhortation to create a bright and shining future for the Aryan Race. He writes with clarity, insight and has a gift for profoundly inspiring the reader.It is a disgrace that this elderly man, in his mid-Seventies, is still hounded by the British Government and the police."},{"rating":"2","title":"A man with Vision","review":"Colin Jordan discusses the untold side of Adolf Hitler and the National Socialist movement, a side that has been hidden for justification of actions against the movement. Well constructed arguments about the modern decadent society, the evils of multiculturalism and the neccessity for the preservation of race will impress open minded people.This book can open any individuals eyes up to Adolf Hitler, portraying him as a man of vision, a man who could forsee the decay of the Aryan people and ultimately the end of civilisation.. Unfortunately his prophecies seem to be becoming all too true in these days of degeneration.Read this book and learn how a great man could have made a difference to a world that is now in turmoil."},{"rating":"1","title":"National Socialism = Nazism","review":"This book is basically revisionist history. It is well known that \\"National Socialism\\" is not socialism at all, but Nazism. The author glorifies Hitler's Germany and the Nazi party. For any good that the author claims that came of Nazism, the party fails on the points of democracy and inclusiveness for all people. This is why the Nazi's killed off not only minorities and Jewish people throughout Europe, but also true socialists and communists."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for anyone in any kind of shape","review":"I found it to be extremely boring. It would be great for someone older looking for a very mild workout or someone in poor shape looking to start slow.

The historical footage is sparse, most live material being taken from one or two shows. Some of the live material is recreated using a psuedo-psyche posterising effect. Very cheesy! The real crime: Most of the interviews are with subordinate characters. NO interviews with Scott, either Brian, Gary, Snowy, etc, etc. Were they all unavailable? The VH-1 \\"Behind the Music\\" from a few years ago was much better. One saving grace is the interview material with Eric Bell."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointing","review":"Not at all what I was expecting. Does not do the band or the fans justice. The \\"coverband\\" audio tracks of some of Thin Lizzy's better known songs is pathetic. Not an outright abomination, but doesn't even come close to representing the band and what they were about live and in the studio. No interview or insight from Gorham, Downey, Robbo, White, Wharton, or Moore. More or less a waste of my hard earned money. Try again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The definitive Lizzy DVD","review":"This is the best ever DVD to be made about the band.There's loads of performance but best of all we get to hear the whole tragic story from Eric Bell the first guitarist and from Phil's mum who is worth the admission money alone .It's haunting and mesmeric by turns .Briliant ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cult leader or Money making genius?","review":"Some believe Amway is a cult, I believe Dexter has not saidthings to get people to do what he wants.

Fundamental principles of success, same that you hear every day, but put together perfectly in this book"},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Performance & Excellent Value","review":"This is a solid, smooth running machine with heavy duty castings and ample power. This unit runs smoother, and with less noise and vibration compared to the Delta 31-280. The 1725 RPM speed produces less burning on sensitive woods like cherry.Fit and finish is very good. A notch below the Delta, but outstanding considering the price. Dust collection is also very good, but you will need to improvise an adapter for the disc side.Two issues make this less than a 5 star review:1) The belt tracking is finicky. Once set it is stable, but it can be a bear to get there.2) The table for the belt is mounted too high. Only 8.5 inches of the 14.5 inch platen are usable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Make sure you set it up properly","review":"The unit comes with sanding disk and belt installed - ready to go, but not quite. It is important to go through the entire setup process as outlined in the manual before turning it on. The one I received had the sanding platen recessed slightly with respect to the top roller. Thus when you sand a longer board, you get a gouge from the top roller. The instructions cover this adjustment, be sure to go through it before use.After proper setup, I was impressed with the performance and lack of vibration - That direct drive pays off. I would definately recommend it.The only down side I have found is having to remove the belt guard to change belts. It is such a bother, I mounted a piano hinge on mine so I can simply hinge it open for belt changes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disfunctional Top Pully & Table","review":"I bought this hoping that it would be a good upgrade for my 1970's DeWalt. Unfortunately, it turned out to be a mistake. The spring-loaded cantilevered top pully may be the poorest design going. I started by replacing the 16g 125v lead with a 12g 250v cord. It now starts faster but jerks the spring on the top-pully and eats the belt. I've tried holding the tension handle but the entire mounting system gets tweaked somehow and the belt won't stop racing off until it's too late. I've been tweaking tools for 30 years and this is the first one that has me thinking that Craig's List is the best solution. I've also been cruising the blogs hoping that some aspiring engineer will sell after-market fixes for this Grizzly embarassment! Don't buy this model. Buy something that has 2-bearings on both pullys."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay away from it","review":"All of my other phones are Motorola, so I had to by this software for my wife's Samsung Sync.I could never get it to work.

The Owner's Guide isn't that useful so I struggled to get the brush to work on the carpet (you have to switch a toggle back and forth). Finally I did and it worked well. Then I sucked up the fringe of a rug by mistake. I do that sometimes with my other two vacuums, and I just turn them off and it's not big deal. But with the Eureka I IMMEDIATELY smelled burning rubber! Horrified, I quickly turned it off. I turned it back on and the roller brush wouldn't turn. Long story short, I unscrewed the bottom and realized 1) the roller was not new (lots of scaring) and 2) the BELT was broken! It just arrived today! You have to be kidding me - now I need to take it in, or return it. I'm am very upset about this. Also, this vacuum is VERY HEAVY!! Not worth it if you have a house with wood floors and area rugs -- too much switching between settings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ouch!! this one really sucks!!","review":"Unbelievable how this vacuum sucks up dog and cat hair.

It has turned into a family joke because it is such a nightmare to use. It is unbelievably heavy and cumbersome. My carpets are two years old and even with vacuuming weekly I have to clean the filters every couple of weeks. It often cuts off after a few minutes of vacuuming from (?)overheating despite cleaning every filter on the thing - which is messy and a pain in the neck. I've had it in for service twice but each time they tell me \\"nothing is wrong\\". What is wrong is that I purchased the wrong vacuum. Steer clear- there are better vacuums on the market that weigh less, do a better job. I'm ashamed to give mine away to some other poor soul."},{"rating":"2","title":"ROCKS!","review":"I was skeptical of bagless vacuums, but at my wife's insistence I got it, and I am impressed!It has suction, and the HEPA filter really cleans the air in the house.We have 2 cats and 2 dogs, and this has made a great improvement in air quality and cleanliness."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad album, don't buy it","review":"don't buy this album. its not standard remixed from Dieter Bohlen.

The rhythm section isn't anything close to the precision of the Stax/Volt crew which graduated King from rumour to star in 1966 (well, name one rhythm section that is) - but if you can overcome both that and a couple of songwriting turkeys, you're in for a treat. Put this together with the King tracks on Chess's \\"Door to Door\\" and you've got a comprehensive gathering of just what made Albert King's reputation enough that Stax couldn't wait to sign him when they had the chance in the first place. Even at this comparatively early stage of his blues career, Albert King was playing like his life depended on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"simply the BEST!","review":"Albert G-d rest his soul, was simply the best that ever played a blues guitar. As a teenager in 1969 I played organ for him before joining BB King's band. NOBODY ever outplayed him on a good night. His perfect timing & rhythm and total on key in-tune bends never ceased to amaze me.Maybe some could play more notes, but no one could play one note better'n him. As soon as you'd hear him, you'd know it was him and not someone else stealing his licks, as so many have. Arguably, he may have played & grooved better on his Stax material, but he was no slouch here and was well on his way towards developing his signature stinging sound that was so unique and original. He was a great, kind and wonderful human being as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good fill in book","review":"I bought this along with several other books on Montana. Its a good resource and has a lot of information, but I found it was hard to use. It was more like a textbook that required me to dig and take notes. While they did provide a few maps, they were sketchy and really didn't help me find where things were located. This is compared to the Montana Roadside Directory which I found to be nicely laid out, and easy to use. I would still recommend the purchase of this if your planning a trip as a supplement to other information. It was my second favorite book of the several I bought."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good stuff","review":"Moon's guide to Montana is an unexpected delight. It's in the details: the small towns with unusual histories, the monuments that go unnoticed by the side of the road, the off-the-beaten path places for which we learned to divert our course. If you're interested (as we were not) in AAA Tour Guide type reviews, this will not do the trick. If you really want to learn something about the place through which you're traveling, this is the book. Some of the large attractions, like Glacier National Park, get shorter shrift than in other guidebooks (Foders was one of the others we used), but Moon has a guide specific to Glacier if you want additional info---and it is voluminous! We're converts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality...","review":"This brand used to be the best for car mats and I owned a set of these so-called premium mats for each of my vehicles.

It really frustrates me how stupid these ad guys are.Ballad--A ballad is a story, usually a narrative or poem, in a song. Any story form may be told as a ballad, such as historical accounts or fairy tales in verse form. It usually has foreshortened, alternating four- and three-stress lines ('ballad meter') and simple repeating rhymes, often with a refrain.If it is based on political or religious themes, a ballad may be a hymn. It should not be confused with the ballade, a 14th and 15th century French verse form.Some good examples of ballads:The Devil Went Down to Georgia,The Ballad of Jesse James,Johnny Has Gone For a Soldier,Ode to Billie JoeWhile there are a couple of songs on this album that are actual ballads, the large majority are not.

The reason for the wide difference in rating the two books: This book, City Smart, is trying to be hip, flippant, and tounge-in-cheek. Instead, it comes off as very negative. I purchased the two books at the same time, read this one first, and when I was done I really wasn't sure I wanted to visit Baltimore. And that would be a mistake because Baltimore is indeed Charm City, and the other book really brings that out. It has a much more upbeat, positive, optimistic, good-natured style; as well as more depth and details in the extra 150 pages.

It worked well at first, but within the first week it was very staticy like I've read in other reviews. I'm usually pretty gentle with electronics, but maybe it was the way I stored the cord by wrapping it around the ear and support pieces on either side of the headset. If that's the case it's very touchy since I wrapped it loosely. That being said, Amazon refunded my money without me having to send the headset back. I tossed the headset in the electronic recycling bin. My company purchased a Plantronics MX500i 3-in-1 Headset (also sold at Amazon) and it works great. It works well with the home office analog phone and VoIP software phone. I also use this when I travel so it stands up to not so ideal storage in my backpack.Since there's so many positive reviews for this headset, I'd recommend trying it out because you may get a good one.

I use them until the headset breaks (it always breaks at the adjuster for the head size). Then I tape it up with electric tape and keep using it for a few more years until the cord/plug finally goes bad. Of course it looks horrible with electric tape all over it, but it works! Panasonic's more expensive models appear to use the same cheap plastic adjuster on the headset, so I'm not going to bother trying anything more expensive. I will just continue to buy these until they quit making them... :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Panasonic KX-TCA60","review":"I had one that was still working, but thought it time for another one for a back up as I use it a lot, upon receiving it, I called my friend in Fl and said Hi, what do you think, she said huh? I can't hardly hear you, I checked to make sure it was turned on, than checked volume and yes it was up, so I moved it all the way down and then all the way back up and still had to speak very load to be heard, as for hearing her, it was not nearly as well as I could hear her on my old set, so I probably over rated this product, panasonic used to make good products but seems latley every thing I buy from them is not up to standards.

It's the best headset I have ever used.You can rotate it around and chose which ear you want the speaker on, very important for me because i don't have full hearing in my left ear. It just plugs in. Nothing else to fine tune or anything. SIMPLE SIMPLEIf you are wondering if you even need a headset you do! I use this all the time, talking on the phone.

That's a problem when talking with clients; they say they can't hear me, and yes, it's plugged into an (expensive) Panasonic phone, and that's the long and short of it. I could hear them, but I have to be able to communicate clearly with clients, and when they say they can't hear me, I've got to pick up the handset or put them on speaker. It needs an amplifier. Just plan and simple, it doesn't pick up and send the sound to the other person. Yes, I have adjusted the mike so it's near my mouth, and around a few different spots, does not matter. Otherwise it's comfortable, cheap, and looks OK. Maybe I can sell it on Craig's list for a profit....?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Panasonic Headset","review":"I bought Panasonic phones and a headset from Amazon.

They have yet to make one tailored for the iPhone.This headset requires an adapter as it has a 2.5mm plug.Additionally, it is a mono plug and not a stereo plug.The adapter for the iPhone you want has a stereo 3.5mm plug that drops one channel and coverts it to a mono output for the mono plug of this headset.It is hard to say which adapters do this properly to avoid shorting left and right output channels from the iPhone 3 & 4.Cellet, available on Amazon, has a 3.5mm stereo plug that mates appropriately to the iPhone 4.Check it out before you buy this model.Hopefully Panasonic will introduce a headset with a 3.5mm stereo plug in the future to properly mate to an iPhone without an adapter.I do like the Panasonic brand generally and the fit of their headsets."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good value, a few discomforts.","review":"Decent sound quality, but the volume doesn't go too high. People have complained about my voice not being audible enough, but this occurs very infrequently. The wire from the telephone to the earphone is very long and can get in the way; of course you can tuck it into your shirt or pocket, but still a bit clumsy. The boom takes getting used to, as it is quite long and large. Overall, still a pretty good value. All the things I complained about can be overlooked considering the price and that it works decently!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this Headset","review":"I should have paid more attention to the reviews. This headset snapped after only a couple of months of use.Its cheap rigid plastic and if you do not handle it right it will break.You have been warned.I have been a Amazon customer for over 10 years and this is the first time I have felt the need to write a review.Panasonic is a great brand and produce good reliable products. This is not one of them.I am not sure how this headset has been awarded so many 5 star ratings."},{"rating":"1","title":"not a fit for the phone","review":"I can't really say how well this headset works, because it did not match for use with the Vtech CS6219-2 DECT 6.0 Expandable 2-Handset Cordless Phone System with Caller ID and Handset Speakerphone (CS6219-2) that I purchased at the same time. It IS comfortable to wear, but that is as far as I was able to get. I thought I was doing my home work, because it was listed as something that was frequently purchased by people who also bought the Vtech phone, but I didn't realize that the plug jack was not a match. I am hoping I may find a use for it yet. A little misleading if you are not into the minute details of these devices."},{"rating":"1","title":"headset review","review":"The Microphone quality is very bad for this product compared to other headsets I have in the same price range.

I have an old cordless Panasonic phone and have to buy one of these every year. I wear them about an hour a day on average (but occasionally MUCH longer, up to probably 5-6 hours) while I'm doing other things like housework, so they fall on the floor, catch on things, etc. and hold up very well through it all. I think they are a well-made basic headphone.The sound quality is clear and the boom is nice...the headset is very light and comfortable on my head. I really like them and am glad they are able to tolerate a lot of abuse. I think for the price they last a long time. When mine have failed, it's usually because a part breaks off due to some droppage or other accident. This last one I had I taped together with duct tape but eventually the sound started to go and there was a lot of static. Still, I think they have a good useful life, and are great. I haven't bought a new phone since 2003!Highly recommended.*****"},{"rating":"1","title":"Microphone Quit After One Month","review":"The microphone quit working after one month so that the person on the other could not hear me.

I thought o well, if it is not good, the price is so low, whatever. When I got it, it works great. When talking to people using the head set, they on the other end of the phone do not know that I am using a head set, and it comes in loud on my end so I can hear great. Nice cheep deal. Recommended for the price. No cord would be better, but I use it on a coardless phone and my cell phone and I like it. Good for the office when making sales calls and doing computer work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crystal clear durability","review":"I've used this headset constantly for over a month now. I absolutely love it. It is crystal clear and have had no complaints from people hearing me. I like the headset because it has a thicker cord to it than most headsets. The others I have found are flimsy and usually the cord gets twisted which causes a short to occur in the set. I've used a previous Plantronics set but prefer the Pansaonic headset along with the telephone that goes along with the headset - makes a perfect work at home situation. I am very pleased - it is cost friendly too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great headset!","review":"I have had this headset for about a year, and have become addicted to it! I have used it for my Vteck cordless and Nokia cell phone. It was my first, so I have nothing to compare it with, but it has worked great for my needs. No more kink-in-the-neck from folding laundry while yapping away! Great sound(I usually have to turn the volume down for my own sake) and people on the other end have no clue I'm using it....meaning it sounds great to them also.So I might look like a McD operator...but who cares? I do however find it a bit big when I'm using it in the car, so now I'm looking for a smaller car version and hope I'll be just as happy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mic stopped working, Panasonic won't replace it","review":"This headset was OK - not great, not bad - but stopped working after the 90 day labor warranty period.Panasonic customer service says: \\"...we recommend sending the product to our Customer Service Center in McAllen Texas.

You cannot adjust the end of the head clip and it digs into your head at a sharp angle. If you try, you will snap off the end. I would return this but the shipping would cost almost as much at the unit itself. I wish I could give zero stars for durability and wearing comfort.There is no volume control or mute.the mike is too big and it gets in your way (when it is not sliding away from your mouth.I would not have bought it except that the picture was lacking enough in detail that I did not notice it was the same as the one I already had.

The sound quality and price are great, can't complain. But a problem developed in less than two months that people cannot hear me from the other end. I did not have time to think too much about it. It is not expensive enough for me to return it. Panasonic can't tell me that the problem is with my phone. It is a Panasonic phone!

It allows me to get all my work around the house and home office done without being tied down to a phone. I found the panasonic to be ok. To tight on my ear, gave me a headache and the boom for the mouth piece was to big and not flexible. For a great headset I highly recommend the AT@T H420 for $17.99. The headset is lightweight and adjustable. The mouthpiece does not get in the way like the panasonic and is very flexible. You can also adjust the volume or mute the call right on the AT@T headset. The panasonic did not have this option. So if you like to be mobile while chatting, get the AT@T and do not waste your time with this panasonic!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a great headset","review":"There is an echo sound when using this headset.

If there were a zero or minus-1 rating I would be very happy to give that to this product. I have never seen such a poor design in regard to the arm of the mouthpiece. The arm will not rotate or adjust such that the mouthpiece will be where a human mouth is (and I have tried it on several adults from age 20 to age 80). As the mouth piece is ALWAYS too far off the mouth, I have to bend the arm every time but the arm doesn't bend very well, causing the other party to keep saying that they cannot hear me."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad fit, flimsy","review":"This headset seemed ok when I got it. But....the headband is not adjustable and is too large for my head. I can't walk around and do things because it falls off. And as with all headsets that have the 90-degree connector, the wires break where they enter the connector and it stops working. It loses volume and then you start hearing an echo. These things don't last more than a couple of months even with exquisite care. I would much rather pay more and get a better one but it seems everything out there has the same design problems with the 90 degree cord. I'd much rather have a straight connection on the cord and can't imagine why they insist on this built-in obsolescence 90 degree connector."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I hoped","review":"I've been disaapointed with this product.

Sound quality from the earpiece is marginal-average. The fit is adjustable and reasonably comfortable. Where this product really fails is the microphone.

I just requested my refund from Amazon (the refund/customer service from them is incredible)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good enough value for the money","review":"If you are looking for a low cost effective headset for a cordless phone this is a good choice. No bells or whistles but it has good enough sound and is loud enough. A faint buzz can be heard but only by the user. Everyone I call says I sound fine. I bought it for the long flexible microphone so it could go right in front of my mouth. When I use a headset with a shorter mike on the side of the mouth people can't hear me well.

I have been trying to find a headset that would work with my cell phone. Why you ask don't I just get a bluetooth. Those are not good to wear in your ear and talk on for long times, they have the same wave hazards as the cell phone. This was #1 seller so I decided to give it a try. Hey it was 8 bucks and change. Will it arrived today and I was soooo excited to get it. However, unlike a lot of customers raved it does not fit into any cell phone in my house. All three are different from IPhones to other smart phones. They all take standard headphone and mic jacks. This one was way to narrow. So, I guess it only works if you have a Panasonic home phone.

Cheap enough, and callers could hear me just fine, but it just didn't last."},{"rating":"2","title":"love it","review":"This headset is super comfortable. Way more comfortable than the kind where you have to stick a portion in your ear. I love that you can use the headset with either the right ear or the left ear. You can keep the microphone right in front of your mouth, or you can move it up a bit if you want to take a drink of something and the person can hear you just as well (I tested it.) I've had it for about a month and use it daily.

I checked the product package and it stated that the headset is compatible with 900MHz and 2.4GHz analog/digital phones. There was no specific compatibility information on Amazon.com so I had no reason not to think it would work with my 5.8GHz phone. Many reviewers have said that the KX-TCA86 is not as good but for me that is not the case. I purchased this headset at Best Buy after checking the package and seeing that it was compatible with 5.8GHz phones. I can be heard perfectly (better than from the handset I am told) and I can hear perfectly. So if you have a 5.8GHz phone I would stay away from this headset and get the KX-TCA86 instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed, and slow delivery after paying for faster","review":"I've been wanting a headset for when I'm driving, using my Treo phone.I've not been happy with quality of bluetooth sets and ear buds fall out or are too tight. After careful reviewing, bought this.Both I and the other end of the phone have trouble hearing each other.Have tried on my landline and it's okay - nothing execptional.Always find these reviews confusing when 7 people love a product and 3 don't. Maybe I just got a lemon with this particular headset and usually they're excellent???"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not suggested if using a converter plug","review":"Most of these headsets have a standard headset jack. To plug it into the iPhone, you need a converter. I am not sure if the converter caused issues or the headset was bad on its own, but I would NOT recommend this headset if you plan to use a converter plug. During calls, there is a base drum sound in the ear of the receiver on the side of the person being called by the headset phone. This noise is NOT apparent to the caller (who is using the headset)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after a month","review":"Headband was stiff and unwieldy, arm of mouthpiece didn't bend very well, and I had numerous complaints about my voice sounding 'far away' and tinny a lot of the time.After using it for a month the size-adjusting band simply cracked while on my head, leaving the entire right side (the one with the mouthpiece) to dangle. The only thing keeping it from falling to the ground was a slightly larger bit of plastic at the end of the adjustment track.As I do not favor a headset featuring a large section of duct tape I will be buying another type of headset!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good experience","review":"For some reason (obviously some customers didn't have this problem), the other party was mostly inaudible with this headset, and they couldn't hear me well either. Like someone else said about another panasonic headset, it reduced the volume by at least 50%, meaning I was lucky if I could piece a few words together. I tried it with a Panasonic KX-TG2730 and I simply had to toss it in the trash. It was unusable."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for....","review":"I bought this because it was low cost and some other reviews said it has clear sound. I can hear with it just fine, but I've had to stop using it because people on the other end ALWAYS complain of an echo, whether I use this with a landline or a cell phone. Maybe it works better if you use it with a PC, but I am having to buy another headset as this one is unusable for my normal daily business calls."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fits great, works lousy","review":"I purchased this headset with the Panasonic cordless phones. I thought \\"same manufacturer, it'll work great.\\"Wrong.The headset feels great. The mic stays close by my mouth without being intrusive, the speaker stays over my ear.You can even hear the person you're talking to.The problem is there is a loud hum that is entirely too distracting to allow.I can't use the headset. So I have thrown my money down the toilet on this one.Sad, Panasonic usually makes quality products."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great headset, will work with Razr if you get cheap adapter","review":"I'm so happy I got this headset. I have a Motorola Razr phone, and I at first bought a headset that is meant for the Razr, but it was horrible-- very poor sound quality. So, I decided to buy this one along with a little adapter to make it fit into my phone:Motorola Mini OEM Original RAZR V3, V3c, V3m, V3i, V3t, V3e, V3r, SLVR L7, L6, L2, L7c PEBL U6, KRZR K1m, K1 USB to 2.5mm Headset Audio, and it's a perfect situation. Great sound quality and my phone recognizes it. Plus, it was amazingly cheap. This one's kind of a no-brainer because of the price. I just bought another one for my dad.*Edit* One caveat of using this with the Razr: If I leave the headset plugged in, the phone will randomly pick up noises in the environment and think I'm giving the voice command to call someone. It's called a few people that way, which can be embarrassing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Panasonic headset","review":"Very disappointed in the headset. It was used 3 times and the mic stopped working and had to be sent back. Waste of postage."},{"rating":"1","title":"It died after eight months!","review":"At first, this phone seemed like a terrific value. I read all the reviews, and it seemed like a solid pick. And it was. I work from home and use a headset every day, so this is a must-have for me. After four or five months, I started to occasionally get static on the line, which I could fix by wiggling the plug that goes into the phone jack. After eight months, there was so much static on the line that I couldn't hear anything else. I replaced the headset with another model and the problem is completely gone.So it looks like this product is only good for several months of use. If you're looking for a longer lasting model, spend a little more money and try something else. (Unless that's how long headsets are supposed to last?)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap","review":"Its cheap and it does the job but its not very durable and isn't comfortable.

I would definitely recommend it to my family and friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Panasonic KX-TCA60 Hands-free headset review","review":"An excellent product with a foam covered mouthpiece at a very low price. Only disadvantage is the mouthpiece tubing is somewhat short. This means that in order to be heard easily, the earpiece has to be moved away from its proper position making it harder to hear. Even a 1/2 inch longer mouthpiece stem would make a big difference."},{"rating":"1","title":"Made for tall skinny heads","review":"I can hear better through the headset than through the handset and callers say they can hear me better too. But.....As a tall and slender adult male 6'2, 175 lbs. I usually complain about clothes, devices, etc. being too small. This headset is almost great with one major drawback. Adjusted to the smallest setting the pressure plate (non-earphone) side is JUST above my ear and and squeezes my head uncomfortably tight. If I adjust it any larger to make it looser and stop the \\"migraine squeeze\\", the pressure plate with its sharp plastic literally cuts into the top of my ear. I wrapped it with mole skin to make it bearable, but I am disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really crummy microphone","review":"With 476 reviews, I guess I'm not gonna make much of a difference. But the microphone on this item (both mine and my wife's) is so bad that it's almost useless. I have to practically put the pickup IN my mouth to be heard on many connections. I tried it without the foam cover, but no improvement. My AT&T; speakerphone picks up my voice much better from two feet away than this microphone does from two inches!So, after 5 months of struggling with the microphone touching my lips, I need to give up on these and buy two headsets of a different brand -- heard good things about the $20 Plantronics.Why wasn't this reported in any other reviews? Did we get TWO defective units? Has Panasonic degraded the quality since those reviews?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice design, poorly made","review":"I bought this because it had so many good reviews on here. It came quickly and felt great on. The headset was comfortable and the earpiece is nice and cushy.Talking with it plugged into the phone and walking around is why it gets the low rating. When moving around with the headset on, it had so much static that the other person couldn't hear me. Any movement of the cord made it screech and crackle, not really good when you need to talk to anyone. I am really disappointed in Panasonic for this poorly made product. So back it goes adn I'll have to buy some other model"},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for...","review":"What can I say? Its a pretty inexpensive headset, which is a huge plus. However, when the headset came in the mail, I pulled it out of the box and tried it on. It didn't fit real well. That's okay, but then when I got on a conference call, pretty much everyone on the call had a hard time understanding me. I had to take the headset off, and it was much better.

Also, great to use if you like to walk around the room a bit while talking on the phone.

The 1st I bought because the price was right, hence the title for this review. The second I bought because I couldn't believe that Panasonic would make a product with a defect like my first one knowingly, that it had to be a fluke. The third I bought because I couldn't afford anything better at the time. My next one will be a different make to be sure.Each of them has had the same failure. The wires leading from the phone to the headset are very, very small, and they break, causing lose of signal and static. At first I thought this was my fault; with my first one I kept catching the cord on various things around the house, and I figured that this abuse must have caused the failure. With the last 2 I've rigged up systems to keep even the weight of the cord from pulling down on the cable. Didn't matter. All of them have failed before a year was out."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm Sticking with This One!","review":"I've tried the blue toofs and the other wire ones.

I hear everyone very clearly though. I am very disappointed. I wish someone could give me tips on something I could do to improve the microphone quality. I tried taking the sponge off the mouthpiece but that didnt work either.

I have used this style of headset for years. It is comfortable, it leaves one ear uncovered so you can hear the rest of the world, and the earphone and microphone work fine. It will hook to your belt, and a small clip on the cord will hook to your shirt sleeve. I am fully mobile, with both hands free, as I walk about, talking.

No volume control or any of the bells and whistles a lot of headsets these days have. It's also got a cord, which some people don't like.

The microphone is in front of my mouth so the other person can hear me clearly. It may not be as \\"cool\\" as a Bluetooth that makes you look like a robot but its much more comfortable and usable.

It is flimsy and I accidentally pushed it too hard and it cracked. I also did not like the fact that there was not volume control and the caller sounded extremely loud. Other than that its an ok piece. I do not recommend it and think you would be pleased as I am with the next higher model from panasonic.I hope this helps someone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not bother, not worth it","review":"I truly can not believe how bad this headset is and I have no idea why it got good reviews. After about two days of using it, a horrible background buzzing noise set in and I could not hear a thing anyone was saying to me. I threw the headset out and called our phone guy who told me to buy a Plantronics one instead. I did and so far it's working fine.The worst part is that as I was cleaning house I found another old headset I'd bought a couple of years ago. That too had terrible sound so I realized I have twice bought the same lousy Panasonic headset. Not sure how it happened. I guess they had good reviews and the price was right. Please don't make the same mistake I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Started buzzing noise after only 1 day","review":"Only used this one day (maybe 5 hours total) when it started making a loud buzzing sound that could be heard by both the caller and the receiver.

I ended up buying the Plantronics model, and spend quite a bit more, but I really need a corded headset that allows me to hear clearly. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is the ease of set up: Plug in and go, no problem there. Otherwise its really poor quality for those who will be wearing it all day at work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great","review":"The mic seems to be poor at picking up sound because people on the other end of the line can't hear me very well.

I just got in today and tested it out. I can have it attached to my cordless house phone and the phone will still ring like normal. My husband drives truck so when he calls I always had to hold the phone while trying to do other things... tonight I was able to have my hands free to look up maps for him and to do the dishes without crooking my neck. Works fine, volume is good... does the job I bought it to do, not fancy yet practical... and it was cheaper on amazon (brand new) than at walmart when I ordered it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay, until it breaks","review":"I've ordered/used multiple of these headsets in the past. They work well and are comfortable enough, while they last. Each one that I've had has eventually broken, due to a poor design/materials used on the head band. The plastic is very thin and easily snaps (particularly at the adjustable area), causing the thing to break and become useless eventually. It might work for 3 months, 6 months or a year, but if you use it often, it will surely break on you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not compatible with Panasonic KX-TG7622B","review":"This appeared as \\"frequently purchased with Panasonic KX-TG7622B\\" when I went to purchase my Panasonic phone. Problem is, that's impossible! The Panasonic KX-TG7622B doesn't have a jack for a headset! And this item is cheap enough that it isn't worth the time and aggravation to send it back!So if customers are frequently buying it with the Panasonic KX-TG7622B, then they are practicing self-flagellation."},{"rating":"2","title":"I've gone through 4 of these, but I'm a glutton for headset addictions...","review":"It's sort of like an addiction that I can't kick. This headset is wonderful because it's comfortable, easy, simple, not fancy pants, inexpensive (which is probably why it breaks so easily) and extremely convenient.Unfortunately, the cord breaks very easily in around 6 months, and the headset will either quit working all together, or one day you might not hear them, but they can hear you, which was the case with this last headset.Oh well, here I go to spend another $8.85, since I like this headset so much (which is why I give this 4 stars)... :-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"poor quality out of the box","review":"I have tried this with a Panasonic phone and with a 3rd party branded phone that has a compatible adapter. For sound, I can hear, but it is muffled. When I tried speaking, it kept cutting out, and I had to go back to the handset.I find it unlikely that this is a Panasonic-branded headset. There is nothing printed on it indicating a part number, no instructions (though probably not necessary,) etc. However, this is no surprise for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"does not work with the phone","review":"Amazon suggested I purchased this for use with the Panasonic cordless phone. It didn't occur to me that there would be no way to connect it to the phone.

The company i ordered from did issue an immediate refund however I didnt want a refund, I wanted and need a product that worked for longer than 4 days! Nevertheless, i guess u get what u pay for and I do thank the company for the prompt refund but I'd rather have a working headset and u could've kept the refund!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great on cell and portable phone","review":"I already have one of these and I'm purchasing 2 more. One to keep in the car and another one for the house. I'm glad I did a search on the model. I almost bought it from another site for $24.99. This price is great. I've tried many earphones for my cell phone, none of them worked very well. This one works great, I never have trouble hearing or being heard. My son was using it on our portable phone because he tries to hold a phone, type on his computer keyboard and play guitar all at the same time. I made him use this to keep from getting kinks in his neck. I was so thrilled when I tried it on my cell phone and it worked, I can't standing holding a cell to my ear for long conversations. It's not compact but for the price I can just keep one in the car, so it doesn't need to be small. Enjoy"},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted to love this headset...","review":"I read a lot of great reviews so I ordered this without hesitation. But, the headset doesn't work very well. When I first received the headset the beginning of December 2007, I received complaints from friends on the other end of a call that they couldn't hear me very well. Too soft, hard to hear, though I could hear them clearly. Now 3 months later, I keep getting an annoying loud static sound which makes it hard to have a conversation. When I remove the headset, all is well. I'm very disappointed because I've only had the headset a short time and I feel like it was a waste of money. I had a great Plantronics phone and headset that worked well for years.

Filter on mouthpiece works. No interfering ambient audio to frustrate people listening to me. For less than 9 dollars. Hard to believe! No other wired headset I tried comes close to this Panasonic. No echoing or static! Volume control on cell is on medium and I can hear perfectly, and I can be heard perfectly. Only nine dollars. Amazing!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT a good headset.

It's comfortable, secure when gardening, but, I must hold my phone's mic to my mouth when speaking if I want to be heard. The Nokia E71 informed me to use it's mic as soon as the headset was plugged in. I still prefer using this headset to having the phone next to my head. I've had it only a few hours so, I can't speak to durability. Frye's matched the Amazon price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid for budget price","review":"Not your run of the mill cheap headset. The headset works on the ts105w phone that I also purchased. The sound is clear and crisp. The mike does need to be placed closer to my mouth, otherwise the voice comes across softly on the receiving end. Too bad there is no 'gain' function on the phone to amp up the mike. The over-the-head band is not too tight and appears to be able to withstand lots of use without breaking, but only time will tell (holding back on rating durability for that reason)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great headset","review":"I want to order another one of these for my son who recently got a \\"cell phone\\" ticket.

I have also found that while I can hear great on it, the person on the other end doesn't always hear me the best unless the microphone is very close to my mouth. It is comfortable to wear and worked well with my phone. I purchased this item for occasional home use. If I were using it more frequently I maybe would have gone with a different model. Seems to be a good value for the money.update - I quickly grew to dislike this model. I had more and more difficulty with the person I was talking to hearing me.

I ended up having to trade her for mine which has the piece that fits in your ear and loops over your ear without anything going over the top of her head. Again, however, I didn't mind trading her because I found it to be very comfortable for me, and it sounds great."},{"rating":"1","title":"panasonic kx-tca60 headset","review":"The headsets work well for a short time. They usually last about 4 months and then either the person with whom I am talking can not hear me or I can not hear him/her. Usually, something goes wrong with the wires. With this last one that I bought, the wire does not stay deep enough into the jack so neither the party with whom I am speaking, nor I, can hear one another. The only way that I can use the headset is if I hold the plug into the jack while I am talking. This headset worked well for only 1 month before the problems began. I have to keep re-ordering new headsets because I can not find any other headsets that fit into my phones jack. If I want a refund, I have to send the headsets back which costs $8 and the headsets only cost $11 so I'm saving $3 if I send them back.

This is essential so you can hear what you are saying. It is like a deaf person speaking. They can't tell what they sound like so they sound a little strange. This headset is the same experience.

For outgoing sound quality, a must in business, this is by far the best we have tried. We have owned a headset with an amplified earpiece which was inferior in sound quality to this model.

Having both hands free to do household chores while talking on the phone is a wonderful thing. I've always preferred headsets and have tried dozens of them over the years. This is the second Panasonic KX-TCA60 I have purchased. I had to replace the first one only because my cat chewed through the cord and I didn't hesitate to get the same one again. The sound quality is perfect. I sometimes get complaints about others being able to hear me if the mic is not right in front of my mouth, but the up side of that is the listener can't hear all of the background noise when I'm doing dishes, scooping litter boxes and such. Overall it is a very good headset for cordless phones. I have recommended it to friends and they, like me, don't know how they lived without it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tossed in the trash","review":"I work from a home office and am on the phone all day, every day.

The sound quality was not ideal to begin with, but you can expect that considering the price. The earpiece is comfortable and the piece can be adjusted easily. Daily use took its toll though. About a month ago the sound started to fade in and out. Seems to be a problem with the jack that hooks into the phone. No matter how much one pays for a product, it shouldn't go out within a few months of use."},{"rating":"1","title":"crackle, crackle","review":"I bought several of these because I had a panasonic that I used before and loved it.

I replaced this piece of junk with the same thing twice. They always break in exactly the same place, at the head band adjuster.It's a horrible design, a tiny bit of plastic is all that holds the band and ear piece together. I won't buy another one. My current one is epoxyed together.Look for a different brand. If you are thinking of getting a Panasonic phone and plan to use a head set, don't. You are required to use this junkie headset. A different brand phone will allow you to use a good headset."},{"rating":"1","title":"Purchased June 7, 2010.......","review":"Passed away November 7, 2012........and I understand I got off cheap.Some inexpensive stuff is just str8up crap.

Hogan"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre at Best..","review":"I bought this for the same reason that everyone else does - so that I can be on a call and still take notes, etc. The fit of the headset is a bit snug and the adjustment does not help a lot. Ear pad is covered in some sort of 'pleather' material that is warm when on the ear for any extended period. I am sure this will not be very comfortable in the summer months. My only frame of comparison is a Plantronics set that I used at work for several years. There IS no comparison really! I guess that for the price, you can't expect too much, so I gave this 2 stars for that reason alone. Everyone that I talk to says that my voice is reasonably clear and I can hear pretty well in the speaker of the set. All the same, I think that next time I will just go back to Plantronics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes, this really is great headset","review":"The other reviews are correct.

While we're very pleased with that purchase, it does have one annoying design quirk: the redial button is in a touchy position - try to tuck the phone in the crook of your shoulder and you're almost guaranteed to interrupt your current call. So, if you're an IT guy like me, be prepared to type with one hand. For that reason, a hands-free headset is a mandatory, ancillary purchase for the AT&T; DTECT phone system.The Amazon buying engine recommends buying this Panasonic KX-RCA60 Hands-Free Headset along with the AT&T; Four Handset product.

I use the phone a lot in my line of work and was looking for something that was comfortable to wear and that would have good sound quality, both on the receiver and on the other end. Because of the great price point I bought two, and I am not regretting it at all.Pros:- Good fit, still feels comfortable even after a while- great sound quality, both headphone and mic.- Loud, which is a good thing. With this headset I have to turn down the volume on my phone most of the time, leaving me some room to play with. Other headsets I always maxed out.- Solid quality- Incredibly priced, you don't always have to buy the most expensive to get good quality!Cons:None really...Some remarks:- Although the headset is a good fit, it might feel tight after a while, something I am used to now, but could get uncomfortable if you have to wear it all day.- The headset is pretty bulky, but that comes with the quality as well. headset feels solid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good for a telecommuter","review":"I agree the boom is longer, which can be an advantage.

The mic boom is longer than it is on many other headsets - an advantage. Earphone volume is no problem, and voice quality (what I hear on my end) is actually better than it is through the phone. Comfort is, to me, not great. However, I always modify headphones to reduce pressure and increase padding, as I am very particular about head and ear comfort.

I use them on my home cordless phones and on my cellphones. I've given a couple away to friends, like the gideons give away bibles -- because I'm a true believer! I keep two in the house (one for each cordless phone -- makes for some awesome conference calls) and one in the car for the cellphone, and one for a spare just in case, because I don't want to live without them!Honestly, I'd gladly pay $40 for a set this quality.

The sound quality with this Panasonic is very good and no one has had trouble hearing me speaking into the microphones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sound","review":"No, it's not one of those tiny, little in-the-ear headsets and you do look like Julie, the Time-Life operator from the old commercials. But the sound is great - both incoming and outgoing. It stays put once you have it on. I recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"headset is great","review":"this headset works well where others fail. talking volume is very good on cordless phones and cell phones. only complain is it is a little tight on my big head."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Preforming Headset","review":"I work from home and bought this headset to allow me to talk on the phone while working on the computer. This headset has the advantage of no extra (like volume controls , ...) features it is just a plane headset. I have been using it for a while and it works flawlessly.It takes abuse well it is constantly being knocked on the floor and the wires are run over by my chair and it still keeps working."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who wouldn't want this????","review":"Now that I have this, I can't believe I didn't buy one of these a long time ago; what a great solution when you have kids and housework but want to talk on the phone and still get things done!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Did Not Work","review":"I could hear the people who called me, but they couldn't hear me.

Will contact manufacturer regarding replacement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Static, and cuts out!","review":"I bought this because the Panasonic phone I have is so uncomfortable to hold, it causes muscle spasms in my hand after a few minutes. This headset has lots of static, and also cuts out every few seconds, making conversation all but impossible. It would only be throwing away good money after bad, to pay to return it, so instead I warn others not to waste their money on this item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misinformation from Amazon","review":"Be aware that this handset is for a *cordless* phone only... even though it was suggested as the perfect companion -- by amazon -- for the *corded* office phone I bought at the same time. And when you search for a headset for a corded phone, it shows up in the top results. Incredibly annoying. \\"Cordless\\" isn't mentioned in the bullet points for the product, either. This is more annoyance at Amazon's recommendation than at the product.

I was disappointed in almost all respects. The scope gave nice views, but was not functional otherwise. The tripod is too small. The one I received was scraped, and rusty. The focuser required two hands to move smoothly. The mount was wobbly. Don't believe you can take photos with this assembly. Glad this was not my first scope, or I'd be keeping fish instead. The mount and tripod certainly didn't help my opinion of Chinese imports."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you're a fan of Gould's 1981 recording, this is the transcription recording to listen to","review":"I see some people have completely missed the point of the recording: I could hear it right away, but it is also stated in the CD's notes, that this specific transcription, made in 1985, was dedicated to Glenn Gould. You can hear not only the inflections trying to mimic the Gould's voicing, but also the tempo contrasts as he intended them in his 1981 recording (the reasons for which he explains in an interview made shortly after).The phrasings in this recording echo not only the phrasing on a keyboard, but Gould's dynamics. Comparing this recording to any other pianist's recording completely, utterly misses the point of this fine recording."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great performance of truly gorgeous music","review":"Tchaikovsky's first ballet score, Swan Lake, is quite simply a masterpiece which revolutionized ballet music. Prior to Swan Lake the emphasis in ballet had been largely on the dancing, and most ballet scores had only been expected to be rythmic dance accompaniments that were, if possible, also fairly tuneful. True, Adam's Giselle and Delibe's Coppelia rose considerably above such modest expectations. But with his score for Swan Lake Tchaikovsky made the music fully as important as the dancing. In fact, he went further and created essentially a four act symphonic poem to accompany a spectacular ballet which could also be listened to and enjoyed on its own merits even by people uninterested in the dancing. This performance by Richard Bonynge is the greatest I've ever heard, fully worthy of Tchaikovsky's beautiful music. If you love great music, please get this oustanding CD set whether you are a ballet fan or not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Too Many Fans Out There?","review":"As the resident \\"House Of Shakira\\" expert, I'll go ahead and take this one. I waited awhile to review it, which was good, because it's grown on my over several months. First off...it's still not as good as their debut or 2nd cds. Their greatest hits cd is still the best bet for the uninitiated. This cd is close to \\"III\\" in sound and writing quality. There's no smash song that will knock your socks off, but as a whole, it's a fine listen. The re-do of \\"Black and Blue Skies\\" turned me off at first, but now it has turned into one of my favorite songs. \\"Celebration Bound\\" might sound closest to some favorites on previous cds, thus may be more accessable to the listener. \\"Landing\\" is also a great song. If you are a fan, pick this up...if not....start with \\"Best Of Two\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happens?","review":"My review is more of a question.

I wished he would of informed the reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never received our CD and never heard back from Gary's Books","review":"We paid Amazon for this CD and of course the money went to Gary's Books but we have not received our CD yet. 3 e=mails to Gary's books have never been answered or explained. The same to Amazon. So we will never feel confident about ordering anything again from Amazon.

My Eureka works great, very easy to operate and dispose of dirt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its [bad]","review":"I am amazed that this vacuum made it to market. It must have been pushed by the marketing dept and not the research dept. It works great for the first minute or two, until there is a inch or more of dirt against the 3x3 inch grill on the one side. All the air has to go thru the dirt in this one small area and the air flow goes to next to nothing and all suckion stops. If you want a bagless, get one with the grill vertcally between the two compartments. This gives a large enough space for the air to go thru and the wind action keeps the dirt from piling on the grill.The little upright Dirt Devil has the same type of grill but it is just used for small clean ups so the dirt cup gets emptied often."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this!","review":"I bought this vacuum several years ago and it has never worked properly. First, the light broke, which wasn't a big deal, but then the motor burned out. It was less than one year old. Then within the next year, after the motor had been replaced, it blew out again. Now, this last week, the belt broke. Their customer service is terrible. I will never buy a Eureka product again."},{"rating":"2","title":"America's Historic Trails","review":"I first stumbled on ths series on public television about ten years ago. I was captivated by the content and Tom Bodett's wry delivery. Though ten years old, this series is hardly dated. It remains a poignant and reverant travelouge and worth the effort to watch it again and again.The series covers the theme of trails that helped define and develop America. It covers colonial eastern trails across the county to the western trails up to the Yukon Gold Rush. The theme has not rally been adequately repeated ever since. For this reason this series remains the standard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please LOOK INSIDE!","review":"I wished I would have looked more closely inside (see pages 5-6), as another reviewer had wished for more \\"commentary\\" and another warned it was \\"just\\" a harmony of the gospels, \\"that's it\\". On the contrary, nearly half of every page on average (which pages 5-6 exemplify) is occupied by the author's own notes and commentary, which I found rarely contributed much. This book could have been half the size or length had it just been the gospel texts themselves. All the emboldened words and phrases have just been distracting for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hope the 3rd time is the charm","review":"I have to RMA two of these kits already.The first pair (double-row of LEDs) would get too hot after an hour of use.

I thought it was a game I installed, but after uninstalling, I started seeing BSOD a day or two later. I ran memtest86 and saw errors on one of the sitcks. Re-tested them individually and one of the sticks had lots of errors.

I've probably RMA'd more than 12 sticks of Crucial Ballistix memory (both Tracer and non-Tracer) in the past 2 years. They all seem to eventually fail. They might work well for awhile and last a few months, but eventually they seem to fail and need to be RMA'd. I don't overclock the memory and other brands of RAM don't have this problem.
