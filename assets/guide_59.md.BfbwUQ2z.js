If Stump is ripping from anyone it's Blackmore, not Yngwie. I've been playing for over 15 years & have been a shred junkie since the early 80's. I'm well versed in Yngwie & all the other usual suspects of the shred/neoclassical gengres. Stump has his own sound & style that is waaay more blues based than anything Yngwie does. If you like shred you'll love this CD. It rocks from the first track to the last, not a bad song in the bunch. You're tone deaf if you can't hear the emotion & passion in Stump's playing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I can't recommend this record as I've heard it all in the past.

Limited selection of hikes as ones I was looking for were not included."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bates is captivating","review":"To begin with, I'm not certain which movie the previous reviewer was talking about, but it certainly wasn't \\"The Shout\\" with Alan Bates.\\"The Shout\\" centers upon the actions of a quiet and mysterious traveler, who, after many years in the Australian Outback, arrives in a rural English town and takes temporary housing with a local couple.Told in retrospect from a mental institution, Bates' sophisticated but dark character unravels a tale that seems, at first, to be the musings of a disturbed megalomaniac. However, as we are drawn into his world, we are inclined to wonder if a clear line can be drawn between fantasy and reality.The movie is powerful, yet subtle and weaves an atmosphere of quiet tension."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great surreal drama","review":"Along with Deep End and Moonlighting, this is one of Jerzy Skolimowski's best films. Starting with a cricket game at a British mental institution, it moves back in time to tell the story of a strange drifter, played by Alan Bates, who comes upon the home of a young couple. The wife, pretty Susannah York, is intrigued with the handsome drifter; complications arise.But this is not the standard love triangle story at all. Bates' character claims to have a bizarre ability which should not be revealed here--which he learned while adrift in the Australian outback for several years. The final revelation of this ability and its consequences are a powerful climax to a riveting film that effectively puts the tale of the outsider in a startling context. The tension here is subtle and strong, giving this film a momentum that holds the viewer captive, just as Bates' character himself holds the couple psychological captives.Highly recommended; deserves much wider recognition."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BASIC INTRODUCTION TO GROUPWORK","review":"Easily the best reference text for groupwork studies that are applicable to social work, youth and community work and all other groupwork settings. This book provides insight into the definitons of groupwork, the processes in working with groups, dynamics and roles as well as some interesting case studies. A must for all those embarking on public sector courses that require a foundation knowledge of how groups work. Enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just OK","review":"I can't believe all the 5 star reviews of this cd. It is a strictly average rock album. It opens strongly for the first 5 miniutes and then just kinds of rocks along with no real peak. There are very nice parts on the cd but these are usually short and stopped with singing or pounding hard rock parts. My main problem with the cd is that good prog rock has complex and interesting instrumental passages and interplay among the musicians and this release lacks that. Bottom line is there is just too much singing on this one. The first Transatlantic is a gem but this one just doesn't go anywhere. Don't buy this one until you have the first Transatlantic, all of the Flower Kings and V and Darkness by Spocks Beard."},{"rating":"1","title":"There is no 21\`st century Yes","review":"After classic 70\`s (Yes, Crimson, Genesis, Floyd etc.)this one sounds like .......you know what classic music made after Mozart,Beethoven etc. is .......So, please don\`t hype it.......Fine print: Even worst Yes, Floyd etc. is way better than any new neo - prog bands best CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"You have to be kidding?","review":"If anyone who heard the first CD by this all-star prog band and like this second attempt has not listened deeply to it. I found every song on this CD to be weak andd hollow when compared to the first CD. I listened to to this CD about 6 times and traded it in at my local used CD store. I think the members of this group took them selves to seriously and thought they could throw anything together and it would smell like a rose. Most reviewers think so but I urge you to listen deeply to it. You to will be at your used CD store finding something interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"'taint SMPTe...","review":"Musical gym overcompensaters might like it, but that's if you actually consider Dream Theatre to be progressive (I dig Mike Portnoy's drumming, but he should lose THAT band). Some of it sounds like they're trying to rip off Tool, another great band, but C'mon, guys, did YOU have to?!? I gave SMPTe 5 stars; it deserves 15 1/2, but the sophmore release sounds like alcoholics-turned-Christian rockers would worship it, good or bad. Oh well; sorry Pete; you're still my bass player hero!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly Good","review":"I bought this disc more on a hunch than anything else. The cover art was seriously cool and I was looking for some new prog rock to sink my teeth into. My hopes weren't all that high as supergroups rarely live up to their individual pasts. Sure, this group contianed a member of my beloved Dream Theater, but that was just the drummer. The rest of the group came from prog rock outfits that not as prog metal or guitar oriented.Going in with these concerns, what a pleasent journey was my first listen through the disc! This is any progressive lover's dream. Looooooong cuts where everyone gets their chops in, yet they hold together remarkably well. Nothing degenerates into showmanship for the sake of showing off and the end result is a high quality outing that should satisfy fans of any of the members' original groups (Dream Theater, Spock's Beard, Marillion, and the Flower Kings)."},{"rating":"2","title":"an excellent album","review":"Bridge across Forever, IMO, is a stronger album than SMPT:e. Yes, the first album had some great tunes. Yes, they were mostly written by Neal. That's not a fault, for whatever reason the band had for using Neal's songs, SMPT:e is great. However, I think that opening the writing sessions up to the whole band, you end up with a more organic album.I have the limited two disc set, and listening to the second disc, you can hear how these guys a) work hard to make the music just right and allow it to grow into itself and b) how much fun they have with each other, i.e. the studio chat track and the covers of And I Love Her and Smoke on the Water."},{"rating":"2","title":"Album of the Year (barring contenders in Nov & Dec)","review":"Who'd of thought they could've topped SMPT:E? This is probably the best four track, 76 minute CD ever released. If you like Yes or ELP you're bound to enjoy this CD, as it's definitely got that sort of feel. Not as hard as Dream Theater, as poppy as Marillion, grander than Spock's Beard, and more easily accessible than Flower Kings, this group is more than the sum of its parts. Definitely bodes well for the future!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I somewhat agree with reviewer LoveJoy.","review":"Yes, this album sounds like Agnostic was tryin a bit to replay their old school days, but you could sence that they were now older.

Purchased these thermal pads for use in installing a new heatsink and fan assembly into my HP Pavilion dv2911us laptop. These pads were extremely thin - all five put together wouldn't equal one-quarter of the thickness of the original thermal padding I wanted to replace. Secondly, the adhesive backing was so tight against the pads that I couldn't separate the thermal material from the backing without tearing the thermal material.If you want to replace thick thermal padding from a laptop, do yourself a favor and buy the proper material from a laptop parts reseller.If you are applying fresh thermal material to a computer and you don't require thickness, just get thermal compound."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works if you follow the instructions carefully.","review":"Pros: Works, if you follow the instructions carefully.Cons: The stuff is really sticky, i.e. hard to remove if you get it on where it should not be. :)Other thoughts: This is a _pressure-applied_ adhesive, i.e. one has to apply pressure to it after it has been put on the first surface (after the clear plastic is removed, but before the removal of wax paper). One will have to try it once or twice before they would get the hang of it. As with everything else like this, clean the surfaces sufficiently (and dry!) for it to be applied properly. My application was to surfaces that are much smaller than the pad - had to cut one pad into multiple smaller pieces (made this harder than it would be with the whole pad applied)."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is junk","review":"The wax paper was on the sticky side, and the plastic on the non-sticky side, instead of the other way around as it's supposed to be.

WRONG! I destroyed three of them as they did not stick and they are way too thin. The other two I got rid of. DO NOT BUY THIS JUNK. Besides, the shipping cost was higher than the actual purchase.

I should have listened to other reviews, but I figured, \\"nah, that's just people who don't know how to use the product complaining\\". Bad move.

The thermal pad is INCREDIBLY thin and does not separate from the paper it comes with, thereby making it useless. After trying three pads, I threw the rest away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible; try another product","review":"As others have said, this product DOES NOT STICK to the heat exchanger so you cannot get the backing peeled.

So far, CPU has not overheated yet, so I guess the product works, but it is a pain to get it off the paper."},{"rating":"1","title":"It melted onto the processor","review":"Two weeks after putting it on, I check it and it seemed to have melted onto the processor. It was much more difficult to remove this than removing a regular thermal paste. For me it seemed to work for properly for maybe five days.

Button Manager functionality works as advertised, and device is whisper quiet. Overall a great piece of gear at a great price... excellent value. Thinking of getting a second one soon, since I've filled this one about 75% full with work in progress. Looks to be straightforward enough to just daisy chain another one off the back (there are 2 FW800 ports, 1 FW400, and 1 USB2.0), so I might just have a go at that soon.

This title deserves to have an English version. If you like genuine french artists, then buy this album, you won't be dissapointed. If you don't understand french, have the lyrics translated for you. If you can't find anyone to translate them for you...then, just sit back and relax with the sound of his magical music.

I also have an injury to my big toe and am always embarrased by flip flop type shoes which also kill my heels. Well Bali is amazing! It covers the top of 3-4 toes to protect against scrapes and bumps. I tried walking on the sidewalk scraping where my big toe would normally be but the toe bumper took all the impact. I also wear these into the shower at the gym and wear them around the house as slippers. They are just so comfortable! If I didn't live in new england I would wear these outside in the winter lol.

I have 3 pair of sandals, a pair of boots and these \\"flip flop\\" type sandals. I've had two of my regular sandals for over 2 years and they're well worn. I loved these the moment I got them. They are cute and comfortable. But I've had them for less than 4 months and they are falling apart. I haven't worn them any more or less than any other keen sandals, so I'm not sure why they're falling apart. I may have gotten unlucky, but I wouldn't buy them if they aren't on sale.

While not the most glamorous sandals I've ever purchased, they are the most comfortable. I ordered a second pair in the pink and they are more feminine than the black. I love that I don't stub my toe anymore either. I haven't had any trouble with them not drying out after getting wet and they seem to wear very well so far. I highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE MY KEENS!!!","review":"This is one of five pairs of Keens' sandals that I own and is my favorite.

I only heard of them through Amazon's automatic recommendation thingy. I've been a fan of the Jayhawks, Wilco, Patty Griffin, BoDeans, etc. for years, and have suffered through Ryan Adams -- what a disappointment! Completely overrated. Anyhow, Old 97's are my new favorites. This album is great fun. It combines country twang with catchy, original melodies and VERY smart, but simple lyrics. Miller's voice is perfect for this style. The \\"Do you wanna mess around\\" line in \\"Buick City Complex\\" is both endearing and sexual -- innocent but eager. This is my favorite song. \\"Designs on You\\" also has some great lyrics. I could go on and on, but I need to check out their other albums now. As I said, I had no idea these guys existed...on one hand, I'm bummed I didn't find them earlier, but finding them now has come at the perfect time.

Yeah, it's a bit more \\"pop\\"y than even Fight Songs was, but there's still the underlying coolness that makes you love them. I've seen Rhett in his solo So.Cal. gigs, so a lot of the songs weren't new to me, but it was cool hearing the full band behind them. Each of the songs has a hook that pulls me in...and I noticed that it's best played LOUD. Can't wait for them to come back to town...I'll be there!"},{"rating":"2","title":"!! Agree !!","review":"The adjacent review (with the 4.0 scale) is on-the-money!(even if he doesn't know the name of track #3).

It was FS: so I tend not to be as critical about that last release as their older fans.........but I am seriously addicted.\\"Buick City Complex\\" is the strong one here....talk about a new take on Joel's \\"Allentown\\" or Bruce's \\"My Hometown\\"!!!!Guys, also note: Chick dig this stuff/this band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"At the risk of death by flame from long-time fans, I bought Too Far To Care a few years back and wasn't immediately taken by it.Fast-forward to the present day.

This has to be the most amazing album of this or any other year.I do regret not being with this band from the start but I'm here now and I can't say enough good things about this album, the songs, the production, etc. etc. I simply don't see how you can be disappointed.Personal faves: King Of All The World, Can't Get A Line.Cheers..."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Instant Classic","review":"This is the best album of 2001 - and it will be very difficult for any album to top it. If you are not familiar with Old 97's, it is now time to discover them. One of their songs (from a previous album) was featured in the main title sequence to the film \\"Clay Pigeons\\" and they have consistently penned some terrific songs. This latest work, \\"Satellite Rides,\\" is their best album to date and we can only hope that there are many more albums to come. One song in particular, \\"Buick City Complex\\" is an instant classic.These guys are terrific! Who says you can't find great music these days?!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the best Old 97's but not the worst either","review":"Having lived in Nashville at the time of the country alternative explosion in the 90's, the Old 97's were one of the later bands to come from that time.Most were probably exposed to the Old 97's by the single \\"What I wouldn't do\\" and purchased this disc. Sadly they probably didn't purchase any other Old 97's because this one feels a little \\"tired\\".The country altenative movement can definitely trace its roots back to the late 70's new wave movement. To me no disc realizes this country alternative genre from the 70's better than Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers \\"You're Gonna Get It\\" album.My recommendation is if you want to purchase an Old 97's is there are a couple better than Satellite Rides and purchase some of the songs from Rides individually."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not an E-ticket ride, though....","review":"i am an admitted Old 97's fan, and am all for the \\"evolution\\" of a band, but this CD is their weakest by far IMHO. i have had to purchase new copies of Too Far to Care, Wreck Your Life and Fight Songs because i wore them out. this one just sits in its case, and not because it's less alt-country, but because musically it just doesn't hang together as a whole, doesn't have the flow and cohesiveness of their other releases, tho there are a few standout tracks. feels like they're THINKING about it too much....a big disappointment to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good collection, with Siegel's best song","review":"This is a good collection. The title very song is good, along with \\"Love is the Power,\\" \\"Falling Angel,\\" and (to a lesser extent) \\"When it's Over.\\" A couple of songs are not all that good, and the rest are OK.BUT this album has Siegel's best-ever song, \\"Rhapsody.\\" If you decide not to buy this album, at least browse over to \\"Along the Way\\" (Siegel's Greatest Hits collection) and spend a buck to download the track \\"Rhapsody.\\" You won't be sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dan should re-record \\"Feelin' Happy\\" ..............","review":"There are a few nice tunes here, but they need a revamp because the synths sound so prehistoric.

As mentioned by previous reviewers, tempos are too fast. What does it mean that to consider the initial chorus \\"Kommt, ihr Toechter, helft mir klagen\\" (come ye daughters, share my mourning) as a jig? Not what Bach meant!

When I started looking through it I was interested in the low budget makeovers and pleased to see the first one (or so) was done for approx. $100. That was really the one and only low budget makeover in the book! All the others were done for $1000's. Not exactly \\"every budget.\\" Oh well, the pictures were interesting.

Second hand tick is particularly loud2. Too much writing on the dial (Indiglo, Water resistant) makes it look too busy"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good casual watch, solid bargain","review":"Have had this watch for about six months, and it keeps time to within three seconds of my original setting. The Indiglo feature, and luminous hands and dial make it VERY easy to read at night, although the date feature is a bit small. The band is comfortable, but beware that it will lose its brown \\"tan\\"--likely the dye wearing away--if it becomes wet, and the band will take on a mottled brown/black appearance. Still, it's hard to beat this casual watch at this price point (I paid less than $50), and the cream-colored dial/blue second hand add just enough panache to set it apart from a lot of other relatively inexpensive watches."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped working after 10 months","review":"About 8 months after I purchased this watch, it stopped running.

This book left me in tears and I have read it probably five times in 15 years. It is so beautifully paced. You fall in love with the main character and you really feel for her.

I have read at least 30 Pike books and this one was the worst I have experienced. I would not recommend this book to anyone but HUGE Pike fans and fans of the Supernatural subplots in bad soap operas. Unlike most Pike books, this one felt like he wrote it in a matter of hours. I almost felt insulted he wrote it expecting his usual fan to enjoy it.

For the most part, Izzy Stradlin & the Ju Ju Hounds plays less like Guns and more like The Rolling Stones, which were a big influence on Izzy. Izzy's first post-Guns work is considered by many to be a modern blues rock masterpiece. Released within a year of his departure from Guns, it's a very strong first release, and also the easiest to acquire. It has a looseness about it that corporate rock seems to lack. Maybe the relief of leaving the worlds biggest (at the time) and most volatile band allowed for Izzy to write such a laid back album. I don't know. I do know that it's a damn fine effort, and that listening to this makes it pretty clear that Izzy had a profound effect on GNR's sound.Highlights:\\"Somebody Knockin\\"\\"Shuffle It All\\"\\"Train Tracks\\"\\"Cuttin' the Rug\\"\\"Take a Look at the Guy\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"love it.","review":"I reallly enjoyed this album, a lot. I like this album because it kinda has a bluesy, old school vibe that you can kinda nod your head to and kinda dance to. My favorite song would have to be Take a Look at That Guy. It's very catchy and I just wanna dance around my room to this. The song I liked least would probably be Pressure Drop, this sounds kinda bothers me. not quite sure why...I think Izzy should be appreciated for more things besides the fact that he was a rhythm guitarist in Guns N' Roses."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure Rock and Roll","review":"Broke out this disc the other night and listened to it for the first time in years, and it re affirmed to me what a truly great album this is. Just a truly pure rock and roll masterpiece, no pretense, no bullsh*t, the sound is like a great band, playing great songs in some out of the way half filled bar you stumbled into on a great road trip, you sit back listen and cant beleive how good it sounds. too bad its out of print. if you can buy it used grab it"},{"rating":"1","title":"a collection of junk","review":"Izzy Stradlin was the best songwriter in Guns & Roses. He wrote most of the band's well known and most timeless songs. He was also an excellent singer and he sang some of our favorite GNR songs such as; Dust N Bones, 14 Years, and Double Talkin Jive. Without Izzy GNR imploded, shriveled up and died a slow death. Unfortunatley, Izzy seems to have blown his load with GNR. His first solo album is a boring, mess of an album. Its uninspired and flat and not at all indictive of what Izzy seemed capable of..."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Rolling Stones without emotion ...","review":"It was mentioned that this CD sounds like TRS which is true.Unfortunately, it lacks any impetus to listen to it.CD already gone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just some trace of what GNR was","review":"I bought this CD because I think there is not a lot of good rock music nowadays. I was trying to find something new (new for me) with a touch of good old rock. I tought that Izzy Stradlin, being one of the main songwritters of GNR had to write at least a couple of great songs for his debut solo album. However, it was dissapointing to find out that this CD is just full of mediocre songs. In fact these songs sound just like the usual GNR filler songs that one doesn't listen too often from their CDs. some better than the other but not a single song to mention. Well, I should have known better why this album was not very popular back then when Izzy was incredibly famous."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Difference Between Good Rock and Great Rock","review":"Do you like Exile on Main Street? Are you going on a short trip? This is the album for that. It is one of the most over looked albums of the nineties, it rocks, has a great cover (Pressure Drop), and has the energy lacking from so called rock bands today. This one holds up. It still sounds fresh today (2006), maybe he wasn't so dumb to leave G-n-R when he did. Izzy got some money and decided to make some killer ROCK. He stuck to his guns more than some of his other former band mates, bless him for that. It goes to show you, rock will never die!!! More than worth a good listen!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure rock and roll","review":"This release has a very different sound from Guns N' Roses' brand of hard rock. Izzy Stradlin' and the Ju Ju Hounds sound more like The Black Crowes than GN'R. The difference between Black Crowes and Izzy is that Izzy includes some punk-sounding songs along with the rock and roll. Some of the highlights are Somebody Knocking and Shuffle it all, which got some MTV airplay for a while. Is a good work overall, but no for every Guns N' Roses fan. If you like Rolling Stones or Black Crowes, then you'll be pleased with this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read for friends and family members of IBD sufferers","review":"For years, myself, my friends, and my family have struggled with feeling helpless as my physical and mental health fluctuate due to the unpredictable nature of IBD. Jim's book offers the heartfelt insights about coping with chronic disease that I have been either too tired or too afraid to admit to even my closest companions. While this book offers an honest voice I can commiserate with, it is a much needed resource for anyone who wants to understand what it means to be sick with IBD. I cannot recommend this book highly enough for both the sufferer and those who want to learn more."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very difficult year, indeed!","review":"This is such an important book for anyone suffering from any chronic uncomfortable symptoms to read and then apply to the reality that they must work at understanding the workings of their own minds and bodies along with accepting advice from the quickly changing views of the medical and pharmaceutical people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry to disagree...","review":"As a person who has struggled with Crohn's disease for years- I had hoped this book would offer some useful information. Instead, after buying it out of my now very meager income- I got to read some guy's diary about how he felt. It was not useful to me at all- except that it will hold the front door open to let the fresh air in. If you have Crohn's disease or suspect it- I beg you to read Jill Sklar's book or 'Straight from the gut'- both are available on Amazon and both are very, very helpful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"I purchased this book after reading a blurb in the local paper about the author speaking at Barnes & Noble. I was unable to attend but ordered it through Amazon. The book sounded like a helpful way to share what a Crohn's patient feels with my spouse/family. As it turns out, the author suffers from Crohn's of the colon only and does not experience the daily pain that 80% of patients do. The major issue for me wasn't even covered! The second problem I had with it was, no offence, it was written from a very male point of view. As a woman, ego & ability to deal with emotional issues are not experienced in the same way as an alpha male type. I think he just needed a Xanax! He does offer an entire chapter about the importance of being your own patient advocate & I think that's definitely an important point to cover when dealing with any chronic medical condition."},{"rating":"1","title":"jetsn","review":"I was very disappointed.

Thank you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alive and struggling","review":"It's almost as if Primo Levi didn't know what kind of a point he wanted to make with this book. Else the whole tone of Survival at Auschwitz must be subverted. In Survival Levi had a very set time and experience to relate. In The Reawakening there is travelling and motion. Levi goes all over the place trying to get back home and the people he encounters on the way are wonderfully alive. There is exhilaration and there is the pain of knowing that things will never be the same. At the end you are left with several conflicting emotions, as Levi knows that part of him died in Auschwitz and isn't sure which parts are still alive"},{"rating":"2","title":"They're Slipping But The Album Still Has Heart","review":"The reunion piece from the boys of the self-confessed cookie-cutter band, Pulley, should ooze with unbridled energy, but unfortunately Radinsky's vocals just seem subdued and the rest is so immaculately produced it's often hard to make an emotional connection. The Ocean Song is the standout track of the album, most of the rest are adequately catchy, but there are some woefully tuneless songs in there too (History Repeats Itself, Leather Face). Radinsky's vocals skip between the unaccompanied sound of @#!* and the vocal layerings of Matters effectively, but his constant habit of overextending his notes at times grows tiresome. It seems Pulley have slipped even more into the realm of the ordinary with this album, but not for a lack of sincerity or as a result of selling out. When Radinsky claims, \\"I don't write this music with intent to pay my bills,\\" you can't help but believe him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rubber head author","review":"This is probably one of the few books I have read that goes totally in the wrong direction. In this book, he discusses the problems with traffic using the same frame that has been used the past 50 years ... V/C ratios and such. Nothing new here. The only value of this book is for those who want to understand exactly what is wrong with urban planning. This book is essentially a step-by-step guide on how to take the humanity out of urbanity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great toy, doesn't do much but for looks","review":"This is a great toy if your a fan of the films, but the tail really kills the fun level.

Yes, the love story is there, but a lot of action happens too. The setting of the story takes place in the Dark Ages in England and Ireland. There is a war going on between the 2 islands when love is created between Tristan and Isolde. I believe that both the starring characters were played by wonderful people. They give the movie a realistic view to it. I would definitely recommend this movie to anybody. Even the guys!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not exactly the same.....But great!!!","review":"This film was great if u like this sort of thing. I suggest you see it. It wasnt exactly the way the story goes but it is still a great story. I know that this is a story that will be told to my family for generations to come. This movie moved me unlike it did to other people. I want to have a love as strong and passionate as Tristan and Isoldes (without the love triangle). But I just want to say that this story really comes alive with James Franco and Sophia Myles"},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly affecting","review":"This version does not follow the classical Arthurian form of the Tristan and Isolde legend. However, I found the logic of the film to be internally consistent. I enjoyed that Lord Marke was an honorable and kind man that both Tristan and Isolde respect and care for. The three main characters are complex and not caricatures; having Marke be a decent person makes Tristan and Isolde's decisions that much more painful (and truer to life-- love triangles are rarely made up of clearly good and clearly evil people).James Franco's Tristan is subtle and restrained. Some have called his performance wooden-- I suggest that the viewer needs to look more closely at Tristan's expressions. Franco manages to convey pain and regret quietly, without any scenery chewing.Swordfighting and horsemanship are excellent (particularly nice is the final fight in the tournament between Tristan and Wictred). The love scenes are quite tastefully done; never more than bare shoulders or upper back are shown."},{"rating":"1","title":"visually beautiful","review":"This is probably the most visually beautiful movie I've ever seen. That said, the romantic triangle is much better known as part of the Arthurian legend, so there's little that's new. In fairness, this legend predates the Arthurian legend, but that doesn't negate the feeling that you've seen this done many times and much better. Worse, the lead actors have zero screen chemistry. As a result, I couldn't have cared less that they weren't together. My best friend and I had a moderate amount of fun watching this since we started making fun of the characters early in the film, but it wasn't a total waste. The redeeming quality is how utterly gorgeous the film looks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring movie","review":"I am really suprised by all the glowing reviews of Tristan and Isolde. I thought the movie was very boring. I didn't think the movie was well written at all. I do like this type of movie but not this one.I think the fact that Tristan and Isolde loved each other but couldn't fully be together, because she ended up married to someone else seems like it would be interesting, but somehow is just fell short for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pile of suck.","review":"This movie was boring. Gouge-my-eyes-out boring. Please-stop-the-pain boring. Make-it-end boring. Until the very end, when our hero manages to survive for half an hour after having his heart bisected by a broadsword. But, never fear, the boredom continues for a good ten minutes afterward.

This movie captures the forbidden love and the tragedy of this medieval story wonderfully!A must see!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty and Worth Watching","review":"The film \\"Tristan and Isolde\\" combines aspects from the variations of the original folktale to present a story that is appealing at this day in age. The beautiful cinematography (except the annoying letters against the blue screen-- can't read those!) and rich costuming will appeal to any film enthusiast. The romance and plot may appeal most to adolescents, because they are characteristically likely to share the lovers' impulsiveness and passion. But anyone who has ever been in love will appreciate this story. I find it is a film that improves with each viewing."},{"rating":"1","title":"An insult to the honorable","review":"This movie is ok in its way, howver, those connected with it obviously have no concept of the meaning of honnor or duty and, if they have ever bothered to read the original romance understood nothing. Tristan in this version is spitefull, self-centered and mean spirited. He blames Isolde for the failure of his relationship and forces her to betray her husband, and the man who cared for him a a child. The mythical Tristan was a man of great honor and integrity, who put honor, loyalty and duty above all else. He did not betray his lord or his friends. King Mark of Cornwall in the legend wrongly suspected the couple of an illicit affair. Incidentally, the makers of this movie also call Tristan 'Traistan of Aragon' which is in Spain. He was actually from Lyonesse, which now lies beneath the English Channel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful movie!","review":"I found this movie to be truly moving - a beautiful, tragic love story. I absolutely loved it. It was easy to empathize with the characters, to laugh with them, cry with them, and feel my heart break for them. My only wish would be for the DVD to have more special features...deleted scenes...an alternate ending..."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Underrated film...","review":"I'm not sure why this film was panned and virtually ignored. It weaves complex elements together and forces the viewer to look at both sides. This movie is based on the legend Tristan and Iseult, two star-crossed lovers in England and Ireland after the fall of the Romans. There are different versions of this tale and this film deviates from those but still manages to entertain and pull at your heart strings in this portrayal of tragedy, love, duty and greed. By the title and tag line you know and want to root for Tristan and Isolde but Lord Marke isn't the villain in this film. American Hollywood would've made Lord Marke the villain rather than going deeper and exploring other interesting themes. Perhaps the lack of big name actors hurt the film but I see it as a good thing, all the roles are perfectly cast and effectively bring the story to life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unforgetable Love Story","review":"I cannot stop watching this movie it is so good the best love story since titanic for me!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"worst movie ever","review":"It was terrible. Tristan was the greatest fighter around and had the most melancholy spirit. He spent most of the movie morose and scowling. yes, his family died, but EVERYONE'S family died at the beginning. as for Isolde, she she had an opportunity to not marry King Mark-when she first met him she could have been honest with him-, but she married him anyway, and then started sleeping around behind his back. i cant feel any sympathy for her because she chose to marry someone other than Tristan and then she chose to cheat and then she chose to run away from her problems which screwed up everyone else's lives."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hit the snooze button...","review":"This movie is cheesy and contrived. It consists of one worn out cliche after another, from beginning to end. The movie may be based on a beautiful story, but the screenplay is uninspired and forgettable. The only reason it even rises to the level of two stars is due to mildly acceptable performances by the actors, and some nice cinematography sprinkled in here and there. I paid $1 to see this flick at the local cheap theatre, and it was worth not one penny more. I found myself bored for the entire two hours. Thumbs down!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my cup of tea","review":"Bought this video because my dad said it was a wonderful movie. I am probably more old fashioned than my dad even because i thought the whole concept was bad. I did not enjoy the thought of a woman being with 2 men no matter what the reason. Or the other way around for that matter. A love story that is based on betrayal of the worst kind isn't worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deceptive Advertising by Amazon","review":"I ordered this DVD (Tristan + Isolde, 20th Century Fox) fully expecting it to be a DVD production of the Wagner opera. There was nothing I saw on Amazon.COM to indicate it was just a movie. Needless to say I am very disappointed. I believed I was searching under \\"Opera\\" and \\"Wagner\\", so I believed that the \\"Tristan + Isolde\\" I ordered was indeed the opera.SO, I am accusing Amazon of false and disceptive advertising.

Fortunately the movie doesn't try to stick to Wagner's version of the story which would be too static for a two hour film. What we do see is a wonderful variation on the story which is quite believable. Everything is well done and tragic in the best sense of the word. The locations evoke dreamlike imagery and there's even something of a liebestod in the conclusion. Beautiful moviemaking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed ~ Rufus Sewall is the only Exception","review":"Boring, contrived, predictable and over-dressed for the poor writing. Romantic?? 'Getting it on' love scenes do not equate to romance. There is no subtle tension, no evolution, no surprise, and no chemistry whatsoever between Tristan and Isolde. They were not believeable or interesting together for one moment. I thought there was much more of a touch of romance and chemistry between Isolde and Lord Marc. I had to fast forward thru the over-gory fight scenes as I think much of the graphic violence serves as filler to make up for uninteresting dialogue and plot. I do not like the vacant, boyish, brooding Tristan; wrong casting choice there. The Isolde actor is unremarkable paired up with him. There is some good photography, but it does not compensate for the unengaging story. My one good comment is Rufus Sewall is very good; every scene he is in is a momentary relief from it's dullness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slowly paced in parts","review":"Yet this film was a good rendition of an ageless story of duty -v- love.James Franco does a passable job of the hero who is in love with one he is not meant to haveThe downside is some dialogue is a little unclear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tristan and Isolde","review":"If you like swarmy soap operas, you may enjoy this movie. This was a terrible adaptation! The story of Tristan and Isolde is supposed to be about an anguised love that cannot be. At the very least, you are supposed to feel the couple's longing to be with each other. You can never feel this because the characters are rolling around the forest every five minutes. The tension of never being together isn't in this movie, because they ARE together all the time --which completely defeats the point of the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful","review":"This is one of my favorite love stories. I didn't even mind the ending :) I fell in love with Tristan and Isolde from the beginning. For those of us who wonder if true love is real...this movie gives you hope.

I do not at all agree with reviews I have read about it not being a good love story and it making you roll your eyes. It was very good, good actors, good story. I would actually prefer this over a number of love stories, it's in my top 3 of them. And I have also read that it's not believable that they fell in love in just a few days, but what about Romeo and Juliet?..that was basically love at first sight. I am one of the most romantic saps you will ever meet and I am very judgemental about love stories. To me, along with Pride and Prejudice and Romeo and Juliet, this is one of the best love stories ever told."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a WONDERFUL Love Story","review":"If you are into love stories with a lot of action, this movie is for you!!!

They have so much chemistry on screen....BUY IT!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tony Robbins?","review":"I could not stand this book. It used verbs like it was going out of style. It tries to make you believe that you're about to embark upon an amazing adventure of learning where discoveries will lead to ultimate fulfillment and success :) . It's 75% fluff to make you believe that all life problems will be solved if only you could learn how to learn. It was like Anthony Robbins wrote it. Motivational B.S.. Some of it was good, if you siffed long enough you could get a couple gold flakes out of this one, that's why I gave it 2 stars instead of a deserving 1. But it was so anoying in how it was written. It was so bad I had a hard time paying attention. Awful motivational and persuasive [stuff]. Do waste you money buying this. ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"flo n go gas pump","review":"I was completely dissatified with my purchase.

While I realize working out is a serious thing... adding light-heartedness, ease, cheer, and plain enjoyment can really change your whole outlook on what you are actually doing. I completed this workout and felt so great... Actually, I felt as if perhaps I really didn't workout enough because I really enjoyed Donna's style. The next day, my body truly felt it. WOW! I love to workout and thought that I wouldn't feel it... But I did. You go GIRL!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I paid a third of the price!","review":"I've had this video for quite some time. This morning, I blew the dust off it and popped it in my VCR. I fast-forwarded to the dance portion and remembered why it's been sitting on my shelf for so long: it's annoying and not interesting. The dance is hard to follow because none of the girls in the video are in sync and it seems to be mostly walking from side to side while twisting your hips in akward ways. I found that I sweat more blasting music and dancing on my own without Donna's video. I don't really have an opinion on the kick and jab routine. It's definately better choreographed than the dance. (Although, I still prefer Billy Blanks.) However, I do really like the circuit toning. Despite her yelling, \\"I got your back\\" every five seconds, I like it. I felt the burn in my entire body and have noticed results. I would only recommend this video to someone who is looking to tone muscles; not lose weight. And thank goodness I have a mute button!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great except I had to buy another one.","review":"I loved this dvd. It has been the best one I have bought. It is so much better and easier to understand than my Denise Austin (hit the spot) and Kathy Smith (Cardio fat burner). Tae Bo used to have the number one spot until I got this dvd. The kick and jab was great and made me really sweat. The circuit training was also good. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because I really didn't care for the dance thing. She wasn't very descriptive of how to do the moves and it was complicated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of fun while working out!","review":"I really like the workouts and the fact that they are 20 mins long. I can rotate the different workouts and not get bored too quickly and then once I am ready for the advance workout, I do not need to buy the next tape, she already has the advance workout on the DVD. I definitely recommend this DVD for those who like to dance and get \\"funky\\" in their workouts!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good!","review":"After receiving my first Donna Richardson tape, 30 Days to Thinner Thighs, I knew I had to try more by this friendly, energetic, very personable instructor. My next tape was Four-Day Rotation; I do the entire tape for a wonderful, fun total body workout. Three-Day Rotation was my third purchase, and Donna still motivates me in her very friendly manner. What I DIDN'T like was that loud, obnoxious Asian-looking woman in the back of the class in the first section; I think she's in the back of the class in the last section as well, but in the second section - kickboxing - she's right up in your face. I began to wonder \\"who's teaching this class\\" as she whoops and hollers at her classmates to \\"work it\\" and \\"keep it up\\". ... as I'm huffing and puffing trying to keep up ... I wish I could mute her out, but keep the music and Donna's comments. I know I went on a bit about \\"that woman\\", but your \\"classmates\\" really do make or break your class enjoyment."},{"rating":"1","title":"too inner-urban for me","review":"i find donna richardson to be an african-american version of denise austin. now, i don't mean that as a compliment either. they are both very chatty and goofy. donna richardson is so hip hop and over bubbbly, she annoys me. i thought reviews of this video would be enough for me to like the workout, but i can't get past the annoying instructor, so i traded this after three veiwings, sorry donna, i just don't like your style."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love Donna!","review":"I work out daily so I like a challenge and variety. Donna definitely gives variety and I would LOVE to see her add some advanced tapes to her collection. This video is great because it has 3 20 minute routines so you can use it no matter how much time you have. The circuit training segment is the least fun but definitely works your whole body. Kickboxing (2nd segment) is GREAT and I always sweat like crazy. The dance segment is really fun and I hate to do cardio so it's nice to feel like you're dancing rather than working out. Donna is a great instructor - lots of motivation and fun in her workouts. It might be hard to follow for a beginner but after a few viewings, I think any level exerciser can benefit from this tape."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and Funky Workout","review":"This three day rotation workout is great! You burn calories and have fun. It is a party that ends too soon. I love Donna's attitude. She is a motivator. I would use perky but she's laid back. The kickboxing routine has one girl that tends to interject a lot. That is a little distracting to meb but the workout is still very good. If you need a quixk workout that is effect for total body shaping, this is the way to go!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Workout","review":"This was an excellent workout. I personally do not care for the dance aerobic workout. The other two are excellent. Using the kick boxing routine and the circuit toning, I have lost 50 pounds. Of course I was using Slim Fast and Weight Watchers as well but the circuit toning exercises really worked my abs; and the kick boxing worked my arms. This is an excellent dvd if you have the discipline to get up and do the workouts. You will definitely see results within two weeks (if you are doing it consistently- 3 to 5 days a week). Thanks Donna, my family and I love you!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just okay","review":"I don't know what it is exactly, but I just don't like this DVD. I mean, it isn't terrible, but it certainly isn't great. I have a few workout DVDs and haven't even used this one in months. There are a LOT better out there so I recommend getting something else. The workouts on this DVD are okay but nothing special and not very physically challenging. Ms. Richardson and her backup people are very irritating and overly perky. She says \\"I got your back\\" every two minutes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even an old lady can do it","review":"Until my daughter moved in to look after me, I never exercised. I am a mature woman of 55 and did not want to go to the gym. My daughter introduced me to workout videos. I recently purchased Donna Richardson's Three-Day Rotation video and love it. I haven't moved to the advanced level yet but I really enjoy the other two segments. It's great that there is an exercise video an older person can use."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT ARM WORK!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I have had the VHS version of this video for years and I promise you if you do the arm segment three times per week you will have the beautifully toned arms! Ladies, the workout is 10-12 minutes and awesome. Your arms will look awesome in those cute in those cute summer tops!!! It is good any level because you control the weights that you use during the workout!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Super Bummed","review":"I was extremely excited to get this DVD. I have been working out with Tamilee Webb and Donna Richardson for years and was thrilled to find that Donna had some DVD's of her own. I really like her energy in the Platinum 2000 series and was looking forward to being motivated by her some more. I have to say I was super bummed after doing the 3 day rotation workout. Although Donna is great and her energy is, as always, super powered, the women in her class shouting and whooping it up and commenting constantly is both distracting and totally annoying. They are often so loud that I can't hear Donna's instructions and the whole thing is just way too over the top. If you want to get the benefit of Donna Richardson without all the annoying background chatter, I recommend you check her out, along with Tamilee Webb and Tracy York, in the Buns of Steel Platinum 2000 series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame","review":"I didn't like this at all. Donna is like the cheerleader you hated in high school. I'm sure I got something out of the workout, but not much."},{"rating":"2","title":"short and effective","review":"this video has 3 sections, each 20 minutes long, with their own warm-ups and cool-downs. the toning section is good, though you won't always break a sweat. it does a good job firming up most of your body. the kick and jab will definitely get you sweating, though she probably doesn't really know what she's doing, and the whole \\"i've got your back\\" thing is redundant and kind of annoying. i just try and ignore it when she says that. as for the dance section, i watched it once and that was enough. too low-impact for me, but if you're a beginner, you might like it. i only use the first 2 sections, but i think they're great."},{"rating":"2","title":"What A Workout!","review":"This video really kept me motivated. I would recommend it to anyone that hates going to the gym.

This DVD is good, but it does not offer a lot of introduction to knew moves. Also, the moves are executed too quickly and are not done for a long period of time. But I love the intensity. It really worked me through which is my goal. If I didn't get a move, I just kept moving. Overall, with more introduction and training of techniques prior to workout, this would be an excellent workout DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Donna Richardson: 3 day rotation 2000","review":"Donna has three 20 minute workouts. They are fun, easy to learn, and get your blood pumping. Her group is real loud and always cheering! She has kickboxing, circuit toning, or funky dance moves to choose from. You can also do these three routines with just her on an advanced level. Her cool down is a bit rushed. She goes through the stretches quickly.Donna is real smiley and pumped up and funky."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fast workout","review":"I love this dvd for the flexability. I dont have much time so I usually do the 20 min weight segment in the morinings 4 days a week. I can tell a difference in my arms definately. The kickboxing to me is good but I am so tired of that. The dance segment I do a couple of times a week because my 5 year old loves to do it too. The DVD has alot of options because in each workout Donna has a advanced segment you could opt for. So its really like 6 workouts you just point and click and chose what your up for that day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't Like It","review":"I love Donna's book Let's Get Real but I just can't get into her workouts. I didn't find the workouts fun or motivating. Save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"a really fun workout DVD","review":"If you went to this class in real life, you'd go back. The \\"students\\" are cheerful, healthy girls of different physical types, the instructor is energetic and knowledgable, and the moves are fun. The workouts are only 20 minutes long, so it's great if you're trying to squeeze exercise in before your workday, but you get the benefits (energy for the day, slightly sore muscles the next day) as long as you put plenty of effort into it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"I love all Donna Richardson's workouts. She keeps things fun and exciting. I love the weight workout on this video - really challenging and keeps me sore for a couple days. The kickboxing one is fun, but it really makes my arms sore with all the jabbing movements etc. The aerobic dance workout is good but not as challenging as some of her other workouts. The 20 minute time frame is perfect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth It","review":"I'm fat and relatively out of shape, and this video was so easy I think I actually yawned during one of the segments. Too much dancing and not enough sustained use of muscles. Donna Richardson's a good instructor, though. Not squeaky or stupid, and she cues well. Maybe her other videos are better."},{"rating":"1","title":"less banter, more instruction!","review":"While I enjoyed Donna Richardson's \\"enthusiatic\\" contributions on the Buns of Steel Platinum series, this video was an overdose of such. On this DVD, I enjoyed the Dance Aerobics and the Kickboxing sections to a certain extent but there is way too much distracting banter going on in the background. The Kickboxing section definitly needs more instruction on the proper excution of the moves and less kidding around. If Donna decides to do a series where she concentrates more on serious instruction, I would definitly buy it. Her moves are great but lets get serious!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No workout here","review":"This one was a huge disappointment. The cardio was funky but not fun, and won't do anything for your heartrate. The cuing is poor, especially with the kickboxing, where she just goes right into a move. The weight portion wasn't bad, but there are better tapes out there. I really regret buying this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me","review":"I hated this video. Sorry to say. The people in it were annoying. I couldn't focus they were so annoying and overly into it.

No such luck. They were both broken within 15 minutes. Boo Hiss.

Since I have an XBOX 360, I heard it's backwords compatible and this may be a good game to play for the XBOX 360.

You can't cantrol the camera which is a drag because if an enemy goes out of camera range you have to get closer to se him. And 3.

These are the 2 songs I had heard on the radio and I liked, and hoped that the rest of the CD would be good too. Not really. In fact, I never heard any other song from this CD being played on the radio here in Europe. William Orbit does bring an interesting bit to the sound of these songs, but the girls really don't stand out as talented. Though they all have ok voices, none of them has a particularly nice nor powerful voice, and the text is girly in a shallow way: what artist would make an entire song around the chorus \\"I know that you want a piece of my a**\\"??"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"Given the title \\"Holiday Favorites: Christmas Soul\\" I thought this CD would have added to my classic collection.

It avoids making any explicit political commentary on the current situation in Afghanistan. Rather, in the best Iranian style, it simply shows us, with loving attention to detail. One of my favorite scenes, also noted by another reviewer, has Noqreh walking through the ruins of a palace in the new shoes which symbolize the elegance of modernity for her. Ostensibly she is listening for the slightest drop of water (which is very scarce), but at the same time she is enjoying listening to the sound of the heels of the shoes as they click against the floor. A very quiet, reflective scene which stays in my mind long after having seen the film, and a good example of the kind of poetry that Iranian cinema has to offer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gun Crazy aka A Talent for Loving","review":"Unfortunately I purchase the cheapest of the four videos available and was disappointed in the quality that I received.

It was misrepresented by the seller, daisy899."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow","review":"I was simply stunned by this recording. Ton Koopman's virtuousity is undeniable, and he does a brilliant job interpreting these works. Of course his \\"Toccata and Fuge\\" is a showpiece; it has to be, but the performance does not let down from there. Even the less-familiar works are spectacular.I'm not ordinarily a fan of Bach; I bought this disc initially just to support the continued production of classical music in high-resolution multi-channel formats. However, after a single, stunning listening session with a magnificent performer and a marvelous instrument, this disc has found a permanent home in my DVD-A changer."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would not buy this title","review":"I bought this DVD-Audio title based on recommendations from Sound and Vision magazine. I wanted to hear this great version of the Toccata and Fugue. The sound is ok...the playing is not. It started off the with the first few notes. He adds trills to the notes where they are not written that way. It does not get better from there. The playing is rushed, muddy, and with no passion. Compare this to my favorite version by Peter Hurford (Toccata and Fugue, Great Organ works on London records) and there is no comparsion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good stuff!","review":"This tape has a lot of great drills on it. I bought it for my son and daughter, both black belts in Tae Kwon Do and they love it.

Very motivating!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT WORTH THE MONEY!","review":"I expected a much more detailed and extensive coverage of Taekwondo moves.

But maybe that's a good thing, huh? A Few Words Too Many makes me cry every time, The Shark and The Mermaid is candy for the ears and imagination, and I'm also pretty fond of \\"Don't Shout\\" and \\"Mother, Daughter, Sister, Lover\\".

Ultimately, the film deals with the idea of soul mates and waiting to find \\"the one\\". While most hated the ending, I liked it because it was honest. Life, especially love, is unpredictable and often people get hurt. The ending showed that people will often choose the safer, more predictable path, than follow their heart and take a leap. The acting was fantastic, as was the music. So overall a sweet, funny, sexy, and intriguing film that fans of 500 Days of Summer will love. By the way- if you have a Netflix account you can watch it online."},{"rating":"2","title":"Feeling great!!!","review":"I love this movie so cute.

Also, the supposition that a few chemical compounds determines all of behavior would fail high school bio. Unless, you believe that clover leaves and Gods intervening in every moment of everyone's lives.Third, there really was no story other than what we know already and that is \\"life is really complex and matching two of them even more so.\\"Fourth, fast forwarding works quite well for vacuous script, acting and storyline."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth every penny","review":"When I first checked this out, it was for the sake of Emma Caulfield, who played my favorite character in BtVS, Anya. I loved her acting style and blunt, quirky delivery of lines. I loved her just as much in this film, and she was supported by fantastic actors, every one of them. Her sister, Steph, won't zero out until she's 43, and plays up the bitterness of that perfectly. This is not your standard rom-com, it's slightly cynical without being caustic, and the dialogue is wonderful.

It has a charming cast and a rather original premise regarding an implanted wristband timer that indicates when you will meet your true love.One might logically ask what the intended dies; what if they are not the race, color, creed or gender that one is expecting? But no, let's not go there! It does bring up some provocative questions, and ultimately make a strong case for chance, circumstance and fate even in our wired, busy age."},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY GOOD MOVIE","review":"This was a great movie. I just loved the idea that a device could tell you if you were with your soul mate. Depending on what the timer says it could change the way people feel about on casual sex, teen romance and cheating. This is a great romantic comedy.It is good enough to watch over and over. :-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"UHG!","review":"Could have been cute, maybe even worthwhile watching, but it wasn't.

Waste of time and money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasantly Charming","review":"I'm pretty sure that the only reason this film didn't get wide-spread theatrical distribution is because of the (almost) no-name cast, because everything else about it was fantastic. The combination of great acting, well-drawn and complex characters, and high-concept plot resulted in an adorable, charming and engaging movie. Perfect for a night in. Kudos to the director. I hope he does more like it... :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"I haven't laughed so hard in ages!","review":"I had the good luck to see this movie at the Cleveland International Film Festival recently, and I am so pleased that I did -- it was funny, well-written, brilliantly acted (I swear Emma Caulfield is one of the greatest \\"face\\" actors working today, she can put so much across with just one look!) and delightful. I hope it gets a broader release in theatres, because compared to the other movies out there right now, it's vastly superior.The premise is simple -- what if a clock could count down to the moment you meet your soul mate? But it isn't science fiction-y, and even though you feel for what the main character is going through (her timer is one of a handful that doesn't work correctly, and she keeps ending up with the wrong guys again and again), it isn't a \\"chick flick\\" either. It's sensitive, slightly dark at times (her sister works in a retirement community -- there are some great one-liners), but overall, a wonderful movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting and fun!","review":"You really have to suspend common sense for a couple of hours to enjoy this movie. But who always wants movies to make sense anyway? The whole premise of the movie was quite intersting. It certainly gets you thinking. What if it was possible... would you want to know? How would your life be different? How would the world be different?You certainly could pick apart the flaws in the storyline with how this \\"TiMER\\" supposedly works, but I think if you take the technical aspects of it too seriously you probably won't enjoy the movie as much. Just let it go and believe it's possible and enjoy the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie, good features","review":"Timer is an excellent romantic comedy - funny, witty, and makes you feel for the characters. Very real in terms of how relationships are handled, and a great fantasy in terms of what may happen if the Timer existed.The bonus features are decent - some outtakes and deleted scenes.

While it is not hard to read, it is not about ghosts/ghost stories. It is about categories of ghosts. This is fine if one is writing about dogs, but seems overly intellectualized for ghosts. Since the \\"objective evidence\\" is sparce, it seems recounting and analyzing stories is better use of the page.

Because of the brevety of the treatment of the subject he seemed to over implify some very fundanental issues. Further, I disagree with the conclusion he seems to imply that Holmesian jurisprudence created a basis for contemporary liberalism. It certainly seems to me that, although some of Holmes' work is liberal, the \\"Lochner\\" jurisprudence that he was reacting against represented true liberal (in the libertarian sense) orthodoxy, and that the likes of John Harlan (which he views as representing republican values) posited the more exspansive view of liberalism.

It contains some truths but it usually draws the wrong conclusions from them. \\"New Agers\\" may love discussion of such topics as \\"Ecofeminism\\" and the book will probably make them feel good but I would not recommend it for anyone else. A person with background in the physical or life sciences could probably separate the wheat from the chaff in the book but such a person may already know most of the material. Others are likely to be misled.Several earlier reviewers (such as \\"radtrad\\", J.

If anything, they have been too kind to the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Capra reveals an intriguing approach to life.","review":"This being my first exposure to Capra, it was quite an eye-opening experience.

That pair are still on the same car and working like new and much brighter than the OEM. Bought a new car (Toyota) and was not happy with the OEM's. Dealt with it for a year and finally bought these PIAA's. HUGE improvement! No more yellow! They have a slight hint of blue which is what I wanted (looks more of a crisp white). I did not want to look too fake/blue like you see often. These are amazing and worth the $.

After doing some research, I decided to go with the PIAA H4 Xtreme White 12V 60/55=110/100-Watt Bulb along with the PIAA 19172 168 Xtreme White Wedge Bulb. I have to say the overall appearance between the lens renewal kit and the bulbs make it seem new again. It is a very clean white and if you look into the bulb itself, you can see a hint of blue.The overall brightness is slightly better but if you want a brighter light, you'll need to go with the HID setup. I don't recommend it though, because it's not friendly on other drivers eyes which can make it equally as dangerous for you... plus it is a much more expensive setup and not as easy to install. That's why I'm recommending the PIA H4 extreme white in conjunction with the 3m lens renewal kit.

The produce a very clean white (4000K) light and are very bright compared to regular headlights. Comparing these to the 4000K Sylvania SilverStar bulbs which I had before, these are whiter and brighter, which surprised me. If you are looking for a true white light, you need to stick below 4100K in color, else you start to get into the blue and purple colors. These seem to be exactly what I was looking for.

When the new one arrived after the new tenant had already moved in, I opened it right away to make sure it looked alright. (The knob actually turned this time.) So I brought it upstairs (this was in a high rise condo.) I opened my can of paint attatched the nozzle, plugged it in and zip. They sent me another one that was completely dead.

It painted fast and cleaned easy. I used it to put 4 coats of paint on a 1500 sq-ft basement. My only complaint is that the paint spattered each time I sqeezed the trigger. I ended up rolling as I painted the first two coats to blend in the big drops. I e-mailed Campbell Hausfield and got a quick first response, but they haven't replied since I gave them the info they requested. It seemed to perform the same whether the gun filter was clogged or clean. The paint was interior latex primer and satin finish. Both paints were unthinned and both spattered the same.

He found a pool of oil at the base of the unit. Tore it apart, found a loose bolt. Tightened, refilled with oil and it ran great after that.

They said they were having a problem with the ball bearing from the factory and got a lot of these calls. After loosening the ball, it worked great. Cleaned it up and put it away. A couple of months later, got it out to use it again. It won't work again. Now the screws are stripped so I can't get to the ball bearing and fix it again. Buy one at your own risk.

Honestly, the similarities are astounding...Ivar Devorast IS Howard Roark in a tunic. There is a scene that is grotesque in its slavish devotion to Rand's original: where Phyrea meets Devorast = where Dominique meets Roark.So, while Athans is excellent, the sheer disgust I now feel at his blatant crime is overwhelming.

The hero is also interesting, not merely a cardboard cut-out of masculinity-to-the-rescue, and the protagonist is a believable and relatable young woman.The death is a dreadful one, at least to my imagination, and so should be considered before recommending it to any delicate types. But I love Ursula Curtiss, and would recommend any of her novels with gusto to anyone but my mother."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Organizing","review":"If you are someone who is not a natural organizer, or has alot on your plate, then this book would be great for you.

I am a pretty organized person to begin with, but after hearing of her method for boxing things up with the separate cards and number system, I figured she may have a few new tricks to teach me. Unfortunately this book didn't carry much else new with it. There are many, many repeated tips in this book and it reads like a 1950's Betty Crocker cookbook in the style of \\"adding a touch of this will brighten up your home!\\" At the beginning of the book I was dismayed to learn that she believes all women should strive to host Tupperware parties for a living. Lastly, there are many common sense tips such as \\"never leave a baby alone in the bathtub\\" and \\"never leave pets in the car\\".

She was so happy when she opened her present and found Mermaidia Elina doll. She took it out of the box and started to play with it. Soon enough she lost interest however. The wings are large, so large they are actually a burden. Placing the doll inside the mermaid tail is not easy for little hands either. All in all, this doll is just \\"make-up\\" if you see what I mean. Pretty but not easy to play with, and easily forgotten.

This wrench has served me great so far. Both my parts and I have suffered no failures. The wrench seems to accurately torque down the hardware without any damage. Highly recommended. This wrench is $65.00+ cheaper than the equivalent from Parke Tools, while I can't do a side by side comparison it did the job it was intended to do and saved me some cashola. The wrench is not graduated in Nm, so you will have to do a little converting if that is what you are looking for but the wrench comes with conversion tables embossed into the very nice case and again in the included instructions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak product - GOOD SERVICE","review":"The torque wrench as received was defective.

So not only would it not read torque, but it also snapped due to possible casting defects.Beam style wrenches are more accurate & less complex to damage.

My hair is shoulder-length and wavy and this is the perfect brush for it.As someone else mentioned, this isn't a styling brush (I have round brushes for that), but for brushing your hair out at night or first thing in the morning, it's wonderful. The nylon bristles go to the scalp and seem to help the natural bristles go through the hair easier. It leaves my hair soft and shiny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute Garbabe","review":"I threw this brush away pretty quickly after receiving it.

I have thick hair and it hardly felt like I was brushing it - it's too soft with little fluffy bristles which impede the brushing action of the longer stronger ones. Since it's not worth the cost of returning it I'll give it to my grand daughter and will let you know if its a hit with her as she does get a lot of tangles in her very fine hair."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did I get the right brush?","review":"When I received this brush, I honestly when back to the listing several times to see if I got the right brush. All the reviews (save a few) are glowing. I have long, relatively thin hair. Although the brush seems to go through tangles nicely (which is why I gave it a generous 2 stars instead of 1,) the thing really hurts my scalp. Massaging effect? Absolutely not. I kept on checking the bristles to see if maybe some of the balls on the head were missing, but they weren't. As long as I keep the brush from actually touching my scalp, it's fine, but it's hard to do because my hair isn't very thick. Plus, as other reviewers said, it looks like it is going to be a nightmare to clean. I honestly don't get all the reviews. Maybe I got a lemon. Maybe my scalp is more sensitive than a 7-year olds. I'm just glad I paid less than $5, because it's going in the trash as soon as I can find a better brush to replace it."},{"rating":"1","title":"HATE IT!!","review":"This is the worst POS brush I have ever bought. Even those cheapies that you can get at a local drug store are 10X better.Pros- none!!!!Cons:1) the handle is for the size of a child or hobbit.2) theres weird extra brissles that you cannot tell from pictures. They make my hair frizzy.3) I have long, thick, wavy hair. This brush was a joke. I couldnt get past the first few strokes when I was ready to throw it out the fricken window. It was only brushing the surface hair only.Do NOT wast your money on this crap of a brush. This shouldnt even be considered a brush for humans. It looks like a baby doll brush or a brush you would use on a SMALL dog (but then the handle is still too small and awkward!)...maybe thats what Ill do...Use it for my 10 lb dog so its not a waste of money.

I really love the longer bristles for de-tangling and shorter ones for smoothing. I slightly prefer the old style I was using because it was wider, but this is a decent replacement. The little balls at the end do have a tendency to wear away making the longer bristles very sharp, but I just clip them off with nail clippers. Because of this, the brush will eventually have to be replaced, but this brush is great if you can't shell out the money for the better quality yet super expensive ones of a similar style."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money.","review":"I've been playing Madden since Madden '97 game for PS1, and while I didn't expect it to be as good as the console version, it was more disappointing than I thought it would be. The graphics would have been great 10 years ago, but they are well below the quality that I would expect from a DS. The worst part of the game is the kicking mechanic; you use the touch screen and stylus for field goals, punts, and kickoffs. IT DOESN'T WORK! All of my kickoffs are only about 40 yards long, and any kick except for an extra point is no good. I e-mailed EA Sports to see what I was doing wrong and instead of giving me a sensible answer, those nitwits told me to check the message boards at IGN! What was I thinking? They only made the game, why did I expect them to know anything about it?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay away","review":"This game is not worth anything at all!

If you like this game, than u need professional help. I wasted 3 months allowance on this, and I can't get it returned because it was opened. I gave it two stars because I feel sorry for the people who made the game.

I thought that being in 2006 we would see a fantastic offering for the DS sports category.....dead wrong. This game would get 5 stars for the GBA, but considering the upgraded hardware, it falls way short. I guess that I was yearning for a console version that I could play on a portable, but ultimately got dragged back into the late 90's with this game. The graphics are okay, but the gameplay is seriously lacking. I firmly believe that this is not EA's fault...it's the DS. Plays run so fast that you never really have a chance to let them develop and the touch screen kicking motion is a joke.The expanded menu options and the season mode are enticing, but without sustainable gameplay I've lost the motivation to continue playing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent concert, crappy production","review":"Adele, even with vocal problems, is excellent here. The only thing that makes this 4 stars instead of 5 is the DVD editing is too choppy. There were way too many shots of the audience here when the focus should of been on Adele, and those on stage with her. Nevertheless, this is worth the buy. She does curse quite a bit between songs, but it doesn't bother me, but she does drop a lot of f bombs, so be prepared for that. A lot of artists these days will do their set, won't talk to the audience and just make the experience as impersonal as possible, but Adele makes this a great experience for the audience and for the viewer.

She talks, talks, talks and talks. So you're tired and decides go forward using the remote control. After some time going ahead, nothing changes, she's still talking.

While the concert as a whole is fantastic, it is worth noting that it was recorded only a week or so before Adele had to cancel the rest of her tour due to vocal problems; her voice sounds less than pristine on a couple of songs, and \\"Rumour Has It\\" has parts where her voice sounds abrasive. I would recommend this album, but at the same time, I am curious as to how much better it would be if Adele had been completely free of vocal problems and might encourage patient fans to wait a few years and see if she releases another live album (assuming she makes a full recovery from her surgery). The language on the DVD also is pretty filthy, and the video editing can get a bit annoying (the camera angle changes every second or two on some songs)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Directing","review":"It's too bad the directing is so awful, because this is a great concert.

They're generally slower and more emphatic.The audience singing along is pretty cool, and obviously affects Adele.As others have said, it's so nice to see a real, talented singer (unlike the hideous Gaga) who can sing acapella, or with just a piano-amazing, the power and feeling in her voice.

It's. too bad the audio and video was butchered by the producer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love Adele But Hate this DVD","review":"I was fortunate enough to see Adele perform live last summer and was just blown away.Though I'm a lifelong music fan and an older guy, she is an old soul channeling emotions that goway beyond her 22 years on the planet.I was thrilled and excited when I saw this DVD was coming out and quickly bought a copy.Though Adele is incredible, whoever was the director of this abomination should be shot on sight.Horrible quick edits, ridiculous shots from the top of the Albert Hall behind a hanging lamp, andtoo many shots of the audience singing along.I want Adele just as she is. yes, she just stands there and sings...that's what's so powerful about her.So why do we need quick edits of boring shots of the drummer? Just give me Adele straight on singing a song withminimum quick edits and I would be a happy guy.Buy it if you must (and trust me you must), but be aware that this ADD director pretty much ruins the Adele experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love Adele hate the video director","review":"I Love Adele's music and was very much looking forward to this concert dvd. After two songs I left the headphones on and left the room. The music is live Adele, which is exquisite. But the video direction is nauseating. The director has many beautiful and grand camera angles at his disposal. Unfortunately, he feels he has to use every one on every song. There is absolutely no \\"soul\\" or feeling to the editing of the visuals, it's just a never ending series of cut after cut after cut completely destroying the mood of every song. It reminds me of watching a 1960s variety show with 2 minutes to cram every angle you've got into the time limit, but it never stops. I'll definitely continue to listen to the cd, but seriously doubt I'll ever watch the blu ray again. A bummer indeed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Profanity alert","review":"I bought this for my daughter for her ninth birthday present. Couldn't even get past the first 10 minutes with the \\"f-bombs.\\" Needless to say, we told our daughter she wasn't allowed to watch it.

The voice was not as good, I guess because she was already having problems with her cord. Anyway I wish I had bought the album 21 instead, at least I get better quality sound to listen in my car. The concert dvd was plain, nothing exciting considering her voice was not that great at the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Beautiful!","review":"Absolutely beautiful! The cd is outstanding,and the 2 bonus new songs that she sings are wonderful! She sings with such grace,poise,and elegence that this generation needs to see and hear.The dvd is wonderful,Adele is such a natural-born performer with such a talent that deserves to be reconized.During this dvd you get see Adele is some of her daily life,her cute dog,and of course her concert!Wonderful!

Warning though, she does use quite a bit of foul language, so keep that in mind if your watching with the kids. Her album is about basically hating her ex-boyfriend, so that is where the language originates."},{"rating":"2","title":"strong performance in a truly amazing facility - thumbs up","review":"Like many new Adele fans, we loved a few songs and elected to go the DVD route to check out her performance. Pure and simple, she rocks. Who knew she would be such fun and her interaction with those in the Albert Hall was grand. This was the timeframe when she had throat problems, wow......no way! She is great at setting the stage with the story of her life and the interplay with her songwriting. Many songs may seem deep and sad, but her delivery leaves you speechless. It is a great DVD/CD and one we will happily watch repeatedly - not just once and done for this one. I wish I was there in that huge hall, it had to be amazing. Nice to have a talent that really has the pipes to stand up alone or with an orchestra/band. Power for days. Loved it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Adele ROCKS!!","review":"Adele Live At The Royal Albert Hall (Blu-ray/CD)I have never written a review for anything until now. Adele doesn't sing her songs, she lives them. She is the people's singer. Her songs inspire and show the raw emotion of a person who has gone through so many changes inner life. From Someone Like You to Fire in the Rain, with the amazing string section, you forget (for a little while) the things that are going through your life. You become focused on her life, her memories. Thank you Adele!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Musical Perfection","review":"Easily the best Live DVD I've ever watched, and I'm not a fan of hyperbole ;-) \\"Someone Like You\\" might be the most emotional performance I've ever seen.

I love it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If you love her stuff this one's for you","review":"Adele is the reason at a ripe old age of 65 I still buy music. This live session at Albert Hall show's what a great performer she really is. Her raw, powerful voice is on display and it comes through your speakers like a freight train.

She gives her ALL in the performance.And when your in your car you can listen to the same performance on CD with limited clapping and talking. Just the music...all 17 songs!I highly recommend this to anyone who is captivated by Adele's amazing gift of voice.On the DVD there are a few swear words spoken by the nervous and excited Adelle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Adele Live at The Royal Albert Hall","review":"Love the music and the DVD.

This was a performance by a Londoner in London for a London audience and as a Londoner I'm offended by those wanting to judge it with non London values. It's spot on and thoroughly enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great DVD and CD!!","review":"This was a gift for my 14-year old daughter. It has become one of our favorite cd's! It's a great live album. We wish more of the monologues from the DVD were included on the cd, but it does not suffer from the lack of. We highly recommend any of Adele's albums!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothing short of brilliant","review":"Adele is a wonderful old soul in a young, fresh and funny present incarnation, wise beyond her years with a charming, wry sense of humor... As much as she seems bemused and amazed at actually being at the Royal Albert Hall, she commands the stage perfectly, as as a consummate professional. Perfectionist that she is, at one point she even corrects herself by restarting a song which did not even sound off to begin with, because she felt she did not sound good enough. Adele seems to expect nothing but the best from herself, and she delivers in every way possible. She has a very infectious way about her on stage and her banter between songs is as entertaining as the songs themselves, making it very easy to enjoy every minute of this fabulous performance. Highly recommended... Fans will adore it and those yet to be swayed will indeed be swayed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great DVD","review":"The ladies sat and chatted while the guys played pool. The quality of the DVD and performance was such that we all kept turning our heads to watch when Adele would belt out one of her top hits."},{"rating":"2","title":"Adele rocks!","review":"She's wicked talented and thoroughly loves what she does.

It is seriously the best seat in the house. Also, please be warned that there is some very naughty language, right from the start and sprinkled throughout. Please put the kids to bed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous singing voice but ...","review":"Adele's voice is beautiful and she has a God-given talent in that golden voice. The only problem I have with watching the video is that she talks way too much and has quite a potty mouth (that's why only 4 stars). Luckily the audio CD included in this set doesn't have her speaking other than to say, \\"thank you\\" a couple of times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big Audio remains DYNAMITE!","review":"Man, for some unexplainable reason when \\"Tighten Up\\" first came out I didn't care much for it. Played it a few times and just couldn't grasp the material. Now it's 15 years later (can you believe??) and the material is absolutely incredible. Brilliant even. This seems to be the case with ALL of B.A.D.'s output, but this album in particular seems to be the most underrated. Each song is like a long lost old friend, and it's gotten to the point where I have to hear SOMEthing off of this CD everyday.My faves? \\"Mr. Walker\\", \\"Champagne\\" and the incurably hummable \\"2000 Shoes\\".It's the great Wooga Wooga of all Rooga!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Directionless?","review":"Most fans would've been \\"dismayed\\" with this album. It could be considered a most 'unlikely' album from them, following from previous releases, such as 'This Is Big Audio Dynamite'.Immediately, one wonders what they had in mind with this album. All the tracks are different, but by and large, the material is 'light'. A few tracks are \\"catchy\\" and worth an ear, but you won't be satisfied by the end of the album.Get it to complete a collection. Listen to it incessantly for a couple of days. Then file it away among your other \\"Play Every Ten Years\\" albums!Fave Track: 'The Battle Of Old Saints Road'"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull. Next!","review":"Big Audio Dynamite always felt like a contrived mix of poor lyrics and messy cut-up techniques. This album hardly proves that assertion wrong. By combining unexciting compositions with the most lacklustre vocal content possible, the band have truly excelled at making a product so terribly dull that it hardly merits any sort of attention. Admittedly, the pace does pick up at the very end: \\"Tighten Up, Vol. 88\\" and \\"Just Play Music\\" finally get it right, and they managed to inject a bit of house influence into their work. Its a good prelude to the better (but messier) Megatop Phoenix from 1989. But, given that you'll have to wade through an album's worth of weak dreck, it's hardly even worth it.If you already like the band, go for it. If you're looking for an introduction, there's other things to check out. The debut, Megatop Phoenix and BADII's The Globe are better than this piece of work."},{"rating":"2","title":"An artist I cannot recommend enough.","review":"She is truly a remarkable songwriter. \\"How it Is\\" showcases her amazing songwriting abilities coupled with her breathtaking vocals. A combination that makes this CD a true success!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Overpriced and leaky","review":"Bought this about five years ago, and the only good thing I can say is that when it first started leaking, they quickly sent a replacement cartridge. But it has ALWAYS been very tight to operate when equipped with the short handle as the wife demanded (don't know about the long handle).Finish wore very poorly, lasting about a year to eighteen months before showing bare spots of copper.And now it has started leaking badly, and it must be swung to the hot water side to stop the leak.The sprayer hose is so weak that it must be held with the hose in a straight position or it will stop the water with the old bend the hose trick.The soap dispenser is out performed by most of the dispensers you can pickup at the five and dime.For the four hundred or so that we paid, one might think a better product could be had, but it isn't this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"superb and often haunting","review":"What a debut! Wonderful (and successful) mixing of cultural musical themes. Oh, and that's a Strad he's almost kissing there... one of I think 3 that get loaned out to world-class artists to play, if that gives you any indication of the craft you can expect to enjoy listening to this superb CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly recorded experiment that fails musically","review":"I love middle-eastern music and world-fusion music that unites cultural influences, and I frequently take chances on buying an unknown cd in the hopes of finding a gem. But I am sad to say that this cd is poor quality The whole album feels like it was recorded underwater. The drum beats sound like they came out of an over-reverbed boombox.The take on Satie's Gnossienne could have been interesting, instead it's like a parody of a funeral march. With proper mixing and arranging this might have been a very interesting album.For your information, this review was composed before the sad events of September 11."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whole new experience","review":"I was thinking.........What should I rate this album?...1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 stars? How can I compare it with others when it's the first and only experience I ever had in listening to this kind of music?Then I thought........Never mind........Didn't I have a great feeling while listening to each and every track on this CD? Didn't I have this same feeling while I was listening to Claude in live performances in Beirut?Didn't his music get into my unexperienced ears like a big hug warms up your heart?Then I decided to rate it 5 stars.....Keep on the good work Claude...Bon courage....."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sensual and Perfect!","review":"An exquisite combination of passion and mystery culminating in erotic ecstasy.

It does not fit a standard bike tire valve - I have no idea why. Followed the instructions and I am no dummy but the pump seemed way too big for the valve and the air wouldn't go in. Don't waste your money, go get a floor pump (that's what I did)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke on 3rd use, weak","review":"I got this a couple months ago. I thought the gauge and compact size were good features. I used it to pump up a set of new tires once and again a few weeks later for a pressure adjustment. Then I noticed my back tire seemed a little soft on the ride to work one morning. As soon as I tried to attach the pump to the valve, the head practically exploded! I couldn't find all the pieces. Topeak may have some good products, but this is NOT a good first impression with me. I logged on to some biking websites and found that many other riders had similar experiences with the Mini Master Blaster series. Too weak and fell apart easily."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gauge does not work.","review":"Just what the title says: Ok for a pump. Gauge does not work. Never has. I'm rather disappointed, since that was the major reason why I purchased it. There are no replacement parts for the gauge, so you're stuck returning it. Good luck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Topeak Mini G MasterBlaster Bike Pump with Gauge","review":"I ordered one when deployed in Afg. for a bike and it worked great. No complaints about the gage either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Product Description is Incorrect!","review":"According to the product description, this pump is supposed to include a fold-down footrest and an inflation hose. In fact it has neither!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good pump, bad gauge","review":"I had a chance to use the pump for the first time the other day when I caught a flat. I was able to pump the air back in with a decent amount of ease, but noticed that the preasure gauge was not working. The gauge looks a bit delicate so it could have broke or just come like that. I'm dissapointed since this is specifically why I bought the pump so I could inflate my tires to the right psi. Other than that, it's a good pump. The mounting bracket works well on my lower bar and doesn't interfere with pedaling. Good luck with your pump."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not fit for 20'' wheel","review":"The opening for the pump would not fit onto the tire because the pump does not have an extension. This may be because the tire is a relatively small tire to pump and so has less space to fit the pump."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work on draw stroke!","review":"This pump looks very sophisticated with very original piston / plunger design. When it comes to mating with the Schrader valve the rubber well is too shallow to accomodate this valve so no effective tight seal is formed aroud the valveMore importantly with any type of valve, it does not allow to draw the air back in on a draw stroke . No internal draw valve?Bottomline: totally useless!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy, popped a tire","review":"I strongly recommend against this product. While it fits easily on your bike and doesn't get in the way of riding, it is very difficult to use. It actually ripped a stem right out of my tire. I bought it specifically to take when my full size pump isn't practical to take with me on vacation, or far from home. Everything about this pump is great except for its use. I found it very difficult to actually pump air in my tire. I will never use it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad guage bulky pump","review":"The gauage does not work over 60 PSI and it's not worth the cost. Leave this for someone else and get a better pump."},{"rating":"2","title":"Handy little pump","review":"This is a great portable pump. Small and light. The dual action is great and it can pump up a low tire with relative ease. Definitely a must have for long rides."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO DIRECTIONS included... none available on the net!","review":"It may be a wonderful pump, but I cannot tell. There are NO DIRECTIONS on how to use it. I went on line to seek directions. All I found were dozens of posts from other people who are frustrated that there are NO DIRECTIONS at all. Also, the print that is on the box is so small that I had to get a magnifying glass to read it. My regular glasses were not enough. I tried to contact the Topeak and their contact information is also impossible to find. This is very bad customer service!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute Crap","review":"Worst pump ever. Instructions poor. Gauge inoperative. Pump would fit on valve but would not fill with air on drawstroke; hence, it did not work.Vaguely satifactory in terms of being able to be bent into pretzel shape before being thrown in garbage. This purchase has made me reconsider buying non-book items from Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Breaks valves, pumps backwards","review":"I should have known after the first 2 broken valves, but I thought 'oh well, must not have pulled it out straight.' Well, I lucked out for a while and used a pump I bought at work for a while, until it got locked in a room I didn't have access to. I decided to use this again, and not only did it break another valve, but now it sucks air out the nozzle and pumps it out the handle. Get a Lenzyne and forget about this piece of trash, (mine, by the way, is now in the trashcan next to me)."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK if you don't need more than 60 psi","review":"The pump is advertised for more than 100 psi but I found it nearly impossible to get more than 60 psi out of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"small but tiring","review":"i bot this for my road bike. the pump looks really cool and easy to use. but try to pump your tire to above 100 psi is more difficult than lifting 100 lbs of weight in gym. I promise if i need to use it more than once every half a year, i will throw it away and get the most huge and stupid one."},{"rating":"2","title":"It does what it says it will do","review":"This is a good little pump. It is reliable and has a decent gauge. It holds on to the bike stem really well. My only hesitation is that it is hard to pump, especially because it pumps in both directions. Although it pumps quickly, not everyone may have the strength to use it when pumping to 80 pounds of pressure. However, I would buy it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little pump, works better than most!","review":"Have been using this for several months now. Works great and have had no problems with it. I love that it switches from Presta to shaurder valve easily in seconds. It attaches very securely to your bike right next to the water bottle so it is out of the way of feet and pedals as well as not interfering with grabbing the water while riding. CONS: For PSI over 60 it can get difficult and a workout to pump since it has a smaller lever and takes a lot of pumps. The gauge is nice to have on the pump, however it can be hard to read...it doesn't have a good readout of numbers, it jumps from 30 to 60 to 90 and there are no numbers in-between. Overall its a great pump and for $16 its practically a STEAL. Im happy about the purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what I needed","review":"It's lightweight and slim so it'll be easy to toss in my bag and go. It's easy to use and fast. My only gripe is the gauge doesn't work."},{"rating":"2","title":"It works, but not fast","review":"It is an emergency pump. That being said it does take a while to pump a tire.

Very compact. The gauge doesn't work that well though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product.. bad user guide","review":"A good handy product with significant power and usability but really low user guidance on how to use it. It comes with the standard Schrader valve setting and to change it to Presta took me a life time.. I completely disassembled this thing and I finally found this video on Youtube. Look it up by searching - \\"Topeak - How to change internal pump head parts\\"It would be so much easier if Amazon just added this video on the product decription!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It works, but not very well.","review":"I had this pump for a year. While this might work well for a MTB that needs only 80 PSI of pressure, it's horrible for a road bike that needs 120 PSI. Unless you're a zen-master, you'll find it impossible to generate the power to push the air into the valve without moving and possibly breaking the valve-stem. Often I was forced to just ride with 80 PSI, which then got me more flats. It was really frustrating.Instead buy Topeak's Road Morph, it has all the same features, but it's built more like a floor pump where you can get the necessary leverage to push all 120 PSI into your tire."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work","review":"For some reason the nozzle on this item did not fit tightly on the tube stem. As soon as there was back pressure from the tube it leaked and would not induce enough air so you could ride. Went to Wal mart and purchased a different brand for $10 and it works great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad locking system, Gauge difficult to read.","review":"Be careful with this pump. The locking system is counterintuitive and not user-friendly. To lock the nozzle, lift the handle. To unlock it, lower the handle.

I will be returning this immediately."},{"rating":"2","title":"great pump","review":"Very quick delivery execellant tire pump fast and easy, very smooth to use and works great. the holder was very easy to attach and has a velcro safety strap"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cap won't stay closed","review":"Although I've had this for quite a while, haven't got a chance to use it yet. What bothers me is that the plastic cap is not tight enough so it keeps popping open all the time.

After reading the Persian Pickle Club, I made a point to read all of Sandra Dallas' work and was thrilled to find a new entry. However, there is NO charm, no real plot, no redeeming characters, and no reason to suffer through some of the worst dialogue ever written.

I was very excited to read The Chili Queen and about 25 pages into it, it dawned on me that this was a very corny book. I ended up skipping over most of it and still got all the scams. When the author is so busy being clever that she forfeits depth and quality, I find the book a big joke.

That's what teenaged kids do when making their own home movies.Other than that, it was a decent film without much depth to it. The music cues on how we should be feeling during a particular scene was another amateur move. Sad music, sad scene. Lively music, happy scene.

It's not that the performances were bad, but they weren't intriguing or special, just there.

Unfortunately that was not the case. This book was predictable, dull, and could not capture my interest or attention. I, too, had to force myself to finish the book. Maxine's story with her husband, although poignant, was forced and too sugar-sweet. Very unrealistic.

The entertainment industry is pretty shallow and the author's portrayal of was a bit banal and recycled from other books on the same subject. I had a lot of problems with the dialogue which was pretty flat; and the characters were annoyingly uninteresting. The \\"real\\" story is Maxine's marriage crumbling from her husband's infidelity.

Orphaned at an early age and left in the care of her maternal grandmother, who is not the average \\"milk-n-cookies\\" Granny Smith, Maxine's quest for her own identity takes many unusual turns.

RR finally came through tho there is to be \\"another\\" book after his last on because it was too long. Yeh, right once again $$$$$.00.

Now, here's where the one star rating comes in: She doesn't remember all of the events in the first two books and acutally asked her fans to please remind her what happened, so she can finish the series.

Now she is returning to fulfill what I'm assuming is a contractual obligation and is looking for fan input? I don't have high hopes for how this will turn out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Please Release This on DVD!!!","review":"An awesome TV movie recreation of the Orson Welles MarsInvasion radio broadcast. Paul Shenar is fabulous as Orson Welles and the atmosphere of the movie I would think successfully recreates live radio broadcasts of the time. Vic Morrow and John Ritter are excellent in supporting roles. Although the side stories to the broadcast may be a bit too-\\"soap-opera-ish\\", it is not all that great a leap to believe that things like that actually resulted from the radio broadcast. Hopefully,this TV movie will make its way to DVD very soon.

I wanted a copy of the show because of those scenes most of all.Having waiting fairly patiently for Amazon to acquire this again, the sand in my hourglass ran out today. I don't know the Amazon policy, but suspect they won't appreciate my posting other sellers on their site, so--hint hint--it doesn't look like they are ever going to offer it again, but it is for sale online.OK, I'll just include the link, and Amazon can delete some or all of this, if they like.

But that's the point: It's supposed to be like that!The album is, perhaps, best known for the cover of 'Lola', but it's just one of the highlights. The use of scratchy violin lends a manic punk-folk edge to some of the tunes and there is an odd mix of musical styles here. It isn't perfect, but music like this isn't about perfection.If I had to compare it to anyone, I would say maybe, The Slits or Gang of Four.At the time of writing, this album was unavailable through Amazon but I discovered that it(and all the other Raincoats Albums)can be obtained(new!)from the Rough Trade shop(by phone or online)and for sensible money.

Even if the potential reader is a non-Christian or a Christian who seeks to rationalize Christianity with reason, this book has many errors and off-the-wall remarks which are misleading.

It published just four years after his death in 1969, and the author, Ms. Wayne, was able to meet him, so that lends credibility to her biography of this Hollywood heartthrob.But the book doesn't go deep enough. It reads like a compilation of data, with little life added in. It paints Robert Taylor as almost a \\"goody two shoes.\\"Yet there was more to him, & I for one hope to read a book that uncovers and tells the truth about many other factions of his life.

This album is fantastic, some of the best Dylan covers around. There is just one weakness, the at-times off-key vocal on Like a Rolling Stone. Other than that, it presents one of the most sensitive and well-produced collections of Dylan songs heard in many years. If Judy's \\"fan letter\\" to Dylan seems overly emotional and odd, keep in mind it was written just after an extraordinarily tragic and difficult occurence in her life. Most importantly, the music speaks for itself and it speaks beautifully."},{"rating":"2","title":"Judy's voice + Dylan's tunes = great listening","review":"Judy Collins' clear, clean voice does justice to most of these great Dylan tunes. Her rendition of \\"Love Minus Zero\\" is a standout. For the most part, as is true with most Dylan songs, the tracks on this album really benefit from someone who can actually SING!The only exception is \\"Like A Rolling Stone.\\" That song's melody and lyrics fit Dylan's vocal style perfectly, and it needs to have his sarcastic, cutting vocal edge in order to be effective. Judy should not have attempted this song. It ends up sounding sweetened and watered down.However, most of the other songs really benefit from this kind of treatment. Overall, a pleasant listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hyde Carbide Scraper","review":"The Hyde carbide scraper is well worth the extra money over the carbon metal type scrapers, as it lasts and lasts.

I picked it up based on the positive reviews, but I agree with some of the negative reviews. Jerome Battle's voice was unconvincing. His thought processes were so overly descriptive and loaded with \\"special\\" words (I'm embarrassed to admit that I actually consulted the dictionary while reading). I just couldn't believe that a guy really thinks this way! Due to the fact that Jerry seemed so unreal, I just couldn't care less about him or the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why was this book written?","review":"I often wonder how an author picks a theme to write about. I absolutely have no idea what made Mr. Lee waste so much of his time on such dull characters in a dull setting in a dull story. I didn't care one iota about Jerry Battle and his adult children. There was nothing about this book that moved me in any way. Why did I read it? It was a book club selection.

Which is all well and good, except that it doesn't make for a very good read. It's sort of boring and annoying. In this book, all the characters are flat, and rather unlikeable. Due to the first-person narrator, we don't even get much of a sense of the other characters; they're just sort of background-noise to the non-story being told. The effect is that we never really feel connected to the story, and don't really care about any of the characters. Also, our first-person narrator has an extreme tendency to ramble in run-on sentences. As a literary technique, I don't mind this too much, but when the character himself is boring, any little quirk in his voice becomes grating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Excellent book as all of Chang-Rae Lee's novels are.

So I bought Native Speaker, and wasn't as impressed as the critics had been, but that was okay because A Gesture Life had made up for it. After hearing the reviews and NPR shows about Aloft, I was thrilled when I finally got it. So what's the problem?The book is patently unreadable. The prose makes no sense, the dialogue is stilted and banal, and the story line is impossible to follow. What a disappointment. The one line that rings true in the book is on page 74, when Lee is describing the mediocre writing skill of his character's son-in-law: \\"He's the sort of writer who can put together a nice-sounding sentence or two, and does it with feeling, but never quite gets to the point\\". That says it all for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Characters don't ring true","review":"After reading A Gesture Life, I expected wonderful character portraits. Instead, I found the portrayals of just about all the characters so artificial and contrived - right down to having the protagonist fly a plane - that the book was almost painful to read. I forced myself to get through about 2/3's of it and then simply could not go any further.

There are mistakes throughout the entire book, most of which are easy to read through. Such as a main character's name misspelled. However, some errors are frustrating and very difficult to decipher.

I understand how she was trying to portray the character of Sally Sweet, but it possible to convey the fact that he is cursing without actually using the profanity.

The bathroom is already steaming from Stephanie's shower when Joe Morelli makes his move, and readers' hearts will beat a whole lot faster. Oh, yeah, the rest of the story's not bad, either, with Stephanie on the trail of an elusive skip who pops up every now and then to torment her ex-boyfriend...and Stephanie. Grandma Mazur and the rest of the gang at Vinnie's Bail Bonds are in great form, and there might be a new \\"regular\\" in the outlandish cast of characters, a musical transvestite.

But it is the characters -Stephanie, Joe Morelli, Grandma Mazur and all of Stephanie's cohorts and the Italian, New Jersey setting which will keep you reading and often laughing out loud! This is the best one yet in a very good series which keeps getting better all the time!

In the book, Maxine- the FTA- steals her boyfriends car, and doesn't appear for her court daete. Pro bounty hunter, Stephanie Plum, recieves help from Lula(ex Hoe), Sally Sweet(drag Queen) and from many other interesting people. There are many twists in this book.

FOUR TO SCORE by Janet Evanovich.Like always, Stephanie is faced with bringing in a person who skipped after bail. Seems like a pretty simple case in the beginning. As she starts tracking the bail jumper, she finds herself trapped in a maze of clues, enemies, extortion, shoot outs, missing limbs, drag queens and a baby. Only Stephanie and her family and friends can make crime funny.FOUR TO SCORE readers have grown accustom to Stephanie Plum's antics when it comes to recovery. I love her entire family, the community and co-workers, not to mention the relationship Stephanie shares with Rex. Each and every book, I find myself laughing and anxious to see if she's getting any closer to setting her life on the right path."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even Better the Second time","review":"I just finished Four to Score for the second time and it was even better than the first. Knowing the plot and knowing where the relationship with Morelli was going let me relax and savor the new characters (hope she brings Sally back), and Grandma Mazur's one liners.

I've read all of the Stephanie Plum novels and felt that this one was the weakest of the five. While I always enjoy Stephanie's antics I felt that the author is introducing too many wacky characters. By novel #4 we now have crazy Grandma Mazur, flamboyant Lula the ex-'ho and now Sally Sweet the cross dressing rock star. It's beginning to look like a dog and pony show in here! I also thought that the central crime story was boring in this one. BUT, I still do love the Stephanie Plum character and the author's following book, High Five, was an improvement over this glitch so I'm giving Janet Evanovich my vote of confidence and looking forward to book six of the series.

This is the third book of Stephanie Plum series I read this weekend and boy, my heart still do a bop-bop-baby-sound. I'm totally in love with Stephanie, the crazy bounty hunter from hell. And the whole lunatic gang is also present; Ranger, Grandma Mazur, Lula, and of course yummy Joe Morelli (I'm in serious case of crush for that guy!). Another character is been introduced here also, Sweet Sally, a drag queen who helped Stephanie in her latest case, trying to find out a girlfriend seek for revenge.It's a whole catastrophe fiasco in this fourth book with Steph and Joe finally get together (that's me, shouting Yes!) and people think they're getting married with Steph being preggers. I LOVED this book! I still have book number 5 in my shelf, and I already ordered book number 6. I can't wait to read them all!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Laugh out loud funny","review":"I have laughed and laughed reading these novels by Evonovich. I woke my husband up the other night laughing while reading this book.The characters in this book are too funny. Grandma, Cousin Vinnie, Sally Sweet and Lula each add a new dimension and many laughs to this story. Grandma is the type of granmother you would love to have; she says what she is thinking. Lula is one of the funniest characters and as this series continues, she gets better and better.I particularly like how Stephanie's cars get blown up over and over again, but not the blue bomb. Wonderful.Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"seriously pyrotechnic stuff","review":"Poor Stephanie - car exploded, flat blown up but what the hell, as she gets to have the steamiest scene imaginable with the Divine Morelli (I had to go and have a cold shower after reading it), she might feel it's a small price to pay.Perhaps not the best of the series but I can't wait to find out what happens next. Stephanie is a role model for our times"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT ONE OF EVANOVICH'S BEST!","review":"Janet Evanovich still managed to write a funny - but much less so than \\"One for the Money\\"- mystery, but I felt this one had too little mystery story in it and too many hard to believe incidents. The \\"shooting\\" scene with Sugar was a little funny, but it was just too miraculous an escape even for Stephanie. Also, haven't there been enough car destructions? Time for more plot and fewer harrowing experiences for our heroine. I wonder if the reader from CA noted the use of \\"choose\\" (twice!) when, I think, \\"chose\\" was the proper tense? Wondering about Number Five!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of 'em","review":"This is the best of the series. The action is great--... Four is a funny, action-packed adventure with all of the great old characters, and some wonderful new ones. This is literally a laugh out loud kind of book (but which of the Plums isn't?)!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Love Morelli but....","review":"I was greatly looking forward to this book. I love the Morelli character and just couldn't wait to find out what was going on with him. Still, I was a bit dismayed when the mystery took a back seat to graphic sex. Not that I'm a prude, I just think it should be used _when necessary_ to add to the plot or to give information about characters. The same information could have been conveyed without the \\"humping\\" scenes. The earlier books were much more about plot and character...and much enjoyable. I hope the next one is better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"RAUCOUS THRILLER","review":"Janet does it again in providing hilarious wit and grit in following bounty-hunter Stephanie Plum in Trenton, New Jersey, and the Jersey Shore. The battery of characters are fun, like Grandma Mazur, Lula, Sally Sweet, Connie, and of course, good looking studly cop Joe Morelli, a romance dating back to their high school days. Stephanie is after a female skip but manages to run into counterfeiters, thugs that cut off fingers and other body parts,and victims that are very much dead. There are mishaps and screw-ups but Joe, Lula, Sally and Good Luck has her back. Does Stephanie get her woman - of course! Good entertainment and the pages fly by."},{"rating":"2","title":"Evanovich better work!!","review":"After enjoying the one-liners from Four To Score, I was expecting more in High Five. Unfortunately, she toned it down a bit. Four To Score was a hard act to follow anyway. I have read all five books in the series, and now I'm trying to something find reading to hold me until the sixth book. It's not easy. I hear a movie is due. I only hope such a production will do Stephanie Plum and her entourage justice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of the first four Plum Novels","review":"Four to Score was by far the best of the first 4 Plum novels. Non stop action with plenty of comedy thrown in to boot. Thank God Stephanie and Joe finally got rid of the sexual tension. It was killing me. Can't wait to get to the next one in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"love this book","review":"As the series goes on, the quality goes down.

It was not good at all. The language in the book turned me off. Surely these books can be written without these words that are offensive. The book was poorly written. The character development was lacking. It did not flow and was hard to read. I will try other Janet Evanovich books and see if they are better. So I give it a lone star."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best in the Plum series so far....","review":"I never laughed so hard with the interactions between Morelli and Stephanie. You don't want to put the book down until you get to the end. Every person can relate to the pre sex tango between Morelli and Stephanie and cheer when Stephanie finally lets reality hit her over the head. She's a lovable character but she leaves you shaking your head thinking is she really that stupid. I look forward to the next book in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another laugh-out-loud Stephanie Plum adventure","review":"Needless to say, if you've already read the first three Janet Evanovich books then you're going to read this installment without hesitation.It's an easy read with moments of sheer madness that will have you laughing out loud. Over the top characters appear to have nothing in common but, as always, all the characters are connected in some way that only becomes clear towards the end of the novel.All in all a worthy fourth installment, roll on the fifth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stephanie and Joe finally do the \\"dirty deed\\"!!!","review":"Well, this is not the best of the four, but it is still entertaining, funny and a quick read.I loved the new characters, happy that Rex didn't die and could feel the passion finally ignite BIG time between Joe and Steph.Unfortunately, I also found two typos, that I hope are corrected in future editions: dessert is spelled \\"desert\\" in one place and on another page there is a period instead of a comma or visa versa. Not being nit-picky...I am a writer so I tend to notice these things!Good, light, entertaining summer read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as fast-paced as ..., but....","review":"After reading the ... series, I thought this series was alittle slow on the action. I don't understand how people could comparethis series to the ... series. Although it is lacking in action itmakes up for it in witty repartee and amusing sexualinnuendo. Stephanie Plum is your average girl turned bounty hunterwithout any special talent, but loaded with dumb luck. Although herluck can be stretched at times, the author makes note of that andincorporates it into the dialogue.That's what kept me reading. It'sinteresting and definetly one of my favorite series(next to ... , ofcourse). I definetly recommend this series for those of you who like agood mystery and a good laugh, but for those hard-core action fans,this might not be the series for you. END"},{"rating":"2","title":"Evanovich Strikes It Again With Humor and Mystery!","review":"Janet Evonovich's Stephanie Plum series is such a good read. This is number 4 in her series which I believe has reached number 12. It is much better to start with number 1 and work your way through. You will not be disappointed with this book. Stephanie Plum, girl with big hair, half Hungarian, half Italian, is a funny,lovable character and you will fall in love with her and this series. The added elements of mystery and other characters in her life will keep you laughing. My friend, from New Jersey is so fond of saying, \\"damn skippy!\\" now because of these books.

I read all four books in two & a half days!! I need more recouperation from staying up to read the books, than I did from my surgery!!

I explained that I am in the process of gathering quite a nice library of HARDCOVER books and I would like to have a new one and I would ship her the misprinted one.

He treated her like garbage and has never said or acted like he was the least bit sorry. Plus, I really don't buy the physical attraction. There is no believable heat or tension between these two - I couldn't believe it in the second book where they go from nothing to being naked in the buick within about 90 seconds. Gee, how hot.SP was in a new situation with the first book and her mishaps and attempts to figure it all out were funny. Now it's just pathetic. Is she really this stupid? She hasn't learned anything in the last three books? Not to mention not having learned anything about men since she was 16.I have nothing against explicit sex scenes - I just wish they were with Ranger.Joe's a pig.This is all old and over-done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well at least its not as bad as the black maid outfit!","review":"Well..do to her lack of understanding the true character of trenton...it has an quite BAD similarity to many of her real life friends...including the ones she was living a dubble life with...I must say it raises my level of confidence in her ability to stab with daggers!

Sue Grafton and Patricia Cornwell better watch out; Janet knows what her fans like and she delivers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure enjoyment!","review":"They don't get any better than this. Maybe the author will take pity on the Plum-dependent and not make us wait another year for book 5."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a cast of characters","review":"In the fourth Stephanie Plum novel, the cast of characters get even crazier. To just read a review about the eclectic friends and family members does not do them justice and frankly, most people would be turned off by the cross dressing musician Sally Sweet who is a key player to solving the criptic messages Stephanie is trying to solve in order to track down the missing FTA or failure to appear client from the bail bonds office Stephanie works in as a bounty hunter. Stephanie's bad luck with both her cars and her apartment are nothing new in this zany pseudo mystery novel.Is it worth buying?I really like this series, but as an individual book, I would say no.

Instead, Stephanie is subjected to a torturous scavenger hunt with the skip's ex-boyfriend, who accounts for 90% of the \\"torture\\" (mentally, anyway), and to some competition from her mortal enemy, Joyce Barnhardt. So now Stephanie has to get to Maxine, who knows more about other crimes than she wishes to reveal, before Joyce does, and before the Reaper gets to Stephanie.Four is funnier, and faster-paced than its predecessor. When Joe and Stephanie get together, it gets hot, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"SCORE is the Key","review":"I'm rather new to the crime novel genre, but I find Evanovich's novels hilarious. Yes, some details seem a bit silly, but, overall, it's a fun read. I like that Evanovich doesn't take herself so serious, which allows me to take myself similarly. Come on, even parts of Shakespeare's works are silly. Although I've read only 4 of her novels, this one is the most risque. However, her \\"love\\" scenes aren't so sappy that I can't enjoy them too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Winner","review":"Another good Plum mystery by Evanovich. Probably not as good as Three to Get Deadly, but still great none the less. Lots of sex with Morelli in this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great unabridged audiotape version at the library","review":"Amazon needs to locate to the unabridged audio version of this novel. It was very well read and simply delightful. I was laughing out loud driving down the street!

Secondly, the characters were stereotypical fantasy types: the earnest, beautiful young diplomat, the rogue captain, the bumbling fool who tries to flee the action but ends up in its midst. Thanks, I'll just pop in my Star Wars tape. And finally, we had the story stop right in the middle of the action!

Everyone jumps to the most outrageous conclusions about other characters' actions and fates, never thinking about alternate possibilities. No one questions the information given to them by mysterious supernatural entities. The plot moves quickly, but at only by sacrificing any credibility or sympathy the characters might have.I managed to read all of DIPLOMACY OF WOLVES, but the last several chapters were a slog towards the painfully obvious conclusion (which nevertheless is a surprise to the characters).

Because anyone who actually bought and read this to their children is not only politically brainwashed themselves, but (like the author) probably in desperate need of anti-psychotic medication.2 stars purely because of its humor value and the proud liberal tradition of compassion for the mentally ill. A fellow American beseeches you to seek help, Ms. DeBrecht. We don't need to be indoctrinating our children to despise their fellow citizens. A true conservative would know that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Sad","review":"This book is actually wonderful in the sense that one can see the simple and evil manipulation of children adults have been using for years. Lie to and mislead them when they are too young to think for themselves, ie Jesus and Santa Claus, and they'll believe it forever. It is unfortunate, and quite telling, that severe right wing conservatives are so frightened their children will grow up, hear their own party's rhetoric and DISAGREE, that they must brainwash them before they have a chance at independent thought. Any parent reading this to a young American should really be soul searching and decide why they're so afraid to let an adult think for him or herself."},{"rating":"1","title":"That was brilliant","review":"Do you realize, in the description on here, it says 'It's just a plant' is a liberal book?

NEVER! Instead, encourage your children to form their *own* opinions as they mature. A child cannot grow to an adult when merely fed opinions.

The movie was originally released in 1981.Unfortunately, the DVD I received was flawed: the video was a bit behind the audio. You can watch the movie (it's akin to a poorly dubbed foreign film) but it's obviously not the best experience.

The problem here is that few of the tracks on \\"Life is Sweet\\" can even be identified as songs.

But nonetheless the problem remains -- no matter how much one respects her efforts the album still needs to be listened to, and at that level \\"Life is Sweet\\" is a very difficult album to warm up to.

It is, in my mind, simply the best rock albums of the 90s by a female singer. It is an engrossing collection of songs dealing with frustration, rejection and fear.

What sinks them, and the entire album, is the way to heavy handed production the drowns each and every one of them in a sea of murky noise that comes across as feedback more than music. This is a shame given Maria McKee's extraordinary voice and talents. It also seems to have been the album that has put some serious brakes on her career, if not halted it altogether. She has not been heard from in the seven years since its release."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lose your preconceptions.","review":"This is one of the greatest albums I have ever listened to. Big guitars and sweeping strings create a rich gothic background for that beautiful Voice to fly across. The first five tracks grab you by the scruff of the neck to try to make you understand. The next five hold you close to calm you down. The final pairing of 'Life Is Sweet' and 'Afterlife' is both life-affirming and sonically amazing (reminds me of My Bloody Valentine). If it's sugar coated chart fodder you want, then steer clear of this. It's real music, with real meaning from a true soul. When you listen to it, you'll understand."},{"rating":"2","title":"A mature and versatile songwriter struts her stuff","review":"I am a huge Maria McKee fan (loved her since her Lone Justice days) and this is my favorite of her albums. Admittedly, it took a few listens for me to start loving this one. It does represent a departure from her earlier work. Much of the album shows what I think must be a strong Bowie-Ziggy Stardust influence--one not audible on earlier albums. The songs here are gut-wrenching and thought provoking. The lyrics are amazing--especially on \\"Absolutely Barking Stars\\" and \\"Smarter.\\" This is pure guts and I applaud Maria for making this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ancient knowledge brought to 21st century light","review":"One of the best books around on the practice rather than the theory of alchemy.

NO organization the size of the NRA (over 3 million members) is without its share of controversy or disagreement among its members, but this book doesn't even try to capture an objective picture of this aspect of the NRA. Instead, it's like reading low grade political material slamming the competition, as though the author was being paid to make the NRA look as bad as possible, as apparently, he was.

Buying this one, however, has really let me down. Some of its drawbacks I can think of, off the top of my head, are: it does not include a number of current and even trendy names, the pronunciations are often not written clearly (with an occasional \\"just flat wrong\\" pronunciation given), and some of the definitions and origins are inaccurate, if not completely inaccurate. Sure, any name book can have a lot of interesting names, but my suggestion is to buy just about any baby name book /but/ this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Below averageI wish I hadn't bought it","review":"I was disappointed with what I found between the covers of this book which looks, from the outside, very helpful and informative. I found the selection of names left something to be desired, and there was nothing very exciting with the names that were here. The format isn't the best, and I would not count on this book to look up accurate meanings. I do like the fact that the 500 most popular names have their popularity number after them in the meanings index, but this small fact can hardly compensate for the number of faults this book has.As an author as well as a baby-name enthusiast, I found it lacking the necessary elements for a good resource in character naming. Though it might look helpful, it wasn't in the end.My advice, if you're thinking about getting it: don't. You'll wish you didn't.

In fact, it almost made it to the \\"bottom\\" of the list of books I reviewed today.

To buttress his argument for integration of religion and science, he draws a straw man definition of each -- neither of which is acceptable to respective practitioners -- then predictably tears these definitions down. The philosophical window dressing he employs indicates that he has read (or skimmed) much critical literature (exposing the surfaces of science and religion, in which he claims to be looking for depth), but he clearly does not understand the practices and tenets of them (the deeper meanings). This is a perplexingly manipulative and unenlightening read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting read, but a basic misunderstanding of science.","review":"I enjoyed Wilber's writing, but his argument about the common ground between science and religion makes some assumptions about science that are just flat wrong. He draws a line between 'broad science' and 'narrow science' to support several theories including that meditation is a 'portal to the Divine'. Science makes no such distinction. Things are either verifiable, repeatable and relevant or they are not. It was a distorted presentation based on a tortured definition of what science is and is not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Food for thought ...","review":"What is it that does not completely resonate about this book?

The lotion is used twice a day, every day. The lotion has no fragrance, which he appreciates. The scrub is not recommended for the face, but he has had no problem with it once or twice a week, it gets rubbed for just about 10 seconds.

This is a counterforce type brace which is supposed to reduce the tension on injured tendons, in this case the tendons that originate from the lateral elbow.The problem with this brace is the hard plastic pieces. As others have noticed, theses plastic pieces do not bend well. So unless your forearm fits perfectly with the plastic, you may not be able put enough pressure on the extensor forearm muscles in order to reduce the tension on the injured tendons.I have a simple Mueller brace with a gel pad which works better.

No matter how tight I tried to make it (even to the point of nearly cutting off my circulation) it kept sliding down my arm.

Worn snugly it helps with persistent pain, cinched more tightly it makes painful movements much less so. When tightly cinched it does somewhat inhibit flexing of the forearm muscles. In that case I just loosen it a bit: it then provides less pain-relieving support but allows great flexion, so it's a compromise, but much better than nothing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Tennis Elbow Device","review":"Best product for extensor tendonitis.

But as others have noted, it doesn't give, so in some movements it was too tight, and loosening it made it ineffective in other movements.But the allergic reaction is something I've never had to plastics before.And the velcro strap is quite scratchy.So the design may be good, but the materials used are bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"The band cuts into your arm.","review":"The review title says it all.

Teagarden gets quite some space here and he is sympathetically introduced by Whiteman.

I thought Andy Garcia represented Modgiliani's charm well, and the woman who played Jeanne uncannily looked the part, though I found her acting skills not up to par. The cast of artistic characters was fun, too - though I think the depiction of Picasso and Gertrude Stein were way off the mark.But, the movie is terribly melodramatic and takes huge liberties with the true story.

This book is a thorough, well-written review of osteopathic medicine's climb into the medical arena; originating from the depths of the mind of its founder, Andrew Taylor Still in the late 1800's, into the growing profession of the 1980's. Unfortunately, however, it does not cover the growth and expansion of osteopathy in the last twenty years of the 20th century. It does explain, though, the legal and social struggles that osteopathy survived in its first 90 years. Gevitz also does a wonderful job explaining what ostopathy is and how it evolved from a holistic, drug-free approach to medical care into an alternative, legally licensed medical practice. I highly recommend this book for osteopathic medical school applicants. It is also an excellent book for those interested in the history and sociology of medicine in the United States."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ouch!!!","review":"Rainy Davis (her real first name is Denise) had a couple of minor R&B hits with her 1987 album \\"Sweetheart\\", a plausible if not extraordinary effort.

Her voice is fairly thin/weak (a la Brenda K. Starr) and although she's credited as having written much of her own material, she still struggled to make the upper reaches of the Dance/R&B charts.

This is a great musical marriage, although I do miss the Bohemians. I have just recently purchased this album (C.D.) due to my twin 4 year old girls who want to see the Goodtime video everytime I power up my laptop (Win 95 C.D.)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unlike the days of New Bohemians, but great.","review":"I loved Edie Brickell and New Bohemians' Shooting Rubber Bands at the Stars so I expected a similar sound with Picture Perfect Morning. I was surprised at the bluesy sound, but not disappointed. The melodies on this album are jazzier than Brickell's earlier work, but the strong, thoughtful lyrics are still there. I think this album, because of the jazzy sound, appeals to a larger portion of the listening audience. If you didn't care for Brickell's Shooting Rubber Bands at the Stars, don't shy away from this album. You may find the new style appealing and, as always, Brickell's performance is wonderful."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good","review":"This is a lovely set of songs that show off Ms. Brickell's song writing strenght. While it could be argued that either a) her hubby helped out or b) she listened to tons of S&G before writing these songs, she still has some real song writing talent that presents itself here.\\"Good Times\\" is a great radio freindly ditty, but to my mind the standout track is \\"Lost in the Moment\\"- simply one fo the most heart wrenching songs ever written.A nice pop collection for your Sunday afternoons"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for beginning to learn torchon bobbin lace","review":"The reason I like this book is that the diagrams and photographs are clear and use colored threads.

A few anachronisms, like a cyclops forseeing the devastation of the New World, give some stories a distinctively modern flavor, which is not entirely a bad thing since it is the prerogative of every storyteller to add his or her own flavor.The deus ex machina manner of some heroes' baptisms into the Christian faith would confuse a newcomer, but bear actual roots in Irish history. As Catholicism grew to dominance, baptisms were tacked on to the ends of stories to provide spiritual aedification.An introduction to this work is sorely needed, since the reader cannot tell how many of the stories are folk stories retold, and how many bear the embellishment of the anthologizer. The historical context from which these stories arose requires further explanation, especially for the Irish diaspora.In short, not a masterly work, but closer to greatness than mediocrity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life Changing!!","review":"This is an incredible book. It can change your heart and your ideas of where God is and how much He really cares.

No one will care if you die and you'll just be an unmarked grave. Which is what Country club probably was as we read in the second chapter that he passes away. I think this book has just the right amount of detail and dialouge. At first it didnt catch my attention but as you start to read more into the book its difficult to put it down. you wonder who will die next? what will happen to the rest of the characters? This book is also faced with a very young homeless girl named tears who is 12 years of age. She still has a chance to be somebody and get off the streets before its too late.

It is the story of a street kid that calls herself Maybe and a \\"tribe\\" of other homeless kids that she lives with. Maybe found herself on the street when her mother kicks her out, because Maybe is the oldest and her mother has to many children to care for. The characters in this story are realistic and easy to relate to and the writing style is absolutely brilliant, both dark and exciting. But be warned this book will have you in tears.

But she also tells about people that want just to help and get nothing in return but just to see the kids get a better life than the one they have on the streets. I really liked this book because of how Todd Strasser gave us an idea of what happens to kids on the streets and that's why I recommend this book for not just adults but teens also. It gives us an idea of what happens everyday when you are sitting in a warm house, with clean clothes on your back, and food in your stomach."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kids are kids everywhere and they all deserve respect.","review":"This movie is outrageous. The two lower points: racism and lack of respect. Lack of creativity and cliche (as saying all black people look alike). Kids was mistreat and emotionally abused there(as when Pauly Shore start talking bad about the hair of a black kid, call other black kid chubby, or thrown other black kid at floor pretending he was being arrested? Why he didn't got any white kids there, as his audience for his show in the same place, same movie, were all white?) And come on, kids in the rain? Losing kids from orphanage? All this abuse was only because the kids were black? Black kids are thieves?

That's just wrong, nothing new."},{"rating":"1","title":"stupid and offensive!","review":"This so called \\"Movie\\" not only is one of the stupidest things I have ever witnessed, It is extremely offensive to Africans, black people and the whole adoption process. If Pauly Shore ever visits African again he better hope some of it's citizens hasn't seen this movie or he may just not make it out alive. I do not see how anyone with half a brain thinks this movie is funny! I realize it is supposed to be a comedy. But this is ridiculous! The little paragraph at the end by Pauly explaining that even though he made fun of adoption, that adoption is a serious matter makes it even worse in my opinion. What a tasteless piece of Garbage!

In Big Red One, it seems every German took 2-3 shots to kill - reminded me of the old Wolfenstein or Doom days. They just kept popping up again like punching bags.This is MUCH better in COD3, as is the interaction w/ your squad mates.Unlike other people, I found it tough to plays this 1-2 hours at a time.

Every part (4) fits perfectly together, simply brilliant !"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books I've ever read","review":"I happened upon this book by chance as it's not my typical sort of interest. I was on a trip and left my book (half-read) on the plane. I bought this book at random out of desperation, and then couldn't put it down.

I finished this book this morning and was very disappointed in the final section. I enjoy mysteries that can actually be figured out and have logical explanations; when I read, I enjoy a world of rational events. This would be a good book for someone who was just reading to read, it's full of detail and historical characters, and it would be good for someone who enjoyed reading about RELIGION! I didn't know it was going to have a religious foundation, which I wish someone would have told me before I was only 100 pages or so from the end! Too ambitious, too convoluted, and not worth the title \\"mystery.\\" Good general historical fiction, and tons and tons of immersion, although sometimes the details do intrude a little."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books in years","review":"A wonderfully compelling novel, where nothing truly is what it seems. It starts off giving you one impression, then gives you a totally different view point, and by the end, everything you thought was true is turned upside down. Not many authors today can weave such a strong, solid, believeable story in four different versions, all completely different, and yet still plausible. Its only virtue is length, which probably would frighten most readers, but it's well worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"The Name of the Rose\\" it is not!","review":"Drawn to \\"Incident..\\" by its bold comparisons to one of my favorite books, \\"The Name of the Rose\\", I was very soon disappointed by its differences. While \\"Name\\" gave us characters to sympathize with with, \\"Incident\\" gives us none. More often than not, the story became as bogged in the mud of details. Inarguably, considerable knowledge of the English civil war is needed to follow the distinct storylines of each of the main actors in this historical drama. Like a prism, the color of the story changes depending on the angle from which it is viewed. Unfortunately, the colors of the people of the story are almost unanimously dull. If you are searching for history-based drama and sympathetic characters, read \\"Name of the Rose', Jakes' \\"Kent Family Chronicles\\" (\\"The Bastard\\", \\"The Americans\\", etc) or \\"North and South\\", or, more desparately, selected books by Jeffrey Archer; leave \\"Incident at the Fingerpost\\" on the shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"Verbose","review":"This may be a great book, but the wordiness (not length of story, but torrent of unneccessary words) was too much, after even 50 pages.

The narrators drone on and on to a point of tedium one rarely gets to experience in life.But for those who didn't like the ending I think you are missing a major point. The last narrator THINKS the woman has supernatural powers, but that doesn't mean she does. His narrative is not intended to be any more accurate in an absolute sense than any of the others. So, his \\"take\\" on this character is just that: HIS TAKE. It's not the horrible unbelievable ending it's being played as by some since a man in the 1600s may very well have held such beliefs.Still, the book could lose a few pounds of wasted words and maybe with those wasted words missing it would have been decent. Otherwise, it's just an experience you could end up resenting as you throw good money after bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"just couldn't get through it","review":"Tried as I might, I just couldn't get through this one.

I found it to be uninteresting and confusing. Perhaps it's because I started with the last section first and read through to the start, but I thought the book was too long and wordy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting, rewarding reading but too slow and weighty","review":"Reading Pears' novel is a lot like eating an all-day sucker- the process is long and requires patience and perseverance, but the reward is sweetness. Nevertheless, Pears' narrative is too often distracted- the reader has to listen to the same story told, in slightly different variations, four times. While this is a unique and refreshing approach, it makes the novel difficult to follow at times. Pears' characters are colorful and well developed but he spends so much time probing their identities and philosophical dispositions that he has little time to actually write a murder mystery. In fact, this book is less a bona fide mystery as an account of political and religious turmoil. In that regard,however, it is a well crafted story and deserves to be savord."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gripping, exciting, and surprisingly sentimental.","review":"Iain Pears \\"An Instance of the Fingerpost\\" virtually demands the reader be familiar with the history of England in the 17th Century and to some degree the geography of Oxford in the era. His description of events and personalities unravel oh-so-slowly that the reader gets surprised at every turn. The four principal characters each provide an account of a complicated murder mystery. Each appears quite different in their own account versus the other 3 accounts. A fifth character, Sarah Blundy, seems to be the same in each account with only minor revelations provided, at least until the surprise ending. Pears' novel takes a strange twist into the supernatural at the end, but he keeps it clear as to why the twist occurs. Overall, powerfully written, an intellectual tour de force, similar to Eco's \\"Name of the Rose\\" and \\"Foucault's Pendulum.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought-provoking and readable","review":"I came to this book because of a taste for historical novels, and found that my enjoyment of it mounted progressively until by the end it gripped like a vice, and on a business trip to Japan I found myself ducking back to the hotel for ten or fifteen minutes between meetings in order to savour a few more pages. It was almost a wrench to finish it, and yet my eye was drawn on from page to page as Pears toyed with my notion of truth. By turns didactic and arch, the book is a prime example of historical fiction, interweaving as it does the factual and the invented. The overall theme about the nature of truth being dependent on the perspective of the observer is thoroughly contemporary, and undermines the reader's sense of superiority in observing the endeavours of the characters to understand matters as diverse as the circulation of the blood or the philosophy of politics. I have bought copies to give to my friends, which is the highest recommendation I can make."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unputdownable.","review":"The best mystery book I've read this year, or at least a close tie with Barnard Bastable's (aka Robert Barnard's) latest.

I cannot recommend it highly enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"a perfect treadmill of boredom","review":"After struggling for five weeks and becoming more and more confused by characters, events, and so forth, I simply have called it quits. My interest waned at about page 200 and I gave up around 400. Seventeenth century viewpoints were interesting and Pears style was better than most writing today. However, I many times wished for an abridged version. Like hearing Wagner's operas,it was interesting at first, but sheer length left me yawning."},{"rating":"2","title":"a thrilling investigation set during the restauration","review":"Just like the philosophers of the time it describes, the book has many levels of interests. It delves into the historic, scientific and politic background of the time while conducting a clever investigation of a particular crime. If, like me, you love detective novels but you often think they are too 'one dimensional', you will appreciate the depth and richness of this tale."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating","review":"I usually read historical fiction more in the line of THE TRIUMPH AND THE GLORY or COLD MOUNTAIN, but now and then vary my interests a little and in doing so discovered this captivating novel.

This is one of the better books you will read for quite some time to come."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, boring, boring...","review":"From reading all of the other Amazon reviews, I know that I am the minority here; however, I found the book to be tiresome and a chore to read.

Not what I was expecting."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is like a bad long-term relationship","review":"I read this book through till the end but I don't know why. All I can think is that it was like a bad long-term relationship. It looked so enticing at the beginning, and then by the time I got to the middle I was very confused and couldn't keep any of the accounts straight, and wasn't even finding the characters very interesting, yet I thought--well, I'm 400 pages into this thing so I can't stop now. And so on and so forth. I kept thinking I should put it down, and then I'd think, well I've invested so much time and effort already, maybe it will all be worth it in the end. Well, it wasn't.

WHAT a disappointment. A rambling mess that I could not finish. Not only did I not care about the victims and why they died,the characters are uninteresting and disconnected with times. Pears just isn't much of a storyteller, the reader continually waits for something to happen. He would have been better off cutting the book in half. I found little to recommend, and I'm taken aback by its positive reviews.I finished \\"Name\\" with a great feel for the times, the personalities of the people, how, and what, they thought about the world around them, and profound sense of history. Propelled along by a terrific mystery and compellng protagonists and you have a great book. Pears does not deliver any of this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too long, uninteresting","review":"This is the first book that I began reading but never finished. I bought this book because I usually love historical mysteries, and I had read another book by this author that I had liked.This book however, had very little mystery in it. It was also so long and drawn out that it couldn't even hold my interest when I was trapped on a plane for 4 hours.Because I couldn't even bring myself to finish it after a few hundred pages, I have to give it one star. I am honestly very surprised by all of the praise it has received."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY BORING","review":"I thought this book was pretty boring. So much so that I returned it. Try Paliser's Quincunx or The Unburied or anything by Arturo Perez-Reverte."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty deep","review":"I'm more of a reader of historical fiction set in contemporary times, preferring novels like \\"From Here to Eternity\\" or \\"The Triumph and the Glory\\", but Pears' book caught my eye and a friend had read it so I bought a copy and settled into read it. I was captivated by the new experience of a literary mystery, but am not accustomed to working so hard for my entertainment! Still, when all was said and done I have to say I was pleased. Hurrah for \\"An Instance of the Fingerpost\\", it has won me over to frowning a bit in concentration while reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Take notes!","review":"This book just returned to me from my brother. It was a gift to me from him 15 months ago after I sustained a cerebral hemmorhage and subsequent brain surgery. My brother has an interest in the historical period covered, and gave the book to me on condition that I loan it to him after I finished reading it. It was a challenge to me at the time, but I did find it quite intriguing, particularly the Rashomon like format, and the inclusion of historical characters, not often met in popular fiction. By the later sections of the book, I found myself strongly wishing I had taken notes earlier, as I was too lazy to reread earlier sections and couldn't remember things in enough detail. I urged my brother to take notes as he was about to undertake his reading. He didn't, and now wishes he had. Read the book, but TAKE NOTES!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This didn't work for me ...","review":"I am no stranger to historical fiction or mystery fiction, and I know this is controversial opinion, but this book just didn't do it for me. The different narrative voices sounded all the same to me. I found the pace ponderous, the style heavy and self-important, the welding of historical fact and fiction too deliberate, and the plot incredible."},{"rating":"2","title":"How We See Things So Differently","review":"I just finished reading An Instance of the Fingerpost. What an intelligent, clever book, that I want to read it again, just to appreciate the intertwining of the characters. One aspect of the book not mentioned is the love story explained in the last chapters of the book. Very intense and distrubing.Four men telling their story of the same event, seen so differently and each man so complex and evil. I just loved this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book--history, intellectual thought,and mystery.","review":"The book is composed of four narratives describing the same set of events. The first narrative is by Marco da Cola, a venetian merchant's son, who is in England to take care of business. He ends up in Oxford and witnesses and participates in several scientific experiments and debates and describes a murder investigation, trial, and execution. Each successive narrative provides additional facts and opinions and brings new elements to the story. It is amazing how well Pears has brought real characters into this work, how he involves the reader in philosophical debate, manages not to add too much confusion by introducing many characters, and still weaves a good murder mystery."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great after you get going","review":"Am I the only one who had trouble getting through the second section? Not because the writing was poor, but because the narrator was so off-putting. The first and fourth narrators are so likable, and the third one at least is cool, so I galloped through those sections. If you're stuck in the second part, take heart and keep going--it's well worth it in the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth the investment of time...","review":"This is a hefty book which took a great commitment of time to get through, although it was quite addictive and not easy to put down...I simply had to tear myself away to go to work! It's one of the few very ambitious narratives that actually measures up to its hype and promise. Can't recommend it enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like a circle in a spiral, a wheel within a wheel...","review":"Often a Rashomon approach changes the facts with each telling. Witnesses to a car accident each report it differently. One says a blue car jumped the light and hit the white car. Another says the blue car had the light when it hit the white car...The magnificent thing about Pears's writing is how cleverly he handles the Rashomon approach. In each telling, the facts remain the same. There are new facts added, but the old facts remain constant. The changes are in the perceptions of what the facts mean and how they are interpreted. This is clever writing, indeed. Especially since each evolution in fact building and interpretation is radically different but non-contradictory to that before. It is fascinating to see how well he does this and is worth reading for this if nothing else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldnt finish too long","review":"I just could not get into this book, I never finished it, it was tooooo long and did not get me interetested soon enough. :( Mark G"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mind-numbingly boring, just couldn't get into this...","review":"I bought this book to read during the four-hour train ride to New York. What a waste. An Instance of the Fingerpost is a historical novel with a touch of intrigue. I love historical novels, cannot resist them, but this one left a bad taste in my mouth. For one thing, the author drones on and on with descriptions that serve no purpose to the story. It felt as though Pears wanted to share his thoughts -- however remote -- to the reader even if it had no relevance whatsoever.Yawning and wishing you had something else to keep yourself amused are never good signs. So I gave up on this book before finishing it. I felt cheated the way I do when I watch a very good film trailer: good premise, big hype, bad outcome. I cannot fathom the good reviews here. Disappointing..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful, worst book I've ever tried to read","review":"I must admit I was unable to finish this book. The main (only?) female character was being raped for 5th time and I just couldn't continue. I can't imagine reading this horrible book for enjoyment. Even books on the holocaust have a reason for being written, this is just gratuitous and totally unnecessary. It pains me to think that so many people could actually have enjoyed reading this. If you'd like to avoid numerous instances of rape and gory depictions of post-medieval medical practices...then you must avoid this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"ZZZZZZ..................","review":"This book was extremely boring. I'm a big fan of Umberto Eco, and (to a much lesser degree) Perez-Reverte, so I thought this book was a sure thing. But WOW was I wrong! I struggled through the first two character's tales, and then just couldn't justify wasting ONE MORE MINUTE on this borrrring tale. The characters are boring and horribly unsimpathetic, as is the story, as is the historical period (Cromwell does not exactly equal exicitement). The research done for the book is surly commendable but the fact is that the time period is so lame that it really doesn't lend to decent storytelling. AVIOD THIS!

The book is about 700 pages long, so I was stuck in the bathtub till my skin looked like a rancid prune.I felt cheated (and prematurely wrinkled). And I still do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, poor ending","review":"This book was my first by Iain Pears, and even though it's long, I finished it in no time. The plot was fascinating, and I really enjoyed trying to understand the story from four different points of view. I thought each version of the tale expressed a unique voice, which made the book even more enjoyable. However, I didn't like what Sarah Blundy became at the end. The resolution of the mystery itself was satisfying, but the rest of the last account in the book just degenerated into something that didn't fit with the rest of the book. I got the feeling that Pears wanted to make a brilliant murder mystery into something more \\"transcendent\\" -- an attempt that, in my opinion, fell flat. I wanted to read historical fiction, not a messianic tale.Nevertheless, I highly recommend this book. It's a well-crafted work that is definitely worth the read."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent read...great drama, Michener would be proud","review":"I really did not know what to expect. I found \\"Instance...\\" to be enjoyable and disturbing, funny and sad. A great mixture of emotions and personal insight. Man's \\"justice\\" wasn't any different then, than ages before and after.

The ending had a innovative twist and left me hungry for a follow-up story."},{"rating":"2","title":"History, philosophy, politics, psycology, murder, faith","review":"A complex story told from four angles, the resonance of the whole is far greater than the sum of the parts. The parts themselves are amazing alone. Four different voices, and four different basic understandings of what is happening in the world, mundane and cosmic. Not really beautiful as a lyrical text (Pears is not for example Robertson Davies) yet the structure of the work produces a kind of polyphony. History is more dominant than psycology, but the work is also an interesting hymn to faith. A 9 rather than a 10 means its not James Joyce but what else is? This is a wonderful book which effortlessly, deftly, arches across multiple genres, is beautifully constructed, and compelling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but overlong and unpolished.","review":"An enjoyable book. It is compelling - I couldn't stop reading it - and provides and intellectual murder mystery without becoming stuffy.It is not, though, brilliant. The several stories of which it is composed do not mesh quite well enough for my taste; the final, pseudo-religious conclusion is at the same time quite unsurprising and inadequately foreshadowed in the text.An excellent read - but certainly not great literature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Concur With the Poor Reviews","review":"A disaster when measured against the hype and six pages of glowing reviews (not to mention a surplus of 5 star reviews by Amazon browsers). A dearth of rich characters. Uncompelling narrative that stalled all too frequently. Better historical fiction exists by writers such as Murdoch, Eco, Du Maurier, and nearly everyone else touted in high school and college literature courses. For reviewers who rate this as the \\"best historical mystery ever,\\" go easy on the superlatives. Of the greatest historical suspense novels, this does not rate. For an example of what a powerful narrative can do -- and to feel what it's like to be shot out of a gun based on the power of word alone -- I direct all admirers of Pears' work to read Pallisner's The Quincunx. This is a modern miracle of historical mystery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terribly overrated -- a thoroughly dark and depressing work","review":"When this book came out it was widely compared to Umberto Eco's The Name of the Rose.

The book is well written and the author explains the concepts pretty well, my biggest problem is the errors. A lot of the answers in the back of the book are wrong. Since this was for a class we focused on the problems that did not have answers in the back of the book, but when you are trying to work through one of them as an example it can be difficult. We found at least 2 every week. Since I had a teacher it was not a big deal, but for those who are buying this book to study on their own it could be a bigger problem.

You should not take seriously the reviews made by native American speakers into account, because it is their own language, so this book may appear to be too easy for them to learn anything new. But I would like to announce that what foreign learners need to know are in this excellent book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Comprehensive and easy to use; weighted toward \\"old\\" idioms","review":"This idiom dictionary is comprehensive, beautifully written, and well-organized. All of the idioms are listed alphabetically with clearly written explanations and examples. In addition, with many of the idioms, Ammer gives a brief (almost too brief, in my opinion) explanation of the origin of the idiom. My one complaint with this dictionary is that it is weighted toward older idioms (i.e. those related to the folk tales, drama, novels, the King James Bible, and the lifestyles of Medieval-Renaissance period in western Europe). This is understandable since many American idioms come from that place and time period, but The American Heritage Dictionary of Idioms is definitely not the book to get for a comprehensive post-1950s listing of Americans idioms. Overall, this is a great resource for American idioms and a must for anyone creating ESL books and materials like myself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect idiom resource!","review":"If you're looking for the ideal resource for idioms, this is it!

But if English is your first language, it's very doubtful that you need it. I don't consider myself very knowledgeable about idioms, yet I could scarcely find more than a few that I didn't already know the meaning of. To an average American, 90 percent of this is useless.

She uses many examples from patients she has seen in private practice. At times the many examples get in the way of the basic advice. Dr. Sills does describe well how easy it is to stay in a comfort zone and not break out. As she says we are on a platform and the way to leave is only by a high-wire; which in turn causes anxiety. She slips in brief advice advocating visiting a professional and for prescription drugs. This book was helpful but brief.

All of the drama, the monologues, the glitz and glamour (when appropriate)is there. The movie even opens with Sidney Potier driving by the Space Needle, how cool and kitch is that? An excellent film that needs to come out on DVD very soon - as does the Route 66 TV series!Stirling Silliphant was definitely one of the best TV writers of the 60's, he passed away in April of 2006. He will be missed. He also wrote the original Poseidon Adventure (1972) (screenplay), and the Towering Inferno!

I felt physically ill as I left the theatre. Months later, after still reading rave reviews, I gave it a second chance (on video for $1). It was beautiful, overwhelming, multi-layered, sexy, shocking, tragic, and even funny. If you steel yourself for this experience, you can enjoy it for what it truly is: a Master film-maker, working with a masterful group of actors (led by the exquisite Helen Mirren, who is flawless and Michael Gambon, who is terrifying), wearing unmistakeable costumes by Gaultier, feauturing music by an amazing composer (Michael Nyman), all coming together beautifully to tell this beautifully lit and photographed tale of love, revenge, power, and tragedy. Be warned: it is not for the faint of heart. For those who dare, it is a once in a lifetime cinematic experience that you will never forget."},{"rating":"2","title":"Work of a maestro","review":"I watched this film recently after not seeing it for a while, and as always it never fails to delight me. A few key images here crop up in some of Greenaway's other films, like the wild dogs in the introduction (which are echoed in Prospero's Books) and the pyramid, which shows up in almost all of his other films but most especially The Belly Of An Architect, which I believe is his most highly underrated work. Every scene of this film is glorious; art for art's sake, not some banal thrown together nonesense that is an insult to our senses like so many other movies out there in Hollywoodland. I for one thank my lucky stars for Peter Greenaway--he never fails to amaze and educate whoever has the sense to look and listen, and he does it with the precision of a truly great artist."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most interesting movie I have ever seen!","review":"I don't know what attracted me to this movie...

Horrible writing and an awful, one-dimensional storyline. This movie is disgusting and leaves a terrible taste in the mouth and knot in the gut. Whosoever compares this to art is comparable to someone comparing hardcore S&M with making love. Extreme - yes. Of value - no. And I'm no prude, but to suggest that people who love someone do the things seen in this movie, and that our watching it has value, is delusional. I wonder if the director/writer had anything in mind but to shock the general populace as much as possible. Art - no.

The tension developed in the story was unwavering and monolithic. I don't mind a tense story, but this tension never made sense to me. Why bother to create such a monstrous world and then do nothing with it?I wouldn't mind the nausea if there was some point to it.Perhaps a cinematographers union has descended upon the ratings for this movie.I think this one is for visual artists/designers only, and those who want to be shocked.I may have missed the point of the movie by not recognizing the true story, as conveyed in a secret code of costume changes and clattering pots."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Cook the Thief His Wife & Her Lover","review":"Enen tho this product (supposedly) was shipped from NJ for Region 2 my DVD player (new Sony Blu Ray) would not play it.

My feelings were 1) revulsion 2) pity 3) titillation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply Not That Good","review":"I am being generous giving this film 2 stars. And no, it has nothing to do with being squeamish, or because it isn't a mainstream Hollywood popcorn film. I love challenging films. This just happens to not be one of them.Yes, the art direction is great. Yes the director of photography did a good job. But who cares? The overall effect is utterly pretentious. Why? Because the whole shooting concept overpowers an ultimately weak script. In order to pull-off the retro-concept of a taut drama unfolding amidst a minimum of sets, you have to have a very good story. Nudity, cannibalism and overly stylized dolley shots tracking endlessly from room to room just isn't enough to keep a person interested for a few hours. You need to be given a reason to give a damn.Since I mentioned cannibalism, let's not forget that the big pay-off of this film (where the cast eats the bad guy)was already done by John Waters in Desperate Living, and years earlier."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disturbing, enthralling, riveting, disgusting, see it.","review":"If you know what a cinematographer does then watch this movie. If you know what \\"Mise-en-scene\\" means in a film watch this.As another reviewer noted, I have never seen as many people walk out of a movie as this one. The theater was full at start, 1/2 empty at finish. It is extremely disturbing on numerous levels. Visually this is the most stunning movie ever made. Be warned however, eat well before viewing this, you will not have an appetite after viewing. It is 10 plus years since I saw this and it is still unforgetable. If you liked \\"Pulp Fiction\\" you will probably like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why bother?","review":"I pride myself on having a black sense of humor, and when a friend whose taste I trust raved about \\"The Cook, The Thief, etc\\", I went along willingly. The opening segments were dark and scatalogical, and I thought I was in for a treat. Wrong-O! A pointless and perverse plot made me wish I'd gone to see something interesting, like \\"Our Friend, Mildew\\" or \\"The Wit and Wisdom of Attorney General John Mitchell\\". In a climactic finish to the film, when the writer & director could used suspense, and hinted at the finish, they instead smash the viewer over the head. Of the 5 people I saw this film with, only 2 were around at the end. My friend said afterwards, \\"I'm sorry you didn't like the movie.\\" I replied, \\"I'm sorry you did.\\" I'll put it this way, this is not nearly as much fun as \\"Killing Fields\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent . . . if you're pathological","review":"Stylistically perfect and visually gorgeous, this is also one of the most unremittingly sadistic and gruesome movies ever made.

I adore Helen Mirren, but I didn't enjoy this movie. The style of the movie gets in the way of the story and the story is as gross as gluttony. The style is art house gone overboard. One room is entirely red, the next is completely white, etc. The unsavory elements include book eating and cannibalism-for-revenge. If you enjoy Helen Mirren, I suggest Prime Suspect instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie is just plain hideous","review":"The writing, directing, acting, sets, and cinetography were all first rate.

That, however is rather superficially accomplished and is not enough to carry a movie. It does, however deal with a parade of grotesque behavior carried out by soulless and uncompelling characters - it is unconvincing, surreal and stupid.

I saw this movie in a theater in Portland, Oregon when it was originally released. I sat through about half of it. I had to leave because I felt like I was literally going to vomit. I tend to have a weak stomach to begin with but this movie totally repulsed and depressed me. It was a nightmare that seems to have originated out of the pit of Hell. Do I have a stong opinion about this movie?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Torture for art's sake???","review":"This over the top art flick makes some snobby reference to the emerging middle class into money and power. Apparently in England that is a bad thing. This country has a branch of government (the house of lords) that only requires you are born of certain families and you get to write laws that affect everyone ELSE. Anyway the director and writer is an ARTIST so he is above it all apparently and he has a self made man portrayed as a brute, criminal and torturer. That's what happens when you are not born from the proper noble stock. The worlds biggest fashion victim designer Jean Paul Gaultier is responsible for the costumes and the talented actors involved in this joke hopefully fired their agents by now. Call me too sensitive but I don't enjoy watching a 10 year old boy get slowly stabbed in the stomach nor am I a big fan of torture for arts sake."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Film of All Time!!","review":"Take away the visual style, set pieces, production and direction and THE COOK, THE THIEF, HIS WIFE, AND HER LOVER has no redeeming value. It is a film of excess, gore, humiliation, and decadence. This is a detestable movie with characters we don't care about and an ending that is so graphically sick it is beyond reproach. Why this film is hailed as great by some people defies explanation. To find out why by watching again wouldn't change this reviewers mind. This reviewer would rather watch JACKASS:THE MOVIE...at least there is some humor and comedy to all the decadence in that film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Marvellous, Shocking, Beautiful, Dire","review":"This exists in my top ten films that have inspired my life. Certainly also belongs in my top ten films ever made. Greenaway is trained as a painter, and you can certainly tell. His use of color and composition of shots and scenes. The actors are amazing as well, and you see the wrenching that occurs as they pull marvelous, deep performances out of boxed in character types (note the title). I should also mention that my wife HATES this film, for being so beautiful and gut wrenchingly horrible at the same time. It is not for the squemish."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Black Comedy & Everyone Knows An Albert","review":"This is a great black comedy because everyone knows someone who is, to some observable extent, just like Albert Spica: Rude, crude, coarse, common, pretentious, overbearing, bossy and know-it-all. Michael Gambon dominates his every scene with an uninhibited gusto that imbues the viewer with open-mouthed, what-is-he-going-to-do-next, awe. I gave this film to a friend who is, within legal constraints but completely unfettered by any sort of societal propriety, just like Albert Spica. The guy phoned next day, absolutely appalled that I would suggest he behaves in a similar fashion. Next day, though, he called back and confessed somewhat meekly, yes, \\"I guess I do get like that, sometimes when I'm drinking.\\"It's worth having this movie just to pay homage to any Albert Spicas in your life.

Sounded interesting. I rented. I was disgusted.This shallow wannabe flick with a highly predictable tale of adultery opens with a scene that has a man stripped to his tee, smeared all over with dog excrement, and even having it shoved down his throat. Which, as you may imagine, has nothing to do with the rest of the movie.The sole intent of the director seems to have been to constantly bombard the audience with horrendous characters (the thief), sickening imagery (some very likable characters are tortured, maimed or killed), characters being degraded in sickening ways, and as a cherry on the terrible cake, a bite of cannabilism.The production values of the movie are pretty good, so it's kind of sad to see them squandered on such a vile, grotesque story. Reviewers at Amazon seem to have taken the good camerawork as a conduit to say, \\"This is ART!\\"No, it isn't. It's just grossness for grossness' sake. Oh, and it's gross.

I was especially surprised at how sparse the (-single-) chapter on Zoroastrianism was!Since this book does not thoroughly address the subject that most people would be getting it for, based on its title, I wouldn't recommend spending money on it.

It's boxed with four other Kramer films, in which I have little interest, but Hey! at least it's on DVD!This film adaptation of Carson McCullers' coming of age story features wonderful performances by Ethel Waters - a luminous screen presence - and a young Julie Harris as tomboy Frankie, along with an excellent supporting cast. This is a poignant and excellent film that depicts a portion of everyone's life that we need not to forget, if not for ourselves, for those in the throes of it, now and to come. And if you like the film, read the novel, too. McCullers was a fine, fine writer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Landmark drama for a 50s film","review":"MEMBER OF THE WEDDING was a landmark in an era when movies were still sentimental, melodramatic, or else full of spectacle in order to compete with television as it was coming of age. It was innovative in that it kept its faithfulness to the stage play and didn't sell out to standard Hollywood fair. Broadway's finest plays often have had more of an intellectual appeal, and therefore Hollywood often times had to \\"adjust\\" them to make them marketable to general audiences who weren't so intellectual. (Just check out the way the early 50s film of THE GLASS MENAGERIE nearly destroyed the Tennessee Williams play, or the way producers had to mercilessly sanitize the late 50s film of CAT ON A HOT TIN ROOF.) The uniqueness of this play/movie is that it not plot driven but rather more character driven; not a lot happens, yet strongly and brilliantly fleshed out characters make it a masterwork, and that's the nature of the piece."},{"rating":"1","title":"popsicle maker mold","review":"Dear Sirs:About your popsicle maker, I was very disappointed!I could not get the metal off the top when I tried topull the frozen pops out.To sum it all up, It's not worth the powder to blow it up!It's a piece of junk.Thank you for your time,Montie Paul"},{"rating":"2","title":"Queen of the dollar store karate movies","review":"Both movies in the set are actually quite entertaining.

The lessons are contrived and the exercises to try at home are quite useless.This book has NOTHING to do with Native American Tribal Spirituality.Native Americans do not use the word Shaman. Each tribe has a different set of beliefs and practices.They only teach their spirituality orally, not in books. Please keep that in mind.I have studied paganism, neo- paganism of all sorts.

This book talks about the 7 types of depression and anxiety, how they are caused, what brain chemicals are causing the symptoms and where in the brain the problem lies. Dr. Amen uses SPECT nuclear imaging to see the brain in its depressed/anxious states. Along with descriptions of all of the 7 types are images of the brain with that type of depression/anxiety. I narrowed down my depression/anxiety to be a type 4, followed the advice it suggested, and have been 90% depression and anxiety free for 6 months.

The current tools used at the university level are more sophisticated (Functional MRI, Transcranial Magnetic Imaging and PET )but are not in conflict with his findings.The graphic and concise presentation of brain images and text allows both the novice and more familiar reader of Amen's works to understand the overlapping features of these disorders. An advantage of his style is that a reader may begin the book from any section or chapter.

As a police commander of many years, I think it would be great if police sergeants could master the dated material that Iannone has preached in this book for decades. Before we look for new and easier reading, can we pretend for a moment that we don't really know everything there is to know about police supervision?

They frequently devote 20 or more pages of verbs, adverbs and diatribe to summarize a single concept that could have been conveyed in one or two paragraphs. As an example, I encountered one sentence with over 80 words. No one talks like this. In real, usable language, this book could have been produced as a pamphlet, a guide.This book is frequently listed as required reading for those seeking promotion within Law Enforcement.

He seems to effortlessly create characters as diverse as they are fascinating. One cannot read this story without feeling some kind of empathy or emotion toward each of the characters.

As it is, the first time i used it, it did leave my face incredibly smooth!I was unsure when i bought this if it was worth the price, but believe me, this shaver is not your fathers old shaver.

I kept waiting for the plot to develop, and it didn't. Perhaps if it had been called \\"The Recollections and Musings of Kurt Vonnegut,\\" I'd have been less disappointed, for the book would have lived up to its billing. As they say, don't judge a book by its cover - or its title."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Master At Work","review":"With Timequake, Kurt Vonnegut shows that he still has the ability to bring the reader on one of his amazingly unique and unpredictable rides. To compare his books to one another is a waste of time considering that they each stand on their own as brilliant works of literature."},{"rating":"2","title":"A clever poggo-stick bounce between points in time","review":"Vonnegut's clever manipulation of time and sequence in \\"Timequake\\" shows that he is as sharp as ever. I thoroughly enjoyed this book, whose temporal manipulation I found to be similar to, though less audacious, than Vladimir Kek's open flaunting of the same in his own debut novel, \\"Mafia Lesbian,\\" a book that resonates with wry and slapstick Vonnegutian humor and styling. I would recommend both \\"Timequake\\" and \\"Mafia Lesbian.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"Compared to his other stuff, this book was a disappointment. For devoted fans it is worth the read. However, I usually want to read his books again, and this one did not inspire that desire."},{"rating":"1","title":"I won't read it twice!","review":"Boring. I didn't enjoy reading this. Just kept hoping the \\"funny\\" part would start on the next page, but it never did. I can't believe he got paid to write this .... It's as if he pulled out all of the scraps from his garbage and stuck them in a book. PLEASE don't waste your time on this, when there is so much great writing to be found elsewhere. I recommend David Sedaris."},{"rating":"1","title":"STAMP: Return to Writer","review":"Vonnegut's 19th, and allegedly last, novel is a mish-mash only diehard Vonnegut fans are likely to appreciate. There are all kinds of semi-autobiographical musings here, mixed in with the remnants of a failed novel. I lost interest a quarter of the way through and tossed it aside."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cmon","review":"It's unfortunate that grumpy old men are unaware of their grumpiness. I read and loved the three Vonnegut novels I read up until this point; Slaughterhouse Five, Cat's Cradle and Breakfast of Champions. But when you become a cynic without a story, it's best you leave your complaining to the grandchildren. This self indulgent novel which ostensibly asks, is anything really important, just rambles on like the years that have passed throughout this aging author's life. Die-hard Vonnegut fans will likely point out to the five or six witty paragraphs and urge prospective buyers to purchase. I had this novel in my house for a long time, however, I did not read it because I heard rumors that it was a capper novel, desert for the fan the wasn't full after reading his other works. This is desert for the man that doesn't stop eating, regardless of how junky the food is. Read his other stuff because it's great literature and there is copious amounts to scurrage through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hopefully the end","review":"Mr. Vonnegut I sincerely hope you choose not to write again. After wading through the trash you concocted out of 26 letters on horizontal rows with maybe eight punctuation marks I was thoroughly nauseated. How could you assemble such a meaningless, meandering, mumble, and release it to the public with good conscience. If this is 'the good version' I would have really hated to see the first one. I'm a giant Vonnegut fan. And I've loved nearly all of his work I've come in contact with to this point. If you're a dedicated fan then I guess it's your duty to read this, this pile. If not, start with some of his earlier work. And save yourself the trouble."},{"rating":"2","title":"Part Autobiography, Part Fiction, a Complete Joy","review":"If you read this book's jacket, you already know the story. A timequake forces everyone back to '91 for a ten year rerun. When it wears off and people don't know how to react, failed sci-fi writer and veteran Vonnegut character, Kilgore Trout saves the day.I love the concept. I certainly wouldn't mind reliving the 90's, but the last decade was a real drag. The only criticism I have is that the story is minimized and the focus is on the author's personal anecdotes and family stories. Then again, that's Vonnegut.For the uninitiated, Vonnegut is the literary equivalent of pizza. He provides intellectual nourishment without being too preachy and overbearing. The thing I love most about him is the way he tells a ridiculous story in his deadpan, matter-of-fact tone.So, pour yourself a beverage of choice, put your feet up, and enjoy a delightful, effortless read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry Kurt... I suggest reading something else","review":"Sorry Kurt. It is painful that the author of such incredibly wonderful books as Slaughterhouse-Five and Breakfast of Champions wrote something like this. It is a challenge to stop publishing when you stop having something creative and interesting to write. Unfortunately, Vonnegut did not meet this challenge. This book was published and how many people will buy and read it like I did to find that it is a waste of ink.I recommend reading something else by Vonnegut before reading this. For that matter, I recommend reading anything by anybody before reading this. Sorry for the bad news. I was sorry I wasted the time going through it hoping it would get better."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Book for Vonnegut Enthusiasts","review":"Timequake's a book that's probably only for Vonnegut enthusiasts. Others may appreciate it, but few would pick it up unfamiliar with the author. It's not one of his most famous but still a good read.Vonnegut speaks in the first person mixing in both fact and fiction, playing alongside Kilgore Trout. Timequake's a message book, as are most of Vonnegut's work. He lays out his views on war, particularly nuclear war and his continued desire for extended families. It's easy to follow and contains many of famous quotes. Myriad references to his life and previous works would be lost on those unacquainted with Kurt."},{"rating":"2","title":"the \\"failed book\\" is a device, kids","review":"I am startled by the many reader reviews that completely miss the fact that the so-called \\"failed book\\" is a literary device employed by Vonnegut to frame the story. This is probably his best work since \\"Breakfast of Champions,\\" which employed a similar device, inserting Vonnegut into the fictional action. (Were readers supposed to think that Vonnegut had actually been attacked by a junkyard dog in the \\"real\\" world?) Yes, the machinery is all onstage for everyone to see, but that is a very large part of Vonnegut's charm."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for casual fans","review":"Timequake is not quite a \\"final novel\\" for Kurt Vonnegut, but rather a final goodbye to his hardcore fans. Though the dust jacket gives a plot outline, there is no real plot to speak of...only the musings of an old man in his final years. And this is why I loved it.Thought provoking, sad, funny, 'Timequake' is all of these. It's just not a \\"story.\\" It is Vonnegut musing over his life, sharing his thoughts and experienced for those who wish to look into his mind for a little while.Facinating to some, incredibly boring to others, 'Timequake' is meant for, by and large, his closest of followers. I thoroughly enjoyed sharing in this mans final thoughts (to us)."},{"rating":"1","title":"The First Vonnegut Book I Didn't Finish","review":"Vonnegut seems to have lost the ability to juggle multiple narratives the way he once did so masterfully (see \\"The Sirens of Titan\\"). The result is a mishmash.He mourns the death of the short story as a literary form and gives that as his justification for the device of inserting his ideas for short stories into his novels. I've always enjoyed that device.But this is what happens when you take a short story (or more accurately, the bits and pieces of a short story) and mix it in a salad bowl with other ideas for a short story, along with some family reminiscences and your general cranky views of life. It starts nowhere, goes nowhere, and although I gave up on it about 3/4 of the way through, I'll bet my next paycheck that it arrives nowhere.If you decide to read this mess anyway, ask yourself what would have happened to the manuscript if it had originally arrived on a publisher's desk with your name on it instead of Vonnegut's."},{"rating":"1","title":"What kind of Book is this?","review":"When I bought this book I was expecting a science fiction novel. I think this book is just a bunch of random paragraphs and chapters that are thrown together and make no sense. I did not even finish reading it since I couldn't make any sense of it.

I have never had a hard time finishing a book. This one took a laborous six months to complete. In my opinion, the book should have died on the writers block. Unfortunatly, I must give credit for one line, which is the reason I bought the book in the first place. \\"All people, living or dead, are purely coincidental\\" sums up the way I feel about the world most days. I will always love his classic works, my favorite two being \\"Slaughterhouse 5\\" and his short story \\"Harrison Bergeron\\". Leave this book alone and read some of his better stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book...for Vonnegut fans","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this novel. Although not a traditional structured book, who cares. There are nuggets of wisdom from an accomplished writer and a person who has lived life. May not be for everyone though. If you are unfamiliar with Vonnegut perhaps you should read one of his other stories first."},{"rating":"2","title":"A piquant farewell to a treasured friend","review":"I have mixed emotions about Vonnegut's newest and, as he says himself, last novel. In it he states that what we are reading is actually a rewrite of his original that is referred to as \\"Timequake 1\\". After finding that TQ1 \\"didn't work\\", he decided to scrap most of it in favor of a memoir/novel/ essay that would be his answer to a sports hero's final season.I live in Chicago, and I'll mourn Michal Jordan's retirement much less than this old friend's, whom I've invited into my home time and again over the decades. I only hope that he'll change his mind and maybe even give us a chance to decide for ourselves the merits of Timequake 1, and that perhaps he'll throw a collection of short stories our way.

But once I got comfortable with the fact that this is more a memoir than a fiction, I couldn't put it down. As Vonnegut says in the book, people like to know who it is that is creating the art they enjoy. That's part of the game. Vonnegut has always let us in, always shared himself almost in equal measure with his creations; his creations are richer for it. This book is a heartfelt letter from an old friend: still making me laugh, still touching in his humanity, still stubbornly trying to be decent in an indecent world. In the first chapter, he says \\" . . . a plausible mission of artists is to make people appreciate being alive at least a little bit. I am then asked if I know of any artists who pulled that off. I reply, 'The Beatles did.'\\" So has Kurt Vonnegut."},{"rating":"2","title":"His best in years","review":"I love this author but most of his later books cannot compare to his earlier triumphs.

Starting out the book was a struggle to read...due to extreme boredom. It did get better by the end, but not much. Even Kurt Vonnegut said the origial book 'Timequake\\" wasn't to his liking so he took the best parts and strung them together, quite haphazardly I might add, and we got this book...Timequake 2 so to speak.

As a whole though the book is disappointing and a bit morose. It certainly isn't science fiction and it isn't exactly a memoir either.

To say that is to simply miss the whole point. In his last work, Mr.Vonnegut is wrapping up his thoughts and swnding us his final message. Part life and part fiction, \\"timeqauke\\" tells us who kurt vonnegut really is.

If you into self-flagellation and you enjoy going to visit 80 year-old uncles who are happy to blather on in stream of consciousness while you're bound and gagged and bored silly, then this is the book for you.

A collection of mostly unrelated paragraphs with no sense of cohesion.

But the truth is, it doesn't happen.With all due respect to a great writer, this book is a big disappointment.In my eyes, Vonnegut's narration is that of a semi-senile, proud man. He repeats; he explains and clarifies the obvious (killing even the slightest chance of irony); he holds an authoritative tone of \\"Listen to this:\\"; and he boasts about his life's achievements like a grandfather to his grandchildren.Not the book I had hoped for."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book for our times","review":"Timequake is the only Vonnegut book I have read so far.

In short, I loved it! In Timequake, Vonnegut pieces together his life's story, along with quite a few satirical comments. My only regret about reading this book is reading it before I read the rest of his books, because this book gives some closure to the ideas set forth by Vonnegut in his other books. In Timequake, Vonnegut has the world do a rerun of it's past ten years. The world is taken back ten years, while the present population is forced to watch what it did from ten years ago to the present.

Timequake was well worth reading. I found it insightful and entertaining, all though it lacked a natural progression of plot. The book is written well, but it was hard to follow all of what was going on at times. Kurt skipped around along the timeline, from World War II on through the year 2001, which did not help the book advance. Vonnegut tells the stories of several different people, some real and some fictional, through out the novel. He also shares parts of his own life and his views on human existence in general. Vonnegut uses a universal chronological disturbance, the Timequake, as a center to the chaos of this book. He writes about the lives and times of some of the people involved in this curious event. The focus of Vonnegut's writing is a homeless author named Kilgore Trout. This story skips around a lot but it is enjoyable and well worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Book Changed Me","review":"Other people may disagree, but in my humble opinion, this is one of the finest books ever written. I do not care to compare this book to his others. I view it as a unique masterpiece. His look at humanity and family, however, is a bit \\"less cynical\\" than the former Vonnegut. If you buy this book, be sure to focus in on the section where he discusses the Gettysburg address. It is fascinating and Kilgore's reaction is perfect. I have re-read this book many times and each time find a new bit of information that fascinates me.

Some seemed irritating and facile... until I began to see that this is an anthemic book, the work of a mature artist with something to say, who is conserving his precious energy by employing the icons from his own history and past work (notably, the views of the character Kilgore Trout, Vonnegut's alter-ego) in a slyly provocative short-hand.The book is a kind of fugue, or perhaps a good piece of American knitwear designed and woven by an iconoclastic, humane and gifted man.I predict it could become a cult classic, but dearly hope it gets far wider exposure.

There are practice quizzes at the end of each chapter that are thought provoking and a good test of your understanding of the material. I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bogey is King!!!!!!!","review":"Let's face it, Bogart was a true hollywood professional and the fact that not to many of his movies stunk make him a true legend of the silver screen.

I would not recommend this example of her work to a new reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slightly lacking","review":"The first 2 Amanda Quick books I read were the exact same story with different names (I forget which ones they were). I kept reading her books anyway because I like her writing style and most of the books have enough of a change that you don't get bored. This book is the first one of hers that I was disappointed in. It felt like she had a deadline to meet and didn't have time to do more than an outline. The characters of Lavinia and Tobias were very sketchy, I never got a good sense of them. Lavinia's niece and her boyfriend were much more interesting, but they were only secondary characters so we didn't really get their story.

Claiming it was for her own good, Tobias destroyed the antique shop she owned in Italy with her niece. Forced to return to London, Lavinia turned to private inquiries. She literally runs into Tobias while investigating the man blackmailing her. They form an uneasy alliance when they determine they are working toward a mutual goal. An interesting mystery is the heart of plot of this story. The investigation is full of twists and turns and unusual details. The outcome is unsure until the very end, with the suspense building until the resolution. Unfortunately, the budding romance at the heart of any romance, is sorely missing from this story. Lavinia and Tobias grow to care about each other as the adventure progresses, but it is unclear if they love each other."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slightly Boring","review":"I loved Ms. Quick's earlier works and reread them regularly. I have found her more recent efforts vague and disappointing. Unfortunately, Slightly Shady continues this tradition. I hate to say, this book isn't quite as offensive as some of her other efforts, but in this book, her characters aren't romantic and her plot is bland. I found it difficult to latch on to any redeeming quality in the characters. I saw no reason for the main characters to find any attraction to one another. What doe Tobias March and Mrs. Lavinia Lake see in one another. Whatever it was, it wasn't worth reading this book. The plot wasn't very well- developed, suspenseful, or even interesting. Maybe Ms. Quick needs to drop this line of writing until her enthusiasm for her work returns."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slightly Boring","review":"Sorry Amanda Quick but this one was disappointing. The storyline was OK but I really never liked Lavinia. I liked the niece Emeline better. It never really made any sense when Tobias got shot in the leg. He just wasn't able to move as quickly.

I'd like my money back on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"MUST YOU ARGUE EVERY DAMN POINT, LAVINIA?\\"","review":"That line, straight from the book, sums up what was most frustrating about this story. The author made the heroine (Lavinia) so darn annoying! She became almost unreadable. (But don't ask me what she looked like because by the last page, all the reader knew was that she was a short redhead with small boobs--which was more than was described about most of the characters.)

Not particularly for the three leading female stars, Fonda, Tomlin and Parton, sorry 'Dolly fans' but she isn't the best actor in the world, not that she needed to be in this movie as it is very much a light weight piece. But! Having said that I should point out it doesn't claim to be anything else, it isn't 'War and Peace'. This is a fun movie which manages to cover the serious subject of misogyny in the work place in a light hearted way. Should it be this light hearted? That's for you to decide.

She has a real cult following who will pay a premium for the episodes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Among 5 Best TV Shows of All Time","review":"This brilliant program, for which the delightful Blair Brown was nominated for the Emmy five years in a row (but kept losing to Candice Bergen for her good but forgettably one-note Murphy Brown and Helen Hunt for the awful whatchamacallit show with Paul Reiser) was a generation ahead of its time. No program before or since has captured the bittersweet elements of life so realistically and entertainingly. The writing was superb, the casting perfect, and the acting absolutely top-notch. I have a million memories of this series and quote it all the time (\\"Who writes this crap?\\"; \\"More pork things!\\"). It is shocking and unbelievable that the series has not been made available on DVD. I will pay nearly any price for it!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"counting the days to Molly Dodd","review":"I have tried to describe this show to my daughters, but it's impossible. I am looking forward to the day when I can pop in the DVD and introduce them to the magical, hilarious, dreamy saxophoneworld of Molly. How I have missed her!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I count the Days and Night until Molly is on DVD!","review":"This incredibly intelligent program aired at a time when I was living in the country with no cable or satellite service so my recetption was mangled by rabbit ears. But I still taped all the epidsodes. On BETA! I never did transfer all the episodes to VHS because I mananaged to keep at least one of my two BETA recorders working until a few years ago. Now I am desperate for a strong dose of Molly Dodd. The characters were so richly drawn and the stories bizarre and normal at the same time. Molly was unlike any sitcom heroine to date and in the hands of Blair Brown you wanted to be in her circle of friends and family. From time to time I will see an actor who played a regular or recurring character on Molly Dodd and twenty years later I still think of them as \\"that guy or woman from Molly Dodd.\\"We must have Molly Dodd on DVD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"To Whom It May Concern: Please release this on DVD","review":"Would someone PLEASE release this on DVD? ? ? This was my favorite series of all time. Intelligent and funny, and sometimes scary and sad. Television at its best. We want Molly."},{"rating":"2","title":"this is a great movie","review":"This is a very funny movie that shows rapid fire comedy is still being done well. Too bad Hollywood will NEVER make a movie this good. The subtitles are easy to read and actually seem to follow the plot of the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, not excellent","review":"I'm giving this movie a 4* rating because it is entertaining and more than just a bit moving at times. The protagonist is perhaps not the most lovable of all of the Spanish Bears one might find in movies, but he's convincing as a person who can both grow and change. If you like BearCub you will probably like this movie; however, you might find it to be a second-rate knock-off of that superior filem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent page-turner with bicultural insights","review":"This is a breezy popular novel and great read with many insights into navigating the conflicts of Indian-American identity. An Indian-American returns to India and learns more about her country and herself. The story moves fast and entertainingly, and its affecting sensational content dramatises our understanding of the character's conflicts with superb insight. Such cross-cultural differences as sexual identity and male-female relationships are delineated with acuity and power. A scene of widow-burning, for example, brings home the senseless cruelty of this Indian practise with searing effect. The novel's depiction of upper-class dilemmas -- the worlds it reveals are those of the affluent well-born -- are particularly well-drawn, with appealing and entertaining wit. A must-read."},{"rating":"1","title":"How does stuff like this get published?","review":"However many hours I spent reading this novel were wasted ones. I moved on to Nirmal Verma's Under Cover of Darkness immediately after Bombay Talkie and I was relieved that, yes, some writers do have talent.

The book is first divided into different neurological categories.In each category the topics that have been addressed are commonly seen cases.The differential diagnosis is presented in most systematic manner with the possible causes you as a neurologist cannot afford to miss.Great book that every Neurology resident must carry in their pockets.It has been life saver for me in number of clinical discussions especially when it comes to generating neurological differntial diagnosis in 'Case Management' conferences and bed side case evaluation."},{"rating":"2","title":"SONJA HENIE'S DEBUT","review":"The finale of this pleasant little diversion from 1936 is Sonja Henie's (pronounced Sunya Henny) triumphant professional debut at Madison Square Garden where, in real life, she made her professional debut in March of that year. The movie gives the cute-as-a-button Norwegian Henie a chance to skate and have a screen boyfriend in the person of Don Ameche (in real life, during this time, she was going with Tyrone Power). 20th Century Fox had to cover its rink with frozen milk because the refrigeration pipes showed through ice water. Executives also had to train chorus dancers to be ice skaters because they couldn't train ice skaters to do chorus routines! Fox paid Henie $100,000 to appear in this film, an astonishing amount for an unknown actress in 1936. In 1927, when she was fourteen, Sonja won her first world's figure skating championship; in 1936, she took her third; this movie is actually semi-autobiographical - Hollywood-style."},{"rating":"2","title":"War is on the Horizon","review":"I'm a late comer to the Warhammer universe. I've never played the table top games or trading card games. I have played Squad Command on the PSP. Well, that's nothing compared to Dawn of War. Wow! This is a fun RTS. It reminds me of Command and Conquer, but without the campiness. Even after all these years, the graphics still hold up nicely. Those space marines are a fun bunch to control. Objectives are easy to understand, but completing them is another thing. This game is not just about amassing a huge army and then running and gunning. You've got to manage your resources and personnel well. There is just the right amount of challenge to keep you interested, but it's not an overly complex or difficult game. For $30 you get the game with two out of three expansions. How can you go wrong? It's definitely whetted my appetite for Dawn of War II."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fighting + Choice = Awesome","review":"In most RTS games, the accumulation of resources is the first and foremost goal of any player. Without enough resources, you're sure to lose to better equipped enemies. While this is true in Dawn of War, the resources are Requisition and Power, which advance at a constant rate depending on the number of strategic points you hold and the number of power stations you've built. This means that, while your primary goal is to get resources (particularly requisition), to do this you must fight everyone else for the strategic points, placing fighting (the true reason to play an RTS) as the primary goal, instead of \\"waiting for my civilian to collect enough wood.\\"Further, with The Dark Crusade, the campaign takes on a whole new level: the level of Risk, where you must gain control of provinces individually to win the entire game. This gives the player another level of tactical choices to use, and the more choice, the better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great game for fans of Warhammer 40K","review":"First, I have to say that I am a long time Warhammer 40K fan. I have played the table top game and collect the army pieces. So, when I found out this was coming out I got excited.I was not disappointed. The missions are fun and can be challenging. Sometimes I would fly through a mission, other times I would have to play over an hour to finish one. Several times I lost a mission and had to start over. I have not tried the online multiplayer yet.My only complaint is the maps are not interactive. Meaning you can't blow up buildings, bridges, or anything else that has not been built by your opponent.Besides that, it's a great game to play. To top it off, it's not expensive at $30. Really worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"WA Incorrect Key Codes","review":"The game is nice.I also got a 16 digit key code for Winter Assault (and it is asking for a 20 digit key code). I saw on a forum that it works if you insert 0000 in the first box. It didn't work for me but when I inserted 0000 in the middle box it worked. Play around with the 0000 before you return the game. It might work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best RTS to date","review":"This is likely the best RTS game to date. It does away with a traditional resource gathering theme and instead forces you to take and hold territory to be successful. It has 7 armies to play and every one of them is completely unique. On-the-fly upgrades and reinforcements as well as squad based combat give you amazing flexibility regardless of which army you play. You can even customize the colors of the forces you use.Over all, one of the best and most under rated RTS games of all time."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't know if this game is any good.....","review":"because the idiots at THQ published the wrong install code on the back of the manual and it won't load."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this game here....","review":"I just went to Best Buy and got it for 29.99Also it WILL be missing the code key for Winter Assault.This is a known problem from THQ.Good Luck, you'll need it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective Product","review":"I disagree with J.

Combining some of the best storyline, and RTS to make one hell of a game."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Suspenseful Page-Turner","review":"Interracial romances/marriages are a fact of life in our world. Sadly, the romance genre has been rather slow at playing catch-up with modern times.I enjoyed 'From the Ashes'. First, the lead character, Paige, is a refreshing treat from the typical size six romance heroine. She's a character that many women could relate to, considering the average woman in America wears a size 12 to 14. I especially liked the way the authors described Paige's body type, both playful and affirming. I loved the fact that Paige was a model. I'd like to see more romance authors be as bold.The fact that there was a conflict of cultures--namely that of Linc's and of Paige's, was eye-opening to say the least. And the conflict wasn't sugar-coated.I am extremely thankful that at least ONE romance publishing company has the guts and the savvy foresight to take romance to the next level. I'm also looking forward to more books by these two writers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally Captivating","review":"FROM THE ASHES is a combination of two cultures and the authors do an wonderful job of portraying each one, then mixing them together to give a provocative romantic suspense. The mystery of who and why is intensely gripping, it had me anchored to the pages, waiting for the next twist. I was spellbound by their handling of the sexual tension between the hero and heroine. The secondary characters were given just the right amount of time and were truly a integral part of the story. The dramatic ending was totally captivating. I was thoroughly entertained,and look forward to more from this splendid writing team."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good and easy read.....","review":"This was a book that I waited a while to read. I was hooked instantly in the beginning of the story. Linc and Paige are awsome characters, and the heat from the two rolls of the pages. Although I prefer a little more descriptive form for intimate scenes but the message was conveyed all the same. I loved that they brought in the Native American culture here. Genius! Not often to see the traditional side of the NA culture. The suspense part was a little lackign as I figured the plot from the first few chapters. Still was an excellent book!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Abington, PA","review":"FROM THE ASHES IS A MARVELOUSLY WRITTEN NOVEL. THE CHARACTERS ARE WITTY.

I read pretty fast and that allows me to read at least one book a day sometimes more.I don't like to start a book and not finish it.

I was expecting thoughtful essays about the meaning of life, as filtered through the experiences of the author, a psychiatrist. Instead, the book had little more depth than a sixth grader's \\"What I did On My Summer Vacation\\" essay. I was amazed when Rako spent more time on watching her granddaughter feed birds than she did on the breakup of either of her marrriages.It's a disappointment because Rako's life seems to be a full and vivid one, but little of that wholeness and color made it onto the page. I finished knowing more about her mentor than I did about her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Elegant","review":"As I was engrossed in reading That's How the Light Gets In, I tried to think of the one world that would describe it, and I think that word is elegant.

It is a fine piece of literary work."},{"rating":"1","title":"thanks, but no thanks","review":"overall not what I expected, and not interesting to me. agree with PW in that \\"the narrative's natural flow is often stopped up with word jams, bumpy prose and sometimes grueling therapeutic jargon\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS GAME IS DEFECTIVE AND FAULTY!","review":"I assure you I am not crazy.

Single player, co-op -- which I spent the night playing with my friend, and it's amazing, -- and multi player (online), are all excellent beyond belief.

The game play, and movement are really good. All the characters are well voice acted to give them their own personality. But the ending is super weak, this is a spoiler so if you don't want to know don't read. But the end \\"boss\\" is surrounded by titanium bulletproof birds that avoid light, so they leave when he's in the bright parts. The boss himself is laugh out loud crazy hard to kill, I mean this is a shooter not a RPG so if I empty a clip into the boss's cornea he's dead period end of story. Not here he just charges in taking a face full of lead and torque bow bombs with minimal dammage. A better ending would have been to raid the train for a stronger resonator then fight deeper into the underground area to set it off and complete the maping they had started instead of this side scroller type mega boss."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST GAME EVER","review":"IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR EXCELLENT GAMEPLAY, AWESOME WAYS TO KILL ENEMIES AND MUCH MORE, BELIEVE ME, I RECOMMEND THIS GAME FOR YOU, I PLAY IT ALONE, ONLINE, I'M STILL IN LOVE WITH THIS GAME, IT'S SO AWESOME AND PERFECTLY DONE THAT IT WILL BLOW YOU'RE MIND.THANKS EIDO FOR AN AMAZING GAME"},{"rating":"2","title":"Comentario Sobre la Edicion en Dvd de Querida Enemiga","review":"Yo no vi Querida Enemiga cuando se Transmitio en Television pero Me Tento Mucho la Idea de que este Carmen Becerra y Maria Rubio, por eso Decidi Comprar el Dvd.Sinceramente no le tengo mucha Fe a Ana Layevska ya que no la conosco mucho, me resulta algo floja como Actriz pero bueno, es un Pre-concepto mio, espero que no sea asi, que no me decepcione con su Papel Protagonico, por otra parte Me Gusta Mucho Gabriel Soto y Jorge Aravena.Este Dvd Me Lo Recomendaron, espero no arrepentirme de haberlo Comprado...Carmen Becerra hizo un Exelente Papel Antagonico y se que me va a gustar mucho porque ya la he visto en otras Novelas y Me Encanta, es uns Exelente Actriz.Cuando tenga el Dvd y lo vea les cuento que tal esta el Resumen...9/8/2011: Muy Buen Resumen, Contiene lo Mas Importante, esta Muy, pero muy Completo, la verdad la recomiendo abiertamente, no se van a arrepentir..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good book","review":"I really enjoyed this book, and the author is really a master at her craft.

The handle bar bracket has a rubber insert, so once it was installed, it was secure, and never moved or rotated. The GPS bracket has locking pins so that the GPS unit cannot accidently slide out of the bracket.

It defaults to amateur settings and the results might thrill someone who's never used a scanner before, but anyone who has used one for graphics work of any kind, will find it unworthy.

And the heroine is a good match for him, too. It's a \\"road story,\\" with humor and pathos and tons of exciting passion. The tenderness between them will just melt your heart. Bravo, Ms. Putney!

The only thing I had trouble finding online was a moves list (I have since found one), so I bought this book.I usually allow for mistakes in books like these, but there are far too many. No index, poorly designed - hard to flip thru the book to find what you want. Secret codes listed in this book are wrong, or require you to press more keys than needed. It is nice to see all the moves - but they are not detailed (which is a float strike?). Also, the moves lists does not differentiate from \\"press\\" and \\"press and hold\\".I do refer to the book on occasion, but I refer to FAQs I have found online more often."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too technical, outdated, unsophisicated","review":"80% of the information is way too technical for beginners.

I recommend you do the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little reference","review":"Given that the Nikon D300 instruction manual that comes with the camera is almost an inch thick, this little laminated reference is invaluable for travel. Unless you have a \\"photographic\\" memory, it's impossible to remember the hundreds of options and various settings for the D300. It is advisable to read the Nikon manual first, then the CheatSheet is even quicker to use and will jog your memory when you're out with your camera. This is not a substitute for being familiar with the camera, but can avoid a lot of frustration trying to find one particular setting. Really nothing to lose by adding this to your camera bag. Note that this CheatSheet is for the D300, not the D200 as the product description indicated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice for the price","review":"though i didn't buy these through amazon.com, i bought these headphones online....u get your money's worth. a little bulky, the earphones are comfortable and some sound is lost...i find that my sony foldable headphones deliver a closer sound. but, these 'phones deliver great bass and very clear music. i recommend these for portable audio and home computer use. as i've said, exellent headphones for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a way to die!","review":"This book is dreadful. I bought it because I'm a fan of detectives from around the world. But Garcia-Roza switches from third-person, to first person, and back again. Why does he do it? Because he couldn't figure out how to plot the book around Inspector Espinoza's own discoveries. That's because during the entire book, the detective doesn't really find anything out at all. It all gets wrapped up through no fault of his own... The worse part, however, is the scene where a beautiful young woman finds herself handcuffed to a bed with a bad guy and decides that the only way to get out of her tricky situation is to have sex with the villain until the excitement kills him. Which it does. But not until the beautiful girl has really enjoyed the sex, though she hates herself for it. Maybe that could happen in Rio, after all it's the land of the string bikini, but I doubt it very much. Absolute nonsense."},{"rating":"2","title":"Silence of the Rain","review":"I found the book quite entertaining. Unfamiliar as I was with the locale the author succeded in establishing for us a genuine a sense of place.Those familiar with the use of up-to-date criminalistics in their police procedurals won't find them here. Against endemic corruption and third world methods the author offers us a detective who is at once humane, uncorruptible and and even noble. The novel moved along rapidly and the plot resolved itself logically.Those looking for a polite mystery may find this book gratuitously sensual and violent.I found the primitivity added authenticity. My one reservation was that I did not find the last scene credible. Those who watch the show 1000 Ways to Die might might find it entertaining. I found it simply bizarre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Look out!","review":"Do not purchase this item! Even though it clearly states guest book and pen set... they only send the guest book!

However, because the heel is aligned behind the foot rather than under the heel of the foot, the heel of the shoe splayed after only a couple of months of wear. I had to throw them away. It broke my heart for such an expensive item from a reputable company. They were broken and unfixable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheaply made","review":"I was really surprised on the how badly the boots were made. First just with the Clark name reputation I had assumed the boots were at least going to be comfortable. No cushioning that I could feel that could hardly last an entire work day. The heel felt like it could easily be pulled from the bottom. And last but most importantly, the look of the boot just looked cheap and I wore my pair twice, then instead of going through the hassle of shipping back and getting my money, I unfortunately gave them to the goodwill and some poor soul who has hardly any money may end up wasting their money on these awful boots. But I still like \\"clark\\" made shoes but I will be careful in what I order from their name brand from now on."},{"rating":"2","title":"It Left Me Speechless","review":"This book has it all, cut throat action, on the edge of your seat suspence, everything. Okay everything takes place at this haunted resteraunt called The Pub. All the people that work there have different powers but they share a secret that leads back years before they were born. It's up to them to help the spirits that are mostly vengeful to pass on to their destiany. You must get this book if your a Stephen King or Dean Koontz fan!

Very comfortable chair,felt solid. After two days I started to rise from the chair,placing my hands on the armrest,the left side collasped,breaking the left rocker and front stretchers (top & bottom) and the seat cushion came loose. I am not going to return it,but I am goinig to put it back together with braces because I LIKE it.But I will not order from the Coaster Co. again(amazon LLC.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointed","review":"The back of the rocker is constructed of cardboard and staples....it is falling apart from just sitting in it.

Have to keep tapping it back into place."},{"rating":"1","title":"unhappy","review":"I couldn't wait to get this good looking rocker, it looked very sturdy and strong but looks are deciving.The chair is falling apart and has to be fixed every week. The problem seems to be with the parts put together by the company. The thin wood braces in the seat snapped, the screws keep falling out of the chair no matter how tight they are put in, the squeeking noise it makes every time it is used is very annoying and when the company put in the nuts they split the wood and repaired it with wood glue and still mailed the part with the chair to use, what kind of workmanship is this? I purchased the chair in October 2011 and it wasn't put together until the 1st week of December 2011 since it was a christmas gift and we have had all this trouble since then. Right now it is in our basement being taken apart piece by so it can be put back together with thicker wood and glued back together. My husband wants to box it all up and send it back, said it isn't worth the money we paid for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money!","review":"Although I did not buy this chair from Amazon, I wanted to leave my 2 cents.At first, I was very pleased with the chair. I bought it to use in my son's nursery to avoid having to walk him to sleep. It worked for about a week, no exaggeration. The bolts continue to fall out of the various holes (holding the arms, back and legs together); I had to add L-bracets at nearly every joint to avoid the pieces from popping out of each other. Worse than that, yes WORSE, it is so very noisy! Every time I sit, rock or try to move/get up it makes so much noise that my son instantly wakes up! I highly recommend that you invest a little more money in a good chair."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor design, engineering, quality...","review":"I spent an hour putting this chair together and my husband was able to sit in it for 5 minutes before the bottom rocker split in half where they jointed it together. Why would they joint the wood in the most pressure sensitive area of the chair??? I will also add that my husband is 5'9\\" and weighs 165 lbs. so it was not an overweight issue that caused the chair to break. When I sat in it at my 5'4\\" height I had to arch my back and sit toward the front of it to even get it to rock. The center of gravity is off with this rocker so if you are my height and purchase this chair you will find yourself sitting on the edge of the seat the whole time. This was given to me as a gift, therefore I didn't have any say as to whether I wanted it or not. Take the advice from the reviews, save your money, and spend it on a chair that is worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Changed my mind...","review":"I have been looking a long time to replace a chair that I owned years ago that belonged to my great Uncle.

In less than 1 week, the factory constucted parts came apart, bolts did not fit from the beginning and I soon got a call from the distributers. I offered to give back the chair if they gave me an all factory constructed chair or my money back. They said they had to talk to the manufacturers. They also said they have sold hundreds of these chairs and had no bad reviews. LIARS! This is a bad product put together with a wish. Save your money. I also never heard from the company again. It would make good firewood.

I just want to make a few comments about this product. I would definitly agree with many of the other reviewers about how it is a FUN toy, not something to really train off of. But I disagree how they mention that it will get the child up and moving, because without proper guidance or instruction, the child will not understand how to move and exercise properly. If you are planning on purchasing this toy, I would just like to remind you that it WILL NOT protect your child if he is to be attacked by a bully in school, nor will it make him more active. It will, however, give him a good time trying to imitate the moves shown on the DVD.If you are only planning for this product to be a toy, i would recommend it, otherwise, please do not purchas it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This toy sucks.","review":"People, this toy is crap. It is the thing thats going to get your kids butts kicked so hard they wont be able to sit down for a month and then some.

The only good thing about this toy is that it MIGHT give your kid something to do, even if its a waste of time and money.

That's the real way to become a master."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for anyone wanting real training","review":"I bought this set for my son's sixth birthday. He and my ten year old had seen it advertised, and wanted one. They have both had a small amount of training in karate, so I thought it would be fun. We were completely disappointed when we played the dvd. It is geared towards very young children, with tacky cartoon characters. The kick bag is very flimsy, and is not appropriate for any real training. The entire set quickly ended up in the back of the closet, not being used. I did some searching, and found a karate dvd for children, for a lower price, that is much higher quality.Do not waste your money on this kit. I would not recommend it for anyone over three years old."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Customer Service","review":"I did not receive my complete order. I only received the DVD and not the Punch Bag.

Even so, could not stop listening to this classic collection. \\"Pennies From Heaven\\" deserves particular comment. It begins with a far out lead as Dave attempts to pump up the group. Morello (on drums) is the first to grab the tune and Eugene Wright (on base) quickly follows. Morrello's drumming on this song is perhaps the best you'll ever hear.

What a director - from \\"The Innocents\\" through \\"Room at the Top\\" to \\"Something Wicked Comes this Way\\" this man is genius.In this slice of life scripted by harold Pinter [brilliant] based on the novel by Penope Mortimer, we experience a woman very much on the edge, but coping bravely and very elegantly with her philandering spouse. Anne Bankcroft [very much missed today] defines this lady dealing with a major domestic breakdown, we are guided through this in detail. Peter Finch is the careless husband, but it's the close-ups of James Mason [perfect camera work, black and white naturally]that remain vivid - that confrontation with Bancroft!Also noteworthy is \\"fragrant\\" Maggie Smith as the au-pair....... and that odd episode with unforgettable faced Yootha Joyce [under the drier].Could be viewed with by cynical eyes as a comedy of sorts today, but still frank and fresh!There should be a future DVD boxed set of Mr. Clayton's works - he cannot go unnoticed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Bancroft's Best Performances","review":"Two years after her Oscar-winning performance in The Miracle Worker Anne Bancroft selected this Harold Pinter script from a Penelope Mortimer novel, directed by Jack Clayton (also a very talented cinematographer). Bancroft plays a much married woman with eight children who takes a chance on Peter Finch. When he starts philandering she begins a nervous breakdown. It's not fun or uplifting but in the hands of these artists it is compelling and the acting is superb. The film also stars James Mason, the fabulous Maggie Smith (in two scenes, curiously unbilled), Cedric Hardwicke, Richard Johnson, Eric Porter and the inimitable Yootha Joyce (check out her scene in a beauty salon). Superior adult fare.Bancroft was nominated for her second Oscar but lost to Julie Andrews as Mary Poppins! Two more different performances cannot be imagined."},{"rating":"2","title":"A strangely fascinating film","review":"Anne Bancroft was outstanding in this strangely fascinating film. Viewed from 2012, this film was very \\"sixties\\" and very \\"British\\" but the performances by all involved were quite good, and including some pretty harrowing scenes. Others have summarized the plot, so I won't do that again, I'll just say that I'm wondering if they always write in a fight scene just for Ms. Bancroft.

And, don't count on getting out the last drop of gas without removing the cap and using a long transmission funnel. They've been doing that for a few years in Califotnia, already.The only viable alternative is the No-Spill brand with the push button, but those cost twice as much.If you have an older gas can that still works, keep it. If you can find one of the rarer and harder to find old spouts at a local hardware store, buy ALL of them. I've visited 10 stores and discovered that they are all gone, and there will be no more of the old ones.

A replacement spout, at Tru-Value Hardware, costs over $5.Recently, the Scepter company agreed to send me a new spout at no charge.29 Sep 12That spout did not work for very long either.I bought another container with this mechanism in 2011 or 2012 and I couldn't get it to work after the first few times I used it.

Listening to my pipe organ CDs, you'd swear you're sitting right in front of the pipes --- unbelievable clarity.The amp has no trouble driving Bose 301 8 ohm 75watt speakers, easily filling a large room with beautiful sound.

It's a good buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great performance at a reasonable price","review":"Just bought a second 4775 to replace one that was failing to hold a battery charge after several years of use. The new shaver performs so well (easy, smooth shave), it makes me think I should have replaced the cutters on the old shaver at least once. (In other words, it might be worth paying Braun's outrageous price to replace the cutters every two or three years.) Before buying my first 4775, I owned a couple of Braun models that had the swiveling-head feature. The 4775 works just as well and costs less. My only complaint about the 4775 is that it has a needlessly sharp ridge on the part that slides up the sideburn trimmer. This ridge was uncomfortable under my thumb, but a couple of minutes work with a moto tool ground the problem away. Now the shaver is just about perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"It works","review":"A no frills shaver.You will not get a super close shave, but close enough for me.I had the same shaver previously and it lasted for about 6 years.

I've had it for over two years and it's never given me that great of a shave. It's even worse now that the battery is prematurely dying and the blade is getting dull.

Unfortunately, the text often adds little, if any, relevant commentary on the picture at hand. It is interesting though to see the domestic surroundings of so many famous people and I suppose that the voyeur in us receives some satisfaction. The photography itself is well done and captures the look of the writers as we've come to know them through other photos. Since there are only 58 subjects out of a possible 1500 that the author has taken, I was able to read the whole book and look at the photos in sixteen minutes. Before you buy, check it out in a library first to make sure you want to spend you hard earned money on such a minuscule offering."},{"rating":"2","title":"A glimpse into the world of writers.","review":"A mesmerizing book that provides a glimpse into the creative world of writers. I return to look at the book often hoping to gain some insight into and about writer's and their art. The book succeeds in wetting the apetite and creates even more mystery. Surely, there must be some common thread amongst writer's and surely that thread must be visible in the photographs in the book if only we look hard enough.

I've done this routine for about 3 1/2 weeks now and I've lost an inch in my waist. Both workouts make me sweat. There are a couple of moves that I can't do because of a bad knee and a couple of moves that would bounce the living room too much, but I've modified the moves to something my knee and living room can handle.

One of the women's accent is very thick and it is difficult to follow her instructions. I have had some dance training before so I thought I could manage but her directions were unclear and she had the dance moves that are very fast paced so that was difficult in and of itself.

I put it in my bathroom next to the toilet and read sometimes one page, sometimes two, and sometimes just a paragraph at a time. Many passages got a second or third reading before I moved on. Much of the cosmology parallel's that of the Bible. Moral lessons are the same, except for the references to reincarnation. Winding through life again and again until one is ready for the Eternal, however, is more palatable to me than living here just once and then descending to Hell or going to that murky place called Purgatory and finally on to Heaven. The translation is poetic and full of stark and amazing images."},{"rating":"1","title":"negative!!!!!","review":"Who ever gave this 5 stars must not have read other versions of the vita this version sucked..they cut out parts in it and the way it is written..eh wish I didn't get it"},{"rating":"2","title":"More of the ...more of the same","review":"I f you have read my reviews of the first two and the final book I really need say any more.It is a fine series by an eclectic author (much n the mold of Robert Heinlein and Harlan Ellison of you can imagine them co-authoring something together,)Read the other two reviews fir a more concise opinion ,,, as that all a review really is, you know."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite of the Riverworld sequals","review":"This is the best of the 4 \\"To Your Scattered Bodies Go\\" sequels purely because of the paddle wheel boat battle.

PJF again makes a mockery of the characters which were established earlier, having them engage in completely non-sensical behavior given who they are and what they are doing. He kills off a bunch of characters to establish \\"suspense\\", introduce a bunch of new characters you couldn't care less about, and then has to make up a last-ditch obstacle to extract any action for a climax - which might have worked but for the fact he has to waste pages and pages extemporizing about the background which he apparently couldn't figure out who to reveal in any other way. PJF tries to set up a cliff-hanger ending, but I, t least, was so uninterested the characters, I really didn't care what happened to them. The first book in this series was wonderful, but the ending is almost insultingly bad..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad - not good.","review":"The first two books were decent (the first one was incredible).

Mine keeps switching inputs for no apparent reason and going blank. Also the sound does not work with the HDMI input. Westinghouse service admits these are problems when I call but the only solution is to ship them the TV in California because they have no parts for it already. Neither do they have any local service center where it could be returned. The freight to ship it to California is $245.00. Great warranty, isn't it?

So I have a lot to compare Open Season to in regard to the 3D aspect of the Bluray.With great confidence I can say that Open Season is hands down at this time the best showcase of 3D Bluray. The transfer is just pristine and pops with color, sharpness and depth. The 3D does not come across as gimmicky but truly is done so well that you feel like you could reach out and grab the characters on screen. Sony should be comended for doing such a fantastic job with this transfer and this should be the standard bearer going forward when referencing 3D Bluray and what it brings to the table for future home entertainment.This is a must buy for any 3D HDTV owner."},{"rating":"2","title":"GOOD Movie, EXCELLENT Picture!!!!","review":"I was not sure what to expect from this movie, as we never had seen it before.

It's like... it should be transparent... just a general sense of good movement / storytelling.To me - it is a bad movie if I would rather be being bored than watching the movie... I got about 30 minutes in and then sort of skipped through the rest to see if it remarkably improved... which it didn't ... at all. If you're getting something for your kids; I will not get this - because it will make them stupider by watching it.

There are essays on how people dressed, how servants were treated, how Christie treated lower-class characters in her books. There are essays delving into the psychology of our favorite detectives.It's meant to be picked up and read in short bursts. It provides a lot of information in quick bits.It's by no mean a comprehensive biography of Christie. Several essays are much better than others. But it's a nice little companion for Christie fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent Companion!","review":"A must for any Christie fan, as it helps you sort out the often confusing array of books by summarizing each of them without giving the endings away, and includes all the title variations that can trip die hard fans up as they accidentally read or purchase the same book twice or more!This book doesn't hold anything back either! For one thing, it reveals that the original title of \\"And Then There Were None\\" (which can also be found as \\"Ten Little Indians\\") was actually \\"Ten Little NIGGERS\\"! The poem in the book was the same thing, and there's actually cover art included.

The drawback is that it's heavy when it's wet. Your shirt definitely gets wet too. When it loses it's evaporative ability after a couple of hours, it is still heavy and because it doesn't breath, you start to overheat. If you can keep it wet, then you're good, but if you don't have access to a ready water supply, you're out of luck.

I have been teaching Martial Arts since 1992 and although I understand the karate school people's point of view, I realize this is just a toy. My 5 year old daughter loves this item, but she does love classes more often. The only real problem I see with this is that it will become another thing you garage sale when the child gets bored with it. There are many \\"open minded\\" schools out in the USA and I suggest you talk with all the instructors if you are interested in enrolling your child. If they bash anything, then they are going against the true code of the arts which instills humility, compassion and integrity. I am not threatened by this \\"toy\\" and I purchased one for fun.

Clegg covers both the concept of infinity and its companion, the concept of infinitesimal, from Greek days to the present, in a way I found very readable. I have very little to complain about except that I found it sometimes frustrating that his treatment oversimplified and didn't give enough details.(For example, he has a chapter on Abraham Robinson's nonstandard analysis. I think that, next to Cantor, Robinson's ideas are probably the most important on the subject of anyone who has worked in it, yet I felt I did not get an adequate picture of Robinson's ideas of infinity and infinitesimals from the chapter.)Still, it is the best book on the subject at a \\"popular\\" level I have seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eurocentric","review":"Unfortunately this book ignores the contributions of the ancient Indians. Infinity did not start with the Greeks. In fact, the Greeks had big troubles with infinity.

Though it may be fustrating more then half the times you have to see it throught. Dont run away, face it! If you read this book you will see that there are many fights fought by us everyday. Its up to us to make tommorow better then yesterday and today. Read it and you'll see that patience is a virtue that everyone dosent want but in the end you'll see that you have gone far.

The writing is bad, the characters are thinly drawn, and the story is just a bastardized version of the real Andrews' novels. I thought the market for the \\"girl who is partially orphaned, then betrayed by adoptive parents, then falls in forbidden incestuous love with some relative, and then is raped by some other relative\\"-story was called the porn industry. I can't believe this is actually becoming like a genre unto itself. How totally shady!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Trouble at School","review":"I could relate to what Ruby went through while she was at boarding school. During my last year in college I had problems with my peers. Without taking my side of the story into consideration, the dean of students booted me out of the residence halls. He said I should just \\"bag it\\" if I was upset with anybody at all. He even said that nobody would want to be friends with me if I couldn't control my emotions. It's hard for anybody to control how he or she feels if he or she is being disliked without a just cause. I didn't deserve to be snubbed at all. This novel was the very first VC Andrews book I read. Ever since I could relate to the feeling of Ruby and the main characters of the novels I have been attached to the VC novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Question in the mist...or is it the fog?","review":"Do they honestly expect us to believe that Gisselle would just magically overcome her paralysis?

Both had the most painful lives, second of course to Ruby, and truly I fell in love with them. The whole atmosphere at Greenwood made me feel like I was there. Although I do not dislike Ruby I do however think that she was way too weak in comparison to the other heroines, I mean who would put up with all the things Giselle did? I also did not really like Beau, since he was a one dimensional arrogant sap. This is still a great read, that really pulled me in. Read it for the plot and secondary character depth."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was good, but the weakest of this series","review":"Pearl in the Mist was a pretty good book, but I think it was meant for a brief rest for what was to come in the upcoming All That Glitters, which I think was the most explosive book in this series. In Pearl in the Mist, I think this is the most that Ruby's heart has ever been broken, by the death of her father, the way Miss Stevens was sent away, how she had to deal with Gisselle, also the bitchy, conspiring Mrs. Ironwood and Daphne. What broke my heart the most was the way that Beau left Ruby after he had gotten her pregnant, leaving her alone in a world that doesn't seem to give a care about her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tender and uplifting, but aimed at much younger children","review":"This little book is short and simple. The main problem is that it is clearly aimed at children who may not even be old enough to read it for themselves. Not that there's anything wrong with a grown-up reading to them, but encopresis affects many children that are over the first-grade reading level. (The little boy in the book appears to be approximately first or second grade.)Unfortunately, there is very little out there in the way of useful, informative literature that addresses the medical and psychological aspects of these problems. Dr. Galvin is to be commended and congratulated for his efforts and insights on how to comfort, encourage, and challenge children (and parents) who deal with encopresis. Believe it or not, with patience and perseverance, this problem does end, and there is life after it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A story for kids who soil","review":"I purchased this book for my six year old son who for the past few years has had serious stomach problems. After his doctor constantly reassured me that he was \\"perfectly\\" healthy I decided to get another doctor.

Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting and entertaining","review":"This book presents a few tidbits about the X chromosomes and the genes resident on it and how they affect our lives. Topics discussed include autoimmune diseases, color blindness, disease transmission vectors (due to mutated genes), X chromosome inactivation in anyone possessing multiple X chromosomes...etcOverall, this is a good, entertaining layman read. It is not an overview on the biology of the X chromosome. Rather,a good afternoon read for one's infotainment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy read if you like non-fiction","review":"I read this book in about 5 or 6 hours. It was fairly interesting and easy to read. I have no background in biology, but I love reading non-fiction. None of the science went over my head and I look forward to acting like I know something the next time someone mentions X chromosomes. Eh, that'll never happen, but I had fun reading it.

In the years after Paddy wrote this song, Bruce wrote Streets Of Philadelphia, The Ballad Of Tom Joad, My Hometown and many other meaningful songs while Paddy was writing drivel like \\"The Wedding March\\". I do think Paddy has written some decent tunes,such as \\"We Let The Stars Go Out\\" and \\"Appetite\\". I just don't see the need for tearing down another musician--especially one with Bruce's talent and integrity.

The language of this book isn't very engaging and due to it's redundancy I found myself loosing interest very quickly. There are many chapters with many key points that are supposed to help you with sales but I find this to be too much information to be effective. For example there's a section entitled 35 tactics, another with the 20 greatest closes, and multiple sections with 5-10 tricks of the trade. You won't be able to memorize all of this information and some of it is just anecdotal and not very useful. One of his 35 tactics is no one is poor; he goes on to say that you should always treat your customer as if he has money. Although I agree with that principle it's really not a tactic. If this book was half as long and written better I would rate it much higher."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Art of Manipulation","review":"This book is a cleverly repackaged version of \\"The Closers\\" written many years ago by Ben Gay III.

The purpose of Jane's Addiction is more than just to provide the listener with entertainment. Though there is never a shortage of that. When I listen to Jane's Addiction I am taken back to that period of teenager-dom immediately before adolescance. Those days when I realized mom and dad were not infallible.

In the war section of the book (unlike Shaara's The Killer Angels, generals are absent and the battle scenes are written primarilly from the enlisted man's point of view.

The humidity gauge is very difficult to calibrate and I'm not sure it's even possible to do so, since I just gave up on it. Appearance-wise, the set is okay. But if you're looking for something which actually works well, look at something else. I used the barometer and humidity gauges in another set, discarded the board and temperature gauge.

The humidity and temperature reading matches with our other electronic weather gauge, and I've found that the barometric reading consistently matches the \\"Weather Channel\\". My one complaint/ suggestion is there are no feet on the backside of this item to keep it slightly away from the wall, so as to allow for better air circulation.

The CD does have a horn section, which was really a temporary period for the band. The production is excellent.

The acoustic quality is generally good (although the bass and guitar work is sometimes less than clear), and the horn section adds a little extra appeal to some of the songs.

If the RP-HT21 has more bass, my impression is that they simply attenuated the high frequencies (making the bass more predominant), as the maximum overall volume from the RP-HT21 is not as high as with my old headset.

The only con for me is that the sounds from the headphones leak out into the air, meaning these will probably be good in busy settings, but not so good in a library or office setting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great headphones for the price, while they last...","review":"I bought my first set of these in June, 2010 for $4.27. Great price for the sound quality. Ten months later, for no discernible reason, the left earpiece went out.OK, I figured, they were only $4.27 - besides, perhaps I did something to cause it (unlikely, because I'm gentle with my electronics).So, I bought another pair in April of 2011 for $4.80 (tax this time, doncha know). This pair lasted six months before it became necessary to wiggle the plug to get the left headphone to work.If you don't mind replacing these every 6-10 months (that's my experience, anyway), these are a great budget pair of headphones: they sound good, and are comfortable. I'd prefer to pay double, or even triple, the price and have a set that would last for at least a couple of years.Why must so many products be designed this way?! It's bad for the environment, and it's inconvenient for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inexpensive Headphones","review":"I recently bought these for a vacation I was going on.

Well, I used them myself for the first time this afternoon to listen to some Youtube links and WOW! I was VERY impressed at the high quality sound coming out of such a tiny and (yeah, I'll say it) cheap pair of headphones!With some name brands you can always expect quality and Panasonic is no exception to the rule. The most shocking thing about these great little lightweight headphones is their pricetag!If you're reading this review, don't hesitate and miss out before they wise up and triple the price - grab them NOW! In fact, order 2 so you'll have an extra set around the house.

That and at only $5.00, they seemed like a bargain. (Make sure you combine them with an order over $25.00 to get the free shipping. Otherwise with shipping included, they are not worth it). The headphones seem very well made and comfortable. They also seem to have a very clear sound with good stereo separation. My only negative with them is their volume level is quite a bit lower than the output of your source. That is, I had to turn the volume up considerably to hear the headphones at medium volume. When I unplugged the phones, the speakers came on and were extremely loud. Other than the somewhat wimpy volume of them, they seem a worthwhile investment...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best headphone ever had in this price","review":"You won't find any better headphone in this price with clarity and bass!

I can't recommend these highly enough, especially for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lasted 1 year","review":"These headphones lasted me one year of heavy use. Like most listening devices a wire connecting to the headphone finally gave out. I like them because they don't cup over my ears. I'm sure the cup over the ear types are better for sound but I need to be able to slip one ear off and listen to house sounds as well as computer/music/tv. I don't think I miss out on anything sound wise. I wear these in the night and fall asleep with them on, thats how solid they are."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great headphones","review":"These are amazing headphones for the price! They work on my ipad, ipod, Nintendo DS and computer. Ear buds are SO uncomfortable to me, I finally looked for an alternative.

On the whole, I'm fairly pleased with them.Pros:-Inexpensive-Comfortable fit-Cord is good length-A couple of weeks have passed, and the headphones have not been affected by sweat-Construction is not particularly cheap feeling-They stay in place while jogging and lying on bench. They do sometimes feel like they're going to slip, but so far, they haven't.Cons:-Volume isn't as loud as I'd like. Even on max, the headphones have a hard time competing with the music played over the loudspeakers at the gym.-The ear pieces are angled with respect to the headband, which means that they don't grip my ears as much as parallel ear pieces do. The sound would be louder if the earpieces were tighter against my ears."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good if ALL you want to hear is bass","review":"Based on reviews of the great sound quality, I foolishly ordered two pair. Such a low price, why not? THIS is why not -- if all you want to hear is bass, these might be ok. But they have very little range. The sound was tinny and I regret the purchase. Unfortunately shipping to return them will cost almost as much as the items, so in the junk drawer they go in case all my other headphones should break. Lesson learned once again -- you really do get what you pay for!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Headphones for an MP3 player","review":"I have an old pair of XBS headphones that came w/ a portable CD player. I've always liked their full sound, so when I changed over to an mp3 player, it was no surprise that I found them to sound the best for that format too. I am one of those people that can't keep earbuds in my ears, they always fall out and/or don't sit right in my ear and sound \\"tinny\\". Anyway, as the old ones are beginning to wear out I found these new ones and decided to purchase. They have the same full, rich sound as my old ones and at a price that makes them disposable anymore. My one complaint is they are using thinner foam that decreases their comfort level somewhat. Overall I highly recommend them."},{"rating":"2","title":"light-weight, great price.","review":"this light-weight headphone is a great value- portable, and ideal for the gym or outside walks."},{"rating":"2","title":"good for the price","review":"The sound is very good for the price.

When I placed the order, I had over 2 weeks before we left, so I used the Free Shipping option. Three days before we were to leave, Amazon had not even shipped the headphones even though they were in stock, and refused to cancel the order, with some lame excuse about their shipping methods.The headphones were delivered when we were halfway through vacation.I know this is a shakedown from Amazon to induce me to switch to their \\"Prime\\" membership which I will never do on principle. Since then, I have not bought a single item that is sold by Amazon, using their marketplace instead, and have had no shipping issues.The headphones work well enough for what they are worth, but if you want them delivered on time, do not buy them from Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of junk","review":"The plug doesn't stay in.

I could not hear diddly squat. Headset didn't fit well at all. (Too big and faced outwards slightly instead of in towards the ears, cupping the ears. I ordered two thinking it would be a great deal for that cost. From what I have read, the restocking fee is too high plus the reship fee. I ate the cost of them instead of returning. Do not order them for your computer. Dealer does not explain what types of systems you can use them on. Apparently, computers are NOT a good fit. Or maybe it is just my particular computer. Fortunately it was a very cheap mistake. Pffft! Next time I will go to Best Buy and ask there before making any orders. I may try the headsets on some other system.

This was one week of \\"old guy sitting very, very still in a chair listening to music.\\" And still...PSHHT!!! The darn thing crapped out on me.For the price, there's no point in trying for a return...nor much hope that I can make a repair. So even though they didn't cost much, it hurts to be adding them to the landfill. Other reviews indicate that this has been an ongoing problem with these headphones. I'm really disappointed that Panasonic couldn't add another fraction of a penny's worth of rubber to reinforce the cord and protect the wiring."},{"rating":"2","title":"I think they are great!","review":"I bought three of these in case of breakage. So far I'm still on the first set after about five months. In my opinion they work very well and so for the money I would say they can't be beat. I had a hard time finding the length of cord in the specs so I will state here that the cord length is about 4 1/2 feet from plug to ear pieces making for comfortable sitting approximately 3 1/2 feet from the source. If you need more length then buy an extension. The plug itself is a small standard one prong stereo plug, that fits in my Sylvania TV for example. So for the price, these headphones are unbeatable. What a feat Panasonic, thanks."},{"rating":"1","title":"You Must Be Kidding Me...","review":"I bought these headphones for use with my iPod. While I do spend up to 20x the price of these for home usage, I don't like spending too much on phones for my iPod as they get beat up easily. I figured five bucks, good reviews, worth a shot.These headphones sound bad. I do know these are quite cheap, but I've still heard better even for this price. The problem is the sound is plain tinny. Even with some equalization in the mix, I couldn't get \\"good bass\\" or a full sound out of these. Also the midranges, specifically the upper mids are screechy and overproduced. Another issue is the volume. I have to crank up about 70% of my recievers volume for moderate volume, and the iPod is even worse. Yes, they are cheap and comfy, but they sound as good as they cost. I've found that both the Sony Walkman headphones (MDRA110) and the Coby CVH42 for the same price sound better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad connectors","review":"I read all the reviews before purchasing two sets of these headphones to use with my brand new iPod Touch. The comfort and sound quality is good, if you can manipulate the mini-connector into just the right position. Otherwise one hears either the left channel, the right channel, or white noise. If you are lucky enough to find the sweet spot and both channels are operating, do not move the iPod or the cord or you will immediately loose the sound. Both headphone sets have the same flaw. I borrowed other ear buds and headphones and tried them with my iPod and I did not encounter this problem, so it is unique to these particular headphones. I know that they are really inexpensive, but Panasonic should be ashamed of itself for putting out a product with this kind of mechanical flaw. It is too expensive to send them back, so I will trash them and look for something that actually works.

If any of you are planning to use this for you computer, don't waste even one dollar on this because it just does not work. You have to keep fiddling with the cord to get the crackling sound to stop.

These are superior to the low end $5 Sony models, much better sound and more comfortable.

He uses his alot and they are MUCH more comfortable, but more money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Headphones","review":"Bought these based on the 4.5 rating here on amazon. Well, the bass is great like everyone says. And they are very comfortable on the head. But what sucks about this product is the the loudness of the mid-frequency range. It's pathetic. The bass and treble are overbearing compared to the mids. It's too bad. I would recommend my previous set of headphones, the Sennhieser 202. I hate when products don't live up to their hype. But what did I expect for $5 headphones?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Comfortable","review":"The entire reason that I purchased these headphones was to find some comfort when I listen to music at work. These are not comfortable as they push on my ears because of how they are angled. While they are pretty lightweight, there is still some heaviness/pressure that makes them uncomfortable for long periods of wear. At least they were cheap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent headphones, well worth it for low price and free shipping","review":"Good headphones for the price, good sound for casual music listening and work decently for video conversations. They're not the most durable things in the world, or the most comfortable after five or six hours of continuous use, but they're cheap and work. If you move them around all the time (like when using a laptop), they will start to wear the cord down. But, in my experience that happens with all headphones if you're using them often, so best bet is to get something cheap like this and replace it as needed."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!!!","review":"These headphones are better than alot of headphones I have had.

They feel cheap and flimsy. The ear pads are thin and very small. I've owned better headphones from the dollar store. Please do not waste your money on these things. Panasonic needs to be slapped for selling this garbage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works OK, good sound","review":"I was a little dubious after reading several negative reviews about the plug in to an iPhone or iPod. The first time I plugged it in to my iPhone the sound started strong then slowly faded. I discovered that the plug was not making a good connection to the phone. After fiddling with it for a few minutes, I got it to consistently work adequately. I was impressed by the fullness of the sound and the bass response. I also like the over the head model of earphones as they don't fall off like the in ear styles do. For the price, even if they only last a couple months I feel I've gotten my money's worth. I'd reccomend them for someone who isn't an \\"audiophile\\" and just needs a basic set of over the head earphones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst purchase ever","review":"These were broken when I received them.

I have a couple of these and then bought some for my mother who asked me to buy another one. It seems like some stores just do not carry many OR any of these type of headphones and push the ear bud type of headphones. I don't like the ear buds as they seem to hurt my ears and are always falling out.These are the better working ones in this price range ($4.50-$10) and free shipping.The sound is decent and I don't need state of the art headphones just to listen to some music. These headphones provide that with minimal cost. Of course you are NOT going to get excellent high quality sounding headphones when you pay $4.56 and try finding these type of headphones.

My wife uses them while working on and listening to music on her iPhone 3GS. I keep them at work, in the car for skiing or walks in the park, at home for working in the yard or riding a bike. I also have a one for the computer and listening to youtube of live concerts in HD. Durable design that I have been using for over a year. It is nice to have good quality sound that allows you to hear what is going on around you, or turn them up to hear crisp bass and clear highs. Having a convenient pair of headphones where you need them is better than than having a more expensive headphone worrying about them being stolen or broken during transport/storage.I may not have needed to buy so many, all are still working well with good sound quality and cords and ear foam that is still comfortable to wear."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard to Beat!","review":"You just can't beat the price for throw-away headphones.

I have a couple of MP3 players I use at work daily and with them I wear my headphones constantly. I either lose or wear them out whether they are more expensive or cheaper. I was absolutely startled at the bass that came our of these phones. It is deep, rich and accurate. Overall sound is better than a pair I once had that cost me about 10 times as much. Knowing that I would either wear them out or lose them I bought 4 pairs this time. I will definitely buy more when the need arises. An excellent deal, I highly recommend these phones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best possible value","review":"You don't get a better headphone for five bucks!

My last pair was breaking down and I knew I needed a new one, but I didn't have that much money. So, I was browsing around Amazon and found this.Absolutely FANTASTIC. I was skeptic at first, being only 4 dollars and with free shipping. I was flat out wrong on that assumption; the sound quality is great, with especially good bass. The cord length was a tad shorter than I would have liked, but it got the job done. I haven't had a chance to test durability, but it seems to hold okay. Wouldn't stake my life on it though.They're very modest in design; not too flashy, yet they don't look tacky either. They were surprisingly comfortable, especially because I have sensitive ears. They were also very easy to use and completely operational from time of purchase.All in all, a 4/5, and a steal at the price. Spring on it while you can people!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Value for money - but increased bass ?","review":"These function fairly well. I use it to listen to mp3's when I am at work, but I'm surprised at the description and some of the reviews which say this has enhanced bass response. In fact, I found the treble response to be good, and not the bass. I normally have the EQ settings for typical classic rock - a distended V, which should enhance the bass, but I didnt see the enhanced bass.The other shortcoming was the length of the cord. I had to buy an extender so I could comfortably move around on my chair in my cube at work, when connected to the PC.Anyway, I am happy with it, but the cost was doubled when I bought the extender."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheap & Work Great","review":"I wanted inexpensive headphones and these are perfect.

Sound Quality is FANTASTIC. I've spent over 50$ on headphones before, worst decision ever. I could buy a few of these, and it would last me forever.Seriously, stop looking for headphones, just buy these. you will not regret it whatsoever.Final Note: If you listen to dubstep, techno, etc, the bass isnt the heaviest, so some songs you won't feel the bass as heavy cause you need some subwoofers.

They are also comfortable and I have worn them for over two hours at a time.Did I mention that they are cheap.

Danny, of course, gets into trouble as he uncovers family secrets and business deals.This is a terrific cast but the pacing is very slow and the mystery is only mildly interesting.

And even now, years later, when I picked some of my old books up for a fun, quick re-read, I noticed that each book addresses complex issues that I hadn't even noticed as a kid, but which still managed to shape how I look at real-life wars and diplomacy.To sum up: this is some deep stuff.

My youngest says her favorite parts are the UFOs, aliens, and adventure. Although I haven't personally read it, they both love the book and find it hard to put down. My younger child is a more reluctant reader than the older one, so it's especially rewarding to see a good book stimulate her interest in reading (instead of video games and other modern distractions). I do plan to read it myself after they are finished with it. However, from the feedback of my children, it is definitely an entertaining read.

I'm 44 years old, and I grew up listening to a lot of this stuff in my younger years. I think the guitar riffs are straight forward and to the point. You really have to have a sense of humor and not take all this to seriously. I'm sure the Band didn't. To me this music is all about letting loose and having fun.

Read it in no time flat, though very soon into the book I already knew it was a piece of junk. Stupid, unbelievable characters. We're supposed to believe that Hank (the main guy character) in madly in love with the girl character in a single day.I love the Plum series, even though I am getting sick of it, too, since it never advances, but these little previous books of Evanovich's show the practice work before she came up with Stephanie Plum.

The only exception is that by the Plum series, Evanovich finally got it right.Don't waste your money or time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Last try for early Evanovich","review":"Like most of the other reviewers here, I bought Wife for Hire because I love Evanovich's Plum Series. I have tried other of her earlier romance stories and been disappointed but, ever the optimist, thought I'd give it another go. This is the last attempt. The situation was highly artificial--a guy pretending to be married so his father will loan him money, though it turns out the orchard would have survived without it--and the guy falls for the girl in less than one day. There was no build up for it, as the girl responds pretty immediately to him, too. There was no attempt to distinguish between sexual attraction and love or to build from one to the other. The story was really rushed. The only high point was the madcap comedy involving the townspeople."},{"rating":"1","title":"No real plot and a general, simple story line","review":"This book just didn't rub me the right way from the get-go. While I did like Maggie and her crazy, disapproving Mom and Aunt, the rest of the book just made no sense. It seemed like Evanovich was in the hurry-up-and-wait mode when she wrote this book. The plot line was nonexistent and the only interesting part of the book was thrown away in the end. So much of the book was pointless and you knew exactly what was going to happen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so inspiring","review":"I tried to give this a listen, wanting to broaden my horizons a bit. However, I found I could not take his 'teachings' very seriously given his wildly inaccurate 'facts' about hypnosis which he uses to support some of his beliefs.

It took almost 3 weeks to arrive after ordering. 5 parts arrived damaged. It took another week to get those replaced and then 2 arrived broken. Over a month into this process I still don't have a chest of drawers. The problem is poor engineering. This one looks nice, but I would keep looking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good buy","review":"I didn't even get to assemble this when it arrived because it was broken in the box.

I was already a fan of nearly every band on this CD but only had a few of the tracks so I picked it up. I will start by saying that me two favorite tracks here are the Mindless Faith and SVD tracks. Both od these go to heights unknown before for both these bands and are incredible tunes with beats that will shred the lungs and legs of people on any club floor. I am not real partial the VNV track on this disc - it is a REALLY toned down, uber mellow version of Legion that I could probably doze off to by accident.Overall, this comp, combined with the first two DAC Advanced Electronic comps should be required listening to anybody who is interested in more from this genre.This is well worth the money - new or used."},{"rating":"1","title":"An almost perfect bracelet.","review":"I have rather slim wrists and this bracelet fit perfectly.

I have not yet contacted the seller, as I'm most likely to just buy some stretch string at a Craft Store.

Due to the textbook nature of the book there are chapters and even sections of chapters that you will want/need to chew on a bit and perhaps re-read to get the full value of it.Goll starts with a very brief history of some prophetic movements, moves on to some characteristics of prophetic people and spends the rest of the book giving examples of prophets and how to build the gift that God has placed on the prophetic person.

Now that she's all grown up - Very HOT!Even though we didn't get to see her in her full glory while handcuffed to a shower curtain rod, the movie was very entertaining. She pulled off the innocent girl trying to become a recovery agent. I haven't read the book, but I am thinking that it might be a good one to read.The movie didn't come off like an estrogen enriched chick-flick either. It had action, and plenty of testosterone. I watched it with my girlfriend, and she got just enough romance and I got just enough action. So if you have a special lady friend, this is a good movie to share.The supporting cast members also helped make this movie enjoyable.Now if they'd just make a Charlie's Angels movie with Katherine Heigl, Jennifer Aniston and Uma Thurman, I'd be a happy camper."},{"rating":"2","title":"What Were the Critics Thinking?","review":"All the supposed story \\"flaws\\" the critics blamed on the screenwriters and Ms. Heigl are in the original novel.

INCREDIBLY faithful.True, this flick would have probably played better on HBO or Showtime, but that's only because it is low on explosions and high on old fashioned storytelling--just the opposite of today's usual theatrical popcorn flick. And Heigl is as charming as ever. Too bad wrongheaded critics gang-jumped the film during its theatrical run and destroyed any chance it had for sequels.

Janet Evanovich's books are well known and well liked, with good reason, but this adaptation just doesn't work. The supporting cast feels completely off, particularly the actors playing the Morelli and Ranger characters, both of whom seem to be wondering what they did to their agent to annoy them enough to land in this picture. The script seems lifeless, as if the energy of the book has been drained completely. Katherine Heigl is the biggest problem of the film. She's completely miscast as the lead character, bounty hunter Stephanie Plum. Heigl isn't at all believable in the part. And she's not at all likeable, in any role she plays, and she turns what was already a shaky movie into a disaster. Avoid this at all costs, particularly if you're an Evanovich fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointing","review":"I too am a HUGE fan of the written Plum books and wanted to love this film...but didn't!First of all fire the director, casting director, and the script writer.

After seeing the movie I took the dvd off my wish list.There wasn't much urgency with the Ramirez threats either so that didn't work in the movies favor either. Overall the filmmakers were too worried about their rating and cut the film back too much. The end effect was choppy and uneven.I prefer to go back and reread my books that are perfect! Sorry KH, but you didn't make a great Stephanie. And this character deserved to be great..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why did they waste the money?","review":"I KNEW this would happen. Granted we all see the characters differently and for that reason alone they shouldn't have made this movie. I can't even believe I have to pay $3.99 for cable. What a waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Suck age","review":"I LOVE these books,I was happy when I heard the movie was being made, then I cried whe I heard who was playing stehenie plum. I forced myself to go and used my fee passes from my birthday cause I refused to pay for it. Could NOT handle it! The jersey accent she does goes in and out in every scene. The acting is flat and only 3 people were cast in a good way. The grandma, joe and lula. Other then that re cast for a sequal."},{"rating":"2","title":"One for the Money","review":"I ordered this because I like Katherine Hiegl. It was a good movie but not great. I enjoyed watching it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it.","review":"Not the Ranger I would have chosen, but still loved it. Hope they continue with the rest of the series, at least through book twelve."},{"rating":"2","title":"CATCH ME IF YOU CAN, CUPCAKE.","review":"We have been flooded with bounty hunter movies. In this film Katherine Heigl plays Stephanie Plum who becomes a bounty hunter for her cousin Vinnie (Patrick Fischler). The action takes place in Trenton, N.J. Her first case is Joe Morelli (Jason O'Mara acting like a young Mel Gibson). He is a cop accused of murder. He also took Stephanie's virginity and never called her back. In return she hit him with her car and broke his leg.Stephanie has no experience as a bounty hunter. This fact and her doting mother (Debra Monk) and grandmother (Debbie Reynolds) supply us with some mild humor. Plum is aided by Daniel Sunjata, who looks like he could play Derek Jeter.The acting was fairly decent although the writing is trite with gags and bits that are old hat. In spite of that Heigl brings new life to them. Her performance is what made the film.No f-bombs that I recall, no sex, rear male nudity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"It is very rare that I do not finish a movie, and this was one of those rare cases. The acting was horrible, everything was so cliche, and her accent was so bad that it made the movie unwatchable. Turned it off ater about 20 minutes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not One For The Money","review":"Apparently this movie is based on a book. I hope the book is much better than the movie, which in most accounts, the books are much better than any Hollywood rendering of any book title. The movie did move along rather quickly only because I found myself wandering off. In other words, this movie is not very engaging. It certainly was a waste of time. Is there a way to get a refund on lost time?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Action that's boring and a romance that doesn't work.","review":"I'm sure others love this movie, and you might. It's kind of \\"war of the roses\\", which I hated. I don't feel like there is any chemistry in the romance of the story, and don't believe heigl pulled off the action at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pushing it to rate it two","review":"I love the books. They are funny and the characters are fully fleshed out. I did not finish watching because I thought everyone was miscast and even the house in the burg was also made ladylike, much like Grandma Mazur with her perfect makeup."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame and Uninspired","review":"Everything you have heard about this lame and uninspired film is true. Even if you are a fan of the Stephanie Plum series, you will find this film lacking in story, pacing, and acting ability. The entire cast is miscast and hampered by a poor script that barely captures the likability of Evanovich's Stephanie Plum novels. Thankfully it will only take an hour and a half of your time to watch this film, so do so if you want a bland diversion for the evening. The film plays out like an incomplete pilot for a TV series which I suspect was how it was originally developed. It has just enough information to introduce the viewer superficially to the characters without really getting to know them. The setting of Trenton, New Jersey is superficial as well and captures none of the uniqueness of this working-class urban area."},{"rating":"1","title":"not so much...","review":"This film generally put a frown on my face. I was not the least bit entertained. Finger drum finger drum..."},{"rating":"1","title":"MY GRADE: C plus.","review":"Tale is about a woman (Katherine Heigl) who loses her job at Macys as a lingerie manager and in desperation takes on a job as a bail enforcement agent. Don't worry. She's from the working class neighborhood so she can handle herself. The plotting of the story is done well enough but the humor is almost always a miss and the chemistry between the two love interests is generally just average or lower. Debbie Reynolds (a very big deal back in the day) plays the grandmother. The family connection was done somewhat well, too, but man if only the humor and chemistry had been higher this would have been a good or better movie.This film was based on the 1994 novel of the same name by Janet Evanovich. The budget for this picture was $40M but it only made a bit over $36M at the Box Office (Wiki).STORY/PLOTTING: B minus; HUMOR: C minus; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B minus to B;ROMANTIC CHEMISTRY: C minus to C; OVERALL GRADE: C plus; WHEN WATCHED: end of May 2012."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice, light movie","review":"Enjoyed it.

Just not the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"ugh","review":"Good Lord. This was terrible. How many ways can you say terrible. Ugh. Useless, not even remotely believable. Worst movie I've seen in many a year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unwatchable","review":"Between the narration of every event we see on screen (\\"It was easy to tail his car because it was bright red\\"), Heigl's unplaceable affected accent, and lifeless directing, this movie is simply unwatchable. It's not terrible, which at the least would be an interesting trainwreck, but is unambitious and lacking in style. The narration, particularly, drags the movie down, and seems to treat the audience like they have never seen a movie before and might have trouble linking one seen to the next without a recap of the plot and how the next scene fits into it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointed","review":"Fans of Janet Evanovich's books, don't look for any sequels to be made. This one doesn't cut it. Jason O'Mara is excellent as Morelli, Katherine Heigl is OK as Stephanie Plum but Daniel Sunjata as Ranger is dreadful. Talk about lacking personality and lacking chemistry with Heigl, wow! John Leguizano, who plays the villan, would have been a better Ranger even if he's too old for the part. At least he has a personality. The movie also doesn't capture writer Evanovich's wonderfully zany sense of humor. Sherri Shepard as Lula is a pleasant surprise in a too-small role."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh, Ranger! What a hunk!","review":"Didn't really like Morelli actor but that Ranger actor was awesome. Donna Reed as the granda was pretty cute also. Also liked katherine Heigl as Stephanie Plum--I thought overall this was a funny and interesting video and ran fairly close to the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heigl, need I say more?","review":"Katherine Heigl delivers another fine performance and is a joy to watch. Love her smile!! Story line was simple but nonetheless enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This movie had good potential but failed to deliver. The acting is subpar and the lines are soap opera cheesy. I really like Heigl and I believe she could have done a lot better. It is barely a decent movie if you have two hours to waste."},{"rating":"2","title":"One for the Money","review":"I read the book and enjoy everything this author writes. The casting of the characters couldn't be better. They story line is true to the book. A fun way to spend the evening!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Way over rated...","review":"Do not be fooled by the high rating as I was. No more than 1 star at best. Not sure what the goal was with this film but it just did not work for me. Lots of technical errors as well. If you are a police film person you really need to lower your expectations when you watch this one. I read through a bunch of the multi-star reviews and it seems the vast majority all read the books. I would guess they are filling in the shortcomings of this film with their memories, familiarity and fondness of the characters in the books thus making the film seem better to them than it really is. I found myself watching to see how many tech errors I could pick out and how many absolutely unrealistic plot twists would take place rather than to be entertained. This will be the film K.H. will want everyone to forget. There will never be a sequel. Watcher beware!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I read the series and I can't see Katherine Heigl being a believable Stephanie Plum, the accent was so off. Being from the east coast, they could've picked a no name actress to play the part. I stopped the movie within 10 mins"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very bad.","review":"I could not even get through the whole movie. The acting was subpar, the script worse. If not for the movie Alex Cross, this would be the worst movie I've seen in my life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it, but...","review":"Loved it but it could have been cast so much better! Whoever played Ranger was not the Ranger decscribed in the book. The accents sucked in this movie too! Debbie Reynolds as Grandma Mazur? Really? And who played Stephanie's mother? Nanny Fine's mother from the Nanny would have been a much better cast. As a matter of fact Yedda from there would have been a better Grandma Mazur. If there is a second movie I hope they recast the roles.The movie was much too short. It needed at least another 30 minutes. I really cannot believe Janet Evanovich was pleased with the script and the casting. I expected so much more. I'm glad I didn't pay full price int he theater. I'm only out 3.99. Thats about all this movie was worth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didnt buy Hiegel in Role","review":"Read the book, it wasnt my favorite, so it was no surprise THE MOVIE DIDNT LIVE UP TO EXPECTATIONS. ITS ACCEPTABLE AT BEST, DRAGS IN PLOT DEVELOPMENT AND IN GENERl is mediocre at best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Diappointing","review":"One of the great things about Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum stories is they're so funny you actually laugh out loud while reading them. Apparently that doesn't transfer well to the screen. Details from the book that are necessary to understand where the characters are coming from were left out of the movie. When it was over, I kind of felt like \\"That's it? That's all we get?\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Movie OK, could have been better....","review":"The movie was OK. The movie could have followed the book more closely (more humor in book) The casting could have been better for Grandma & Ranger. Sorry that I purchased the movie. I should have waited for Netflix. On the good side, Amazon delivered the movie on the release date."},{"rating":"2","title":"The book is better","review":"As usually happens with movies, the book was better. It was not a bad effort and I appreciated that the more gory scenes were adapted for general viewing. This is my least favorite book of the Stephanie Plum series and I never re-read it (although I do the others)because of the graphic violence in one section. The casting was not bad but did not quite live up to my expectations. Still, not a bad movie. I hope more get done."},{"rating":"1","title":"save your money if your a fan of the book and read it again","review":"First off, I did read all the reviews before watching..still took a chance because I seem to be more tolerant watching movies that were made from books than most people I know. I know they can't all be spot on. Secondly, I have read the book and loved it so very much. That said, if you have not read the book you might enjoy this movie more because you can't miss what you don't know. I found this movie to be very bland personality wise, under character developed and very disappointing; mostly because the best parts of the books were the characters and their various attitudes and personalities; they were not shown as well as they could have been in the movie. In the books all the characters esp. Lola's and Grandma Mazur's antics among others were what kept you in stitches; Do yourself a favor and read the book instead, you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Capitol BAD","review":"Katherine Heigl has no pizzazz whatsoever needed to play Stephanie Plum. What a terrible film voice. From the moment the title credits rolled to indecipherable lyrics and bland graphics, I had a bad feeling. Who ever cast this should be shot out of hollywood in a cannon. Debbie Reynolds is still too vibrant and beautiful to be Grandma. Where were the accents. Could not get past the horrible casting to even finish the film. What about a soundtrack. This film has no music to carry it along. Stale, boring and completely flat. Evanovich, you shouldn't have sold out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why does Hollywood keep doing this to books?!","review":"Did anyone involved in this movie even read the book?

The accent was definitely funny, but not consistent all the way throughout the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Barely Watchable","review":"If you're looking for something utterly mindless, this movie could be a viable option. Otherwise, it should be avoided. Paltry dialogue and plot. Fairly shoddy acting as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"not crazy about it...","review":"I love Janet's book, and I thought the casting for the parts did not work at all...the books are way funnier than the movie,and both morelli and ranger could have been sexier and hotter that the guys they casted.it was entertaining, but not even close to what the books portray..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Retarded","review":"What was Heigl thinking?

It has no allegiance to Chambersburg, where the novels are set, and has no idea how people from Trenton speak. They all sound like New Yorkers, which is never the case. Aside all that, Kathryn Heigl is poorly cast, as is Debbie Reynolds, and indeed the rest of the cast. I've seen television episodes better directed and shot like this bore fest."},{"rating":"1","title":"nah","review":"pretty predictable. if you're into really basic and predictable plots, this ones for you!

The movie exceeded my expectations. All the actors were well suited to the characters they played with one exception. Debbie Reynolds was not even close to Grandma Mazur.

They also gave all of the characters a \\"North Jersey\\" accent and look. Trenton is decidedly \\"South Jersey\\" and has its own dialect, similar to a Philadelphia and not New York accent.With all of that said Heigl is of course super hot but the rest of the movie is lacking, and most of the comedy was left in the book. (Pretty good read)They had a scene in a shooting range with assault rifles painted on the outside, a real laugher.

I agree with the negative reviews that have said how awful this movie is. I just wanted to add that I'm in shock that Katherine Heigl gave up a lucrative job on Grey's Anatomy for a stinker like this. She definitely doesn't pull off this role convincingly, and her accent comes and goes constantly. She's much too talented to be wasted in something like this turkey.

I was so afraid the movie would make me toss all my books. Fortunately it didn't. I found that after time, Stephanie, Joe, Ranger, Lula were all back just the way I imagined them. Thank goodness the movie didn't ruin it for me, but I fear the effect the movie has had on the \\"unPlumed.\\" I hope there will be no further attempts at taking these wonderful books & ruining them in film.I am currently reading \\"Notorious Nineteen\\" & am glad to have Stephanie, Grandma Mazur, Morelli, Ranger & Lula back where they belong."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super cute movie","review":"After having read the books, I did not know what to expect from the movie.

Ranger was totally awesome! Now, Joey was hilarious, too. I would have liked to get a little more back-story on his and Stephanie's relationship. I love their banter and the insults.

She gets involved in mischief and tries to survive while bringing in the bounty. This is an attempt at being clever, funny and hip, but the movie achieves none of those. The storyline is only mildly interesting, and the film has complimentary characters meant to provide light moments, but they are not very funny.

Heigel comes along as a single loser living in Jersey desperate for any job. Instead of rationally taking small jobs she's determined to go after some guy with a large price on his head whom she apparently attempted to run over with a car in high school?! Also, her Jersey accent was horrible. All Jersey accents are horrible.

Clearly this movie had been returned and resold. I tried playing it in 4 different DVD players and my computer and the dang disk would not work.

However, getting to that point was a pain. Must have had to sit through 10 previews before the movie started. I'm guessing this was a rental because of all the previews.

Some of the best scenes were of the crazy antics of Debbie Reynolds. When the DVD came out, all of those scenes were gone.

The plot moved along at a clip and the bazaar elements were there, but the casting was all wrong, failing to capture the essense of the characters as we have come to know and love them throughout 18 volumes (19 out this fall). I suppose a viewer who has not read any of the series might enjoy the giddiness and unlikeliness of the plot, but for a seasoned Stephanie Plum fan it just fell flat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of fun!","review":"I wasn't holding out much hope for this adaptation. Bringing a book to the big screen is just about an impossible task. I've never seen one that measured up to the written version. This was no exception. BUT, it was still fun! I enjoyed it simply as an addition to one of my favorite series and would recommend it to anyone as such.Heigl and O'Mara pulled off decent portrayls of Plum and Morelli. Shephard was fun as Lula. The rest of the cast was just okay. Sunjata, though, WAS Ranger. By far my favorite and completely worth watching just for him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money and read the books instead","review":"I am a huge fan of Evanovich. I laughed so hard when I started reading the series that I was crying...the only reason I was crying when I watched this movie was because it was so painful and confusing as to how they could have taken such a great and funny book and ruined it to such a degree. If you have the unfortunate luck to watch the movie before you read the book, don't despair...they have very little in common."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"When you're 15 minutes into a movie you get to view for free and want to no longer watch the rest, it's not a good sign. I don't mind Katherine Heigl, but the accent is terrible and the fact that she's continuously narrating her own actions is incredibly annoying, especially when she's pointing out obvious things that don't need to be narrated. I don't need you stating that a car was yellow when I can see that for myself. Only reason it didn't get 1 star is because the grandmother is pretty funny with the few parts she has 30 minutes into the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somewhat Disappointing","review":"I am a huge Katherine Heigl.

Altogether disappointing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"Just from the previews I didn't think it would be worth paying the rental fee. I was right. I waited until it showed up on Netflix. I made it through twenty minutes and turned it off. No one in the roles made sense. From the terrible Jersey accents to the non-Italian actors, it was a disaster. I don't know what the casting director was thinking when they put this group of actors together to make this movie. Not one of them fit their part. Do not waste your time on this mess. If they had found all new actors that fit the parts, and had written a decent script it would have been a funny and enjoyable movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable!","review":"I went into this movie not knowing fully what it was really all about. It was one my wife wanted to read, as she had read some of the books, and she checked it out and we watched it on one of our stay in date nights. I found it actually rather enjoyable. The actors were good in it and there was some good humor in it. Aside from comedy, I am also big into action & thriller movies, so those bits in the movie were up my alley too. I'd recommend to just about anyone to give this a watch...it's pretty good."},{"rating":"2","title":"book vs. movie - surprising, but still a lot of fun","review":"Katherine Heigl was awesome as Stephanie Plum - true to the Jersey Girl we know and love from the series. I was really surprized by Grandma Mazur - she was more polished than the character from the book and it was a bit distracting. Stephanie's future love interests weren't nearly as hot as depicted in the novels, but they have potential and I'm looking forward to seeing them in future movies as the series progresses... Does anyone know if more movies are planned?Not even close to being as side splittingly funny as Janet's books - but honestly, I'm a book worm and there aren't many movies that can top a book. Still - it was a really good show."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was fun!","review":"The dudes were hot, Katherine was perfectly cast, and Debbie reynolds was hilarious.. A funny, sexy film.

After over a month and a half I still do not have the correct replacement for a nine month old defective under the cabinet toaster oven. They sent me two counter top toaster ovens on two different occasions. One takes forever to toast and the other electronic switch only works half the time. They lied to me more than one time about shipping a new replacement. The best part is that my children have allready told me they will never buy a Black and Decker product. If you have stock in this company sell it quick and do yourself a favor and buy a different brand toaster oven."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Toast","review":"The toaster looks nice, but unfortunately it does not work very well. My wife and I received this toaster as a wedding gift from our registry. We moved into our new house and started to demo the kitchen so it was important to have something that would function as an oven substitute. The product worked fine for a few weeks and then unexpectedly the toaster feature stopped working. The bake and broiler are fine, but the toaster does not work at all. This thing is horrible. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT."},{"rating":"2","title":"Toast in this?","review":"As someone who got this as a gift, maybe I can be a little less impassioned. This is large enough that making toast in it doesn't make any more sense than using a conventional oven to do the same. The timer is very useful to me. The calibration on it may lean towards hotter than my conventional oven but it is very useful as a second oven for a NY apartment dweller.As for the failure of B&D; to stand behind defective product, that is an American industry problem that will only be solved by Congressional legistlation to force companies to replace or refund defective products. B&D; is just as reprehensible as almost every other American company - I suspect that to be responsible would be a dire competitive disadvantage. You want to see that change then make it a matter of public debate. Unless they are all forced to do it, none of them will (or probably can afford to) do it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware!!!!!","review":"This is the worst appliance I have ever purchased.

Other than a small fire, I LOVED this toaster oven, but it is hard to get over flames in your kitchen.While I have had B&D; toasters for over 15 years, I was shocked to be standing in my kitchen while I watched the top heat element spark and flame up while making dinner. I use this toaster oven on a regular basis for baking and broiling and have had no problems for nine months. When I was six minutes into broiling a steak (one of the main uses), it started to spark and at seven minutes it broke out into flames that did not decrease when the unit was unplugged.My mother also owns the unit and uses this more than the stove. The day before my fire, her unit would not work unless the timer and temperature were both on (had not happened before). I find it odd that two toasters in two states would break in the same weekend."},{"rating":"1","title":"4 minutes 14 seconds for warm bread?","review":"My wife and I couldn't believe how long it took to \\"toast\\" bread with this machine. So, in the interest of making this review accurate, we timed it. We set the \\"toast\\" dial to medium, and four minutes and fourteen seconds of loud ticking noises later, we had warm bread. It had started to brown in the middle, but the bread was still not warm enough to keep me from comfortably picking it up with my hand immediately after the timer went off.We can't comment on the other functions of this toaster oven, but since we planned to use it 75% or more for toasting bread, muffins, bagels, etc., it's horrid performance on this task was enough for us to decide that it only merits one star."},{"rating":"1","title":"FIRESTARTER!","review":"We were reasonably happy with this toaster oven; although it didn't toast well or evenly, the glass gets very dirty, it gets very hot and the heating element coils catch on fire frequently. We were willing to settle for this less than stellar functionality until this morning when toasting some hash brown patties. All of a sudden there were sparks flying out of either end of the toaster oven (literally sparks of fire shooting all over the kitchen counter and toward me) and then before you know it the unit was on fire inside. Thankfully we were able to unplug it before there was any real damage; no damaged kitchen cabinets and no kitchen fire - but if we had left the kitchen for a minute, our kitchen could have caught on fire. This is the second TRO651 that we purchased, and the second one to bite the dust!

The old one worked, but the paint was rubbing off, so why not get a new shiny one! But the new one started having an intermittent problem with the top Toast/Bake/Broil temperature control after 6 months, and recently the oven timer clock would stop after a few minutes and get hung up at around the 20 minute time. Sometimes the oven or toaster would not work, but after moving the top dial back and forth a couple of times, the unit would work OK for months. Then the problem would return, and could be \\"fixed\\" again by rotating the knob back and forth several times. Yesterday 1/26/2011 it would not heat at all.

Not every idea is for everybody. Some are clever. Some are creative. Some are just plain fun. Some take some planning, and some you can just put to use right away. If you don't already have a great card, skip to the back chapters, design your card, and then the author will tell you how to creatively network with it.

A must for any serious student or fan of Black music.This Lp always reminds me of my sister (Deb, Class of'76).

Curtis Mayfield produced this Aretha Franklin album in the mid-1970s.With top line production, this does not have the southrern soul grit of Franklin's 60s soul recordings. The sound is logical--Mayfield was the king of smooth northern soul with the Impressions, and took this even further with his solo funk work.On Sparkle, the name of the game can be described by the title. Fantastic horns, beautiful female backup singers; Aretha's voice is buffered wonderfully by the environment Mayfield creates. This production has the polish of a Steely Dan album.Elegant, classy, refined: you have heard a lot of Aretha Franklin, but it's high time you hear her on Sparkle."},{"rating":"1","title":"amazingly poor","review":"As a long-time Buddhist, i can say this is the least Enlightened talk on Zen I've ever encountered.

This album just does not measure up to either their first album, or to their third, \\"Oi Dai.\\" The singing is much like we find on the first album, but I noted on listening to \\"Black Bird\\" that in some places the instrumentalists were just not together, either not quite on beat or not quite on key. Maybe they had not yet learned to do multiple takes in the studio. The first album is recognizably Varttina, and is full of good singing and enthusiasm. \\"Black Bird\\" is perhaps too ambitious - a case of growing pains.

Benny Golson's trademark riffs from this era are heard to great effect, and Art Farmer's inventive solo is deeply felt. My personal favorite is \\"November Afternoon,\\" by Tom McIntosh, the trombonist on the date. The melody alone is memorable enough, but again, Farmer and Golson kept me transfixed.

A good account of the life of St. Bernadette. From that standpoint I can certainly recommend it. But from the title and the description, I expected it to be comprised entirely of verbatim excerpts from the writings of, and interviews with, St. Bernadette herself, strung together to create a flowing narrative. I was looking for the most complete volume of the visionary's own description of the Lourdes apparitions, and of her subsequent life, in her OWN WORDS. This is anything but that.

Not only do we get a brief history of sentence diagramming (and its predecessor, word balloons) but we're also treated to various stories of different writers and their approaches both to diagramming, and grammar in general. (The section on Gertrude Stein is particularly amusing.)This book is the perfect gift for your favorite language geek.

Authors write a good description, but can't back it with plot.Be warned, this is the turning point of the series. Weird to write for book two, but the anomaly is book one -- great compared against the rest. I stopped this series completely after book six because the authors can't write an interesting plot.

Action star Bryan Genessee is starting to rival Stephen Baldwin in his low key, somewhat soporific performances. Bentley Mitchum fares somewhat better as the truly psychotic madman who is holding a trainload of caricatures hostage. We have the asthmatic priest; the pregnant lady; the crippled boy; the young newlyweds, etc. The henchmen are just as bad as Mitchum including the requisite female who is just as dangerous as her male counterparts. The action sequences are tired and unimaginative; and the director uses several of the same scenes over and over in trying to fill the movie's extended length. Few movies have ever made walking on top of a moving train look so easy. Avoid unless you have nothing else to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very enjoyable adaptation","review":"This was an enjoyable adaptation of Jane Austen's Sense and Sensibility. The portrayal of Elinor and Marianne was satisfying and the dialogue compatible with the text. High praise for the casting; the characters looked as though they stepped out of a party Jane Austen might have attended, rather than Hollywood actresses (although I enjoy those versions as well for different reasons). Anyone that may be introducing a young woman to the world of Jane Austen would do well to select this movie version. Highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly Excellent","review":"To my shock and amazement, I stumbled upon a hidden treasure. This work is brilliantly and beautifully captured -staying true to Jane Austen's masterpiece. In fact, unlike the 1995 motion picture with Emma Thompson, there is a hidden surprise in this more accurate depiction of the story. I won't spoil it for you-but it's quite clear that the 1995 version missed one of the most important portions of Austen's tale of love lost and found. I will admit, I was VERY SURPRISED by how expensive this viewing turned out to be, since you have to purchase each episode individually and those episodes are only about 40 mins. long. But the money is well spent!

I've read the book twice. And so I was curious to see how an early BBC production of the story played. In a word, \\"Disappointingly\\". The key word is really \\"early\\", as in, \\"this is an early Masterpiece Theater type production that looks very much like a filmed stage play\\". In other words, the production values are weak. More importantly, passion is also lacking - both that provided by the actors (who seem stiff and plain) and that experienced by the audience. The movie version proved that S&S can have both scope AND passion. This mini-series did not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Slow.","review":"Staged sets and no personality breaks believability, in this earlier, 1981 version. Compared to \\"Pride & Prejudice\\"-2006, 1996, & 1940 all at 5-stars; and the Emma Thompson version-1995, at 4-stars.This film should be used in a film school, to show what happens when: no additional lighting is used outdoors = (shadows on the actors faces), no boom-mike = (distracting noises), ill-plotted camera-angles = (the camera comes into the viewer's mind), and no transitions, indoor to outdoor, or room to room, and staged-sets = (does not take you there).So, they had a low budget. If you view it as a college play, do not mind \\"reserved\\", and \\"slow\\", and are a big Jane Austen fan, you may enjoy it. I recommend instead, \\"Middlemarch\\", skipping the first episode; and \\"Maytime\\", watch first 5-minutes, skip 10-minutes, then the movie takes off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to enjoy","review":"I found this version listless and uninteresting overall. Tracey Childs overacted badly as a hysterical Marianne. Bosco Hogan was depressed and lackluster as Edward. Robert Swann had nothing to offer in looks, demeanor, or chemistry that could ultimately win over a damsel of 17, in spite of his righteousness. Donald Douglas was a ridiculous caricature as Sir John Middleton. Irene Richard's performance as Elinor Dashwood was uneven, varying from good to overwrought. The direction was poor, and the writing was below par.There were a few worthwhile performances. Diana Fairfax was a spirited Mrs. Dashwood, and Annie Leon found the right tone for Mrs. Jennings. Amanda Boxer made a superb Fanny Dashwood. It is a shame they did not find a better vehicle to support their effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated!","review":"I was really eager to watch this film after reading all the praise it has received in the reviews, but I must say I found it quite disappointing.The language sounded either lifeless, as if the actors were just reading aloud from a script, or completely overdone and unnatural. The sets looked like stage decorations and the actors stiff and uncomfortable. As a matter of fact, the whole film seemed more like a theatre play than a movie. The screenplay of Ang Lee's version might take some liberties with the book, but at least the characters are lively and credible!The worst letdown was the end after Episode 8, though: Marianne batting her eyelashes at the Colonel, remarking that she would have to ask him lots of questions - and her mother commenting \\"Children\\". And that was all! Am I missing a DVD??"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This is a flat, uninspiring rendition of the Dashwood saga.

While the author does not seek to provide a complete program for living, he provides some very valuable reminders that can provide excellent tools in any endeavor for effective living. No matter what your starting point, I think everyone will feel a little more empowered after reading and understanding his basic messages.

So, every chapter begins well and seems interesting, but as you keep reading, you will soon notice that his main and unique point is that the belief in question is a lie because it's a lie!

(page 233) and so on just misses the point. Feeding the ego all sorts of truisms will hardly make it effective in life, as I have seen from my work as an international teacher and psychologist.I don't recommend this book.

Her rendition of Ain't Nothing Like the Real Thing never really catches fire. On the other hand, she is able to take a sappy song like, With Pen in Hand and let it build into a soulful firestorm.

After two readings the flaps starting falling apart (this wasn't even my son's doing!). Then all of the other flaps just began to come off just by lifting them up and down. Even if the flaps were working I couldn't recommend this book to anyone. It had SO MUCH POTENTIAL with the writing...but alas, the writing is awful.

She loves lifting the flaps and gets into it so much that she pulled off one of the flaps because she was so excited. It has helped in teaching her different body parts.

My son who has not yet ripped Where is Baby's Belly Button, ripped this one within the first day of getting it. The problem is, alot of the flaps are too small!

The story told of a witch who axed two children to death and then chased two others, killing 11 dogs with a swinging ax and knife. Luckily, she was killed by the 12th who jumped at ther throat. THe children who survived cut out her heart...etc. Not appropriate for most 17 year olds, much less 7-8 year olds.

These are their memories, not only of the 10 men that died but also about their own struggle and endurance. In the time of the book you will intimately know these people that fought so hard to regain political status in Long Kesh, which was denied by them by Margaret Thatcher. It is a very moving account and all the more so because these people actually sufferred through conditions that in the civil world we live in, they should never have to endure.

It sheds a whole new light on a number of modern \\"thinkers\\". In particular the parrallel between Hitler's writting and that of a number of modern intellectuals is impressive to say the least. Also the book is very accessible and I found it very readable without extensive literary background. This goes to show that John Carey at least makes an effort to be read by the masses! Note also that although the title claims to address 1880-1939, there is a section at the end putting more recent authors into a whole new perspective, which imho is one of the highlights of the book.

The picture seems in his mid years but the sound on the cd, if him, must be from very early years. Doesn't have the typical Adriano Celentano unique sound that is him.

While some of the comments can be translated to the selling of services, it is geared at products, not services. If you have no sales experience, I'd recommended it.

I read it in one lunch hour, and that's not skimming. It's very basic English, simple sentence structure, general maxims. It's more like a morning pep talk to sales pros rather than a treatise on rainmaking. Nothing complex, nothing confusing, nothing intuitive.A lot of it came across as common sense to me. I think you learn these lessons the hard way when you run your own business for any length of time.I think it would be a fantastic book for corporations to hand out to employees as a mandatory read - too many employees see the impact of their jobs ending at the borders of their desks. It would also be a super gift for someone starting their first sales job.

The cylinder is too close to the frame and the speed loader hits the frame and grip causeing the bullets to enter the cylinder at a angle.

The instructions advise that grips made be a problem so you should know that going in. We used these in law enforcement before weapons like the Glock were available and authorized for carry. The grips on my 640 are factory and they do not allow full insertion of the rounds but with a little practice you can insert and twist the loader to the right and the rounds fall right in. Your practice is well rewarded and allows your smaller J frame model weapon to be quickly loaded and ready.

The rounds go in smoothly, but need a little jiggle to shake them down into the cylinder. They are what they are for the money. A little practice with them and you can get reasonably quick. I have never had a problem with them and I routinely carry two of them loose in a pocket. If you carry them loose in a pocket, make sure to check the pocket you carry them in for lint and foreign matter, as well as the speed loaders. If you want competition fast, this one isn't it.

This is a little misleading. The speedloader will work, but not as intended. You have to adjust the loader angle and drop the bullets in about a third of the way out of the cylinder. It is faster then loading one bullet at a time, but this is not something I would trust to do in a stressful situation. Tactically these speedloaders fail in the LCR 357. I have no experience with other snubbies or j-frames, just reviewing for this specific firearm.Construction and quality of the product are fine. I did more research and found another speedloader brand called Five Star that is reported to work better, I'll put in addition in here if they do work out later.Shipping was also extremely quick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does Not Fit","review":"The speedloader seems like a good product in terms of quality and function, but it does not fit my revolver.

The gun is plain old normal factory specs from the manufacturer, no after market parts, no customization, etc. The speedloader doesn't even feed in half way to the cylinder before it gets stuck.

I have the factory stock grips on the weapon, and the speed loader gets jammed against the grips. It is anything but a speedy load. In fact, it will get you dead. I have unfortunately found that the fiddling with this speed loader to extract it after loading takes substantially longer than simply loading in five shells into the cylinder by hand. I am trying out some Bianchi Speed Strips (also sold here on Amazon) and will rate those soon. But in the meantime, do not expect this speed loader to work with the 642 or any other J frame. It will not, and if you take your safety and that of your family seriously, please do not purchase this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good quality, great price, does the trick","review":"This speedloader has great quality, holds the shells firmly, releases them easily, and works as advertised. Note that it doesn't quite fit perfectly with the Ruger LCR with standard Hogue grips, as the grips get in the way of it lining up perfectly. So you have to load them at an ever-so-slight angle (and can't put any more than the tips of the bullets in the cylinder) rather than loading them all the way in before releasing them.

This is a \\"memory play\\"; in memory everything seems to happen to music, the character, Tom, continually shifts from narration to his \\"in scene\\" character. He is a dynamic character. This technique makes the drama a most effective selection for audio. The cast is extraordinary throughout, with each performer deftly handling the most subtle nuances of Williams's poetic realism. The production and direction of the performance are equally engaging.

I probably should have put it down then and there; the play unfolds to be exactly that, the work of a man who never should have been a writer. Williams really needed to learn how to show, not tell. It seems to be one of the most obvious and avoidable pitfalls, but this author fell for it so badly it ruins the play. For example, the play begins with a character, the narrator, talking about the play's meaning and giving the audience background. This is something that should obviously be done through the story, and not through direct explanation, and this theme returns in just about every scene. I'd stay away from this book if I were you."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Tragedy to Literature","review":"I don't care if this play was somehow a foil of Tennessee Williams life, it was the worst \\"work\\" of \\"literature\\" I have ever been forced to read for school.

But this is a story of Tom's pathetically sad life that involves his taking care of his aging mother who can't give up her past and his disabled sister with an unusal attration to glass figurines of animals. This play is filled with symbols, metaphores, and all that jazz, expecting you to feel for the characters and Tom. No, his unenthusiastic approaches at life, and depressed facade turn down any simpathy you feel for him. Amanda the mother is obnoxious, end of story. And Laura the sister is SO helpless you can't help from stopping to want to end her life now. Don't buy the play DON'T DO NOT watch it and never think about it again.

She takes a train journey to a country town and meditates on her past. We learn about her childhood, school and family life. We meet her mother, older sisters, grandmother and her taciturn father. We learn about Taeko's insecurities, limitations and potential.The stylish music, mainly played by a piano and orchestra, is excellent and compliments the film.

Any pianist who has found that finger strength is not the basis for piano technique might be dismayed with the author's approach.However the book also includes a couple brief, well organized chapters not related to finger exercises: one on Memorization, another on specific ways to optimize your practice time.Even though I do not agree with the author's premise that every clean downstroke of a finger is preceded by a preparatory upstroke (in fact that statement seems absurd if you watch a lot of pianists play the piano), his book has forced me to think very clearly about how I want to teach piano technique to beginners."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dummy learn technique","review":"This book is really too simple for someone who's already known what means technique.

This is not useful in improving technique; only can call it an introduction of technique."},{"rating":"2","title":"Teen pop music done right!","review":"Pop music today has become so miserable and monotonous- especially when done by teen divas like Britney and Christina Aguilera.Back in 1988, Martika was a teen pop diva with a lot of spunk and a brilliant voice, some really funky and energetic musical hooks, and song lyrics which ranged from care-free and fun to intelligent and serious. She made music that was ALIVE, and full of soul!\\"More Than You Know\\" is a lush and infectious disco track, \\"If You're Tarzan, I'm Jane\\" is nicely tongue in cheek (another thing missing from music today), \\"Alibis\\" is wonderfully Jazzy, \\"I Feel The Earth Move\\" is pure high energy and \\"Toy Soldiers\\" is a very dark and conflicting power ballad about vice and temptation, sung very soothingly and passionately.A short but satisfying album of upbeat pop music with soul and life"},{"rating":"2","title":"another great 80s set","review":"Love it! of course back in 1988 the hit 'More than you know' was a favorite of mine, incl. when driving WI Hwy 51 from Philips to Wausau airport; does that have anything to do with the album?..no, but I would often hear it whilst doing so. Anyway, a great album here, no doubt has 80s influence, great variety of styles & tempos, lush ballads to high energy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing....2 1/2","review":"I hoped that this would be as good as either of Debbie Gibson or Tiffany's 80's albums, or anything by Samantha Fox, but it's not. It isn't as consistent as anything from those artists. It's predictably front loaded with some of the better songs, and then after 'Toy Soliders', it goes down hill. Not that anything aside from 'Soliders' is really all that great to begin with. Only the first four songs are any good. 'I Feel The Earth Move' is okay, too, but it's a cover. Everything else is limp and poorly written, especially 'It's Not What Your Doing'.Martika is the prettiest of the 80's teen bubblegum pop singers, and 'Soliders' and 'Love Thy Will Be Done' (from her second album) really are respectable songs, but she always sounds like she's SHOUTING the lyrics. Thankfully, she toned herself down on 'Martika's Kitchen', which is a better album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Breathtaking...","review":"Anyone who listens to this CD should wonder why Martika never really got her true props alongside Cyndi Lauper, Tiffany, Debbie Gibson and even Madonna. The whole CD is fantastic, but the crowning glory is \\"Toy Soldiers\\". Even though this song talks about depression, it's raw, gritty message struck a chord with Martika's audience and shot up the charts to Number One. Every time I hear it, I feel as if I'm hearing it for the first time, like I did that summer of 1989. Had she been given the proper songwriters and business management, Martika would have rivaled Madonna to this very day. \\"Won't you come out and play with me?\\"...."},{"rating":"2","title":"More Than You Know Martika","review":"A pretty cool CD with all those 1980 dance beats.

My favorite song is Cross My Heart!! Her voice is so powerful in this and the music just really impacts on you! It's given me goosebumps!!

All the music can be found easily enough from the artists original releases. There are no rare, unreleased or live tracks. I got my copy from the library so did not have to waste money for it. I suggest you do the same. It amazes me how large record companies bemoan that they are losing millions to pirating when in fact no one buys their junk, thus loosing millions to banality, not pirates.

Clearly, it is not the typical soul, gut-wrenching music ordinarily synonymous with the Queen of Soul. But, ever since I heard the eclectic mix of songs, there was always something that kept me replaying the album. Whether it was her uptempo version of Moody's Mood, the lover's-anthem Angel, or several of the hip, psychedelica tunes, the Queen always demands \\"R-E-S-P-E-C-T\\", and thus any serious music lover of Aretha should take the time to listen to her interpretation of the early 70's R&B/Soul era. I still say \\"Just Right Tonight\\" is one of her best Blues ever recorded. Just check out the free sample track and you'll see why."},{"rating":"1","title":"The beginning of the end","review":"Aretha's most productive period was between about 1967 to 1971.

This is nothing like the shows. The music is not there, the episodes are chopped up, it is NOT what you think you are getting when you are laying down your money. If enough people would have complained and boycotted buying it ... they would have had to do it right. I say let the stores send them all back and show them that the consumers have brains and know what they want to spend their hard earned money on."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Christian tract","review":"The time travel concept of this book was good, although the writing was stiff (obviously the author's first novel with all the inherent shortcomings). The story was okay until it became obvious that this was written to advance a very Christian point of view. I don't mind a little religion, but this was preachy and too obvious. In parts it read like a tract that folks hand out when they are standing on your doorstep. And of course the author totally ignores the time travel paradox at the end -- if the inventor of time travel is removed by time travelers, how can time travel have been invented for them to do so? -- explaining it to have been God's will to have worked it all out. (I guess that's the ultimate deus ex machina!)

The dialog and character development progress very well as the story evolves. Alan himself undergoes significant spiritual growth in the process.The book contains a significant amount of transcription from the writings of Plato as dialog. For those who are fans of philosophical discussions, this book is a goldmine. There is also a transcription of the play \\"The Clouds\\" by Aristophanes.I was pleased to discover the book does not have a fairy-tail ending in which everything works out perfectly. Without giving the ending away, let me just say that there are consequences to the accidental inclusion of Alan on the mission.An enjoyable story - one that I highly recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"sticky\\" not a smooth operation..","review":"Hello, Yes I shopped the market until I found speed loaders that my fit .38 Colt Detective Special.

The book gives the answer 135 by multiplication, the answer is 60 by Division! The equation just below it has the right answer but the fraction has the values in the wrong position. This on just a brief look at the book so far. Many of the definitions in the back are bad or just plain wrong. Not sure what to trust in this book.

Inexorably events involving these three unfold as in our best beloved fairy tales. The Book of Atrix Wolfe may not be McKillip's best (that honor is still associated with The Forgotten Beasts of Eld) but her story-telling still soars in the realm of high fantasy.This is a faery tale, serious high fantasy, displaying glints of humor but told in powerful and vivid language. In particular McKillip's rendition of a medieval kitchen is perhaps the most delightfully evocative kitchen to be encountered in the fantasy genre.Readers who've enjoyed Robin McKinley's Beauty may be equally enchanted with McKillip's work but should be warned that The Book of Atrix Wolfe is serious and heady stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Book of Atrix Wolfe","review":"Patricia A.

Found immediately that the machine doesn't copy any original larger than letter size...(my own fault), but then also found that it truncated my documents and left off the last line on a letter page and in my case, a crucial line. Shouldn't a copier that has a setting for 8 1/2\\" x 11\\" actually copy that size? I thought so too, and returned it for a Xerox XD100 which is a WIZ machine.

It does not even have the sexual content of most Carry on movies. The overweight and shapeless women are very bland and wear shapeless uniforms.There is a serious technical flaw.

The topics are ordered in a way that makes more sense than many composition textbooks; Rosenwasser and Stephen start with reading strategies, and only get to the nuts and bolts of writing after laying out the steps for critical analysis. In other words, THINKING comes before WRITING - as it should.

He reads novels, history, and science books, and seems to have a military fetish. The reviews are generally well-written and useful, but Gingrich may overestimate the importance of books. On Kissinger's \\"Does America Need a Foreign Policy?\\" he writes, \\"This is a book the Bush Administration can use for sophisticated planning.\\" I can just see Dubya, Cheney and Condy huddled over a dog-eared copy of Kissinger's book, marking up their map of geopolitical chessboard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read Molinari's chapter on Newt first","review":"Before you get caught up with Newt's rhetoric, get Susan Molinari's book Representative Mom and read the chapter on Newt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't drop all the bullets","review":"I ordered two and one works fine and one holds one and sometimes two rounds from dropping .

Over the years, Branden's books on self-esteem have continued in this tradition. Six Pillars Of Self-Esteem appears to be a culmination of his knowledge on the subject, a broadening of experience of over 25 years since the publication of The Psychology of Self-Esteem. For anyone interested in self-improvement or growth, for anyone wishing to break free from the cycle of the past or to discover the disowned self, for anyone floundering in the world of pop-psychology or five-minute improvement courses, this is the type of book that can lead the way.

While I was waiting for it to arrive, I went onto the Internet and downloaded some information, including the text of the legislation itself.I read through the legislation. I'm not an attorney, and I wasn't motivated to cross reference the other laws/acts mentioned. In other words I just read the legislation as is, with no legal background.When this book arrived, I expected it would provide information and/or interpretations that I was not able to get directly from reading the legislation and other free materials.In truth, I found there was very little, if anything that I hadn't gathered directly from my other sources. If you are trying to learn what Sarbanes-Oxley is about and choose not to use the available information, this book does describe the basics.I would not recommend it, because it does not significant add to, or simplify the information readily available for free."},{"rating":"1","title":"**Little** you need to know about Sarbanes Oxley","review":"The tagline on the book and on the on-line discription -- \\"Everything corporate employees must know to understand--and comply with--the Sarbanes-Oxley Act\\" -- is clearly wrong.The book does provide a \\"plan-English overview\\", from about 200,000 feet. In breadth, it does seem to cover each section of the act, but only from an exteremely high summary level.I was hoping this would be \\"Sarbanes-Oxley\\" for dummies, but it doesn't either have the level of explanation or the wit of most \\"for dummies\\" books.This book would be useful for someone who needed a very quick, high-level cursory introduction to Sarbanes-Oxley, but to suggest it is *everything* you, your employees or your company needs to know is absolutely crazy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great overview for those with small companies","review":"This book is a a quick read, it explains about 3/4 of the Act.After reading this you will be able to understand what the Sarbanes-Oxley Act was created to do, how the rules work, who is responsible for what in your company, and what you must do to comply with the act.Honesty, for the cost and the time it takes to read this book it is worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Primer","review":"This book is easy to read, straight forward and relatively brief.

He truly gets to the core of the sound and the digital recording quality really helps to bring this out. One cut that is particularily well-played in my opinion is the fugue from the C major Sonata. Despite the difficult double/triple stop patterns, Ehnes plays with perfect intonation and makes it seem effortless. The amount of control that he has over his instrument is incredible. He is able to phrase even the most difficult passages beautifully."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for travel","review":"We purchased this for our 2 year old son for a cross country plane ride.

He can't wait to read it b/f bed and I've found him reading it on his own during the day. It's full of butt-humor that boys his age find hysterical. Went ahead and ordered the others in the series as well. One good thing seems to be that reading about it seems to have cut down on his need to potty talk all the time.

Every pop-metal band wanted to write songs that reached these levels. \\"Don't Walk Away\\" and \\"Feels Like Love\\" rank up (or down) there with great ballads like Warrant's \\"Heaven\\" and Poison's \\"Every Rose.\\"Further \\"Bang Bang\\" and \\"Rock America\\" are pure late '80's pump your fists and then yourself teenage machismo. I actually recommend this album to every guy who had a mullet or who currently lives in New Hampshire...Did time stop there in late '86?...

Danger Danger were a decent live band, but their studio debut is 100% grade A cheese. The keyboards are what destroys this record's chances.

They feel great and made a nice addition to the controller. I cleaned the controller handles with alcohol thoroughly to give the sticky side a clean surface to hold onto.What i found was that the gells started to move around and slide back and forth. The sticky side on the controller worked fine it was the sticky side to the gel that gave way and let the gell move and finally just come off leaving the handles sticky.

About 3/5 of the pictures were shot at night with long exposure. This creates eerie skies and unnatural, usually pastel colors. It's a lot like a dream.

Went to dollar store to get a bAg of rice, Put rice inside an old tube sock, knotted it in the end, viola! I got my cheap hot compress, that gets really hot for my need.2 stars for the design though.

It would be very easy to overheat these -- I heat two of them for about three minutes, and that's plenty. My largest complaints with these is that the heat dissipates quickly unless they're covered by something (I recommend a towel, or using 'em under a blanket) and that they are lumpy and semi-solid, which is a gripe I have with this entire style of hot packs. I have not used this as a cold pack, and honestly, I probably wouldn't... a bag of frozen peas would curve around an injury a bit better than this would, although these do great for my shoulders."},{"rating":"1","title":"Celiacs beware!","review":"I am allergic to wheat and this causes me to get hives.
