The musicians who made it, made one of the greatest pop albums of the late 80s/early 90s. You're reading this because you would expect a \\"Greatest Hits\\" compilation to include those songs that you remember, namely \\"Baby, Don't Forget My Number\\" and \\"Girl You Know It's True.\\" For some reason, this album has been marketed in the same fraudulent way that the music was. Specifically, the two above mentioned songs are \\"remix\\" versions on this album, and they naturally lose all of the magic of the original versions. They aren't even close to the originals. Now, having just received this CD in the mail, I will be sending it back.

I needed a book to consolidate my most used recipes in because I tend to forget what the heck I cook. It has made it easy for me to flip thru MY favorite recipes and find a quick meal to make instead of going thru numerous cookbooks when time is of the essence. It's fun as well because instead of just writing the recipes down, I am making both color and black and white copies of recipes and taping them in the book along with pictures of what some of the recipes look like. I also have been able to write down recipes passed down to me by my mother that have no measurements, but I can cook them as long as I know the ingredients.It's a pretty book w/spiral binding and I am having a lot of fun with it.

I love Ina Garten (the Barefoot Contessa) but wish that I had saved the $12 and used one of the spiral bound lined journals in my home (you can find cute ones for $3-6 at Target, TJ Maxx or any hobby store).

It always helps to learn from those who are themselves successful, and unfortunately I knew nothing about Halperin before reading his book. His resume includes basically being a staff writer for Star Trek Next Generation, Falcon's Quest, Quincy, and the Masters of the Universe cartoon, none of which stands out as a pillar of literary depth or quality (also note - none of these are FILMS, about which the book is supposed to teach.)

I'm still looking for a reliable vendor for the 4500 mg strength ginseng, which tastes quite palatable. Asiachi.com was the vendor I used to use, but they don't have it anymore. Another vendor had it, but 4 of the vials were broken when I opened the box.

You begin to feel her determination and love for dance and only hope she makes it thought. But what was different about this book is that you didn't live the life of Melida through her eyes, but throught letters written from her, Jesse, and her parents. We were able to see how the illness not only affected the paitence but the family and friends as well. Its a great book and I guarentee it will leave you in tears."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best....","review":"This book did not hold up to McDaniel best, i read the first to pages then just skipped to the back to see if she died or not, but when i started to read the last chapter i relized that i haven't missed anything.

Melinda is preoccupied with her ballet through the years without him. But what will happen to her two favorite things in the world (Jesse and ballet) when Melinda is diagnosed with leukemia? Will it tear her dreams apart?I really liked this book. I liked the way the author had a really good description of everything, and the way you knew what was going on with all the characters with her journal/email style of writing.

I am a sucker for romance, and she writes such great love stories that have to end up in death. They make me cry time and time again. This time, she has definitely outdone herself. The romance between Jesse and Melinda was so sweet and innocent, that it would make any teenage girl jealous.I also really liked the format of the book (all in emails, letters, or diary entries). I would recommend this book to anyone that likes a good romance and a good cry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book I have ever read","review":"Lurlene had gotten me hooked by reading \\"Telling Christina Goodbye\\" but this book just kept me on for months and months to come. I figured that maybe it's kind of weird loving all of these sad books until I had gotten to this one. This book is every emotion you could possibly think of. Melinda's love for dance is definetly similar to mine. One of my favorite quotes comes from this book. You get to see in the beginning a romance start while they were about 6 or 7 and you see it grow into the love of her life as well as her best friend.

Since I wanted them for my workshop and garden shed, I just assumed they were plastic versions of the wood-handled dust brush I already own. Not so, unfortunately.These things are like 2/3 scale, toy versions of a real brush. Also, the photo is misleading: its handle is actually longer than its head. The brush head itself is a mere 1 X 5 inches, and of generally low quality. Further, as another reviewer mentioned, the bristles arrived somewhat flattened, apparently from their original packaging.The shipping cost almost as much as the two brushes, so it is not worth my time to return them.

It is a new idea, what happens to worn out currency? The stars are well suited for their roles. I particularly liked the zany Katie Holmes, who made the movie more interesting, but the professional critics particularly did not like her. I found it fun, thought provoking(what would I do with an unlimited source of money?), suspenseful,and oh yea, fun. Professional critics are not my best guides to good movies. Amazon reviews are better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"RECYLING OLD MONEY","review":"Three creative brainy women come up with the idea of recyling old money ready to be destroyed at their place of employment - very eco-friendly women. They kind of get caught but had kept out some of the stolen goods, and the movie ends with the women basically going scot-free from the legal system but still with loads of money. The cast was great, the plot shallow, but still plenty of laughs and good old-fashioned entertainment. No violence and forced sex. Good show!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable for a chick flick","review":"This movie might not be for everyone - some might find some parts a bit cliched or chick flick-ish, and I won't deny that it is. But I did overall find it to be a rather enjoyable film with a trio of decent actors, though I don't think that Katie Holmes did as well in her part as she could have. These ladies do what we're all thinking, and what we'd all be tempted to do if we had to actually destroy money. Goodness knows I'd want in in such a scheme, it really is the perfect crime. The ending is a bit cliched but overall satisfying. 3.5/5 stars for a fun and light-heated flick."},{"rating":"2","title":"$$Mad Money$$","review":"Funny Funny movie!

Its not your average run of the mill movie.

Diane Keaton, Queen Latifah and Katie Holmes are perfectly cast. Their characters are likeable and you'll find yourself rooting for them.

The story is a fantasy most people have indulged in at one time or another. While it certainly is not the funniest film I have seen; it is humerous enough and well-acted enough to make for an enjoyable film that was far better than one would expect given the critics' point of view upon theratrical release. But as so often is the case; critics seem to be looking for different elements in films than the general public. I found 'Mad Money', cute, enjoyable, light, funny, and now that it is on DVD, a great way to spend an at-home date night or a rainy afternoon alone or with friends sharing an enjoyable film that doesn't tax your brain or make you depressed, it just entertains you, and quite well at that."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Holes Than A Box Of Fruit Loops","review":"This is probably the worst movie I have seen this year, a failure on so many levels. It's a comedy without laughs and a crime caper without drama. To say the story is not realistic would be a gross understandment.The characters played by Diane Keaton and Katie Holmes are not only ridiculous but downright irritating. Queen Latifah's character, a single mom who wants a better life for her sons, is somewhat more sympathetic. But really she is the only bright side in this cinematic disaster. Avoid at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mad Money, Bad Times","review":"From the very first moments you wonder if this is the final version of the film or a rehearsal intended to show how the movie has to \\"look\\".A comedy that doesn't have any funny moments, a heist-flick with no excitement, and performances by marquee-name stars hat don't deliver, but rather dissapoint.This movie is to be avoided and not even paid money would make me watch it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mad?

Even Katie Holmes has a track record far better than most of her generation. Not to mention Ted Danson. If these estimable folk had produced another \\"Smoochie\\", it would have been one thing. But they didn't even do that! Whatever else was true of Reiner's film it was never so plain & simply uninteresting and dull. The sad fact is, there's nothing really wrong with \\"Mad Money\\".

It appears to be a formed cushion with a raised back and a seat that has a formed butt imprint. What you get is a flat cushion where nothing is raised anywhere and there is no form or shape. It is totally opposite from what you think you are getting. I used it anyway to see if it made any difference or if it was magically going to form to my rear. Needless to say, that didn't happen.

I don't understand how the people below can recommend the movie, as it bore no resemblance to the book whatsoever.A taunt, exciting thriller that had me up late to finish it.

A quick review of current literature on 1 Corinthians will show that a number of scholarly articles take up the issues addressed in 1 Cor 5 and a number of monographs treat the chapter quite extensively.

He then proceeds to demonstrate his point with an astonishing and fascinating collection of evidence from the period. It is a perfectly wonderful read, particularly for readers who are tired of abstract theory. What makes this work so powerful is its focus on and attention to details, which make the theoretical points much more powerfully by fully contextualizing them. The evidence is what makes this work worthwhile--as well as a fun read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious, self-indulgent","review":"I had heard good things about the author's work before but had not read any myself. I came away disappointed. There are flashes of great insight at times and the author is obviously smart and well read. But after a while it becomes clear that convincing the reader of those two points is the author's main aim. The book makes readers embarrassed for not knowing the details of 18th century, obscure texts, and the author dismisses the work of other leading political theorists with one line throw away sentences. I forced myself to finish, but in the end, I agreed with Melbourne that the work is fundamentally tedious and self-indulgent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Erudite but unfocused","review":"Have to agree with the reviewer from Melbourne on this one. Herzog says in the introduction that he eschews any overarching methodology, laudable in theory I suppose but not very good in practice. The result is a rather meandering narrative that lacks the benefit of a clear central argument to structure it. Probably the main strength of the book is that it draws on a staggeringly broad set of texts. [To be fair, I have not read the entire book, so you can take my criticisms with a grain of salt I suppose, though I do think I have grasped the essentials of his text.]"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring Tedious","review":"This book has a promising subject, the creation of conservative politics in England. In promotional material the book has been described as explaining the sorts of ideas which were developed as a reaction to the pressure for democratic change in England as a result of the French Revolution. Such a book would have been interesting.This book rather than looking at the institutional structure of England and the response of its elite's is a mishmash of written material at the time. It rambles is unfocused and one wonders what is the point. The book is more a display of the author's knowledge rather than trying to look at the attitudes of the time and to see how they tied in with the structure of power. The book is very much an \\"academic treatment\\" in the worst possible use of that label."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"A pleasure to own, read and recommend.

Initially I was disappointed because even when I wrapped the cord around the hook on the bottom of the unit, it still sagged. It really takes a lot of strength to pull the line taut enough while you wrap it around the hook. My husband used his muscle to get it tight enough to work, but that sort of defeats the purpose of retractibility if I have to get my husband to set it up each time I want to use it. It worked well for a while, but this weekend I went to use it after its been out in the FL sun all summer and after I hung a half-load of wet laundry on it, the plastic loop that holds the end to a hook just snapped, perhaps from sun damage. We tied it to the hook so it will still work, but in retrospect, I would just spend a little more to get something more permanent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product for the money...no sagging issues","review":"I bought two of these and they're great. They're easy to install & remove because of the keyhole-shaped holes in the bracket...all I have to do is lift it off of the screws to take it off. I sometimes take one from outside and put it inside on some screws I leave in the wall so that I can dry clothes inside if it's raining...takes 2 seconds and doesn't require any tools.Some of the reviews I read mentioned sagging issues. I wrap the rope around the cleat at the bottom of the housing twice and haven't had any sagging problems at all. Wrap it around once, pull it tight, then pull some slack out of the unit itself to wrap it around a second time. Works great."},{"rating":"2","title":"outdoor clothesline-love it!","review":"Rec'd my outdoor clothesline just a few days after ordering it. I had a similar one that was worn out.

I have already bought something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get new hardware!","review":"I love my clothsline, its perfect for saving money on laundry in my small apartment. The only complaints that I have is that my clothesline came in this icky green color (I was thinking that it would be white)and that the hardware for the clothesline is not sturdy enough for even 1 load of clothes. The screws to attach the line to the wall (or whatever you are attaching it to) doesnt even make it through the dry wall. I had to trade these out for longer screws (the line ripped out of the wall while I was hanging a shirt on it...) It is a great line though and with the longer screws it holds much more weight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Impressed","review":"After I hung this up, I only put a couple items of clothing on the line before it started sagging. The line will not stay tight no matter what I try. I rated this item a 1 because it does me absolutely no good if I can't hang more than two or three t-shirts on it. Complete waste of my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shorter in length than description states","review":"Although the description from Amazon claims this product is 15 feet in length, it is actually only 13.8 ft (as per my measurements, and those stated on the box). Unfortunately, this was not long enough as our walls were exactly 15 feet apart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs Improvement","review":"It is very easy to install, and it retracts its clothesline easily. The problem is that it is very hard to make the clothesline tight so that your wet clothes would not drag on the ground. You do need to wrap the clothesline around the little arm on the unit in order to stop the clothesline from sagging. You have to wrap the clothesline around a little piece of plastic with one hand while trying to pull the clothesline real hard to make it as tight as possible with the other hand. I have not been successful with pulling my 40-feet clothesline tight enough so that a wet bathtowel does not touch the ground in the middle. The manufacturer needs to add some kind of a pulling devise to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good value","review":"I bought three of these, and they work very well: the lines roll out and retract easily, the casings are solid (and hinged to allow the line to swivel), and the hardware for attaching the casing to the wall is sturdy. I wish there were a little more tension in the line when it's not pulled out to its full length, but otherwise these are perfect. I'm using my electric dryer a lot less these days!"},{"rating":"2","title":"There's a trick to keeping the line taught.","review":"Great product. Another reviewer had mentioned that you need to pull the line out all the way to get it taught. Just be sure to wrap the line around the little \\"cleat\\"/knob on the bottom of the unit and it will stay plenty tight even if it's not pulled out all the way. Other comments -- it's well-made and unobtrusive when it's not in use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped working after a minimum number of uses","review":"This is called a retractable clothes line for a reason: Because it retracts. Or is supposed to. Its retractability was the big appeal for me, since I don't want to have a clothes line strung across my backyard except for when I need it. I used this clothes line 10 times or less, and then it stopped working. It suddenly stopped retracting one day, out of the blue. That amounts to about $1.50 per use, which isn't the end of the world. But why can't companies make good, durable products anymore? We waste so many natural resource manufacturing and shipping what amounts to lots of crap nowadays. Oh well, I can still use the clothes line, but instead of retracting the line I have to coil it up by hand and hang it over the unit that it's supposed to retract into. If you don't mind doing that yourself, buy away!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Large and in charge!","review":"Very sturdy and not at all \\"cheap\\" feeling, will definitely do a more than sufficient job as a clothes line!

Thought I would get another, but this one is terrible. I'm not sure if I got a faulty one, but there is no way to hang clothes without them lying on the ground. Each article of clothing I add makes the line sink lower and lower. Thought maybe there was a way to lock it in place (since it doesn't do it automatically) but can't find one. It's all loose and continues to give as clothes are added. Clearly not how clothesline are intended to work. Terrible, will be returning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good cheap line, but not perfect","review":"I bought this to use in my long narrow laundry room. It works well for me, but it does sag a good amount even over just 10 feet. It stretches out too much and it's hard to get it to bite the cleat to prevent it from coming out under pressure.

Somehow the hole in the plastic housing where the line comes out is quickly deformed by removing and retracting the line leading to a sharp groove this fraying the line more. After 6 months of very limited use the rope broke.

My small yard isn't big enough to have a permanent line, so this fits the bill.

They are all cheaply made, inferior products. The locking mechanisms don't work. The hooks are too weak and break. The inadequate, soft-cotton/poly lines coated with vinyl sag and need to be knotted again and again to restore a modicum of tautness, so that the retractable feature is rendered useless. I have the line extended a little more than 25 feet, but it is supported in the middle by a line attached to a large wooden beam. The support hasn't helped. There are materials available that would work better, but that would reduce the profit margin and the ever-on-going repeat sales. Tomorrow, I will install low-sag clothesline rope and sturdy eye bolts. Perhaps a retractable clothesline is a great idea, but the execution by every manufacturer (they all appear to be made by the same factory) is shamefully poor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plastic Junk","review":"This product is all made of cheap plastic and the bracket broke after using for less than 6 months.

I bought this because I have white porch columns and wanted something that would blend in.

So don't get the 20-foot version unless you love that color."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad locking mechanism","review":"This is a fairly well made and affordable laundry line. I'd be very pleased with it, but its line-locking mechanism is insufficient. It's designed so that you tuck the line around a little catch, but this friction hold is insufficient to suspend the weight of a normal laundry load. You put a pair of jeans on the line and the line slips and sags to the ground... every time. This design could be corrected if they were to add one or two more friction points to wrap the line around.I think I'll keep it and add some hooks myself to make up for what the product lacks. I'm hoping this will fix the problem.

The problem is easy enough to avoid, safety first and keep it away from kids."},{"rating":"1","title":"doesn't make thin enough slices","review":"As someone who cooks professionally, I can say that MAIN point of the mandoline is to get something that will slice paper thin slices - which this contraption, sadly, can't do.

This, I think, is overpriced and rather poor in execution, especially considering the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"works ok, but plastic stains","review":"This product works fine and is easy to use, but don't expect it to be of quality construction. The blades are sharp enough to do each task of slicing,including thin slices, but since it is white plastic, it stains easily with things like carrots or beets and won't come clean.

Sometimes hard to get the force going","review":"Love this. Fabulous for making thin cut french fries. Easy to use.A little difficult to clean but thats true of anything wiht sharp blades.The holder makes it safe so you don't cut yourself - but it also makes it impossible to cut the entirety of whatever you're cutting. (eg. about 1/4 of each potatoe I slice cannot be sliced due to the limitations of the holder).Also if you don't start with good force and have good momentum thick things like potatoes can occaisionally get stuck and be a little hard to push all the way down the blade.Overally very happy with my purchase.

It's a definite must-have in the kitchen but be careful...it is super sharp and will slice your finger through the bone if you use it without the guard and don't pay 100% attention to what you are doing!!! No kidding! By far the cheapest and most practical alternative to a professional stainless-steel mandoline. I am getting this professional set as a back-up. This is the best value on the market and I have tried using a few others only to come back to this one. In fact, I travel with it sometimes and slice apples etc in my hotel/billetting room.

I have since bought two more, I am afraid if it breaks I will not be able to find another.This shreds, dices and slices in two different thicknesses. I just shredded a whole cabbage and 6 carrots for sauerkraut and it was so easy and fast it is incredible. Clean up is a cinch, I use a kitchen brush to get between the blades.

Well on the positive side the unit is light weight and very comfortable to use. The grip cover makes for a nice non slip surface. Unfortunately that is the only positive I can find. From day one the grip was noisy when compressed. The noise comes from the metal rods rubbing against the plastic handles. I was willing to live with that. But with very light use, one of the metal legs failed due to fatigue. As an engineer I can tell you that that is a very poor design with a very short life cycle. At the end, I guess we get what we pay for and this was a very cheap grip strengthener."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap for a reason","review":"The plastic underneath the \\"grip\\" part on these grips is very cheap and broke a few weeks after use.

So I took two hands and closed it enough so that my one hand could grasp it, and then flexed it. After only a few flexes, my hand began to really hurt. Long story short, I developed trigger thumb from this, and had to have an injection in my thumb. My grip is worse, and I am having trouble even opening a bottle of water or turning the key in the ignition of our car. My husband's thumb is also hurting, but he hasn't had to have an injection.

Surprisingly it wasn't the plastic housing that failed but rather the metal spring inside. It snapped right at the top.It's too bad because up until the moment they broke I was pretty happy with these grips. They were a good size for my hands and offered a satisfying amount of resistance.Was I guilty of excessive use? You decide-at the end I was doing two or three sets of 50 with each hand per day. If you plan on using it less than that you may be satisfied with this product.

There is no possible way a sane human being can sit through this crashing bore of a DVD without falling asleep.

Too bad for you if you can't follow it--especially the Russian. Then the voice moves on to present and past conjugations of \\"to have\\" and \\"to be.\\" Again, tough luck if you aren't linguistically buff enough to keep up. There are no pictures. There are no conversations, no grammar explanations, no graphics, and no way to extend the lists of words and expressions into real-life situations. One hears nothing but that voice and sees nothing except that white-on-black print.Why put this blah-blah-blah on an expensive DVD? To get your money, that's why. Don't say you haven't been warned.

I got quickly turned off Real Fast by the addition of the new woman vocalist, just doesnt cut it, and looks very uncomfortable on stage...They would have been a million times better off having Craig Fuller fronting the band.

This title however, does that very thing! The lyrics are powerful and Biblical, and the music is top-notch. Each track addresses the church in a prophetic manner, reminiscent of the music of the late Keith Green.The track \\"Stained Glass Masquerade\\" is especially appropriate, challenging church members to pull down spiritual facades and to embrace one another's humanity.I'm thoroughly impressed -- Lifesong is definitely a must-have for any contemporary Christian music lover!"},{"rating":"2","title":"ahhh casting crowns","review":"I got lifesong after I heard a friend recommend the band to me. I liked it at first, but now that I have heard their first cd I like it even more.

Of course 'Praise You in the Storm' is the most popular song on this album and I love to hear it over and over again -- it never becomes old, and this CD offers one gem after another as each song is truly exceptional. I'm pretty convinced that most listeners of whatever background will enjoy this CD thoroughly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the Lifesong","review":"Mark Hall and group have done it again.

I purchased it for the song \\"Praise You in this Storm\\" too because I had a very rough summer and needed to be reminded daily that my storm would eventually end (and it did!) but God would never leave me. I read Justin from Alabama's comment and realized the Lord does give and take away as mentioned at funerals. To me, taking away means He takes back souls from earth to be with Him.

For those in Southern California, you will especially enjoy seeing all of the local orange County sites used as scenes for this film (including the late, great, Balboa Fun Zone).

Try his Cold Papaya, Mango and Cape Goosberry Bisque, it is so good and refreshing. With all the availablity of tropical fruits and good seafood to most regions of the country, this fare is ours now in our own homes.To date, the dishes are relatively easy to prepare, and sumptuous and so unique to consume. Outstanding is the Baked Whole Snapper with Coconut Milk and the Chicken Hekka, a standard Hawaiian party dish.For dessert the Pineapple Coconut Yum Yum was aptly named.

There are only a few photos of his dishes (and they're not next to the recipe, the few given are all in the center of the book). I like to know what a recipe should look like when it's done so I know I've done it right - this book seriously lacks in that department, something I find very important in a cookbook.

I return to this book time and time again during the course of my graduate studies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Applied, don't need a PhD to understand; lacks theory","review":"This book is very applied and the practitioner with little statistical knowledge will be able to benefit from it. It is easy to read and has many examples. I would say that it is written for MS level grad students. I find it very useful for examples of application.There is not much theory and if you are looking to see how the techniques are founded in first principles, this is not the book for you. If you just want to know how to do it and not concerned too much with underlying theory, you will enjoy this.This is a good overview of the techniques and what they can do.

The shrill sound that he makes whenever he messes up is unbearable, but he deserves to learn how to play without people complaining, so I got him this. It really did the trick.

Of course, in addition to lowering the volume, it does diminish the quality of the sound produced, but I suppose that is to be expected. I would say that it probably reduces the volume almost by half, but it sill seems a little loud. Overall I am pleased with the product and I would recommend it to any violinist, especially for anyone who lives in a dorm or an apartment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Luck of the draw whether it works or not","review":"Does not work at all. I spent over half an hour trying to get this mute into a position that it would actually mute, but no matter how I positioned it it never made an impact on the sound.Given that the reviews of this are pretty evenly split between \\"it works\\" and \\"it doesn't work\\" I knew I was taking a gamble with it. I'm not really upset, considering it was only 6$ after all, but for about 12$-ish you could still get a much better quality mute--and that's what I'd recommend you do."},{"rating":"2","title":"great mute","review":"This mute works well.

I live in an apartment so I hoped that it would cut way down on the noise which is does not. If the violin loudness was at 100 before the mute it is about a 90 with it. Still much too loud to practice in an apartment or hotel room. This mute is inexpensive which is great because it is a total waste. If you are looking to seriously mute your violin I would recommend purchasing a different mute. This one just does not work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyers remorse.","review":"I do not like this mute. There is very little reduction in volume.

This mute does work, to a degree. I mean, it doesn't completely mute the sound, but it does the job well enough so that when I'm sleeping in the next room, his playing doesn't wake me up. All in all, it is a good mute for the money you spend on it.

The mute does its job well. It cuts the sound by about half which is really great for playing later in the day or early on weekends. It does lower the quality of the sound a bit but nothing too really complain about. I'd definitely recommend this if you want a quieter practice session with the violin.

It has deep groves such that when placed over the top of the bridge, can sink down as far as needed. This allows for control of sound damping.

I contacted Brook Mays Music in reference to the mix-up but they didn't seem to mind that I received the incorrect mute, nor did anyone offer to exchange. While the mute that they sent doesn't mute the viola as I would like, I guess some muting is better than none when you need it.

However, it only covers two strings unlike the comb style mute so you'll need two of these to mute four strings.Muted sound reduces reverberation, which also reduces any harmonic and resonance qualities of the sound.

While this one doesn't sweep quite as wild as that, it does flange and has decent sound quality. IMO it sounds much better than the price. One concern that I have is that the unit is very compact and knobs are in harms way when feet are ready to pounce. Care is required here. Physical strength of jacks, switches and knobs do not appear to be nearly as sturdy as Boss, more like the Arion (jacks appear to be pcb mounted.) I would recomend this for someone who wants to try a flanger pedal (or as a backup) and is not inclined to tinker with the circuit as it appears to have few exchangeable components. (There are a couple of chipsets visible but they are very small and I wouldn't imagine being able to remove and replace them without doing PCB damage.)

I have three teeth that became grainy, sensitive, and discolored after using this product. I suspect the citric acid in the product is at fault.

I tried again the next day and hed the tablet in place for two minutes to see if it would adhere to the canker sore. It did, but the second i relaxed my mouth it would attach to my gums. I kept my inner mouth from touching my gums for a full 20 minutes by blowing air out of my mouth, to no avail. Perhaps it might stay attached to a canker sore positioned across from your teeth, but it simply can't resist your gums. THe result is that it sticks to your gums instead of your canker sore.

I left it for an hour or so, and it was about half-gel, but the pain was only increasing. I decided to try and take it off since it was too painful to sleep with, but despite being gentle and using warm water, removal was very painful and ripped the skin right off my lip. Now my sore is way worse and even larger than before, and bleeds at the slightest touch. I won't use these again! It's back to Kanka for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Actually made pain worse!","review":"Canker Covers are a great idea in theory but fall short in practice. Here's why:1. They're too thick. If applied between the lips and the gums, they cause the lips to snag, making it hard to talk or even smile. When wedged between the lips and gum, this thickness puts pressure on the sore.2. They're too dry. Even though they dissolve in time, it still feels like the interface between the canker and the cover is irritatingly dry. Ouch!3. Menthol is an unpleasant sensation. It seems to \\"perk up\\" my nerves, which is not a good thing in a wound. I want to numb them!While the covers rid of the periodic, radiating pain of the sores, for me they replaced it with something worse: a steadier, more intense pain.Because of these problems, I've not been able to test the manufacturer's claim that they speed healing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not work!","review":"I've tried these several times in the past and disliked them, but my dental hygienist suggested I try it again the next time I get a sore. BIG MISTAKE. I had two little ones on the inside of my bottom lip, right next to each other. I had been sucking on them all day, which makes them worse, so I thought perhaps this cover would help prevent it. I put one of these on, covering both, and went to bed.Well, imagine my surprise when I woke up the next morning AND MY LIP WAS SWOLLEN TO TWICE THE SIZE IT HAD BEEN THE NIGHT BEFORE. I *finally* managed to scrape the nasty thing off, thinking that it might have been why my lip looked so puffy, and as it turns out, it was only PART of the reason my lip was swollen. The two little sores look angrier (even redder) than they did yesterday and my lip is still puffy. I think I'd have to be DRUNK to try these again.Edited 9/10/12: I still have the same two sores on my lip, and they're both bigger. What a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful, awful, awful","review":"Bought these at Walgreens for twice the price sold here...not that I would have cared. Since they were for my daughter and she was afraid of them I decided to test them out before sticking one in her mouth. The thing felt like I had sealed an altoid mint to the inside of my mouth between my teeth and lower lip. The box said it would only burn for a few minutes but thirty minutes later it was still burning. It was also still a white disc. Fortunately, after an hour I was able to get the still burning like crazy disc out of my mouth. The other five hit the garbage before I managed to get the first one out of my mouth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"This was a huge waste of my money. I tried one without splitting it out but then it stuck to my teeth and not the sore. Then I tried to cut it in half and that came off very painfully when I tried to eat. So I read some of the reviews and people suggested to put it on at night. I tried that as well but with in a few hours I was basically eating it. My sore was in the front on the bottom so these might work for a sore in the back of the mouth. I don't get them often enough to make the money worth it and would not recommend them to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have a warning regarding nighttime use","review":"The packaging is a little misleading, it certainly didn't work as some sort of miracle cure for me (the box shows that once it's done dissolving, it's miraculously healed), after the first one it was still not even close to healed. I put a second one on the next day about an hour before bed (on my bottom lip, near the front of my mouth), woke up in the morning, opened my mouth and tore the entire thing open again (nothing like waking up to blood in my mouth), because overnight it had glued my mouth closed without me knowing. My lip was swollen afterward (as to be expected from that type of trauma) though the swelling's slowly going away. Anyway, I can't really recommend this product. Might be good for some people in some situations, but I think it might have made my canker worse than if I'd just let it heal itself and used mouthwash or something, and it should definitely have a warning regarding usage while sleeping (I certainly don't recommend it)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Got gyped","review":"The produce was slippery in the mouth and hard to keep in place.

My experience was that it does a good job to cover the canker so you could eat whatever you want. Now this also depends on where the canker is because the gel melts out and covers a large area. It would not really work if you have one on the gumline around the teeth. Mine was in the corner by my gums and it could hide back there. As far as healing it did nothing at all, the canker developed as usually and lasted the normal amount of time.

I had a canker sore on my lower gums beneath my teeth. The canker cover is in the shape of a pill that is too big to fit properly in this space. They really should come in different sizes.2. I got it in there as best I could and waited for it to dissolve. It did dissolve after some discomfort and worked effectively to block pain for a while. However, after 24 hours, it was still there and had turned into a disgusting gummy mess (the package says it will dissolve after 8-12 hours). I tried to swab some of the goop out with a q-tip and I think it disolved the skin on the inside of my lip because it TOOK THE SKIN WITH IT. So, not only do I have a canker sore on my gums, now the inside of my lip is raw and bleeding.3. The package says you should not try to remove it. Are you supposed to leave it there for eternity?? The stuff in my mouth was there for 24 hours between my lower gum and lip, so it wasn't getting washed away at all.AVOID this product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing ...","review":"For me, did not work as described. May be some transient/temporary pain relief (for an hour or two), but you have to balance that temporary respite against the additional discomfort you'll have in putting it on, and in trying to talk/eat, etc. for the 30-40 minutes after you put it on (when the patch is very bulky & awkward). Definitely does not heal ulcers (canker sores) any more quickly than they would heal on their own. If makers of over-the-counter products were held accountable for their claims (i.e., by the FDA, which unfortunately does not regulate OTC products), this claim would be shot down right away.

They do cover the sores, but the cover is big and bulky.And they do take the pain away, at least while the cover is on. But once the cover wears off (a couple of hours or so), the sore is right back where it was. It's my understanding that the Canker Cover product has a anesthetic in it that numbs the sore, but nothing that actually helps it heal. In any case, that was my experience with them. A couple of hours of pain relief, but the sore didn't actually heal any faster.On the other hand, I found extremely good results with the CankerMelts product, especially if I wore them overnight while I slept, so they had time to work.YMMV and maybe these do work for some, but they didn't do much for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really that great","review":"It's hard to get on especially if it's on your tongue.

I found this product and even though it does take about 30 minutes to dissolve, and it does stick to your teeth a bit at first, I was able to eat, drink, and talk without much difficulty. I wore it overnight and the sore was half the size in the morning. The product does not have any type of healing medicine on it but b/c the sore is protected from food/drink/and friction, it has time to heal. I recommend this product to anyone who has even the smallest sore! The only downside I have noticed is that after it sticks to your teeth for awhile (say during the night) you may have a strange feeling on your teeth...kind of like you ate too many sweet tarts or sour patch kids :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Looks fishy but works wonders","review":"I have had canker sores all my life, and frequent too, so i have been looking around for something that helps relieve pain and allow healing. and after hunting every pharmacy out there this is the brand I found and am now completely loyal to, it's a hassle to apply but onces it's on, it's done... I usually apply it right before I go to bed, and drink a cup of water, next morning it should all be gel'd up and now I just go on with my day...these patches usually only takes 1 per sore and it relieves pain, provides a long period of protection and it seems to quickens the healing... give it a shot if u suffer cankers like me and need some relief"},{"rating":"2","title":"It Works","review":"This works well. We use it for canker sores and the sores my daughter gets from playing her trumpet too much with braces ( ouch! )."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for soreson the tongue","review":"The first time I tried it, it worked really well. I had a sore on my inner lip and it gave a lot of relief. But I often get sores on my tongue too. It just doesnt stay put on the sore. In 5-10 min after applying, the patch comes off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snakeoil at its finest","review":"Completely worthless. Although the box boasts \\"Fast Treatment\\", the active ingredient is Menthol. That's it.Didn't do anything for the sore and made it look like I was incessantly dipping. Don't waste your money on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"How do you dry a salivating tounge?? Kind of difficult to use!!","review":"Well I read the great review and was eager to try using these Canker Covers. I rushed out on my 30 min lunch break to my local CVS and have so far gone through 4 of the 6 tablets that you get for $10.00 a package. If your canker sore is on the side of your tongue, (where a lot of us get them from biting) then forget about using it there. It was unfortunately a waste of money in my case because they stick much better to your finger than they do the inside of your moist mouth. Dry your mouth first?? How the heck do you do that while staring at yourself in the mirror drooling down the side of your face! No the easiest task to do. I'm sure they work well if the affected area was easier to reach. Unfortunately, my best hope is to rinse regularly with a solution of hydrogen peroxide and water. Basically, back to enduring cankers for 2 weeks at a time. Fun. I want my $10.00 back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Created more problems than it solved","review":"I purchased Canker Cover 3 months ago. I had a canker sore inside my lower lip, and it had been there for 4 days prior to treatment. I put the cover on the sore and followed the directions. After the patch dissolved (about 10 hours), the tooth that was opposite the sore became extremely sensitive. I could not eat anything hot, cold or sweet on that side of my mouth. It became so bad that I had to go to the dentist and have a special solution put on to ease the pain. This procedure worked for about 4 weeks and then I had to have it repeated again because the sensitivity came back. Though the pain is now more manageable, I still cannot eat certain foods on the affected side of my mouth. I have to use sensitive toothpaste both to brush and to treat the affected area. It has been quite a hassle and very painful. There is no way I would recommend this product. The tooth pain was unlike anything I had experienced before."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forms a tumor like lump in your mouth....","review":"This is a great idea in theory, a little patch to just cover the sore spot, but in reality these are just so thick that they don't work well in most parts of the mouth. It is very difficult to speak or act normally with a 1/16\\" patch adhered to the side of your tongue or inside of a lip. I find that they get knocked off by my teeth, and they make it look like I have a growth inside my mouth if I put it inside my bottom lip. They need to try to make them a bit thinner to be a five star rating. For the price, they just aren't worth it unless you have a very inconspicuous area and you aren't going to interacting with others while wearing them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Allergic reaction!!!!","review":"After using this product yesterday, my tongue is so swollen that I cannot close my mouth. I now have pain and swelling up in to my ear and down in to my neck. Do not use this product If you tend to have any type of sensitivity to adhesives."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Work","review":"This product doesn't work. It doesn't numb as well as other products. The tablets stick to everything except the sore even if you follow the instruction exactly. I tried several tabs and they ended up sticking partially, sticking to my teeth, sticking to my gums but not to the sore. Additionally, they appear to be too thick even if they did stick. Don't waste your time or money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap shirt!!!

The caulking comes out very smoothly with very little air to pop and ruin the bead. Polyurethane sealer has held up very well and still looking great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good and Bad","review":"I sealed cracks in my cedar siding with DAP polyurethane sealant and it holds up well but it has a major problem. The tube says its paintable so after a month of the sealant drying I started to paint. After priming and giving boards a finish coat, the sealant is causing a shading reaction in the paint. A year later I have primed again, with oil primer and another finish coat of acrylic latex. Only where there is Dap sealant underneath the paint does a shading difference show up again. It now seems after following all these attempts at fixing this problem the only idea I have is to replace the boards as this caulk really holds and trying to remove it will ruin rough texture finish on cedar. This Dap sealant is paintable but has altered noticeably the paint finsh enough to make it unacceptable. Going back to using acrylic sealants again where there were no paint finish problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shipper never shipped","review":"I can't review product since I NEVER got it.

I have had them for only a few months and have not used them very often. Neither of them work. On one of them the swivel piece broke, now the screen just hangs there. The other will not play a DVD without it freezing. I play the same DVDs on better made products and have no problems. To make matters worse Amazon and J&R music (the company they sent me these things) refuse to provide any help. Sure, the thing has a \\"limited warranty\\", which I've already used once because one of the batteries would not work. Using the warranty requires the consumer to spend additional money for shipping, just to receive another piece of junk. Both companies should have the decency to take back poor quality products and provide a refund. I will never buy anything from Amazon or J&R music again and recommend you do the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm a fan","review":"The fan is well constructed and has a vary large and strong mounting clip. The motor does make more noise than it should while spinning, but it's a small issue."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fan of the fan","review":"The Holmes HACP9 Oscillating Clip Fan is a nice unit. It's fairly quiet and seems well build, and the price is right for all it's features. The only slight I have against it is that I would have liked the high setting to have a little more kick. Overall, if you looking for a well built, small, oscillating fan, the HACP9 will most likely fit the bill."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke After 2 Months","review":"I put this fan in one spot and it worked nicley for about 2 months, but I was thinking about adjusting the angle. I grabbed the clip to remove the fan from the pole it was on, and the fan stopped working. Some wire must have popped loose inside because it just won't start again. For something like this to happen so soon after I got it, in the course of regular handling, says to me that this is a piece of junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped oscillating","review":"I used this fan about 12 hours per day for about 6 months before the oscillating mechanism broke."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the Air??","review":"If this fan is 2 inches from you it might keep you cool. Mechanically it works fine but even on high it puts out very little air. The clamp holds tight and could be a handy little fan. I bought it to use in my camper but see very little practical use."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good little fan.","review":"This little fan does just what I need it for. A bit of air blown right at me sometimes while sitting at my desk. It clips on very well. I even tried it on a 1/2 inch overhang and it stayed on. I would reccomend 3/4 inch if you want to use high setting and oscillation. That oscillation is of no account by the way as the fan just is not that powerful. My reason for no 5 stars is the vibration. There is too much especially on high speed. This could have been solved with more and better padding on the clip. It doesn't bother me but might others. The cord is coiled nicely to stay out of the way but has a good stretch. I needed to reverse the blow direction of the fan. This was easily accomplished by removing and replacing only one bolt.All in all very good for my uses. If you need just a bit of air in a tight space this one's for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not much to add : )","review":"Great fan for the price, all the previous reviews pretty much cover it, but I though I'd add that the \\"neck\\" is multi-segmented which makes it easy to get this fan to point/oscillate anywhere you want it regardless of what its clamped to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Osilllating Clip Fan","review":"It was bigger than I thought. The cord is long enough for me. The Clip is very sturdy and can grip a thick surface. The two speeds are handy. However, it has lighter output than expected. I like the adjustable angles it can make. I have no regrets buying this fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"A piece of JUNK!!! NO STARS!!","review":"The button on the fan that makes the fan head turn BROKE the same day I took it out of the box. The fan head will almost turn to the left but just before it is susppose to start back it gets stuck and makes a clicking noise. The fan's highest speed setting is not as high as I thought it would be, with the lowest speed setting I can barely feel it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work well","review":"The low speed stopped working a short while after I bought it--so it's either high speed or nothing. And then the side-to-side adjustment (if not in oscillating mode) gets stuck a lot and won't allow adjustment. This is just not a quality piece of merchandise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bulky and Unimpressive","review":"If you're looking for a fan which can really move some air, this is not your fan. My $9 6-inch fan from Walmart blows more air. Additionally, this thing is heavy for it's size and takes up a lot of room when considering how little air it moves. One of the very few good features is that it seems to be really sturdy and well built and not made from cheap materials. It's also quite versatile, you can turn and bend the fan to blow in just about any direction. But the negatives severely outweigh the positives so move on and look for another fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Holmes crap fan","review":"This fan was bought to use as a clip fan, however, one thing became clear upon using the fan... it sucks. When turned on, the fan did not spin. I took the cover off and turned it on again, after much spinning, the fan began to spin on it's own, but very slowly. It definitely won't move enough air to make a difference.DO NOT BUY ONE OF THESE FANS!!! YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor air movement","review":"The other reviews are correct,except they fail to mention that the fan does not move air.That is why it is so quite.I do suppose that I got 13 dollars worth of fan though.Think twice about purchasing this fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective","review":"Arrived defective,right out of the box.

And I, having not been alive during his rule, found it very boring. I have no idea about half the things they talk about in the book. That is why my opinion may be debatable as others may have more of a background concerning these events. This book was written before he was assassinated. \\"Portrait of a President\\" really outlines Kennedy and what he was like, every single detail.

I rate it low because such a simple device has only a few features, so a few problems means it's overall problematic.1) It has a very strong rubbery smell that gets on your hands2) As you work it in your hand, the rubber resistance piece works itself off - imperceptibly at first so it just seems that the resistance has softened - and finally slips all the way off - after say 20 or 30 quick repetitions. You have to keep pushing it back in place just to use it.It does have some advantages. Good, I think, for larger hands.

Fortunately power cycling the monitor fixed that problem.For all the laughter and fun I have had with this preposterous device, I strongly recommend not attaching it to any electronic device for which you have feelings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute garbage","review":"The above reviewers are right.

The vacuum has no suction wahtsoever. Very disappointed. Returning it shortly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spooky!","review":"I picked this up with trepidation. Finishing it, I laid it down with trepidation of a different nature. Don't read this by a full moon, nor alone in the house. Especially not in bed. You might hear a howling in the distance or a hoot owl in the woods and mistake it for a werewolf (even though you don't believe in werewolves) or some other night-stalking admirer come to claim your essence.\\"Rumors of Wolves\\" is a stunt that works, a bit of spooky legerdermain, provocative and succint.

Without spoiling it for you, by the end of the film, well, they're not all together anymore.....something happens to pretty much the whole world. Don't miss the earthquake scene and the funny yet tragic scene with the crazy Confederate guy with the gun!!! This is a really enjoyable film debut."},{"rating":"2","title":"Suspenseful and very fun!","review":"Nightfall fits into that small category of films that truly does surprise the viewer. It starts out looking like it's going down a fairly well-trodden path of the typical \\"monster-type movie\\" but where it takes you instead is nothing short of amazing. It is at once suspenseful and frightening, but carries real heart through the entire journey. I found myself actually leaning into the screen, worried about these characters and scared about what was happening to the world around them. The effects are realistic and scary (I got chills every time there was \\"electrical interference\\"...watch the movie and you'll KNOW what I mean) and the ending is both poignant and jaw-dropping. Nightfall is very, very entertaining and I'm glad I took a chance and bought it rather than just renting it....it's definitely one I'll be watching again! Though, maybe next time I'll leave the lights on......."},{"rating":"2","title":"What would I do without it?","review":"Because of this book, I became interested in the welfare of bats. Without it, I would not have known how to start, where to go, nor what to do. It was the springboard that launched me into a career as a bat rehabilitator. As an aside, I appreciate that the authors are confident enough in their abilities and experience to forego the use of language that could be understood only by those in the medical profession."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good quality and assortment of hooks","review":"The hooks are good quality and well coated with vinyl. There's a good assortment of hooks, and the price is really good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Country Music is Alive & Kickin'","review":"And Daryle Singletary knows it. He wants others to know it, too. That's why he sings this way. Although the disc is nearly all cover songs, they are presented here fresh and new. Daryle knows his roots and he celebrates them. Thank God he escaped from Gnashville's meat grinder, and thank God for Audium Records, who continue to bring us these great country artists who can't get anywhere with corporate-owned radio (who insist we really don't want to hear this kind of music) and Gnashville labels who want to dig up redneck roots and wipe themselves clean of any \\"hick\\" image. Most of all, thank God for artists like Daryle Singletary, who still sing this way. If you're hungry for real country and honky-tonk, help yourself to this album. You will love every second."},{"rating":"2","title":"CD Review","review":"I bought this CD for one song, \\"Kay\\", but am pleasantly surprised by the entire song list.

Too bad he does not have a recording contract right now."},{"rating":"2","title":"AT LAST - DARYLE SINGLETARY DOES IT.","review":"Daryle Singletary is a traditionalist country singer whose self titled debut showed great promise, but it and subsequent releases were dogged by mediocre material and the usual Nashville production.I caught him live in Albuquerque a couple of years ago, (after he'd parted company with Giant and was without a record deal) and concluded that the hard core country music I saw him play was what he needed to get on record. With \\"That's Why I Sing This Way\\" he's finally done it. It's a delight to hear Daryl again with quality songs, great musical backup with pedal steel & fiddle right up front - and a guest artist list that includes Dwight, Merle, George, Rhonda V. & Johnny P. This is one of the best Traditional Country releases I've heard this year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great pictures and very entertaining","review":"Jane Austen's World is a beautiful and highly entertaining book. It touches on various aspects of Georgian and Regency society and helps the reader understand Jane's world and her surroundings. I did notice a small error (typo?) on page 76, where one picture's caption announces that Louis XIV was executed and also that his queen was Marie Antoinette (this was Louis XVI, not Louis XIV). Other than that, a great book, worth getting for the pictures alone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helped me understand Jane Austen's novels better","review":"This is a really great book. I'm a fan of Jane Austen and have read all her novels but there were many things in them that I didn't understand because I didn't know the culture, customs and history of that time. Just one small example--Mr. Darcy hands his letter to Elizabeth Bennett instead of mailing it. Apparently unmarried men and women did not correspond with each other unless they were relatives or engaged to be married. Another example--balls and dances were a primary way for unmarried people to meet and socialize and one of the few ways they could talk alone to each other (while on the dance floor). So the balls/dances in Jane Austen's books are much more significant than I realized.I would highly recommend this book for anyone who wants to understand Jane Austen's novels better."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Eclectic Mix","review":"I can't say that I immediately rushed out to buy this album after watching the movie. I don't think the soundtrack is one of the best I've ever heard, and I have to admit that I was a tad disappointed that there wasn't more French music involved. Although, as the movie was set in Spain, it's understandable.However, once I bought this album, it quickly grew on me, and has since become one of my favorites. It's a great mix of songs for just about any activity; I especially like it for my road trips. I encourage everyone to buy this album, as it's an \\"auberge espagnole\\" in its own right."},{"rating":"2","title":"Takes Me Back","review":"The film takes me back to when I studied in Spain as an undergraduate student.

But the biggest drawback is the quality of the unit itself. First off, the magic flap idea is unique. But the first problem I had is that it wouldn't always flip open for use, but continue to play. Next, All of a sudden all it would do is play the disc, and never even eject. I was stuck listening to the same disc for a couple of days. Then it just quit working all together. When I contacted Aiwa, They informed me that I was just days past the end of my warranty. It would therfore cost me 99.00 to get it fixed. End of story.This unit is either going in the trash, or I am going to send back to the manufacturer so they can shove it where they may. I will never buy another product from this company. And I would advise anyone I know to do the same. If you ask me, they don't deserve anyone's money."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Outstanding Reminder","review":"It has been awhile since anyone reviewed this book.

The hinges are made of a flimsy, unstable composite material (It looks like sawdust and glue). I have had this safe for a couple of years. I keep it on the floor because it is too heavy to leave on a table. I just use it to store papers and open it only occasionally. Recently the top right hinge disintegrated for no known reason. The bars that act as a hinge for the top cover appear to made of some composite material. One of the bars recently turned into a powder in a normal household environment. I would have thought the hinge would have been made from a stronger material such as metal. I need to replace the safe and I definitely won't buy from Sentry again. I notified their customer service but they didn't respond with an explanation as to why they used this material."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lock stopped working","review":"I bought this a few months ago but haven't had the chance to use it until now so it sat in my office not being touched for a few months.Today is the day that I finally needed to use it and the keys were still in the lock so I go to press the button and it doesnt open. So I take the keys out and put it back in, turn it a few times... still nothing. Maybe I am not pressing the button hard enough! So I try until my fingers hurt then got a hammer to push against the button... No luck. So I get a screw driver and use the hammer and start pounding my way in... few minutes later the front part of the lock busted off and I saw the hook that stopped working, unlatched it and opened it up.One thing I learned a while ago, if you're going to invest in something, do it the right way and buy something with quality.

After about two years (after the warrantee has expired) the material the hinges are made of has turned to dust, and the safe is useless. Initially Sentry Safe refused to take any responsibility, after more persistence they have agreed that they would replace it. Still it's a big heavy thing to be throwing in a landfill after two years. There is a design problem where the plastic extrusion does not correctly cover the hinge area so the concrete inner material is uncovered and soon turns to dust. I would not recommend buying this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Faulty","review":"Hinky open/shut mechanism. It takes persistence to get the latch to click correctly and open.

Terribly disappointed that such a product would even be made or sold by a well known company like Sentry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hate this thing","review":"For me, this safe is nearly impossible to open. I usually have to ask someone to open it for me. To be able to push down hard on the top, and at the same time pull up on the latch, is completely impossible. I regret that I bought it and do not recommend this product. In addition to that, the inside space is limited and not much fits into it.

This security chest's inside storage area looks a LOT bigger on the box picture than it actually is! The unit is also way too heavy, with very thick walls, thus not allowing for much inside storage area at all. Surely, there must be a cost-effective fire-resistant material 'Sentry' could use here that is not nearly as thick and heavy as this one. The lock mechanism is also very cheap and flimsy.

But the very small print, the less than top quality production, and the story itself, in my opinion, make it third rate. I will carefully consider the reviews before trying another."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not sure if puzzle has an answer.","review":"While I've greatly enjoyed Nick Bantok's books, and this is no exception, I may be terribly dense, but I didn't find much meaning or solution to the puzzle. The illustrations are beautiful, and the story well designed, but I wonder if there is another level I have missed... A little help?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Forgettable","review":"At his best, Bantock's work carries a visual and narrative sense of the unseen, of mysterious forces guiding the visible characters. Those stories feature evocative artwork, in complex and layered imagery, often in ways that invite (or demand) direct involvement of the reader.Unfortunately, as in this case, the narrative mystery sometimes just turns to murk. Likewise, some of the artwork, including one image that seems central to the plot, becomes so dense and dark that it becomes nearly illegible. Given so many visual elements with most in such fragmentary condition, I found a paradox of too much and not enough information for its meaning to come clear. Not all of the book's art suffered that fate, though, and I wish that more of the book had been in the art and less in the text.I'll keep coming back to Bantock's work, because I liked his earlier work so much. I found this disappointing, however.-- wiredweird"},{"rating":"1","title":"A better tale of Bantock himself than a mere work of fiction","review":"I love Nick Bantock's work, and have for a few years now. I consider his works an inspiration for my own and I enjoyed this book as a means to discover how Bantock as an artist creates his pieces. As a story however, I felt it lacked the passion it set out to portray and seemed hurredly written.All Bantock collectors will buy this book, and most will treasure it, not for the forgetful story, but for the artwork and an insight into the artist himself.If you are looking for a great story however, I'm sad to say you should look elsewhere.Don't worry, I'll still be first in line to buy the next one."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Forgetting Room\\" by Nick Bantock","review":"This book is like a breath of fresh air!!! It has a magic in a very heart felt story and its intriguing surrealistic symbolism. Aesthetically it is quite outstanding and made even more so in the intimate format of the book. I am now very eager to visit the small Spanish town of Ronda! I am sorry that it has taken me so long to discover the books of Nick Bantock, which I might add I am now collecting. As an artist I particularly identify with the author's work and have purchased additional copies of \\"The Forgetting Room\\" to share with others. The perfect word to discribe this book is that it is a treasure in its total sum of aesthetic worth and the revelation of the story!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Blech.","review":"Thank goodness this was a library copy, or I'd have felt most cheated.The writing was clumsy, and strained at many instances. One can feel that Bantock is trying to be witty at times, but his 'set-ups' are so obvious it's paintful.The pacing was off. There's a big lag in the middle.The few pieces of 'art' seemed to have been thrown in because the whole story was so boring and self-indulgent.Rich in symbolism?

We put this in our bedroom so it has not been used much - maybe 12 hours in the past year. The other day when we turnedit on the picture was there for about 2 seconds then slid down the screen untill it was gone and all you could see was vertical lines - if yo uchange the channell the picture would come back for 2 seconds and do the same thing. I spent a lot of time holding for CS with polaroid and received nothing! Unfortunately we were just outside of the 1 year warranty but I thought maybe they woul dmake an exception since it was so close and pretty obvious that it was a xmas present because of the time of year but NO Luck!

The price there on it at that time was somewhere around $160, and for that price the set is well worth it. Mine came with no dead pixels on screen.Other people have said that the picture is real bad when using other hookups besides S-video(which is what I now use). I didn't find that to be true. When it was hooked up via composite cables, it had a better picture than my old cathode tube TV did with them. With S-video the picture is about on par with my LCD computer monitor.The only problem I have had with this TV set, is sometimes it doesn't recognize when you have a video cable plugged into it. I have to usually unplug the monitor, and then replug in the video cable to it after starting up. Doesn't have too often, but enough to take it down a star.Good TV overall if you can get for under $170."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy Picture","review":"If you are hooking this unit up by coaxial cable don't bother.

Cunliffe's dictionary provides, in a manageable sized volume, almost any form of any word you will encounter while reading Homer. Chances are, the very instance of the word you are looking up will be referred to in the entry, with its own specific meaning. Cunliffe is an inspiring guy, for his preface demonstrates that this massive endeavor was truly a labor of love for him, a lawyer by profession (apparently he did this in his spare time!). This volume, and a good commentary, is all one needs to be on the way to reading, and enjoying, Homer in the original (One other book I've found extremely helpful is Homeric Vocabularies, by Owen and Goodspeed). The binding is fairly sturdy, and has lasted quite a while for me. I've used the hardback, but I find it easier and faster to look up words in the paperback version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sine Qua Non for Homeric Studies","review":"We are forever in Richard J. Cunliffe's debt: he has provided us with a lexicon that gives immense assistance to those of us who study Homeric poetry. As some have already noted, Cunliffe's work is thorough and indispensable for engaging in the reading of Homer. The entries for Greek verbs contain the place where one can find instances of the word in the Homeric literature as well as the participial or infinitival forms of the Greek verbs. I have been completely satisfied with this Greek lexicon. The binding for my copy is also satisfactory."},{"rating":"2","title":"On What Grounds","review":"I picked up this book because coffee and mystery seemed such a great combo as I love them both.

Since the police seem to be under the impression this attack was just a workplace accident, Clare is determined to solve the case herself.I thought this was a great little mystery with a lot of good coffee tips as well.

And, you will know who the killer is as soon as you meet the character."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be a nonfiction coffee book","review":"I was very upset when this book turned into a nonfiction coffee book. It was supposed to be a mystery. The only mystery is why this is classifed as a mystery when over half the book is about coffee. I love her Haunted Bookstore books and had hoped these books would also be good."},{"rating":"1","title":"good heroine; 2 1/2 stars","review":"This is an average read; somewhat enjoyable and breezy. The main character is written well but I don't think that the mystery was fleshed out.Without going into specifics, the big revelation at the end seemed obvious. Also, the love triangle that is being developed is not one bit interesting. I doubt I will read any other books in this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent new series!","review":"This is an awesome debut novel! It actually made me want to try coffee again and I detest coffee! But I definitely have to have a cup of chai to read this book. The characters are wonderful and the plot intriguing! Definitely a series to savor!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A double shot that doesn't use bullets","review":"A nice mystery for fans of the rich dark brew. The plot is decent, the characters are interesting, and for an extra added bonus you get coffee lore and recipes. The only thing I didn't like was the editing - too many typos and misuses of words. Not to mention that the author apparently doesn't know that the rat-tat-ta-tat-tat knock on a door is called \\"Shave and a Haircut\\" - or maybe I'm just being snarky about it. With those minor exceptions, it's a good read and perfect to take on an airplane or off on vacation this summer. And oh yeah - I'm a sucker for puns, so the title had me from the get-go."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse than weak coffee","review":"What's worse than weak coffee? A weak plot and a weak main female character. I can't stand this main character who allows her philandering ex-husband to stay in her apartment. This woman is a 'victim' of her ex-mother-in-law's attempts to get the couple back together. While apparently upset that she 'has' to let her ex-husband stay with her, she is flirting with a married detective. Ugh. Add a pretentious attitude toward coffee-making and you have a thoroughly distasteful character.So is that the worst of it? No. The story is interrupted several times by instructions on making the so-called perfect cup of coffee. Is this supposed to be a coffee cookbook or a mystery? Including the recipes at the back of the book is one thing, but in the middle of the story?This story seems so poorly written I can't see how it ever made it to the publisher. Maybe it was self-published--that would explain a lot.Just like with bad $5 coffee, it doesn't live up to the hype. No more for me, thanks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely Beginning To a Charming Series","review":"I discovered Cleo Coyle late (Espresso Shot) and decided to go back to the beginning. I am so very glad that I did.No spoilers here but to see the characters then and now is really amazing. Clare is like an old friend who is fun and knows how to get in and out of trouble. Can't wait to read the next one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I like some other culinary mysteries, so I gave this a try. It was just OK. I made it all the way through the book, but I wouldn't read any of the others in the series, even though I already bought the next one before I started this one. As others mentioned, she talks too much about how to make different kinds of coffee. She also has a habit of insulting vegetarians and people who drink caffeine free coffee (I am both). The other thing that didn't appeal to me is the romance parts with her ex-husband, since he is described as a jerk and she already divorced him for that reason. It would be better if she dated the detective. Overall the book is slow moving and boring. I would not recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"I only made it to chapter 7...","review":"I really really tried to finish this book. I made it all the way to chapter 7 before I finally gave up and read the ending and threw the book aside. There is just too much coffee and not enough plot for me. I thought the main character was ok but not really in depth enough to keep me interested. I was looking for another series to get into while waiting on other book releases, however, I will have to keep on looking."},{"rating":"1","title":"not liking the protagonist...at all","review":"This is a hard one to write. On What Grounds is the book in the Coffehouse Mystery Series. The story was good as was the writing. I liked the supporting characters and even the heavy info on coffee was interesting if a bit over the top. Unfortunately, I just did no like the main character, Clare Cosi. She is over done, over reactive, and a bit shallow. All in all, Clare is a very unlikable character. I liked the disreputable ex-husband and meddling ex-mother-in-law, so much better than the main character."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice read.","review":"This book is a easy read, quirky but not simplistic. In addition to it being a nice mystery the additional information about coffee scattered throughout the book was interesting.This is a good start to what will hopefully be an enjoyable series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reading with Tequila","review":"Why read: I love both coffee and cozy mysteries.What impressed me: A great mystery. A great setting. I loved how coffee was incorporated in the story and more importantly, I loved Claire's relationships with the other characters. Between her ex-mother-in-law and her ex-husband, you really get to see some interesting sides to Claire and sets up for future possibilities.What disappointed me: This is another cozy mystery series that can't possibly provide realistic involvement of the main character in the long run.Recommended: If you love cozies and coffee, this book is definitely for you.Continue series: Yes. I can see the potential to become completely addicted to the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book I've read in a long time","review":"If you like endless descriptions of coffee making and unrealistic characthers, this book is for you. There is nothing about this I could relate to or recommend. You barely know anything about the victim, and the parts of the book that aren't going on endlessly about coffee seem to be filled with obscure descriptions of the type of watch or dress someone is wearing. The \\"star\\" of the book is thrown together with her ex-husband, someone whose company she does NOT seem to enjoy but she puts up with him anyway for some unknown reason."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't order anymore Coffeehouse Mysteries","review":"MY sister and I both read it. We got tired of reading about how to make coffee. I have read better mysteries!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacking a story","review":"A lot of scattered waffling and not much of the actual story. I almost deleted it after 2 chapters but was hoping for improvement...sadly it didn't get better and I wish I hadn't wasted my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"average","review":"stopped halfway though and moved onto something with more substance. i know its supposed to be a 'ight/cozy' mystery but the characters were flat, the dialogue ridiculous and the plot just plain boring.... shouldnt have invested in the second book before giving the first a try. guess ill just donate both to the local library..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too slow","review":"I know I am in the minority, but I did not care for this book and actually did not finish it. I wasn't crazy about the main character and found the relationship with her ex-husband contrived. I will be moving on to a different cozy mystery series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't even bring myself to finish it","review":"This book would have been so good if it weren't for the continous references to coffee. I know its a caffinated-themed mystery but GMAB - every single page talked about how to make the perfect cup or expresso, or the perfect mocha, or the perfect blend - WHATEVER. I just couldn't get through it.If this author wants to find a wider market then it needs to tone down (a lot) on the writer's coffee obsession. Boo hiss!"},{"rating":"2","title":"enjoyable","review":"\\"On What Grounds\\" wasn't a book I felt like I couldn't put down but I enjoyed it, it was a nice weekend read. I didn't find the coffee lore or coffee brewing minutiae annoying at all, though the recipes given aren't something to make at home. I'll give the next in the series a try, though I have a feeling the relationship with the ex-husband could get to be a bore (I find the \\"I can't stand him, I want him out of my life\\" followed quickly by \\"Ooooh he's so sexy, I can't control my desire for him\\" to be the most annoying story element EVER!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great new book...quick read...BUT...","review":"I sat and read this entire book in a few hours. The characters are well thought out and you really like them. Even the secondary characters like Tucker the Asst. Manager was great. BUT... like alot of the reviews before me stated, the endless references to expresso,coffee,java,latte..ect...gets really old. If it was only in reference to the liquid it would be one thing, but it was also in reference to her cat, the color of her hair,ext. For crying out loud, Clare and Matt even drank coffee flavored liquer.PLEASE!!!! Great story but learn to skim through the brewed babble."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, fun book","review":"What a great book to read. It was fun and humorous and easy to put yourself into the book. I love how the author teases you with suspenseful thoughts to tell you about later. Easy read and hard to put down. I look forward to reading the rest of the series. Definately knows her coffee!"},{"rating":"1","title":"On What Grounds","review":"The book was an easy read but not as well written as I like. It was fine for a beach read but not really suspensful enough to keep me reading with enthusiasm."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many wordy descriptions","review":"I really wanted to like this book but the author spent way too much time on coffee trivia. Also, I was annoyed that every time she mentioned Claire's apartment, it was \\"the duplex apartment\\"; the counter was always \\"the blue marble counter\\" and the plaque had hung \\"for over a hundred years\\". You get the point. The characters were not very believable and the plot got bogged down in unnecessary details."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less Gourmet Brew than Folgers","review":"For me this was a pretty standard blend of cute: good-looking independent woman becomes embroiled in puzzling murder, with the hook of having coffee tips interspersed between clues. I've read the same formula with both bakers and caterers, so far.The characters were likable, but not extremely interesting. Ditto for the locale and the mystery itself. A good way to pass a couple of hours and the writing was pleasant, but the book itself was pretty forgettable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Coffee - ad nauseum","review":"Well written with all the obvious plot twists - attractive, fit, buxom, divorcee meets single man - she still has contact with the ex husband with all that entails. The main complaint with this book: every time lead character makes any type of coffee - she goes on and on and on and on and on AND ON about how the coffee should be made. EVERYTIME!!!Can only read the proper way to make coffee so many times - it interferes with the mystery. If not for that would buy rest of series. Recipes are interesting enough to want to make."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does the heroine really solve anything???(possible spoilers)","review":"After a painfully slow start.. I suppose this might be expected seeing this was the first of a series.. can only hope the follow up adventures dont suffer from this... our hero essentially accuses every potential suspect of the crime only to have the real crimial basically fall in her lap.. the only real detection skills she seems to possess is reading coffee stains on peoples shirt.. anyway if you like your coffee you can learn something... but if you want a real mystery... look elsewhere..."},{"rating":"2","title":"thorough instructions, worked right away","review":"I NEVER WRITE REVIEWS!

I even tried wiring them both ways.On the issue of sensors working in direct sun, I bought new chamberlain sensors and they work just fine, just like the originals did 7 years ago.

This book provides the right balance of reference material and tutorial material. It serves well for wanting a quick answer and equally as well as a general OOP guide specific to VB.NET. I particularly like the 'best practice' feel of this book. .NET as a whole is quite daunting for VB6 developers; we almost have too many options now available. Learning VB.NET from a VB6 background can be confusing because it's difficult to know where to use all of these new techniques now available. This book goes a very long way to showing us how to write VB.NET classes in a pragmatic way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth the price","review":"This is one of the better Wrox Handbooks and I really liked it. This isn't exactly a guide beginners guide on class design, nor is it an experts book..but it does one thing very well, if you are new to VB.NET or .NET and you know what you want your classes to do, this book will show you how to accomplish it. Moreover, there are some good examples and it can get you thinking in different directions.They were a little skimpy on issues like using Properties vs. Public Variables (and if you move to .NET, you will have to fight VB6 programmers clinging on to bad habits of the past), but overall, I think the book does a great job at what it advertises itself to be.Also, the discussion on Delegates and event handling was particularly helpful if that's your interest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading title for the content","review":"Silly, naive me. I purchased a book with the title \\"Visual Basic .NET Class Design Handbook\\" in order to learn more about effective class design, and particularly the expectations of previous Wrox books having wonderful practical examples. But you know you've made a mistake when you receive your book and on page 2 read \\"This isn't a book about object-oriented analysis and design.\\" It seems as though someone asked the authors \\"What time is it?\\" and they wrote a book on how to build a watch and the space/time continuum. I found the single chapter devoted to classes in Sybex's Visual Basic .NET Programming far more valuable than this book. Perhaps it's one of the cases where the title just does not match the intended content -- I'm willing to give the benefit of the doubt and give two stars instead of one. But I'd also hesitate to ask the authors for directions to the restroom, afraid that I would receive a lecture on the digestive process and the history of plumbing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good.","review":"This book is pretty good. It could use a little more 'big picture' information. It does a very good job of differentiating protected, sealed, shared... class modifiers and how they work on a technical level, but not necisarially why you would do it.I think the book has a good bit of value for somebody who is going to architect a small system or build classes. I think this book combined with the sam's \\"the object oriented thought process\\" book are a very good match to introduce intelligent people to modern class construction and use. The book really isn't for slow learners. If you need 'for dummies' books, stay away from this one. If you have a reasonable IQ, then its a very concise lesson without much garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating","review":"This book is packed with typos. The author often talks in circles making an unpleasant reading experience.

After creation, the constructor cannot be called and is not in the object's declaration space. The constructor is a special member that is only callable during object creation.

I just got a copy of Black Cocktail which I had never read and was again blown away by his imagination and story-telling ability. He gets this idea from Plato -- that all humans originally were joined to another being and spend the rest of their lives looking for their other half (also Plato's explanation for sexual preference as those that started as two men obviously look for the male half). Only Carroll makes it the perfect 5 (i.e. everyone used to be 5 people connected) and has his usual interesting and quirky characters trying to reunite.

The darned FBI warning and a cute Panda bear can't be fast forwarded through so you are left to do warmups waiting, with the clicker in your hand. A new production would be very welcome as he obviously knows his stuff, but we want to follow and imitate, not just watch!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to learn from this DVD","review":"This was the very first Tai Chi form I learned. It is not difficult to follow the DVD and the teaching is clear. This is good for anyone who is just beginning tai chi. The Yang 108 Form DVD is also great also. One of the best teachers you can learn from is Dr. Paul Lam. He breaks each move down into smaller segments so it is even easier to learn a form. That way of teaching can be used with any tai chi form."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good video","review":"I enjoy this Tai Chi video very much. I found that the instruction includes more movements than in my live instruction, but it was very helpful in learning how to do each movement correctly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best At-Home Tai Chi Instruction","review":"Terry Dunn's Short and Long Form Videos are excellent. Although there may be some variance from traditional Yang-family form, they provide an excellent foundation to learning the basics. With more independent study, these basics can be then refined and deeper insight attained. Very good value for quality Tai Chi instruction in warm-up exercise, form and flow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor production quality","review":"The video is fairly useful. However, Terry Dunn frequently mixes up left and right in his oral description of what to do. This means you can never rely on what he's saying and have to keep looking at the video (which can be inconvenient for several of the positions). This compounds the problem of having to do the \\"opposite\\" of what you're looking at. The scences where he says \\"left\\" where he should have said \\"right\\" should have been redone. The more times you play the tape the more the left/right problem gets annoying!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Complete, simple to understand, with excellent instruction","review":"The best thing for me was how simple Terence Dunn made it to learn from this video. I never felt rushed, pushed along, or left behind.This video offers the full short form, the instructor taking you slowly and thoroughly through the Yang short form in a way that can be easily followed and learned if you are a beginner.The philosophy and breathing techniques are given, to make a well rounded whole. The stances are taught in a logical easy to understand and learn manner. There is also a full viewing of the Yang short form demonstrated which shows you how it should be done, and the lovliness and grace that can be attained with practice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thumbs down","review":"Seeing that someone had rated this five stars, I took a chance on the Amazon \\"opened video cannot be returned\\" policy and bought this. I really regret it!From a video quality perspective this video is high schoolish. The nauseatingly pink background that takes up a solid 1 hour of this video. The titles convinced me that this seventeen dollar video was not worth it.The Tai Chi presentation is 60 minutes long without a break in the pink background, and without titles of names of movements such as \\"Single Whip\\" etc. Thus, it is very difficult to stop the tape and learn a movement in the middle of the 8 minute Form by skipping through in fast-forward.The exercise sessions seemed worth going through, but all in all, if Amazon didn't have a \\"opened videos cannot be returned\\" policy, this video wouldn't be taking up space in my video collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Potential lost","review":"Excellant choice of trials, but writers extreme political bias reflected in description of trials and did not provide a clear view."},{"rating":"2","title":"hematology and oncology secrets","review":"As a physician assistant working in a medical hematology/oncology practice, I find this book to be invaluable. It explains the pathophysiology of the diseases at a level down from the oncologist, yet detailed enough to be educational. It is also good for quick reading. However, it is now 6 years old and with all the advancements in cancer treatment, needs to be updated. I am waiting for a new edition, yet it doesn't appear as if one is forthcoming. Therefore it is good for the basics, but as many treatments have changed and improved, it may be best to wait until the next edition, if there is one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not her best album, but worthy.","review":"This album is different from her other salsa efforts in that this album focuses on commercial sasla instead a more tradition salsa found on her previous efforts.

Other highlights are \\"Love On a Two Way Street\\" (originally recorded by Stacy Lattisaw), both the English and Spanish versions of the title track \\"Temptation\\" among others. Her voice is sweet and pleasant throughout. This album is flawed, however it is worthy."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Brenda's Best!","review":"I recommend this salsa cd to all Brenda K.Starr fans.

From what I could watch it seemed like an OK movie.I ordered this back in November and just got around to watching it today. I took the plastic wrap off and put it in the DVD player. The movie was fine until the second episode, when the disc began to malfunction. I took it out and checked to see if there was a scratch or something. Nothing, no scratches, no dust. I put it back in and it continued to skip around and freeze and renders roughly 20 mins unwatchable. (I might add that these are 20 mins of extremely important plot points!!)So I figure no big deal, I'll just return it and get a new one.

A friend had a foreign player, though so we were able to watch it that way. The story is a little weak. You spend a lot of time thinking that people are simply not dim or gullible enough to believe a complete stranger over someone they've known for years. Very similar to Lifetime movies.

Also the other songs included on this production, are not well known from this band Eruption.Therefore I would recommend to the record company to include original hits on the compilations albums , and not just add a remix or re- edit versions, as this kind of marketing is misleading the people who genuinely follow a band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comparing American Hearing Culture with Deaf Culture","review":"In order to understand deaf culture, you need to understand what is standard American culture and then see how it contrasts with deaf culture. Anna Mindess does an excellent job of comparing and contrasting these cultures, with references to cultures from all over the world. She includes insights from respected Deaf members. This is an easy read, not a difficult textbook. I read this with many lightbulbs going \\"aha\\". She delves into values, presentation styles, and politeness in both worlds. She provides scenarios with cross cultural perspectives in the doctors' office and the job interview.

This was a truly groundbreaking film in 1951, tackling the evils of the KKK, with strong performances from Ginger Rogers, Doris Day and Steve Cochran. Ronald Reagan is wooden as usual, and the role certainly should have been given to a stronger actor. Despite Reagan, this is an absorbing and compelling film that deserves rediscovery."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ginger and Steve create some heat","review":"This film began with a noir edge, that lost ground with the appearance of Ronald Reagan, playing his usual taciturn self. It was Ginger Rogers and Steve Cochran that kept my attention and interest, as they flashed anger combined with an undercurrent of lust at each other. Doris Day, in a non singing role was fine as the younger sister and wife. But things really only sparked when Steve and Ginger were on the screen. Steve, as a none too bright young husband and Klan member, lived up to Ginger's words in her bio re \\"Storm Center\\". \\"When I iirst heard Steve Cochran read his part, \\"I knew he would steal the film from the rest of us.\\" According to Louella Parsons, they carried the sizzle over into their private lives.I gave it a 4 for being so graphic and tackling the KKK issue for that time period."},{"rating":"1","title":"story about racism","review":"nonsense story. expected better from a reagon film.

What I have got was a production (1997) with shallow entertainment not even amusing or funny, created loveless.Although the original movie exists in a restored version I don't understand why it is not yet released on DVD in place of that nonsense of 1997. Therefore I share the same opinion with the reviewer who said: \\"buy That Darn Cat (VHS) in place of That Darn Cat (DVD)\\"!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful!","review":"This is one remake that shouldn't have been made! The only thing it has in common with the original is that a cat came home wearing a wristwatch on his neck, everything else is a totally new story that doesn't make any sense. It appears that the current producers disliked the original plot so they added a bunch of silly subplots just to fill space. The lady butcher in love with a security guard leaving packages of meat on his doorstep, the \\"bloody twig\\" clue which turned out to be a maraschino cherry stem, the person who hasn't left their apartment for years, etc. were all distracting elements that nobody would have missed had they been left out.My sons hadn't seen the original yet, and they thought this movie was stupid.

Unfortunately, my expectations were disappointed.Not only does Go Quest Young Man prominently feature the series' least effective and most unpopular character (the ratings fall for episodes featuring him, which should have told someone something) but its most powerful draw, the friendship between the two leading characters, is virtually ignored.In fact the novel seems designed to be as unappealing to dyed-in-the-wool Xenites as possible. The wretched Joxer's name appears virtually everywhere, while Xena and Gabrielle are kept apart for all but 28 pages - and Gabrielle is presented for much of the time as a bitchy brat with pms!I hope the next book shows a closer acquaintance with the series and some appreciation of its true strengths.

At least in this book, Argo has returned to her natural state as a mare. But Ru, if you read this, the word is CHAKRAM, not chakrum.

Unfortunately it lacked the fun and silliness that runs throughout the series. Although I do like the way Homer was in diapers at the start of the Trojan war. Really.I had hoped that books based on the series would get better with time (like they did with Star Trek) but there were only a few and now the series has ended. Oh, well.

He's just in there for Xena to deliver a message to? In the future don't waste such valuable characters in a book like that. After reading this first book in the trilogy, I'm not anxiously awaiting the next book in the series. Maybe I'm being a little too hard on this book because Ru is setting up the storyline in this first book (I hope so).

I could barely put this book down. Emecheta rights in an engaging style that gets the reader wrapped up in the lives of the characters. I found myself cheering on Adaku, hating Oshia and wanting Nnu Ego to break free from the patriarchal system.This is not the kind of book you read to see how it ends since you know from the beginning it will end in sadness. You read this book only to know the characters and their plight. It even gives you a look at how _men_ are victims of the patriarchal system as well. I fully recommend Joys of Motherhood to anyone who enjoys fully engaging characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"sucrose = sugar","review":"How is this product sugar free when the first inactive ingredient listed is sucrose?

I now own every Zebrahead CD I'd have to say that this is the worst Zebrahead CD of them all.

Unfortunately, the focus is mostly on the stories behind the playing and not the actual piano playing itself. I did not find the stories that spectacular. For instance, we see people getting on planes, saying how much they wan to really win, seeing their houses and dogs (!) et al.Most of the clips of the pieces played are only 10-30 seconds and the pieces are often not identified clearly. Just when you see their musical talent emerging, were off packing the bags!

I've read that the power cords on other heaters become hot - the power cord on this one has remained cool. I have turned down the heat in the house and use this to warm the room I am in.

It was cheap enough that its relatively short life was not an issue.So, I bought this unit. Its brightness is no longer an issue, I can watch TV with it sitting in front of me and not even be aware of it.

However I paired it with a WIN100 Heating & Cooling Programmable Outlet Thermostat, and the combination is much more precise and controllable than any built-in thermostat would be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does the job","review":"After much research I settled on this heater for many reasons. I liked the environmental aspects of it, the size, and the heating options. I use it in my small private yoga studio and it only takes a minute or two to heat the entire room and is very quiet. It also runs clean and heats without that \\"electrical scent\\" that some small heaters have. Four stars instead of five because it is really hard to know what setting the control nob is at.

We live in Northen Calfornia, we have mild winters, but the temperature is often in the 30s and damp. We'd rather not use the forced air heater to heat the entire house since she's primarily in her office all day. This unit sits next to her desk and gives off radient heat, kind of like sitting next to a fireplace. It has performed perfectly for the past four months, quickly producing comforting warmth, silently. It uses significantly less power than fan-based heating coil heaters, and is much quicker than the oil-filled radiator electric heaters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quit after 4 months","review":"I bought this heater new on November 7, 2011. While it does not heat the whole room, it warms if placed 4-5 feet from your work space. It ran approximately 4-5 hours per day. However, it quit working March 7, 2012, 4 months to the day I purchased it. Taking into account the shipping time, it worked less than that. Before purchasing, I researched several space heaters. I decided on an infrared rather than one with a fan because the fan on my last \\"milkhouse\\" type space heater quit suddenly, and the heater casing heated so fast it nearly burned my fingers when I tried to turn the setting to \\"OFF.\\" The experience was a good reminder never to leave a space heater unattended.This Optimus H-5210 heater cost $28.00, so while not a terrible loss, I can't recommend it. The previous space heater was the least expensive brand I bought at Wal-mart in 2004 and lasted 7 years.The one positive thing I can say about the Optimus H-5210? It did not start a fire."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass this one up","review":"I'd decided to purchase this heater because of it's small size, I only needed it to heat up my office. The package was shipped within 48 hours of purchasing it. It came with a simple two page manual; only needed to unwrap and plug it in. When I plugged in the device, a small amount of heat irradiated from it but there was a horrible smell of smoke. I quickly unplugged the device, waited about 5 minutes and plugged it up again; the result was the same. There was no light from the heater. I decided to return it, I'd rather be safe than sorry. My suggestion would be to pass this one up-- you get what you pay for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quiet and Warm","review":"I put this under my desk to warm my legs and feet while I do work on my computer. I like that it's more like an intense sun lamp than a heater that blows out hot air. It has two settings: 400W and 800W. I use it at the 400W setting with the heater about a foot/foot and a half away from my legs and that works out pretty well for me. If you use it at the 800W setting, it's probably best to put it about 2-3 feet away from you. Be careful not to put it in a narrow space because it can get pretty warm and you don't want to heat up your furniture. I have a table for a desk so there isn't much furniture/wood/plastic that it can heat up and destroy if I put the heater underneath."},{"rating":"2","title":"good","review":"Good qualityI bought is 1 year ago.

I bought this unit because it had a good star rating. I did see MANY reviewers complain how easily this unit breaks, but I thought I take a chance, since the price was not bad. I bought it about 6 weeks ago when the weather was not cold yet. Now, when I started to use it, it broke on me on the third day of use. The first two days, I only used it for 2-3 hours. On the third day, it gave a burning smell after a few hours of use and then stopped working completely. The unit was handled carefully and never had any damage to it. Since it was bought more than 30 days ago, I cannot return it to the store (Amazon). Warranty repair requires that I pay for return shipping and another $15 shipping/handling fee.

This is not only one of the less expensive ones, but is actually better than more expensive ones (like the one that looks like a fan because it uses a fancy dish to focus the heat). The power consumption is low enough that you may be able to use 2 on the same circuit, and on the low setting that only lights up one of the two rods, you could easily put 3 on the same circuit. Since it only heats you on one side, you will probably want to use 2 or 3 at a time, or combine it with another type of heater.This product works well when used together with a ceramic heater in larger rooms. The ceramic heater will raise the air into the 60's, and this will let you feel like it's 75 or warmer depending on how close you get to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"quiet, effective heat; lousy dial","review":"I use this when I have a chill in the evening, but don't want to turn up the heat for the whole house.

Testing can be done with the unit UNPLUGGED, using a 'continuity' tester or a DIY tester using the wire in question connecting a flashlight battery to its light bulb, taping the wires in place. The repair required a single conductor wire with standard insulation coating. Make sure the amp rating is for 15 amps or better. The wire can be spliced on or soldered.

Warms small room.Note that when used in night, it also acts as a night light since it will light the room.The control dial is awkward. It has two \\"OFF\\" positions in the full circle. From one \\"OFF\\" position, no matter which direction you turn, you will get to the \\"800W\\" mode. And from the other \\"OFF\\" position, no matter which direction you turn, you will get to the \\"400W\\" mode. This design has two problems:- If you switch between 400W and 800W from time to time, you will have to look at the dial to determine how many clicks you need to turn to get to the mode you want. And in night, you'll have to wait till it lights up to see which mode you turn it to.- If you are at the OFF position next to 400W, and want to turn to 800W, you'll have to turn two clicks away to pass the 400W.

This is probably the most compact quartz heater available and it is very easy to use. There are just two settings low (400 watts) and high (800 watts). Unlike other heaters that heat the air, quartz heaters heat objects and people directly. So, it feels like more heat for less energy. That makes this heater ideal for an open area that would be hard and expensive to heat with those other types of heaters.Also, this heater is very quiet; but you can easily see that it is on from the soothing orange glow it emits."},{"rating":"1","title":"useless","review":"I don't understand why this unit has so many good reviews.

They seemed cheap and great, and the only obvious problem was you have no idea what the settings on the dial do. They just say 400, 800 alternating all the way around, and switching it will make one or two come on...i don't know. My main problem is they dont have a reset switch or anything on them, but they will just shut off, i guess because they are too hot? They wont come back on when they are cooled off. They just randomly seem to start working again. I tried everything to make them come back on, unplugging, letting them sit, flipping the dials around...etc. Eventually one of them would ONLY work when i had 1 element lit up. Very frustrating to the point it was useless. Which is a shame because it definitely can heat a bedroom when its actually on and working with both elements."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quiet with pretty good heat but POOR DESIGN","review":"I'm returning this heater because it is so poorly designed it drives me crazy -- the round knob has off plus 2 settings, and then just repeats the same settings on the other side of the knob... so you just keep turning and turning the knob. Have you ever in your LIFE seen a machine with a dial that says Off Low High Off Low High? It is insane. And it's on the side, so you literally have to lift the heater up and bring it up to your face in order to see if you're turning it on or off... Normally you'd just turn it all the way right or left to turn on/off, but since it's a never ending dial you have to look at it. Bizarre."},{"rating":"1","title":"quiet, but lacks basic safety features","review":"I purchased this heater because it received such high reviews from other Amazon customers. It is definitely quiet (virtually silent), and produces am amazing amount of heat. But the absence of a fan means that most of the heat stays in the immediate area, and that area (usually near me) gets too hot for comfort. There is no thermostat, so the heater just keeps blasting away until it's manually turned off. And the front of the unit gets very hot, so hot that I won't leave it on unless I'm in the room. It does have a cut-off switch on the bottom in case the unit gets tipped over, but no safety mechanism in case something (like a blanket) falls on it.

I tested it originally and it worked fine, but I did not leave on for very long - my bad. Now I find that it will stay on between 15-60 minutes and than turn off. It is not the wall plug, fuses or temp level as I have my older heater that is another brand but the same levels and I have to remove it from another room and bring into mine and it does not turn off, throw the fuses, etc. Since the return policy has run out I am stuck.

Furthermore, the SIX dial markings are \\"800W OFF 800W 400W OFF 400W\\" in that order. So, the OFFs are across from each other, but each 800 is across from a 400 and vice versa. It makes no sense.

The bag also provides a protective container to keep the scope in at home. I wish the bag had some pockets for storing eyepieces, the finder scope and various tools, red flashlight, etc. I solved that problem by purchasing some inexpensive all-purpose zipper bags from the stationary department of a local superstore ($2.97ea). I bought bright colors so they would be easier to see in the dark. Overall, I am pleased with the purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"We play it a lot","review":"My family purchased this game because we are Sesame Street fans and play a lot of games together. Granted, the board is just a simple path to follow, but we play again and again (with kids ages 2-6). Reading is necessary. You are basically paying for the question cards as in many trivia games. To prevent long runs we limit all players to 2 questions per turn, because sometimes we just know too many answers. We even played this successfully at a larger Thanksgiving family gathering with mostly adults (also SS fans and game players) and had a blast. What more can I say--great if it matches your family."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ever wonder how they took care of babies back then?","review":"Caroline's Promise is filled with details from day to day life in the 1800s.

I recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too gory","review":"I'm a fan of Mack Bolan, but this one was just gross.

They are not. They are not the old red-dot style, these have a cheap hinge clamp and best of all, mine did not include ANY CABLE STOPS AT ALL. These levers are of no use at all unless I go out and buy more hardware to make them work. Very disappointed.

Amazon gets an F on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT THE ITEM PICTURED!","review":"These are the not the pictured item. These are by all accounts the Dia-Compe 133, the bottom of the barrel in their city lever line. They are not the \\"Red Dot\\" style with band clamps which are pictured. They do not even fall into Dia-Compe's TOURING line!I didn't even think to check the reviews, who the hell gives 3 and 4 stars for not getting the product they ordered!!The hinge style clamps are cheap looking, and the new DIA-COMPE stamping on the smaller body make these almost look like even cheaper steel levers. The new design is just not worthy of being purchased. They lost the vintage-y feel and downgraded the mounting style. Add to this that they just raised the price, and the \\"Velo Orange City Levers\\" ASIN: B004JKIPYA are a MUCH better deal at this price point."},{"rating":"2","title":"My daughter loved it.","review":"My daughter loved this outfit.

Set on the highest speed it starts lifting pictures on the wall (room size is 21'x12'). I wish, it blows less air on low speed. I don't think I will ever use the higher speed on this fan. With this higher velocity on low speed the fan is also pretty noisy. Not the motor, but blades and air movement. Otherwise, the fan is OK."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Fan, So Quiet!","review":"This really is a great fan. My biggest concern when purchasing this fan was its noise level because I bought it to be in my baby's room. The air gets so stagnant in there that we needed a fan to keep the air moving. This fan did not disappoint. Its so quiet!! When its on the lowest setting, the air moves great and you can barely hear it. I would definitely recommend this fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"100% crap","review":"Almost all plastic, including the back grill behind the fan (the front is metal wire).Fan blades are plastic and not balanced, so the whole thing shakes as it spins.

No way could you consider this quiet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fan cool as ice, quiet as breeze, breath of fresh air","review":"Excellent quality and function, even more so in view of reasonable price. Light enough to easily carry but weight and design such that it seems solidly anchored to ground. Design unobtrusive, thought was given to footprint and profile, aesthetics were given due consideration. Virtually silent at low speed; higher speeds not used. Good height, simple, effective control.

The only thing that I didn't like about it was that the picture was a little mis-leading. I thought that the links between the hearts had diamonds all along the band, not just a little one in the middle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality Equals Unhappy Consumer","review":"I was very disappointed the first time they sent me this product because the quality of the diamonds was horrible. Most of the diamonds had huge scratches in them, and a couple of them were completely crushed. Although nothing was wrong with the sterling silver hearts and the piece was heavy, I had to send it back for a replacement because of the diamonds. The piece they sent me as a replacement was much better, but many of the diamonds had noticable scratches on them. I will never purchase anything from them again because I believe their diamonds would be low quality like the jewelry they sent me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not real silver","review":"I bought this product and when it arrived it looked different to all my sterling silver bracelets, I would be very surprised if its real silver.

I emailed the company and never recieved a response back. I ended up returning the item, I just hope I do not have issues with them returning my money.Not only that but the delivery of the product took forever. I got it a few days before Christmas.

I didn't appreciate the inside scoop on officer Atwood's wildly running hormones as he interviewed a teenage girl. That was totally out of character. And why the one night fling between LeDonne and Martha? What point did that prove? Also, we were privy to an adolescent's sexual fantasies, that stupid kid at the end. Come on McCrumb, step up out of the gutter."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT VERY GOOD!!!","review":"I was very disappointed in this book. This is the first one on McCrumb's books I have read but had heard they were real good. I found my self not wanting to put the book down, not because I was enjoying it but because I just wanted to get done with it. Sheriff Spencer Arrowood is a Sheriff in a small town. First a dog is killed, then a sheep and then a girl. We are led to believe a Vet. no one has heard from in 20 years is the killer. Peggy Muryan, a 60\\"s folk singer is supposed to be the final target. No one solves the crime until the killer shows up. A lot of the book is spent planning a class reunion. I may try one of the MacPherson books but think I am done with the Ballard books. I know different people like different things but this is just not for me. If you have another author you enjoy I would read it and skip this."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read.","review":"Strange days track everyone down in a small mountain town. The twentieth class reunion reminds them of the contrast between who they thought they would grow up to be and who they are. For the men of the class the war was their crucible and they judge themselves on whether or not they went. For women life was a choice between two wrong answers, with the career women envying the homemakers and vice versa. When a sixties folk singer is menaced by a soldier long thought to be dead it seems that the past is inescapable. This is a moving look at a generation who had to make it up as they went along."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Impressed","review":"I was pretty impressed with this book. I am planning on reading all of the \\"Ballad's Novels\\" and I know this is the first, so as I read it, I cut the author a little slack (being this was her first). I did enjoy the story and the suspense. And I found the characters loveable. I'd give it a try if I were you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"The book was disappointing. I expected a better read from this author. Overall, the book is boring. Stick to Michael Connelly, Lee Child, Robert Crais, and John Hart. Far better writers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"The coverage of C++ and data structures looks pretty good. There are lots of programming examples, and the book is written very well. I'm recommending it for our 2nd year course in data structures and C++. Our students know Java, but not C++, so it's been a challenge finding a data structures book that packages a semi-introductory version of C++ with a standard course in data structures.

Cottages on the Coast is a small and wonderful glimpse of styles around the coasts of the United States. A small \\"photo album\\" near the beginning shows early pictures of some of the cottages that are featured later and as those same cottages appear today. A great selection of cottage styles, representing different regions of the country, are fascinating with their accompanying stories. This is a book I will go back to over and over again, to look up something I remember, to find something new and to just plop down with it in my lap for pure beach imaginings. I love this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I expected something different with this book. It depends on what you're looking for. I love the cottage look and feel in a home, but this was not really my definition of 'cottage.' When I think of coastal cottages, I think light, bright, airy and made up of furnishings that look like they've been collected over time. I think painted finishes and an inviting atmosphere that beckons you to just put your feet up, sit back and relax. I wasn't impressed with the way the rooms were photographed and it just didn't inspire me."},{"rating":"1","title":"In the Shadow of the Cour House","review":"I found the book rather boring, I am a former Clintonian.

I loved the book Jacket, it brought back memories..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very enjoyable reading","review":"I am about four years younger than the author, but growing up in Clinton I share the same feelings for that time and for Clinton. Growing up as a Luthern, I did not embrace the Catholism then, but since my grandchildren have grown up as Roman Catholics, I can appreciate what the author is saying. Now living in Oklahoma, I think that anyone growing up in a town of Clinton's size can find something to relate too. The picture of the courthouse is exactly as I remember it and on a recent visit to Clinton, I verified that everything is so accurate."},{"rating":"2","title":"In the Shadow of the Courthouse","review":"This book was a nostalgic trip back to my childhood, and consequently back to anyone's childhood who was raised in a small midwestern town in the 1940's when the traditional values of family, education, religion, sports, and deep personal friendships were the make-up of common existence. The author has evoked every emotion that is present in the maelstrom of growing up, creating a story that touches one's sensibities to the core. This step back into the past weaves a common thread about life during WW II when we all clung together from necessity for emotional and physical survival."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read","review":"I enjoyed this book. There was added adventure and suspense that didn't overpower the romance."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book didn't give good instructions for projects.","review":"This book isn't what I expected.It really gave no instructions on how to do experiments.I can't find the source listed for one experiment.We got the book to give my daughter ideas on science projects:it wasn't much help."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!!","review":"Superb quality, the duvet fits like a glove, and looks like it cost a couple of hundred dollars! I'm highly impressed, and would highly recommend its' purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unfortunately, today \\"common sense\\" has become nonsense to a grunge-influenced culture","review":"Detractors will argue that a book like this is only common sense, but unfortunately, our society today has been influenced by the \\"grunge-activists\\" so that good manners in word and deed are disappearing. Bridges and Curtis touch on such mundanely topics as shaking hands with the elderly, with ladies, etc., writing (a lost art) of thank you notes, giving and receiving compliments, opening doors for others, answering a phone (and cell phone usage), table manners, making introductions, etc. These and all are essential in the business and professional world.Good manners in what one says and does is always appropriate: putting others before oneself.

Lots ofseriouse,funny,strange and even downright ;what to hell were they thinking; stories in here.The most popular events,pictures,investigatorsand reports are all jam packed into this great read that you will find to be a must have for the seriouse crypto junkies.It was interesting to read all of the BIGFOOT REPORTS from the late 1800's all the way to the modern day and realize that what ever people have been seeing, has not changed much at all.This is a must have for the BIGFOOT fans. The only thing that would have made it better would have been including more pictures.If you love to read about BIGFOOT, you will have a hard time putting this book down.

None of the local stores had anything left in stock so I resorted to Amazon.The design on this is the only thing that saves it from 1 star for me. The handle is a good shape, the blade is smaller but it's intended for shoveling not pushing so that is fine.The problem is in the materials. After one use the plastic at the base of the blade was already fraying. After 4 uses the base of the blade was very erratic from the plastic that shaved off. After 6 uses it had a small crack in the blade near the base of the handle.

Signature tone exemplified.","review":"Four songs into this concert I am already declaring it the best Freddie King recording I have ever heard. It's not in a surround format, but it still sounds better than I expected for a 1972 outdoor recording. Fans of his studio albums will likely agree that the part of his songs you wait for is the all-too- short solo in the middle. Here these are stretched longer than you will see on any of those television recordings (vide infra) Freddie King always left me wanting more out of every song; in this performance he delivers it consistently. Even on the bonus TV songs, that fat Gibson tone cuts through the limitations of time and stings so good. 5 stars for a legend at the top of his game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Freddie King: Live at the Sugar Bowl","review":"Great raw footage of one of the greatest blues musicians of all time.

These men founded a new church which they called New Zion, originally meant to be a reformation of Mormonism. These men were leading citizens; intellectuals with sufficient wealth to support their position. While Brigham advised his elders to ignore the Godbeites, as they became known, this was no small matter. William Godbe and several of his cohorts had been long time friends with Brigham and were prominent members of the church as well as the community. This book does an excellent job of explaining the many facets of their dissent and thoroughly examines the several characters, their backgrounds, and what influenced them to take such a strong stand against the man who had been their leader. I found it to be an easy read, but hard to put down until I reached the last page."},{"rating":"1","title":"Security camera with no cable or power supply","review":"I have been buying security cameras for our businesses for 12 years.

Probably because we all think that some horribly illness wont happen to us, but this was just such a reality for Beth, it seemed like this could happen to anyone. If you are looking for something incredily sad, here you go. It's amazing, i stayed up half the night to finish it, i couldnt put it down. And then i spent the other half the night thinking about it.

I read this two years ago and I always mark it down as MY FAV. BOOK of all times. You should definitely read it. You seem to be watching a movie and then suddenly you feel as if you're really there, standing right with Beth and behind Terri and you are so engrossed in the book all the characters seem to be like your friends, your family. It is a truly wonderful book and in my opinion, you should definitely read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book I ever read!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This book is about a girl named Beth and her parents Paul and Carol and her brother Doug and sister Allison get into a car accident on their way to an annual picnic down by the lake. When some of the people notice that they are late they go down they go and try to see were they are and about 5 miles down the road they see there van in the road and they called the ambulance but when thy arrived they were already dead. Now Beth has to go and live with her aunt and uncle Camille and Jack and her cousin Terri in tampa, Florida. Sher has to leave her house in Tennesse were she lived all her life with her family and all her friends. Will she ever be able to get over her loss?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Valuable Reference Book","review":"I have owned this book for several years, and have often found it invaluable. It provides complete conjugations, and is easy to use. It is only limited to 501 verbs, but it contains most of the commonly used verbs. It does not, however, give any examples of verb usage, which would often prove helpful. Still, it is a valuable book to have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book is not very well bound","review":"This is a great resource. It's very helpful and well organized but unfortunately, the binding is poor. My copy has been used only a couple of months and it's literally falling apart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helpful For Russian Language Students","review":"This book is a very useful tool for the beginning to intermediate student of Russian language. It provides a lot of verbs and their full conjugations, which can often be confusing to students.Every serious student should own this book. However, once you advance in ability, you will notice a few shortcomings, such as questionable translations in a few cases. The book also fails in some cases to provide a sufficient explanation of which case is to be used with the given verb in what kind of situation. Still, this book is very useful and will greatly help the student of Russian to learn the typical conjugational patterns of the language. I highly recommend this book to early students of the Russian language."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Helpful!","review":"I'm a beginner and a language lover, and when a friend of mine gave me this book as a gift I was thrilled. It lists Russian alphabetical order in the front, which is helpful for newbies like myself, and also has an index in the back where you can look up the English verb. As a beginner, this is very helpful. I have never not been able to find a verb here. However, I would not recommend it for someone who has not studied Russian at all. It does not describe the different forms of the verbs, and it can be a little confusing at first. Also, the ability to read Cyrillic is a must; there is no romanization."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you want to learn Russian, skip this book!","review":"Five years ago as a beginner student I found this book to be totally inadequate. Don't buy it! Instead buy \\"A Dictionary of Russian Verbs\\" by Daum and Schenk (Hippocrane Books). My book has 20,000 in all declinations with examples of usage. Conact me if you have questions about the book. email: gerryd36@hotmail.com"},{"rating":"2","title":"Helpful For Beginners, But Not a Necessary Study Tool","review":"The supposed value of this book lies in the fact that it lists verbs in all their conjugations and tenses. Whereas this may be helpful for beginners, the fact of the matter is that once you learn the grammar rules governing verbs, you won't need this book!However, in all fairness I must write two good things about this book. First, seeing all the conjugations and tenses of a verb laid out on one page is helpful in making sense of the various verb forms, especially in terms of keeping them distinct from each other. And second, this book provides a list of some of the most useful verbs that you can study as a beginning student of the language.My advice is to examine your own personal learning style and ask yourself if you really need this book, because once I learned the rules of verb formation, this book did little more than gather dust on my shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"Verb book with out examples......","review":"I rented 501 French Verbs from the library. For each verb it had examples of usage. The French book also had idiom phrases, quizzes, etc... Liked it so much I bought it from Amazon.So I rented 501 Russian Verbs from the library expecting similar content as the French version. What a difference. If you really need a book that shows you how to conjugate 501 Russian verbs without context and without examples, this book is for you.Honestly how can you have a Russian verb book that covers verbs of motions with one or two word English translations. Completely worthless for learning how to use the verbs.The differences between perfective and imperfective require examples to begin to make any sense of the usage.The only reason I can think of for the positive reviews is that it must have been a classroom assignment for extra credit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to use, fits well in most rooms","review":"This unit is easy to assemble and uncomplicated to use. It made a noticeable difference in keeping the house from being too dry during spells when the heating system went on frequently. It was, however, difficult to tell what humidity sensor it was using to gauge how much more mist to put into the air. It would run for long periods at times when the air seemed fine, and would not turn on at other times when the air seemed dry. However, those are subjective observations on my part."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great gift if you want to infuriate the recipient","review":"The only way I could keep my girlfriend from taking the chain saw to this thing was to promise that I'd return it.This thing has a non-functional humidistat.

Others also. :-( Does ANYBODY make a product worth spending your money on anymore???"},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS HUMIDIFIER!","review":"After using this for a year--here is what we found: you have to flip the filter about every hour to keep it wet or it dries out except for the tiny part in the water. If you do not buy their products to keep out mold and bacteria, the filter becomes useless in a week. The humidifier is noisey. It blows air horizontally instead of vertically so there is cold air blowing directly on you when walk in the room. Frankly, I am sick and tired of this humidifier producers---we have tried Holmes, Honeywell, and Duracraft. It appears they all ruined their filters so that they will require frequent replacements, or they have issues with their leakage, little output, noise, etc. We are now trying a filter-free Air-O-Swiss. So far we like it but it requires frequent cleaning. At least it works and NOT the constant upkeep buying filters that dry out or become bateria and mildew filled."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Humidifier!","review":"I have used the Honeywell HCM-640BW QuietCare 4-Gallon Cool Moisture Humidifier 2 in 1 Tower for several weeks, and have found it to be without a flaw. It is easy to fill, quiet in operation, and attractive with any decor.I can only wonder about the lower chamber of the Tower. It is easily accessible, but for what purpose, who can say? (Maybe to hide the family jewels!) What is more, it was most reasonably priced."},{"rating":"2","title":"humidifier","review":"the product does exactly what it is specified to do, quiet and easy to operate,I am very satisfied."},{"rating":"1","title":"Assembly Required with Poor Construction & Directions","review":"I based the purchase of this item on the Honeywell name instead a Holmes unit. That may have been a mistake. I found the produce very difficult to assemble with poor installatin directions.

But really it's a fairly lame version of memory mixed with spoons. It creates little interaction between the players, as there are no turns or anything. You're just all randomly searching for the foods you 'like.' Speaking of food, that's all the game is about. It was okay the first time we played it, but I doubt we'll ever open that box again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Even the best stories can be ruined.","review":"It stars Frank Stallone. It was doomed before the cameras even started rolling. The film doesn't even try to be suspenseful. So many elements have been changed that it stops making sense very early on. The actors seem to be mentally cashing their paychecks. If you happen to even find a copy of this movie I suggest you flee in fear. It's bad. Real, real bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ten Little Indians (1989)","review":"Copared to the other versions of this movie this one stinks.

We somehow missed the theatrical release and, after that, it seemed to have disappeared (now, we know why)!

They are hard workers, family oriented and caring individuals. If you don't believe that, please read Janice Marschner's \\"California's Arab Americans.\\" Her thumbnail snaphot of their difficult war-ridden history is a good refresher for the reader and makes their integration into American society, as put forth by Marschner, seem that much more remarkable."},{"rating":"2","title":"CD Music","review":"Perfect all, like new the CD, one of the best and greats albums, Excelente vendedor, llego antes de lo prometido y perfectas condiciones."},{"rating":"1","title":"no merchandise received","review":"i have not ever received this book and i sent an email to the seller thru amazon and have not received a reply."},{"rating":"1","title":"White Fang Complete Series","review":"Purchased this DVD recently. The stories are short but okay. They are annoying to watch because there is 3 minutes of credits and intro's for every single story.Do yourself a huge favor and purchase Call of the Wild with Shane Meier and Nick Mancuso. TV Series featuring 8 episodes, far better than White Fang complete series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for a 7-year-old.","review":"If you are an adult, perhaps you will want a different series. But if you are a young boy, this series has everything you want: Beautiful outdoor scenery, animals of all kinds, some fighting and posturing, lots of drama and happy endings. My son is not old enough to read the Jack London book, but he enjoys this tale of a modern boy and his faithful dog. One thing that irks me is so many of the actors seem to be German and are having problems sounding like rural mountain men. German actors in New Zealand playing mountain men in the Northern Rockies? Oh well, it's TV, not the History channel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass this one up!","review":"I purchased this at a local store for $5, so I can't complain about the price too much. But I would certainly not pay more than that for this series. As another reviewer stated, the music is just horrible! The plots have no depth, and are so short that really not much happens, and what does happen is predictable. Some of the plots had potential if they had been longer. Sometimes the acting is a little too obvious and not very realistic.Also, this has nothing to do with Jack London's book. The only similarity is the name of the dog.I would recommend this instead.Call of the Wild-Complete SeriesIt, too, has nothing to do with Jack London's book, but the story is much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst adaptation yet","review":"So many translations of White Fang are awful, and this one is the worst of them all! Garishly bright colors and extremely poor animation make it an eyesore and the plot (such as it is) varies so greatly from the original as to be an almost separate story. Everything about White Fang's abusive puppy hood and dog sledding history is neglected, with much of the focus being on a young Native American boy who is his best friend. Anyone who has read the book will know such a thing is laughable. Although the creators of this movie were trying to tone down the violence of an admittedly violent story, I felt that the result was condescending to children's intelligence. No narration and little dialog made the drag even more noticeable. Even though the DVD cover is cute, it houses a dull and lifeless movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gluten-free Valentine Basket","review":"Nice to have a gift basket for those who are gluten sensitive.

(In fact, I think I'll watch them again tonight!) We even have the entire West Wing collection.Douglas is monumental in American President, and Annette Benning was the best choice for supporting female.And of course, Sig Weaver was memorable as the First Lady. The lady is no tramp. She bellied up to the part in glorious style. Kevin Klyne is at his comic best here. He does his own part in creating suspense AND laughter.The hook in these movies for us was the real-time politics that the writers included. The drama and the flirty romance brought them home to the heart, and this guy doesn't like romantic flicks. No, no.Four thumbs up from us.

D'Artagnan befriends three current Musketeers (Porthos, Athos and Aramis) and what follows is a fast-paced literary romp as the four friends share a series of swashbuckling adventures in 17th century France. The plot is full of twists and turns but is cleverly developed and believable. Dumas expertly develops the characters, engaging the reader as the characters experience war, love and just about everything in between.The edition I'm reviewing (the Illustrated Junior Library version) is highly abridged (300 pages vs over 600 pages) and has many beautiful illustrations, making an already fun novel even more accessible for young readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a mistake!","review":"The Table of Contents of this book is completely erroneous (and it appears in the Butterworth-Heinemann Web).

The desk took me 15 min to unpack and assemble. This is not the typical particle board furniture that you normally get for this price. The desk is not only sturdy and solid, it looks fantastic. I would highly recommend this if you are looking for a computer table."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"The keyboard piece did not fit with the desk. It was too narrow.

The desk was packed with some particle board blocks with sharp staples sticking out of them. These were probably meant to keep things from moving around inside the box during shipment, however, 3 of them were loose and guess what... they scratched the heck out of the desk! The packing looks like it was done by a crack addict. Geez."},{"rating":"2","title":"computer desk","review":"I really love this desk. Lots of room, hideaway drawer for keyboard.

Instead, I took a chance. When this item arrived, I could tell the packaging was way too thin. When opened, it confirmed my fear. The desk had dents, scratches and broken pcs all over the place. The furniture appeared to be in good quality if undamaged. Unfortunatly, I had to pack it right up and send to Amazon for a refund. If you are not desperate, do not take this chance. I have learned my lesson. Like you, I was warned by other reviewers. I guess my stupidity is partly responsible for this unpleasant experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Arrived broken","review":"The desk is a good size, and sturdy. I use it for a laptop on a stand and an external display. Then I have another desk for paper and writing.However, one piece did arrive broken. Fortunately, it was some of the trim from the front, which I can live without. So in my case, I don't have the keyboard drawer cover installed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little table.","review":"I bought this desk because I wanted a simple desk that matched the color of my kitchen table. It really is what it is, simple. The design is simple, the assembly is simple. That's not a hit against it because if that's not what you're looking for obviously you wouldn't be looking at this desk.Anyway, there isn't much to say about it, it's put together well, and it's solid after it's assembled.As far as the packaging goes, the other people that have reviewed this are spot on correct. The packaging looks like something you'd get from a table you bought at Wal-Mart. This is fine when all you have to do is run it from the store to your house, but it's really inadequate for cross country shipping. There isn't enough give in the packaging to be very forgiving of any mishandling. Luckily mine showed up just fine, but keep that in mind when you order one of these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still disappointed","review":"The desk arrived, and there are several large spots (right on top, of course) where the finish is terrible. Also, the keyboard tray track is bent, and the tracks were installed too far apart, so the wheels do not fit into the tracks like they're supposed to. The desk would be very nice, if it hadn't been thrown together in such a sloppy way by the manufacturer.I returned the desk and got another one. It is much better than the first, but still not great quality. One of the corners is cracked, and there are still some ugly spots on the finish--just not as bad as the first one. I need a desk, and I'm tired of dealing with it so I'm keeping it. I probably would not recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Computer Desk","review":"This is the desk for a college student's home bedroom.

One side of the desk was broken off entirely, split through the middle of the plank. They do offer part replacement, but it can take 3-4 weeks to fulfill a replacement order and I had ordered this item primarily because 2-day prime shipping was available through amazon. Very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"winsome computer table","review":"I read the other reviews for this desk first; but took a chance that the packing had been improved and that the desk would arrive in good shape. That was not the case. The portion of the desk to which the computer tray attaches was broken off. The packing materials are not sufficient to protect the desk in shipment. Since it was only $100 I didn't want to hassle with returning such a huge box; so I glued the pieces together with super glue and hope they will stay in tact. I cannot pull out the keyboard tray because of the repair I had to do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple and very functional","review":"We were looking for a desk for our son's room. This one was the right size and I expect will be able to grow with him through the school years. One slight disappointment we had was the cover for the keyboard tray is attached to the desk and not the tray as some are. This limits the use of the tray as a drawer which we had intended since the son in question is not yet old enough for a computer.That said, this is still a good desk for the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't risk buying a broken desk","review":"Beware of the poor packaging, my desk arrived broken.

I live very near NYC and I can name so many gluten free restaurants that weren't included that it's ridiculous. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Score That Soars!!!!!","review":"First of all, this is a recording of symphonic movie underscore, not a collection of folk and/or pop songs, nor is it a recording of the very fine musical based on Noel Coward's BLITHE SPIRIT. So, let's not blame it for what it isn't, and enjoy for what it is: a wonderful collection of mostly instrumental themes meant to undescore a rather rambuntious and romantic movie about a haunted castle in Ireland. It has wit, romance, great melodies often inspired by the Celtic tradition, a wonderful love theme, colorful orchestrations, and one of the most exciting end-credit themes ever composed for a movie. It's like an Irish jig on steroids, and if it doesn't stir your blood, then I'd suspect you were recently drained by a vampire. A lush, funny, and sumptuous score for those who enjoy such things, and I know you're out there, so this is definitely for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfully orchestrated celtic music!","review":"One of the things I love best about the movie \\"High Spirits\\" has always been the music! Unfortunately, until now, I haven't been able to find it available anywhere.....until Amazon!I've just purchased the CD, and should receive it soon, but can tell you that it is indeed *NOT* like your average everyday celtic music soundtrack from the \\"bargain bin\\" as a previous customer said. This is beautifully composed music played by a full orchestra....suitable for a Sunday afternoon while puttering around the house, a long drive, or even your next St. Patty's Day party!Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"High Spirits Motion Picture Soundtrack","review":"I was EXTREMELY disappointed to find that the soundtrack did not include the song performed in the hotel pub scene that everyone sang along to. I do not know the artist's name, but she had a beautiful voice and her harp accompaniment was fantastic. Her song was the only reason I purchased the soundtrack. Imagine my surprise! The music on the CD is very similar to Celtic instrumental CDs found in the $3.99 bargain bin at your local music store. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"WRONG! WRONG!

The Crystals is one of Phil Spector's groups from the early 60's and along with the Ronettes, one of the best of the period. This collection brings together their best performaces and offers for the first time, the VERY RARE song \\"Dance The Screw\\" which was the first production from Phil Spector and his Philles Records partner, Lester Sil. The song was released to DJ's only and never released to the public. If you are a fan of the Phil Spector Wall Of Sound, you will not be dissapointed with this import from Brussels."},{"rating":"1","title":"MONO","review":"I bought this based on these \\"rave stereo reviews\\" and the place I bought it from deals primarily in cassettes and vhs tapes (I discovered later). Nothing on my copy of this CD is stereo, not even the bass being in one channel. BUYER BEWARE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Name dropping to the nth...","review":"This book reads like the script for a James Michener miniseries or an epic blockbuster (it reminded me in parts of the film Giant). My biggest complaint is the incessant namedropping that at times is so gratuitious that I self-consciously found myself looking at the floor to make sure my feet hadn't stepped in any of it. I expect we will see this book on TV (HBO perhaps?) or maybe even on the big screen someday, since Cort is a major producer in Hollywood. Hopefully the real screenplay will do to this novel what central character AJ is supposed to be talented at doing: tightening a potentially good but ultimately sprawling story into a focused unit. It surely needs it. My advice? Wait for the screen version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self-Referential Junk!","review":"Why is it that people in the movie business (as opposed to filmmakers, who are artists) think their lives are interesting and/or important? Cort's weaving of numerous real people into his story does not (contrary to Lesley Stahl's blub on the jacket) even come close to Doctorow's achievment in \\"Ragtime.\\" On the contrary, it's not enriching, and it's pretentious and amoral in that he puts dialogue into the mouths of real people, many of whom are still alive (and a few of whom I happen to know). One has the sense that this writer is doing a lot of score-settling, and that his story is self-referential in the worst possible sense. The author is certainly an accomplished producer, but you won't learn anything about what the business is like except that to make it big in Hollywood you have to act like a monster. The big question a reader must ask himself after wading through this morass of superficial charcterizations: \\"Why on earth should anyone care?\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic book","review":"Robert Cort has written a one-of-a-kind book of behind the scenes Hollywood action. Sure, it's fiction but no one could make up stuff this interesting. A must read for anyone who is interested in how the movie business REALLY works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Characters are undeveloped","review":"This is a fun read but not a very well told tale. The characters aren't very emotionally fleshed out. For instance, the lead character's mother despises him, but his actions don't seem to warrant it. Likewise, the son hates the lead character but the lead's behavior didn't seem to warrant that either. And, the lead character is described as ruthless by others, but the author doesn't really paint him that way. The end is also less than believable. I bought the book on the discount table at Borders but I definitely wouldn't pay full price for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Novel Version of Hollywood History","review":"If you like following the history of Hollywood, this is a novel by a well-known producer who rather than write a history of Hollywood, invents a family through three generations that lives through the different stages of Hollywood business growth, the studios in control, the producers/actors/directors in the late 70s through the current history of corporate ownership. Significant Hollywood players who are mentioned include Steve McQueen and Mike Ovitz who once again is portrayed negatively. I suspect he's used to that by now.I found this to be a very fast enjoyable read if you like nonfiction and Hollywood history. My only complaint is the ending seemed to be thrown together and seemed to leave a few unresolved issues to explore like the father's former girlfriend who is now pregnant. Overall, I would highly recommend this book and thoroughly enjoyed it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very useful tool","review":"An invaluable tool for removing stumps and similar work.

I should have known it was too good to be true. All their best songs have been re-recorded and completely butchered, particularly Dont Let Me Misunderstood. House of the Rising Sun and We Gotta Get Outta This Place don't fare well either. They made a great British Invasion band sound like a terrible 80's band. This was particularly disappointing because I've been looking for a complilation of The Animals for some time.I am returning this cd as soon as I can, and will buy another greatest hits package of theirs.

The authors' step-by-step instructions make it easy to produce beautiful eggs on the first try.

There is a really small crack by the chip and I know if I hit a bone or cut something too hard it's going to snap. It's still a good knife for the most part. It's been the main knife that I use to cook with and now I'm going to have to find a replacement. :("},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a favorite knife","review":"I purchased this knife about three months ago. It is very sharp and works very well...on salad. None of the information on this knife told me it was limited in it use or that it would dull like any knife and I could not sharpen it. Nor did they tell me that I could pay for shipping and return it with a proof of purchase to the company and it would sharpened it for free.I have followed all the use instructions and my knife, like any knife, is dulling. Can only use it on salads and fruits. My husband tried to cut a chicken (a no no) and chipped the knife. Have to stick to salad.I don't think this is a good investment at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"SHARP KNIFE","review":"This knife is very sharp and light - great - just making sure I'm careful not to chip the edge!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mr.","review":"I look like a defect item the blade is over cut, and out of alignment of the knife back.

We loved it for the first week... but then it BROKE off when she was cutting something frozen.. It was totally embarrassing and disappointing that it breaks so easily. I think it would have been better if I gave her a metal one instead. At least it won't snap so easily."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deceptively Sharp!","review":"So far I've used this knife to chop fruit, and it's fantastic. It looks like a cheap plastic knife that won't do anything, but it's very sharp and you need very little pressure to cut through apples, oranges, etc.My only disappointment was that the knife doesn't have any indentations on the blade the way a typical Santoku knife does to prevent the food from sticking to the blade.Other than that, a great addition to my knife block at a very reasonable price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely... Excellent.","review":"I came across a ceramic knife over Thanksgiving at a friend's house and I fell in love with it. So I ordered my own. I was so excited the day the knife was delivered... I took an apple and did a test - absolutely marvelous. Now I bring this knife with me to our potlucks, where I frequently prepare side dishes and salads. I always do a demo for other participants, and they are always amazed at the smoothness of the cut. I feel like I could not live (or cook) without this wonderful knife."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Knife","review":"I bought this for a friend as a gift.

Decades after the initial conflict, a rag-tag fleet of poorly maintained and damaged ships - a shadow of the state-of-the-art naval warships they once were - sets sail to teach the enemy a lesson once and for all. I thought there was a sort of epic doomed quality to the novel with the \\"last ride\\" of its final naval armada (have I mixed the metaphor?). Anyway, it's a quick read and worth picking up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good ideas for everyday living","review":"When I recieved this book, I thought that they would be ideas about special things to do together. But it is more about regular everday living--not just special events.

I believe this will be beneficial to my family in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wealth of ideas!","review":"As single parent of a 22 month old, I am always looking for neat things to do with my daughter that are fun for both of us.

The table is no ordinary table... need a quick hiding place? Watch out! Petigrew is over by the small shed changing into a rat! (It really works!) If you make it out alive, stop by Honeydukes for a popcicle or lollipop. Overall this toy is loads of fun and stays together pretty well once it is built."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Toy Is Very Cool!","review":"This toy is very cool because it stays together very well, and it includes Honeyduke's, the candy store, that doesn't show up in the movie for a long time. It has Sirius Black as a dog and as himself. Under the little house, you can change people into animals. In the candy store, it includes some cherries and apples.

Expectations among fans of Wright's work were very high. But Burns fell woefully short in capturing the essence of the man and in explaining what makes his architecture great (and what makes the ideas behind it still relevant today). Instead, he spent too much time delving into personal scandals, as if the docu. was being made for the commercial networks rather than PBS! A mediocre effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did Jerry Springer make this film?","review":"This was very disappointing. There was way too much information on the personal failings of Frank Lloyd Wright and way too little on the architectural themes. Yes, you will see all the obvious structures: Fallingwater, the Guggenheim, the Johnson Wax building and the Japanese hotel. But Usonian structures receive about 2 minutes out of 2-plus hours. Yes, Frank Lloyd Wright was a jerk. We get it, Ken. I didn't need dozens of examples on why this was true. My feeling is that if Jerry Springer had done 2-plus hours on Frank Lloyd Wright, it would have looked a lot like this.

The reproductions are glorious! My only criticism (and it's slight) is that I would have liked the text to be more extensive and thorough. But I suppose that there will be other reading books on the site since it seems that new chambers filled with mummies are being uncovered every day.

HOWEVER, you must plug it in and there lies the challenge. You are obviously meant to string these lights somewhere other than on the floor. The amount of cord that you have from the plug to the 1st butterfly is insignificant and therefore you must use an extension cord to get the lights where you want them. If your plan is to hang them vertically, you won't have a problem. If you want to hang them horizontally, like over a window, you need at least a 3 foot extention cord to make this work...unless you're lucky enough to have a plug in the ceiling :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful butterflies","review":"This butterfly light strand is beautiful in the dark.

He fought in numerous campaigns in Africa (Alamein and on) before dying in Normandy shortly after being called back to active duty.

Otherwise, try the other two first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kind of a disappointment...","review":"I've read all of McCammon's other books - this one rates on the lower end of all of them. It's a dark book, kind of depressing in fact. I had trouble getting into the book as well as getting into any of the characters.

Each recording is either electronically altered or features additional instruments, presumably native to Mexico. But, who can tell? The booklet contains no program notes--just 15 pages of unidentified images, presumably from South of the Border. Many of the tracks end with a faux \\"on location\\" soundscape. Did the album's producer imagine there was an audience for random street noises, laughter and snippets of conversation? I wanted music, not feeble attempts at sound collage. And then there's the music itself. While each piece was performed with undeniable zeal by Kronos, none of it, in my view, was the least bit memorable. The sole representative from the \\"classical\\" repertoire, the arrangement of Revueltas' Sensemaya, illustrated to me just how important the original orchestration is to the success of the piece. Ackk!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Kronos Nuevo. Not for me.","review":"I bought Nuevo some time ago with the expectation to enjoy, as always, the powerful musical experience provided by Kronos. I\`m afraid I was deeply disappointed as most pieces are not necessarily interesting from my point of view (except for the funny Chavo Suite) and Kronos performance was unable to capture the Mexican sensibility. Definitively, I would not recommend Nuevo to people just introducing to Kronos music.

The effects in recording this CD are so unusual that more production notes are in order. Some of the effects (distortion on the cello in the first piece) are nice but I know they could never get that sound live unless they ran the sound through a sound system.

Useful features include glossary of terms, with translation table showing English, French, German and Italian. And also an index of trade names.

I also loved Jennifer Warnes first couple albums and her hit singles. Jennifer had this same potential I am hearing now but she just didnt make much materials after the 70;s. This is what Beth sounds like to me, a dead ringer for Warnes and the brilliant song writing on these tunes. Her voice is just lovely, and the country feel on this album's ballads in particular is wonderful. Every song is a gem, it reminds me in a way of Jennifer Warnes first album which was one of my favorite female vocalist's albums of the 70's! It just goes to show you how everyone is so close to the mainstream that someone like Beth just outside of the mainstream can be overlooked by so many people. But she shall not be overlooked anymore.

I thought perhaps he might become more open-minded as the story progressed. When Kate's sister starts shoving the Bible on her, I rolled my eyes, but still continued on. This book is written for people who believe they have the only answers and arrogantly believe that people with different beliefs are always wrong. I hate it when an author preaches.

However about 2/3 of the way through it I just got bored. The connection between hero and heroine seemed tenuous to me and I did not really care who had done it or why which is to say the plot development was lacking. The family connections did nto seem to hold water and got too melodramtaic. I also found the religious conversion overtones very distracting."},{"rating":"1","title":"christian propaganda, angst, and no sex","review":"I almost gave this three stars, but I'm going with two because I don't think I'm going to finish it.

However, I do have a hangup about the two books that I have read by Dee Henderson.Sara in Danger in the Shadows is gorgeous. Kate in The Negotiator is described as \\"too exotically beautiful to make it in undercover work\\" Why do all her heroines have to be beautiful in a worldly sense? Don't we get enough of that from worldly sources? Also, what attracts Dave to Kate? It seems to be mostly physical. If Dave were truly a mature Christian, he would be seeking out women with spiritual as well as physical beauty. I'd like to see more Christian novels with characters the average man or woman can relate to without all this emphasis on physical beauty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Frankly I'm surprised by all the great ratings and reviews on this novel.

Though the inspirational romance subplot was touching and well-written, the main storyline was confusing and overpopulated with only tangentially relevant characters. It was virtually impossible to follow Kate O'Malley's thinking as she completed her investigation, because I could not keep the multiple characters separated in my mind. It did not help at all that Henderson referred to many of the characters by name only. Without the chance to meet the \\"suspects\\", they remained simply indistinct names; the plot got lost in a sea of forgettable suspects. Also, though Ms. Henderson writes authentic sounding dialogue, the rest of the text is flat. All in all, a regrettably frustrating read."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is Love?","review":"I also thought this book was going to be a mystery, and where those elements applied it was well written. however when one really can't stand the \\"Hero\\", it kind of removes all traces of romance, this guy wants to change her from day 1. he doesn't tolerate her lack of belief, is constantly praying to God to help him suffer her till he can convert her. this to me isn't love, if he loved her he wouldn't keep trying to change her. i couldn't even finish this book as i knew she would be converted, this didn't fit her character as she had gone all her life not believing for a reason and seemed too sensible to me to fall for a guy so obviously lacking in understanding or consideration of her views.for myself i am Christian, and i still couldn't read this book so unless you like Christian books don't bother."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I read this book in a week. I couldn't put it down!! I fell in love with the characters and the story line. I'm new to Dee Henderson's writing, but I intend on reading every single one of the \\"O'Malley\\" series books. I'm currently reading \\"Danger in the Shadows\\" which was the prequel to the O'Malley series and I'm already in love with these characters. I was hoping for a little more romance, which is the only reason I gave it 4 stars. I recommend this book to anyone who loves a good mystery with a little romance thrown in. Sometimes the investigation became confusing because the author detailed the police work and it was hard to follow but somehow it always wound up making sense and coming to together through the dialouge of the characters. Overall an excellent book."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT! book","review":"Absolutely AWESOME book! By the 2nd chapter I was hooked!

Not many couples can say they met during a bank seige! Kate O'Malley has nerves of steel. She has to have due to her occupation of hostage negotiator. This book is a brilliant combination of suspense and romance, portraying also the loyalty and devotion of Kate's 'family'. The ingredient which for me made it extra special was the way Dee Henderson puts across the message of salvation. Don't be put off from reading it though, because it is not an 'in yer face' preachy sermon type of book. It is just perfectly blended in to make it a TOP book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Christian mystery","review":"I love the combination of mystery and Christian ethics. This book starts out with questions about God and how he fits in with our modern life. A new twist. Usually Christian novels don't deal with doublts. I found this book enthralling.

The \\"dark past\\" of the main character is only ever vaguely referred to. The childhood of a band of orphans is presented completely happy-go-lucky. The whole conversion to christianity aspect is so incredibly simplistic that it's AMAZINGLY patronizing to a non-christian. The whole falling in love aspect is so incredibly simplistic that it's AMAZINGLY patronizing to any, um, human beings... and how come all the characters are white? a bunch of disadvantaged kids who meet in the inner city- probability says some of them will be non-white.edit: I suddenly stumbled on this old review of mine, and the 2nd paragraph was a little over-the-top.

Dee Henderson is very creative and thoughtful in her development of relationships and plots.

In a world of hate and loneliness, this story is a look into the reality of life and how the worst of times, can result in the best times. Definitely realistic!One downside to this book is that there are a lot a typos. I also came across numerous sentences that I had to read and re-read to try to figure what it meant.

I know this is love, so I think I will have sex with him (or her).I also liked the integration of a faith based life, the struggle with trust in that relationship, and faith even when events in life shake that faith.I liked the way the case was analyzed, the steps, the contributing factors of everyone involved, and what it takes to solve a case.This was a very good read.

It helped me know a little more depth to the character of Dave Richman. Dee Henderson has a way of connecting the books without going in depth what happened in the previous book.This book does give you clues to the different characters in the rest of the O'Malley Chronicles. I like that the reader is not overly bombarded but mainly are focused on one or two members of the family at a time. Hopefully by the time I finish the O'Malley Chronicles, I'll be well versed with all of them.I should also add a hanky caution to this book...and if you haven't read any of Dee Henderson's books than you should have a hanky or two ready for them as well.

Kate was a strong female character, a welcome change from weak female characters who play the smaller part in the Christian romance genre. The book is well-written, however, there was much too much emphasis on the action, and mystery and not enough on the relationship. I liked the back story about Kate forming a family with the other orphans, THAT was something new. Like other readers, I could not finish reading the book. My interest was lost somewhere in the middle.

I was not aware of the religious overtones of the book, and found their introduction into the story somewhat disruptive.The mystery elements of the book are engaging, and the overall writing is better than average. The plot line is relatively strong, and there is enough action to be engaging.However, the discussions of Christianity were rather forced. When Dave, the lead character, is reflecting on his religious beliefs, the text is consistent with his character. The discussions about God are awkward, and Kate's sudden conversion to being a \\"believer\\" based on a deal she constructs with via prayer is not a good fit with her characterization in the novel.Anyone who wants a G-rated read will enjoy this book, or if you can move past the over management of parts of the storyline, you may enjoy it overall."},{"rating":"1","title":"Propaganda is not Literature","review":"I did not acquire this book thinking it was going to be great or that it would have actual literary merit.

The first O'Malley book focuses on Kate, the negotiator who seems to find herself in pretty precarious situations. Such as a bomb-strapped man in a bank. As Kate races to solve a mystery centered around a plane that was blown up, she is also confronted with the presence of Dave Richman, the FBI agent who seems to always be around. But when the mystery turns personal for Kate, Dave has to protect her before she walks into a situation she can't talk herself out of.Overall, a great book!

Nearly every track is riddled with overindulgences, primarily on the vocal front but as a result of the pop-punk-progressive fused mentalities as well.

I only give this release two stars because i don't get anything out of it almost at all.but it's still okay.one thing that really irks me is the little kid voice this dude keeps using.someone needs to tell that guy to grow up."},{"rating":"1","title":"?","review":"whenever i listen to and coheed and cambria it reminds me of sitting in my friends room with him riffing out to a copy in the cd player. i didnt like the first album as much as the second, but i still really have no interest in this style of music. plus his voice annoys me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah","review":"I don't know about you guys, but I think they ruined the songs in the enhanced version...

I gave it a shot, and I bought the album. I patiently endured the slow pain that was inflicted after the first track. But i repeatedly told myself, to give the album a chance. Now, by the second track, i thought it was going to get a bit better...and for a moment, it did. UNTILL THE LEAD SINGER OPENED HIS UGLY, FEMANINE, PAIN STAKING \\"MAKE YOU WANNA HANG YOURSELF\\" MOUTH.I cannot believe that amazon.com even allowed patrons to submit even ONE star to this band. Alternative use to be sung by men and/or women. Not shemales (with the exception of Ru-Paul, which fits nicely in the C&C category). This album now sits as a coaster on my coffee table. I hope that alternative becomes in no way influenced by any of what C&C have to offer. They need to get over their castration, rather than singing about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't let them scare you","review":"I bought this because I bought Good Apollo volume 1 first. Then I realized it is a concept series of albums. I also have Playlist ( greatest hits album). This album is very good. This is actually their debut and you can tell. On the rest of their work the production is far and above this album. That being said this is pretty good. Devil In Jersey City and Everything Evil are probably the.best songs. The production and the drumming are the most questionable parts of album. I like these guys a lot and you must own it to follow the concept. Great riffs and lyrics. If you want to jump in to the Coheed and Cambria story this is a must own.

But then again all of the songs on here are unbelievable.The only thing that i could think of that anyone would not like about this band is the singers voice but if u have an open mind and accept it then i know you wont be dissapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"just.....plain......wow","review":"Rarely does an album come along which can hold my atteention for more then a couple of weeks, but over two years later I still listen to C&C's debut with the same enthusiasm as I did the first time I heard \\"Delerium Trigger\\" on an internet stream. C&C are incredible musicians who combine to create a sonic rush rarely encountered in today's overcrowded music scene. From the intro of \\"Time Consumer\\" all the way to fade out repeats of \\"God Send Conspirator\\" there is never a moment when fast fowarding is required as each song is gripping and appealing in it's own way. I have not been this engrossed in a music cd since the last Hum album, and it seems this may keep my attention even longer then that masterpiece did. Little can be said negatively about any part of this album except maybe that it's only ten songs long, and how in the world do they produce a follow up."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best band you've never heard of","review":"This cd is awsome i love the whole thing.

Buy it now!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"Coheed and Cambria stand out from a world full of trendy music and have put together some of THE most interesting material out there. This is one of those cds that is so rich and full with compexity that it is very tough not to listen to it again and again. Between their two cds, not a day has gone by where I dont listen to them. Their singer is amazing, and their songs are even more so. The Delirium Trigger has one of the coolest intros of the modern day. I would buy this cd if it was $50.00."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST OF ALL TIME","review":"Look into this band at www.coheedandcambria.com!

I've listened to it all summer and still can't take it out of regular rotation. Any confusion about the lyrics is because they're all based on a fantasy story the singer is writing. The name of the band is from the two main characters in the story. How cool is that!? Every song on the album is Great... not just ok, or just good, but great. Check it out... if you don't like it... you have no soul."},{"rating":"2","title":"not a typical listener","review":"I am a classic rock fan but my boyfriend is a die hard fan of bands such as Saves the Day, The Get up Kids, and Weezer. He introduced me to Coheed and Cambria and I was surprised to find that the singer's voice sounds similar to that of the lead singer in the classic rock band Rush. This band is full of power and flavor, and I especially like the song \\"Time Consumer.\\" Good cd, even for people that don't normally listen to music of this type such as myself."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of them best albums ever","review":"This cd is absolutely amazing to say the least. The lyrics mean so much, and with the greatest vocals I've ever heard, it's great. With only having 10 songs on the cd, it's quite long. With about 55 mins. of play time, it sets them off from most \\"punk\\" bands with their 2 1/2 min, songs. I really like how pretty much all their songs are about 5 mins. long. I got to see them open for The Get Up Kids, and seeing them live is SO much better than the cd, his voice is great on the cd, but when you see them live, there is no doubt about it that you will like them more live. I would highly recommend seeing them live if you can. Like me, most of the people at the concert were more excited to see Coheed and Cambria than The Get Up Kids. Buy this cd, and try to check them out live."},{"rating":"2","title":"coheed and cambria is the shiznit","review":"umm i dont know really wat to right except they sound like the band rush to me anyone else thing soo"},{"rating":"2","title":"Completely Satisfied","review":"Love this bowl: just the right size for passing around the table, serving food to a family of four and storing conveniently in the cupboard.

I wasn't expecting Academy Award winning performances but I wasn't prepared for the juvenile crap it promotes. I like a good 'The Fast and the Furious', and films like it which are in it for the hype, are fairly well made and generally are not promising to be much more than that. I know what to expect, fair is fair. But 'Crank', I think, falls far short. It does have it's moments but if you intend to get this movie try to get it at a rock bottom price. $3, $4 at most. It's for those times when you and your buds get together, the beer and pizza, buzz, etc, are going, and you feel like watching something really moronic for as long as you can stand it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good little action movie","review":"This movie was what id expect- a nonstop action movie with little value. Jason Statham is a great action star in my eyes. He was great in The Transporter and is a highly enjoyable movie series. Id recommend this movie to people who like action movies, but dont look for a meanings. Also check out the Transporter series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Non Stop Thrill Ride","review":"From the opening credits you can be assured this isn't highbrow or arty, but it's not supposed to be. Crank is pure non-stop action fun. The camera work is incredible - giving you an actual sense of movement in many scenes, of feeling totally out of it in others. The first time I saw this in a theater I must admit that the combination of the drugs I was on and the frenetic pacing and camera work left me feeling quite unsettled. One of the guys I was with actually bolted upright out of his chair and said he was feeling motion sick. ( I had a great laugh over that one.) Such a visceral, physical reaction to a movie I don't think I've ever experienced. Some people have criticised the few holes in the plot, but don't let that bother you. This is a great movie, highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"An awesome adrenalized action movie from the new legend Jason Statham","review":"So what would you do if you were injected with a lethal virus that slows down your heart and eventually kills you....well you do what this guy does, keep running and doing over the top insanity to maintain your heart rhythm up.I have to admit this movie may seem silly but you have to give credit to the creators for crafting a very original movie. And honestly it is very original, the action, the humor, everything in this movie becomes an instant classic. The story is simple Chev Chelios(Statham) has been injected with a lethal virus and the only way to stat alive is keeping his adrenaline up. He needs to find the men responsible and the antidote before it's too late. It doesn't get more complicated than that, the rest is a great mix of humor and neat action scenes that will surely have you laughing and gasping for air due to its incredibility, definitely worth buying.MY PERSONAL RATING: 3 OUT OF 5"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thrill Ride","review":"\\"Crank\\" is an action-packed thrill ride that starts with the opening frame and doesn't let you down until Statham crashes to the ground. Jason Statham is perfectly cast as the assassin Chev Chelios who falls in love. Amy Smart from \\"Varsity Blues\\" as Eve is a luscious light brain with a determination to keep turning up at exactly the wrong time. Her amazing lack of understanding to what's happening around her makes the violence comic as in the sequence where she drops her purse while Chev dispatches numerous assailants without her being aware. The scene downtown where he flips up her skirt and has back door relations before a busload of ogling Japanese schoolgirls is hysterical, even if it is quintessentially poor taste. Dwight Yoakam gives a nice supporting performance as Doc Miles who keeps coaching Chev on how to stay alive. Directors Mark Neveldine & Brian Taylor keep the thrills moving a mile a second. Whatever \\"Crank\\" may be, it is not boring. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Different","review":"In this unique type of action film there's no deficit of quirky scenes. You may say 'bizarre' out loud a few times, but you'll definitely keep watching. What would you do if given a lethal injection that will stop your heart if you quit moving? This story is basically a race for revenge before a hired assassin's time runs out. Very fast-paced and a new slant on action films. I was hoping for a different ending, but oh well...Chrissy K.

Actually I turned it off after the first 30 minutes because it was so dumb. My brother convinced me to finish it because he said it got better. Well it didn't, it got worse.

It was simply bad. The soundtrack was unbearable, the cinematography will make a normal person nauseous, and the plot line was more than likely written by a drunk, stoned 17-year-old. If you plan to make it through more than 15 minutes of this film, you will also need to be heavily drugged or intoxicated.

Jason Stetham's acting and casting is superb for this role. The ultimate bad*ss, witty, the edgy personality, extreme athleticism that rival Jackie Chan. Great plot concept, Stetham backs out of a contract hit for underworld bosses, who retaliate in kind. He comes out of a trance, and discovers he's been injected with a lethal cocktail that keeps his body's from producing adrenaline. His doctor friend informs him his short life will only be prolonged by insane activity that creates adrenaline pumping through his veins. Insane physical activities ensue, buying him time to find his employers who poisoned him and to seek revenge before he keels over. Great handheld digital cam action sequences in inner city Chinatown. Amy Smart plays the airy, sexy neurotic girlfriend role perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poison in his veins. Vengeance in his heart.","review":"A hit man (Statham) learns that a poison injected into his body will kill him if his heart rate drops too much. Now he must exact his revenge on the people who injected him before he takes his last breathCrank is a violent, funny, cheesy, fun entertianing ride that is original and unique. There were some fantastic shots like the last lines of the film, and there are some great shots like the prespective of subtitles from the other person. It was just great, I had fun watching it, and the audience did too. It is sort of what Snakes On A Plane wants to be because this is good campy, b-movie fun right here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite different than anything out there","review":"In an hour and 20 minutes, this movie starts off with a bang and never lets up.

Jason Statham is awesome, and Amy Smart is usually very good, so I thought this would be a winner.The most annoying aspect to me was the way the camera jumped around, and went into this fast forward, jerky mode. That coupled with the music gave me quite a headache. I understand it was all meant to mimic the racing heart of the \\"hero\\" but it was really overdone.The action was not on par with the Transporter movies, and the humor was not on par with Snatch.The plot was rather confusing, why was he poisoned again? You don't really end up caring about any of the characters, which made it hard to get into the movie.Overall this was a disappointment, any other of Jason Statham's movies would be a better pick."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rock n Rolla","review":"\\"Crank\\" is directed by Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor. Chelios (Jason Statham) is a hitman who has been injected with a drug that will stop his heart, and the only way to fight the drug is to maintain a high level of adrenaline. Chelios then goes on a rampage hunting down the gangsters who did this to him. This film has a frenetic style of fast clips, and an almost montage style of filmmaking that reminded me somewhat of Oliver Stone's film \\"Natural Born Killers\\". Everything about the film is geared towards a hyper-realism. This is a brilliant film that never slows down. Buckle up!This film is presented with a 2.35:1 aspect ratio, and in 7.1 PCM Audio (uncompressed) or 5.1 Dolby Digital Surround EX Audio in English with Spanish subtitles. The soundtrack is loud and clear and one of the best to test your system with. Crank was filmed with high definition cameras and its high clarity images and knock out color and contrast reflect this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Fun","review":"This is for those of you who just want an action film. No real complicated stories, no subplots, just balls out action. Statham is well known for his work in the Transporter movies as well as the Italian Job. He is a believeable action hero and a fair actor. After being injected with poison, he must keep his heart rate up by any means or die. The rest of the film is him doing just that as he chases down the men who did this to him. Things are often unbelieveable, but who want realism when you can have world class action from one end of L.A. to the other. Turn up the surround sound and enjoy the explosions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cranked up!","review":"This is a non-stop action like \\"Gone in 60 Seconds\\". Incredible visual and special effects make it quite different. You will not be bored and more than likely entertained if you enjoyed \\"Transporter 2\\", \\"Saw 3\\", \\"Snatch\\", or \\"Layer Cake\\". Good acting, good effects, and decent music. All make it worth at least a rental. I plan to buy a copy since I can see watching it from time to time.A hitman wakes up and finds a video to play that indicates he has been given an Asian drug that will kill him in an hour. He starts to go after the gang leader that poisoned him. He finds out he can stretch out his time to live if he stays pumped up on anything to keep his heart pounding. This includes all kinds of stimuli, legal and illegal. Lots of killing and car chases. Not for young children."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hyperactive, Hypnotic, Hip.","review":"Wonderfully hyper-kinetic, \\"Crank\\" opens with style and piles on the action all the way to the end credits. Rapid cuts, flashing images, split screens and wild camera angles are interspersed by momentary psychedelic slow-downs that might be a child passing in the other direction, or a bird's heart beating in its chest, the juxtaposition of the pell-mell against the sublime imbuing these moments with beauty and meaning. Jason Statham is tough and highly competent--he does his own stunts--and the dry Brit wit makes him the total action package. \\"Crank\\" is ninety minutes of well-crafted adrenaline."},{"rating":"2","title":"80 MINS OF NON STOP ACTION","review":"in a nutshell it is 80 mins of non stop action. chev is a hit man and is injected with cocktail of posion,, basically he he stops moving he will die. in most parts its just your normal overrated action flick and in some parts its really over the top cool. my dislikes are that it had the typical plot of every action movie..and it allso has some dark comedy,,but the sex scene takes the cake,,(very funny) in closing if u dont like the typical action flick then this is not for you then..(Rated R for, Strong Violence,Language,Nudity,Sexual Content, Drug Use.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cranked up way too much","review":"The Good Things:-Jason Statham is in it-It has a good conceptThe Bad Things:-Incredibly hyper film style-Highly unrealistic events (such as when the guy makes a phone call while freefalling...)-Action scenes are not impressiveThis is another tragic case of a good idea poorly executed. I truly believed that this would have been a good story, with a good message about living your life while it lasts (because the guy is racing to keep himself alive). The film only vaguely approaches this theme. For the most part, however, it is a shallow, emotionless, hyperactive spiel of crud. I could probably name dozens of other action movies that are way better.

There is almost no dialogue here. The only relief is the man's dumb blond girlfriend who doesn't notice all the violence all around her until it hits her in the head.

Many of the things that happen in the movie are totally pure fiction, and do not try to apply logic to most of the scenes. It is a hard-core action movie meant to entertain and take you away for a few hours from our regular, routine existence. I liked Jason and Amy in this flick. Chev Chelios is one wild and crazy dude.

Could be that it is just not my kind of movie and the friend likes this kind of crap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fully Charged","review":"In a frantic/frenetic search for an adrenaline high to counter the effects of a deadly poison administered by a dangerous gangster, Chev Chelios (Jason Statham) aggressively searches for excitement in a variety of activities which include driving a highly muscled large car through a crowded shopping mall, riding a motorcycle in a manner that would have impressed Evel Knievel, and engaging in a very public display of affection for a most beautiful woman. There are also vigorous foot chases, hand-to-hand combats, and more than a few slam-bang gunfights.Although many of Chelios's frenzied acts seem senseless, it could be argued that they reflect all life's desire to maintain. The film's depiction of the heart's response to a wide range of stimuli is state of the art.Highly recommended because of the intensity and catchy soundtrack."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crank","review":"Probably one of the biggest wastes of money I have ever endured.

He play a hitman that gets injected with a poison, and the only way to try and beat it is to keep his adrenalin up. So the movie revolves around the unbelieveable thing he has to do to get his adrenalin going...and then some. Not only does he get even with the man that poisons him, its non-stop smash'em up action doing so. Great movie that should leave any man revert back to a caveman from the testosterone raising action.

The film was well-acted, with Amy Smart stealing the show, and some of the cinematography was interesting. Beyond that this film was abysmal. The direction felt off from the beginning, the story was forced, and what campness should have conveyed as humor fell flat. It's not worth your time or taking up space in your queue. In fact, we're still not sure how it made its way into ours."},{"rating":"2","title":"Time Crisis","review":"The Transporter (2002) and Italian Job's (2003) Jason Statham stars in this short, fast moving, Action/Thriller, Black Comedy. And he commands his role well.Statham carries the film as we follow his hitman character from scene to scene in real-time from the point that he is poisoned to the point where he hooks up with the only people that might have an antidote.The action is non-stop. The dialogue bounces around from clever to comic. The comic dialogue goes along with deliberate, over-the-top sequences that entertain and make you laugh out loud.As I said, Statham solely sews the entire film together as he threads his way through his supporting cast, and he expertly keeps you tuned into each situation and its accompanying banter. Statham's exchanges with his epitome-of-a-stereotypical dumb blonde girlfriend (Amy Smart) are particularly humorous.First-time Directors Neveldine & Taylor make a name for themselves with Crank. Check it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I like Jason Statham, but this movie was terrible. I almost had motion sickness by the end of the movie. The sex scene in chinatown was beyond stupid. The blood was overdone, the action was too much. All in all, I'm sad to say I did watch this movie. Don't watch it, unless you like cheesey action films."},{"rating":"2","title":"fun show","review":"crank is a fun movie, jason statham is an amazing actor, and the story is crazy, unrealistic, and hopelessly entertaining. one of my favorites shows for sure."},{"rating":"2","title":"You have to know what you're getting into but it's fun as hell if you do","review":"This is one of my all time favorite movies. That being said, it is by no means a good movie. This is the sort of mind sucking action film that makes a man feel like the old caveman days are back. Just pure adrenaline, action scene after action scene comprise this movie, but frankly thats just fine. If you want a film that doesn't slow down, that gets your blood pumping, and makes you wanna climb Mt. Everest without a shirt on this is it. If you want something that is sophisticated, or has great characters and dailogue then you'd be better of with something else.Decent all around movie, but mostly fun for the sake of fun. Easily worth $10 to the right audience.(sorry for any spelling errors I may have missed)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"Well, I've had high high hopes for this movie as I really liked Jason Statham in Transporter series and Italian Job which were actually very good action movies. While I was hoping to see a similar type of movie, I had to watch one these new trendy absurd movies which reminds me a bit of Pulp Fiction. Sometimes it's too realistic and too violent but mostly very stupid. I really thought that the guy was dreaming or something when he made a call with his cellphone while he was falling from a helicopter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Under average for sure","review":"Really bad acting.Poor story.Bad musically.Unprofesional making.Lot of clich��s\\"I want to make a film as Tarantino\\".

Talk about having a busy day on your schedule.Recently released \`Crank' ('06) plays like a low budget Indie film utilizing angular, avante-garde inspired shooting angles and rapid camera movement to create the illusion of compressed time and drug-induced mania. Add to that a loud, pounding, high octane soundtrack that's all over the musical map and you have the makings of a film in a genre all its own. You'll either love it, or hate it. I fall into the latter.Definitely outrageous and original, \`Crank' had loads of potential and the right leading man (Jason Statham) to try and pull it of, however it just didn't quite work for me. One viewing is more than enough for this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really bad","review":"Even though I think that Jason Statham is an awesome performer, (See Transporter and Transporter II) and Amy Smart is absolutely gorgeous, their combined talents and looks couldn't save this turkey! This movie was so bad, as soon as I finished watching it, I gave it away!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mind Sugar","review":"Yes, it's an obscenely ridiculous sugar-rush of a ride, but \\"Crank\\" is the #1 action film of the decade. The cinematography is so over-the-top hyperactive, aggressive and stylish that it overcomes the preposterous plotline to the point where the lack of story means nothing and the action is all-consuming. Speaking as a film snob who hates 99% of modern action flicks, this is the only time I can remember a movie successfully accomplishing this. It's also helpful that Jason Statham, star of the \\"Transporter\\" films, has the best \\"I don't give a f@!k about anything\\" attitude in contemporary, dare I use the word, cinema, and is able to convey his sweaty, literal adrenalin rush to the screen and into your blood. The movie is definitely junk food for the mind, but it sure tastes good going down. Remember to take your epinephrine."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's unbelievable...","review":"This movie was unbelievable and interesting. I like the character here, he's good-looking. This movie was non-stop action following through the scenes. Nevertheless this movie was not famous. But this movie was not tiresome. I was enjoying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good blu-ray, boring movie","review":"I though the blu-ray was very good but I found the movie predictable and very boring. I bought it because of the raves of the HD quality and it is very good in that respect. I hate the movie itself though."},{"rating":"1","title":"STINK, STANK, STUNK!","review":"If I could have given zero stars for this movie, I would have. I actually feel dumb for wasting my time even talking about it.The movie aspires to be a cross between \\"Speed\\" and \\"Escape From New York\\", but doesn't come anywhere near as entertaining as either one. If you like stupid movies, well, you won't find one any stupider."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wha..?","review":"I bought this because a friend recommended it. He described it as totally insane. It is pretty much Grand Theft Auto in live action. A simple story line where Stratham runs around to stay alive. I say Crank 2 is better, but not by much... and oh my friend forgot to tell me that it was only worth renting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crank Not Even Worth 1 Star","review":"Do not see this movie what a horrible movie the story is just plain stupid I mean it had a good idea about him being poisoned and the only way to stay alive is by keeping is adrenalin up, but after seeing the movie the execution of that storyline is just plain ridiculous you sit watching that movie for the 83 minutes and you wonder what the hell is the point of movie. I would advise do not waste your money on this movie and if you decide to see this movie good luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"over the line","review":"The characters are interesting, the action is entertaining and creative in spots, and the plot was acceptably predictable (except the 1-hour-to-live deadline.) I'm sad and disappointed that whoever allowed this flick to go public thought that the sexual aspects of the action (the Chinatown incident) and some of the crude cartoon-language were titillating and funny. I found them pre-juvenile and pathetic. I've lost respect for Statham as an otherwise fine peformer and Lionsgate as a provider for accepting that trash as morally acceptable. On the assumption that Crank 2 and 3 are more of the same, I'll spend my money elsewhere. I encourage parents to see this flick before deciding whether their kids should see the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure Unadulterated Garbage","review":"I usually give films at least a half hour before I turn them off (or walk out), on this one I set a record. Six minutes!! What a piece of crap. I don't normally characterize films this way but whoa nelson. Other reviewers have taken the time to write why this is so bad, so read other 1 star reviews.

Yes, there is action, but I would say this was an action comedy for sure!!! Some unforgettable scenes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Statham bites yer leg!!","review":"I just had to own this DVD. Fast-moving, action-filled entertainment. Very funny, very clever with a few odd twists. If you like this, then Crank 2 is also a must. Extremely bad language!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Action! Action! Action!","review":"My husband insisted that I watch this movie with him, so I did. Chev has been drugged and the only way he can save his own life is to keep his adrenalin high and does he ever do it. How? By driving at fast speeds in crowded areas, getting in fight after fight and just acting totally insane every minute, just to stay alive. Definitely an action, fast paced movie and actually one that once I got involved in the story I ended up enjoying. Definitely different,and that is a good thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Look Away","review":"I'm a little embarrassed to admit that I watched Crank. I used to be a Jason Statham fan, but now I find myself not so sure. He was great in Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels and The Transporter. But this... This was just one guy's excuse to put complete junk in a movie. Let's just say that the \\"highlight\\" of the movie was the main character and his girlfriend going at it in the middle of Chinatown. And by the middle of Chinatown, I mean, on top of a newspaper stand surrounded by 50 people of Asian descent. It was like a train wreck: awful, but I couldn't look away. But when you find yourself asking \\"why did he have to take off his underwear to put on that hospital gown\\", you're watching the wrong movie. Spare yourself and rent something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too far out of date to be useful","review":"SuperCard is alive and well (<http://www.supercard.us/>), but unfortunately nobody's written any books about it lately.

I expected a great album, but what I found was a master piece . I really cannot find any down side to it. The closes thing is at times you can hear some influences from Dream Theater or Symphony X.

It also has a port to plug a headset into.The dialing buttons, mute button, headset activation button, and speakerphone button are all easy enough to use, but the other features buried in the menu system are less intuitive. Another minor gripe is that the phone can take a couple of minutes to boot back up after the power or network cables are disturbed. Also, the headset jack is positioned on the underside of the phone, and it is inconvenient to access this location on a regular basis (if you need to take your headset to phone in a quieter location, for example).Overall, this is a decent phone, but it's not perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for medical transcriptionists;All body systems complete","review":"I used this book to learn medical terminology for my career in medical transcription.

After applying this, I waited 36 hours before taking a shower. As the previous reviewer stated, the sealant turned to mush. I had to dig it all out again and start from scratch. This is the second Dap product I have bought for bathroom use, and they are both worthless. I am never buying a Dap product again.In my limited home-improvement experience, I have found that nothing compares to silicone for water resistance in the bathroom. Uncured silicone has a more liquid consistency than acrylic-based products, so it's a little harder to work with, but it dries on time and is durable. GE makes a fast-drying bath/shower silicone that works well. I used it to replace this Dap garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never use this product","review":"I had the same experience as other posters.

Again I let it set 36 hours (as instructions say to do) and again it came off the first time the shower was used. I then went to Home Depot and asked what to use. They recommended DAP Kwik Seal Plus. I repeated the procedure again with the new product, again waiting 36 hours to use the shower. This morning we used the shower and once again the caulk is coming off. I would NOT recommend this product to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"This doesn't work on showers at all","review":"I tried this material twice and it didn't work at all and to pay over $5.00 a tube is stealing from consumers.

This product is absolutely terrible. Do not buy it. No matter how perfectly you prepare the area, and cure it, it will dry to a grimy looking semi-opaque finish, rather than the high gloss white. Not will it really cure. This product is the result of some chemists' chemical problem or a storage problem that resulted in an ineffective product. You would be better off using kindergarten Elmer's paper glue. A little under $6 for a tube of this, and hours of wasted time.

It does not spread smooth, it is the consistency and stickiness of melted marshmallow, making it impossible to do a neat job and spread it. Doesn't cure. The shade of white of this caulk is absolutely horrendous as well, there is no other white grout or caulking on the planet that this would match or look good accompanying. Really I feel I should be compensated an additional $80.00 an hour, X 5 hours = $400(and that is a damned conservative estimate) of my time spent removing this garbage from my job. There is a problem with this product, and it should be removed from the marketplace. DAP should be ashamed of themselves.

It does not cover the more unusual aspect of the victim living in fear of losing his life at the hands of his mother as in my case; but does cover very fully the more usual traumas in the family context of PCB (Prolonged Child Abuse). I read it all through, then started all over again - slowly - with my yellow highlighter. It gave me confirmation and great respect of Steven Gold's immense research and practical experience in this area. One can see 'Dissociation' in action from the social family viewpoint. Definitely a good study/read for those dealing with trauma victims as survivors or those in recovery. This is reality. (We are not alone!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Helpful Insights","review":"I had heard before that a person's family of origin had an impact, sometimes a big impact, on how long it took and how difficult it could be to recover from abuse.

It was for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing Book-Enless lists","review":"The book does little explaining and does a lot of quoting of other sources (this person says this way, that person thinks it should be done that way....) Every attempt at an explanation is really just another list. The book is list upon list, and doesn't connect the dots in any meaningful way! Hardly a way to get to know the subject. The overwhelming use of abbreviations (BAA, BPE, SCI, CAA, SCM, etc., etc.) makes understanding even worse because you have to try to remember what the initials stand for, sometimes chapters later. Probably Ok if you have already done software engineering for years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Amateur DVD","review":"Most of this production could be made in anyone's lounge by blocking off one corner and throwing down a mat on the floor. The models are very average and there seems to have been no direction to pose or perform.

Dolphina does a pretty good job of explaining the veil movements, and she wasn't quite as annoying to me on this video as she was on some of her previous ones.I found that this was a pretty good upper body workout, especially for days where you don't want anything really high intensity. I do recommend that you use a veil for it though. A towel does not work, and you can't really tell if your form is correct without the veil."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Fun Workout","review":"This video is such a fun and surprisingly good workout for the arms. I do weight training and I am in good shape, but this workout uses the muscles in a different way and I felt the burn! Some of the moves are challenging, and gave me a good laugh.

Her cuing is good, attention to detail, use of analogies & the pace is good. But Neena & Veena, Neon, Suhaila, Jenna, Jillina, Sonia, Blanca, Rachael Brice & even Amira (though her form is sloppy too), teach & dance better. Dolphina's form is a bit sloppy, but she still has more fluidity then Rania & Tanna.There are 3 trailers on her site at Goddessworkout com"},{"rating":"2","title":"I thought it was a lot of fun!","review":"As a new bellydance student, I was looking for something to practice with between classes. I bought this DVD to give me a little headstart before the instructor brings out the veils. To be honest I've been a huge fan of the Bellytwins, Veena and Neena, so I was a smidge skeptical of Dolphina. But as I worked out with the DVD I found that I caught on better with Dolphina's instructions. It's great for practice. Obviously, it's a workout for beginners, so take it for what it's worth. Just because she doesn't explain all the spiritual meanings or have a hooka-pipe for set dressing, it doesn't mean it's an \\"insult\\" to bellydancing as that last review suggested.

She will explain the move one way, demonstrate it, then when it's time to go full speed she does it a totally different way. If you're not interested in really learning veil work and just want to swish some fabric around in your living room, maybe this is for you. If you want clear instruction that will actually teach you something, look elsewhere. There are lots of other videos on Amazon that are made by actual belly dancers!

It surprised me to see it because it was not on Jade Tree records, but Epitaph. I hate to say it, but i think The Promise Ring has sold out. Davey sounds somewhat annoyed and desperate as he sings \\"I've been the next big thing since i can remember me.\\" Gone are the simple, honest songs that sounded so refreshing on their previous albums. In their place are radio-friendly pop songs with everything from sring arrangements to a backing choir. Compared even to Very Emergency, it sounds over-produced and even hackneyed at times. What let me down the most about this album is its lack of the joy we heard on Very Emergency and the previous records. Having said all that, i could be wrong and just bitter that TPR has changed their sounds so dramatically, but this album makes me doubt Davey's intentions when he sings \\"happiness is all the rage.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"rip PROMIsE RING","review":"It is always a sad day when a band that started a trend and could only be defined in themselves can suddenly draw comparisons from other bands. Wood Water is another album in the ever growing alt country genre. yes, this album sounds like a little wilco, a little ryan adams and so forth. Instead of creating a new music genre (nothing feels good), the promise ring have now limited themselves into a pre exixting one. And with woodwater, they dont even do anything interesting, just cliche' alt country. no, its not twangy country, but you certainly cant rock out to this record."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad but stiil good","review":"This is not one of my favorite albums by The Promise Ring, a matter of fact it is the only one i do not like, and I think that they really changed since Nothing Feels Good.

These guys are trying too hard to sound like everyone else: Blink, Weezer, Green Day, etc.They are an okay live band, except when the singer makes fun of other bands (that have actually made it like Lynyrd Skynyrd). I wouldn't invest too much money in these guys. They may get their 15 minutes of fame, but as far as real staying power, they shouldn't quit their day jobs."},{"rating":"2","title":"A New Sound for TPR","review":"Probably the first thing that comes to mind when considering Wood/Water is that it's 'different.' And it is. They've strayed from the upbeat and poppy songs of Very Emergency, but the songs are still catchy. They all tend to be slower and mellower, which makes for a great album to listen to all the way through, again and again (played it 3 times in a row the first time I got it....). There's a lot of good backup vocals on it as well that really enhance the songs. 'Letters to the Far Reaches' is probably the only song that I don't enjoy.I first heard 'Stop Playing Guitar' and 'Say Goodbye Good', and I think they're the 2 instantly catchy songs that sound like what you would expect them to play. Personal favorites include 'Become One Anything One Time', 'Half Year Sun', and 'Bread & Coffee'."},{"rating":"2","title":"promises so much...and delivers","review":"Ok, first listen left me a little dissapointed - this record is NOT as immediate as previous TPR efforts, but equally as rewarding and enjoyable..given time..Much in the same way that the Get Up Kids new album is a step away from their 'punkier' roots, so Wood/Water demonstrates how the Promise Ring have grown whilst still retaining the honesty of their earlier efforts.

Children will fall in love with this book. This book tells about the heroic story of Joan of Arc, the French maid that helped France win a war against England, and died a heroin. I think children will think she is a saint, and she is a great role model for children. Here children can learn from Joan, about bravery, courage, and patriotism.

My 6- and 8-year-old children sat glued to their seats as I read this story to them. The causes of the Trojan War (The Golden Apple, Paris and Helen) are explained well, and the ensuing battles are depicted with vivid details. Alan Lee's illustrations are perfect for this story-- they give a clear idea of what is happening without being gory. My children loved this book, as did I. I heartily recommend it for a read-aloud, or even for an adult who hasn't read \\"The Iliad\\" by Homer. It's a wonderful introduction."},{"rating":"1","title":"no illustrations in my edition","review":"I have not yet read this book- so my review is only based on my disappointment that I bought this book after reading about the wonderful illustrations.

I read the wonderful reviews about the illustrations and thought the book sounded perfect. While the cover is beautiful, it is the ONLY illustration in the whole book. The older edition must be the one with the pictures, I will be checking into whether or not it is still available."},{"rating":"2","title":"Black Ships Before Troy (Hardback edition)","review":"I have read several versions of The Iliad and after checking this book out from the library, decided this was the one I wanted in my permanent library.

Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Black Ships Before Troy","review":"Most anyone knows that they are supposed to read Homer's Iliad at some point in their life, but many are intimidated by its complexity. For starters, try Rosemary Sutcliff's Black Ships Before Troy. It is a beautiful and delightful read for all ages. You can easily sort the characters and get a grip on the plot without wading through the epic or the longer narrative. Once you have done this, you may muster the courage to attack the Iliad itself and impress all of your friends, or you can just let them think you are an expert in ancient literature after Black Ships Before Troy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Transports the reader","review":"My children and I have read this book together several times.

It is very well written because the book explains the story very well. It starts out with the story of how the war got started, and slowly made it to the war. The only confusing part is all of the names. I am not used to the names and that makes it even harder to remember who is who. Overall this was a very good book, and I recommend reading it.

Dont forget folks, that the disc is dual sided..just turn it over and the other film is on that side. I used to work at a DVD testing facility, so what I have figured out regarding the full screen/wide screen aspect problem is, it seems to be a player issue. Some players will read both aspects,and others won't. Don't give up if you cant view the 16x9 wide screen. Try it in another player or your laptop,because its definetly on there. Although if you cant play it in your living room, then perhaps return it, or consider a better quality dvd player.

His account of the Silk Road is fascinating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slogging along in the Shadows of the Silk Road","review":"Barren landscapes, indigenous people desperate to leave; temples and monuments crumbling in ruin and the author covers it all in three hundred and forty four pages of barren text leaving the reader desperate to leave the book. Traveling the Silk Road could have been a fascinating adventure but this book offers no insight, portrays no curiousity as to why things are they way they are and if you can make it to the end of the journey you have endured!There are numerous better sources of first hand accounts of adventure travel in these regions. It is simply too hard to find kind words, a compliment, or a recommendation for this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A path through the ancient and modern world","review":"Thubron makes the Silk Road come alive with both his eye for contemporary detail and his knowledge of its history. The paradoxes of the modern world are evident throughout--the embrace of Western popular culture and the weariness with Western values, for example. Thubron goes the local route and suffers most of the same inconveniences and indignities as the locals and provides insight into the response to SARS and the reaction to recent conflicts in the region. I knocked off a star for a collection of minor reasons: The maps are of limited use; there is an elliptical quality to several parts of the book and it appears that content was deleted (e.g., Tubron has letters for two friends who are never heard of again after mention of the letters); the purpose of the trip seems to get lost and the ending is a bit abrupt; and a bibliography would have been helpful. Even so, this is a book that beautifully captures details about people, places, and time."},{"rating":"2","title":"living shadows","review":"A well written text.

That's evenm more than the Star Wars sets!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Portrayal of the Game","review":"Now, I'm not a big fan of reading books, but I have beaten this game many many times and figured I'd check it out. I was so surprised to see myself not want to put the book down.This book portrayed the game perfectly, it went from character to character, describing all of their events and what related to the game.It even added a little bit of background events and dialogue that wasn't in the game, such as Wesker's manipulation of Barry to get him on his side. Also Barry's thoughts about the whole situation and having to lead Jill to Wesker. There was also a meeting of the S.T.A.R.S. teams prior to leaving to investigate.If you're looking for a very detailed novel that includes blood, gore, and of course swearing, or maybe you're just a huge fan of the game like me, then I strongly suggest this book.It's not a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be under Young Teens","review":"What a shame to give such a good idea to such an untalented writer. This could have been written by anyone who played the game and has never written a thing. It was a quick and pathetic read that should be placed in the young teen section of bookstores. Please don't waste your money on this book or they might hire the author for future installments. This is a good idea that should be done by good writers."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was a disappointment","review":"The game having poor acting does not account for this book's complete lack of writing skill.

But if you just PLAY the game you don't experience the whole plot of the Umbrella Conspiracy. Besides S.D. Perry did a splendid job at putting more detail into the simple aspects of game (like in the caves, she describes how it feels, in the game it only shows you what it looks like). If you are an addict to the game, the series will be interesting because it digs into the cospiracy and the cover-up of the T-virus spill. I suggest, if you are into Resident Evil don't just pick up this book , pick up the whole series."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is awesome!! A must for Resident Evil fans!","review":"Ilove Resident Evil.This book was outstanding. S.D Perry magnificently establishes characterzation by telling about each character's background[even Joseph,Brad and all the Bravos!] and tells the story from each character's prespective[mainly Chris,Jill,Barry,Wesker,Rebbeca,and even Brad!]It also tels and describes the Umbrella conspiracy very vividly,so if you didn't understand the video game or just want to know more about the thrilling story,than this book is a definite addition to your Resident Evil collection! Even if you haven't played the video game and don't know much about Resident Evil than you should still get this book and it will explain it all thoroughly.

I thought it was a very descriptive book. The words were very detailed with what was happening. The book perfectly explained the stench and look of the monsters in the mansion.

Resident Evil Umbrella Conspiracy leads any reader to the unthinkable nightmare of the mysterious dilemmas surrounding the murders. Each scene is one teeth grinding, hold-your-seat moment of suspense and fear. Moments are detailed and well-structured for any fan of the hit popular game resident evil."},{"rating":"2","title":"you thought that was good.....","review":"The book was great as all the other reviews say and just like the story, and alot of people thought it was realy gory and if thats what your looking for read the book(also based on a video game and by pocket books)DOOM: Knee Deep In the Dead. Its wall to wall gore, zombie killing, weapon packing and the story is better (if you played the game to RE you knew what was gona happen) and 10times the blood and gore. It is also part of four but the first is the beast. So if you want real gore and violence go with DOOM, though RE was really good."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST BOOK I'VE EVER READ!!!!","review":"This book is based on a game that I personaly love, so I decided to read the book.

This is a suspence thriller with a must read sticker slapped on the front!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointment","review":"I couldnt understand why this book was getting such good reviews. But then I realized that everyone says they played the game for like 15 mins or so. Ive played All The RE games and beat every one of them And in My opinion their was ALOT more Hapening in the games than what Perry had wrote. I was quite bored with it but i decided that ill read the whole collection before I critisize it I love the Game series And hoped that the books would get better.Half way thru Book 4 I gave up.There Was A big Scene in the game i was waitin to read but it never happened.I think Alot of the key elements of the story were cut out and replaced with the B.S. Like Jill Solving The Puzzle Of The Colored Paintings.If you want better Story That will actually scare you, Play the games. If you Suck at games Buy the Stratey Guide too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yaaaawwwwwnnnnnn...","review":"Dull. Boring. Tedious. I can't think of any other words to describe this book. Based on the Resident Evil video game, the book is never able to translate the creepiness of the game to paper. The only reason I would give for reading this book is for the Resident Evil junkie to get a broader picture of what went on inside the Spencer Mansion, otherwise, this book is just a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"GARBAGE","review":"I can't believe I wasted money on this junk. After impatiently waiting to read this series of books, I was terribly disappointed. I have read the first four books in this series and wasted my money on every one. DON'T BUY THESE BOOKS! The author doesn't know anything about the Resident Evil games and insults people who have played them. They read like they are written by a small child who is failing beginner English. Trust me; don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible book!","review":"Pardon my french but...this book bites the big one! i mean come on! zombies with butt cheeses?!?!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Mediocre Novel on a really silly game.","review":"S.D. Perry is a decent writer but her best work seems to be only the Aliens paperback series. Resident Evil never had a good story to begin with. Heck, Resident Evil wasn't even an original game at all. It's a big rip off of the old PC game Alone in the Dark by Capcom, a stupid software developer who makes crappy titles. And the book, while a bit better, doesn't help Resident Evil much. If you want good some good novels or stories, do yourself some good and check out authors like William Gibson, Stephen King, Dean Koontz, or Kevin J. Anderson."},{"rating":"2","title":"This taste of Resident Evil will leave you itching for more!","review":"S.D. Perry's first Resident Evil novel is a straight forward adaptation of the first game, perhaps a bit too straight forward. The characters run through all the game's famous spooky and gruesome obstacles, but it lacks a certain dramatic punch. Too often Perry opts to simply describe a brief run in with each of the game's threats and/or puzzles and then just rush on to the next one without any attempt at exploiting it for optimum suspense with a more drawn out battle and/or mental legwork. Despite that sometimes irritating weakness, the book, like the game, is just too much fun of a ride to not recommend. In the book's favor, Perry sketches in details and background that fleshes out the setting and characters quite nicely, leaving this reader hungry for more. Good thing it's become a series, the book is as addictive as the game, I couldn't put it down. Required reading for all Resident Evil fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breath Taking","review":"this book kind of truged on in the begining but then picked up in a flash and i would deffenitly recomend this book to all teens that enjoy a good on the edge suspence book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"4 S.T.A.R.S.","review":"This book truly captured the spirit of the game itself. It had puzzles built into this just like the challenging levels that we have grown used to with this name, Resident Evil. The only thing that faltered, was the ending, so don't get your hopes up for a shocking finale. Just remember, you have 5 more books to go."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW","review":"BUY THIS BOOK. IT WAS THE MOST EXCITING THING I READ DURING THIS WHOLE YEAR. IN FACT I HAVE THE WHOLE SERIES AND I CASNT WAIT FOR MORE TO COME OUT. BUY THE WHOLE SERIES.

What really impressed and imersed me into this book though was how S.D Perry provided a hidden incite into the activites of Albert Wesker the Stars captain which is something the game kept behind shut doors also the book stayed truthful to the game with out making it a straight and boring walkthrough of the video game. overall a superb read"},{"rating":"2","title":"Resident Evil Umbrela conspiracy","review":"Excelent book. It was like reading the game. I could not put it down. It was so fun getting to see Wesker's perspective."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"Resident Evil: The Umbrella Conspiracy was a great book and provided more of a story for what the game couldn't!

There was a lot of suspense. It also didn't hurt to add those little pieces of funny, sarcastic comments."},{"rating":"2","title":"Resident Evil Fever Forever","review":"Very impressed with Perry. It shows he did his homework here. He wrote it just like the game. Obviously, he played the game or researched the game. This novel should be screenplayed for the film.

Thank you, Perry!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good story","review":"I have many other books of this series and I enjoy everyone and this one is very enjoyable too. It's worth the money It is a reprint it is not an original book."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a keeper.","review":"This is one great book. I couldn't put it down once I started reading. I was unsure about whether to buy it or not, but then I did. I'm glad I did. Everything from the game started to make even more sense once I finished the book. And the combining of the two adventures was excellently executed. This is by far one of the best books I've read in a while."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good novelization to the game","review":"Was thinking this was going to be another \\"Doom\\" novelization (aka - good game, crappy books) but after reading through, that was all changed. This is a great read and worth the money. And it will enhance your enjoyment of the game after reading it. Mostly because it fills in a few questions on what some of the people were thinking and doing during throughout the game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whoa!","review":"I have only played the game once, but this was the bomb. I read it in two days! I couldn't put it down. It was the most awesome book I have read in a long time! I can't wait to get the next book! If you like Resident Evil you must get this book! Get the whole series! The way S.D. perry descirbes the zombies is so freakin' cool. They say things like the crusty blood around it's lips. The prologue has some newspaper clippings. You must read this book! It's so cool!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"So far so good.....","review":"I haven't read the whole book yet (they've just now entered the mansion) but so far it's pretty cool. I liked the additional news-paper clippings in the prologue, and I LOVED how it described what the characters were doing that led up to the events in the game. However, I do not like how Jill swears so smegging much. Yes, it makes it more life-like, but she didn't swear in the game and her swearing in the book seems WAY out of character (this is why I give it 4 *s). I really LOVE the way the author goes into more detail with the introduction than the game provided. I am most decidedly looking forward to finish reading the book and the following books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Deal","review":"This double feature is worth your buy.

The boys absolutely love it and every time they are at my parents house they ask to watch it. I purchased this for my nephew so he could have it at home and figured the second episode was a bonus, for the price you couldn't beat it.

This movie is one of the few."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh Mr. Wilsonnn......","review":"Dennis the Menace (1993) Hank Ketcham's comic strip character is brought to life as the latest attempt by John Hughes to cash in on his own Home Alone series. It's really too bad, because the film is so perfectly cast: Mason Gamble (Spy Hard) is an acceptable Dennis; Lea Thompson (Back to the Future) and Robert Stanton (Bob Roberts) couldn't be more likable as Dennis' parents; and Walter Matthau and Joan Plowright are absolutely perfect as Mr. and Mrs. Wilson. But the film, which starts off well, eventually slides directly into Home Alone territory, especially with the introduction of a thief character (Christopher Lloyd-Back to the Future) whom Dennis trips up in that painful \\"Kevin vs Harry and Marv\\" way. This one gets sooo painful, in fact, it's nearly unwatchable. Still, the kids are sure to love, so there will probably be a viewing in your future if you're a parent."},{"rating":"1","title":"RIPPED OFF","review":"i ordered this \\"new\\" for my grandson for christmas the problem is there was only one movie on it he did not get strikes again and was very dissapointed i have contacted amazon and they have never answered me so i guess thats called being ripped off!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A touching, sentimental romance.","review":"It's many years since I saw this movie, yet I would purchase it in a moment if I could find it available on video. Anyone who has had an experience like the protagonists can relate to this story. Isn't it such a basic human reaction, expecially when young, to deal with rejection by resolving to do something great to win the love of the person who rejected you? Haven't we all dreamed of doing that? It's my supposition that Joe Brooks was telling a thinly fictionalized version of his own life - and it worked. Jaded, cynical critics may not have liked it, but anyone with a heart - and a romantic streak - will enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely, but.......","review":"It is a indeed great movie.

Hope the studio releases it sometime soon!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If Ever I See You Again - NOT LIKELY!","review":"Being a huge Shelley Hack fan, I was thrilled to finally locate a copy of this movie. What a MAJOR disappointment! Shelley's character had the warmth of frozen popsicle. But even much worse is the lead actor - who sounded and looked like he was reading off cue-cards constantly. Too bad the movie doesn't match the quality of the music score. Oh well . . . .."},{"rating":"1","title":"If ever he sees you again, RUN!","review":"Dull, predictable and lifeless story about a widower who gets a second chance at love with an old flame after a chance meeting. Good thing his wife died, huh?Triple threat Joseph Brooks probably figured \\"You Light Up My Life\\" packed them in so why not build another film around another syrupy song? Sadly, the song is even worse than \\"You Light Up My Life\\" and Joseph Brooks doesn't exactly make for the best leading man. There's absolutely no chemistry with Shelley Hack and she looks bored throughout the film (in all fairness, she ALWAYS looks bored).You've been warned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why it is not being reissued","review":"Like the rest of the reviewers of this movie, I found it to be a wonderful love story that just leaves the viewer feeling good. I was fortunate enough to find a VHS copy on eBay a few years ago at a good price, so it is part of my library. Just after buying it I heard somewhere (wish I could remember where) that Shelly Hack was so unhappy with her performance that she had bought the rights to the film, and that is why it is not making it to DVD. Don't know if that is true, but if it is, I sure wish she would read these reviews, maybe they would change her mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor rendering of a good video","review":"Many years ago I bought the VHS version of Terry Dunn's Tai Chi for Health. As noted by other reviewers, the DVD is the same as the VHS; not an update, or even a remaster. Still, I figured that the DVD would be more convenient to learn from. I was wrong. The DVD has the basic lessons divided into small sections of roughly 30-45 seconds that repeat until you hit \\"Next\\". This means you have to do the form with a remote in your hand. Also, there is no way to start at the beginning, and go thru, eg. 5 sections, and then repeat that. At least with the VHS, I can do this. Although the video quality is good, I cannot recommend this DVD, especially if you already have the VHS. Too bad, as Terry Dunn is a good video teacher; I would recommend the VHS, if you can stand the quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very confusing","review":"I bought this video based on other reviews, I am sorry that I did. He is very confusing. He is constantly saying step with right leg turn 45 degrees. But when you watch the video it looks as if he turns half way around. Everything is mirror image and you need a lot of space for the movements. I think the beginning part is okay but the second is more frustrating than relaxing. I have not moved on to the third part as I get frustrated with the second and turn it off. The camera angles are terrible and he should maybe do things opposite so that we at home do not have to keep reminding ourselves..opposite, Opposite!!!! (I am a mom of 4 and have limited workout time and I can not spare the time for this frustrating video) I bought another at the same time by Dominic Stefano and it is alot better. I will look for more of his videos and avoid Mr. Terence Dunn's work. Perhaps when I retire and have time I will take a class."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Beginners like Me","review":"I just finished my 6th week and this duplicates just about everything I do in class. This is my 4th Tai Chi DVD and so far, this is the one that works best for me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Production Spoiled this Film","review":"This video was incredibly frustrating. Terry Dunn is a fine teacher, who gives clear, precise instruction, if sometimes after the fact.My chief complaint about the video is in regards to the production. All the movements are taught, what I consider to be, 'backward', that is, shown from the teacher's point of view. (His right, his left) This does not take into account that the student is standing facing the instructor, and must see, learn and then reverse every motion all at once. (His right, your left) This is pretty tough when learning new movement. I was so frustrated, after 15 minutes of this I shut the video off in the middle of the first form.All this confusion could be solved by a) Mr. Dunn reversing the movements himself, or b) showing a back view camera angle.I will probably require a book in order to learn the forms, before I turn this video back on to help with fine tuning."},{"rating":"2","title":"T'ai Chi","review":"I throughly enjoy the learning technique's provided here on this video. Having had the chance years ago to practice with Terry Dunn him self, I found this relaxing to be retaught some skills from the same teacher."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't see how anyone could learn tai chi from this video","review":"Although Terry Dunn is very pleasant to watch, it was impossible for me to follow his video instructions. Except for the warm up exercises, which he explained in a very step-by-step manner. After the warm-ups, he lost me . . . demonstrating movement after movement nonstop . . . whoa! Also I kept getting my left and right mixed up. sigh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like to be Frustrated?","review":"I am studying Shaolin Kung Fu and thought that it would be nice to complement my studies with T'ai Chi.The difficulty of following this tape is really dissapointing. Everything that you are looking at is opposite of what you need to execute. In other words, if Dunn turns left and tells you to turn left, since you are looking at a \\"mirror\\" image, it is very straining to execute the movement. If the tape had shown some of the instruction from another angle I would have given this tape a big thumbs up. Nevertheless, if you are not concerned about following the instruction due to the reasons I mentioned above then you might be able to get quite a bit out of this.The reason I gave it two stars is because the quality of the production was exemplary.Personally, I am looking for another source. Good luck, and MORE CHI!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tai Chi","review":"The dvds are very thorough and easy to follow for a beginner. The only problem is that it is time consuming. Best to take it in shorter sessions which can be easily done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terry Dunn is brilliant!!!","review":"The instruction provided in all of Terry Dunn's videos are properly executed and masterfully done. The student of tai chi should have no problem understanding and following the instruction. Persons with no background in tai chi may have some challenges because there are some basic concepts that they will not grasp even though Terry explains them wonderfully. Excellent work Terry."},{"rating":"2","title":"DVD is not a new production","review":"If you already own the VHS, you may be wondering whether this is a new production, especially since the cover photo appears to be a 40-year-old Dunn. Wouldn't you like to see the results of some 20 years of practice? Imagine, too, all the ideas Dunn must have had over the years of what he could have done better on the video. Well, sorry, it's the same production as on the VHS tape, the same 20-year-old Dunn, the same soundtrack, including the same minor errors in verbal instruction.There is, nevertheless, some advantage in the DVD format over the VHS, if you haven't learned the form yet. There is a menu, with the form broken down into about 50 short pieces, and it will cycle through a chosen short piece repeatedly until you select \\"next\\" -- or you can play straight through the entire form. If you're like me, you'll use that automatic repetition of short pieces quite a lot, on your way to learning the form."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I purchased this, with much trepidation, based on one person's 5 star review BUT indeed this is a wonderful video. The music is very appropriate and peaceful, the instruction is clear enough for beginners but the instructor's expertise is clear and will provide learning for many, many hours to come, and the instructor is wonderful, no silly jokes that will get annoying, very to the point yet not dry, seems very genuine. I am very pleased."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLANT FOR HOME MEDITATION","review":"THE DVD WAS DETAILED TO SHOW THE USER HOW TO GET THE MOST OUT OF A SELF HELP PHYSICAL WORKOUT.

I could not just put a ratchet on the tool and turn the caliper in, i had to also add a clamp."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was a fool--learn from my mistake","review":"I bought this audio book even after I read the many negative reviews. I saw a couple of positive reviews and thought it might not be that bad. Never have I been more mistaken. The didactic tone of the character Richard's \\"speeches\\" put me off. I became so frustrated that I literally fast-forwarded through an hour of Richard's diatribes. I thank Terry Goodkind for his amazing first few books and will cherish their memory, but somewhere along the way he lost the gift of story-telling. Buyer beware, you will regret this purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uhhhh...","review":"Okay, I give 1 star because giving the rythyms a phrase to say was helpfull. Unfortunetely the phrase she gave for the beledi (I-am-re-ady-for-my-massage) makes you play it wrong. Beledi is doom-doom teca-tek doom teca-tek, playing it her way is doom doom teca-tek doom tek tek. I guess she couldn't think up a cute enough phrase for it the right way. And she messed up so many times when she was doing the routines, I'm not even sure she's played the zills before. I would pass on this one, a good sub would be Zills with Ansuya from IAMED. Pricier but worth it, Ansuya would zill Dolphina into the ground ;)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the serious student","review":"I found this video to be a waste of money if you want to learn zils. Now if you want to pretend you are a Goddess and repeat silly statements (like \\"I am a belly dancer\\" and \\"I am ready for my massage\\") to learn some patterns, this is the video for you. Personally, I found this video pretty funny. The problem, of course, is that this video is not supposed to be a comedy! I am sure her heart is in the right place but I wonder why more instructors can't put out instructional videos with substance (and while I am at it, REAL middle eastern music)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"If you have a teacher who has taught you beladi (\\"i am ready for my massage ....ugh\\"!!!!) then this video is not for you. I hesitate to say it is for beginners given how short it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"'Isn't she pretty'?","review":"Unfortunately, I think that all of her bellydance tapes have been at such angles, that I couldn't learn how to do a certain part of ANY dance. I'm sure her husband, or someone who really likes her is the one taking the video, and doing the angle shots, because it may be 'pretty' for a guy to look at, but for us ladies who seriously are interested in learning, it's frustrating. Yes, she is pretty, but I won't be buying any more of her dvd's. Only gave her one star, so my message would go through, otherwise, even a star would give points down on these dvd's!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is NOT a Workout","review":"These moves are so easy that my 95-year-old arthritic grandmother could perform them without difficulty. I never broke a sweat or even warmed up. The cool-down is a total joke. There is nothing to cool down from. I gave it two stars because I did at least get to use my finger cymbals, which I enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"So not worth the money.","review":"The DVD was way too short, and is a horrible way to teach a musical instrument. I really like Dolphina's Goddess Workout so I decided to try this even though it had bad reviews. The Mudras (Yoga for the Hands) section was unique and interesting, but beyond that I didn't like it at all. Actually, forget my 1st comment. I'm glad it was so short because I could barely get through the whole thing. Dolphina makes up phrases (i.e. I-am-a-godd-ess, I'm-a-bel-ly-danc-er) to go with zill patterns and they are kind of retarded. Buy Ansuya's zill DVD instead, it is SO much better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh dear....","review":"I hate to be so negative here but oh dear me. The DVD was only 25 minutes long and much of this was taken up with Yoga for the hands. I have since noticed another DVD dealing with the same subject matter, available on this site, which is 2.5 hours long! Now that's more like it!I just felt completely short changed, however much I paid for it. I think if it had been called \\"A Very Brief and Playful Introduction to Finger Cymbals\\" I wouldn't have felt the need to join in here.Ho Hum!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great concept, but too short...","review":"This is the first and last Dolphina DVD I plan on getting. My biggest gripe with it is that it is way too short. There is a total of about 25-30 minutes of actual instruction. Thats it. A DVD can hold so much more information than that. It seems overpriced to me. Other negative aspects of it are the annoying super happy/perky high school cheerleader attitude of the instructor. It seemed forced. Also, most bellydance videos/DVDs include a professional performance at the end where you can see things come together. This does not include that.The one positive aspect of this DVD is the way that she chooses to teach the rythms. She introduces catchy phrases as ways to memorize the zill rythms as opposed ot the \\"dum-tek-a-dum\\" nonsense seeming syllables that most instructors use. Dolphina's method is easier to remember at first and therefore easier to learn if you don't have a regular instructor that you take classes under."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forget about the $, not worth your time!","review":"I actually was slightly embarrassed when watching this, thinking that someone might believe that this attempt to teach zils is an accurate representation of the artform. Maybe Dolphina's style is not my cup of tea but she seems all fluff and no substance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your Money","review":"If you really want to learn how to play finger cymbals than don't buy this. Get Saroyan-How to play finger cymbals.Dolphina shows you how to play using catchy phrases, but never breaks it down, or explains the rhythms or beats, unlike the Saroyan video. Mesmera teaches the Saroyan video and it is the most comphrensive lesson on finger cymbals I have ever seen. She has real drums, and teaches beats, and counting, and how to get the different sounds from zills and blend them together, all while teaching you how to move while playing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"The candles don't smell very good and if they did it's not even a strong smell. Don't waste your time on these. Nice idea, but not what I expected."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good show; picture quality acceptable","review":"SInce there doesn't seem to be much out there on DVD of Mink Deville, i was pretty excited to finally get to see something by them, given that they were a bit before my time. This show is from 1982, and while i don't think it has the original lineup, this incarnation is very good and plays tight. Willy is in fine form vocally, sounding like a more soulful Dylan, including the terrific cover of \\"Stand By Me\\". My main (really, only) complaints with the DVD are that i wish it were longer (it clocks in a bit over an hour) and the picture quality is sometimes a bit flat and/or not totally sharp, but i chalk that up to technical limitations of the source tape, owing to technology available at the time. No big deal - the sound is very good on this, and there is a generous set list."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great gift item....","review":"There are a lot of enjoyable anecdotes here, with quite a substantial number of close encounters with celebrities. I got a copy for my parents (who are always difficult to shop for), as many of the encounters involve celebrities they are familiar with. Another nice feature of this book is that you can read it in one sitting or one or two anecdotes at a time. Rossi's writing style is conversational, and makes for pleasant reading.It's a fun book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Memorable Reading Moments","review":"This book is fun to read. I especially liked Roger Rossi's stories about his meetings with \\"tough guys.\\" During his long career, Rossi has interacted with the famous and the infamous, celebrities and truly talented men and women, good guys and those whose standards of behavior are different than mine. Through it all Rossi maintained his integrity while having fun and sharing his music with others. This book is more than a series of stories about others. When taken as a whole, its about a talented musician who shares his feelings and lives a life that brings joy and pleasure to many people. I liked getting to know him and hope to hear him perform someday."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cone Heads","review":"Dr. Cone and her sister, Etta, amassed one of the best art collections in American history. How and when they did this is the tale contained in this nice effort by Mary Gabriel.Those interested in European art as created in the early part of the last century, by such people as Picasso and above all Matisse, will be interested in buying this book, as well as those who just want a slice of cultural history of the period. (And if you have a keen interest in Gertrude Stein, you will also want to read this rewarding, yet stylistically simple, work.)I have visited the Cone Collection at the Baltimore Museum of Art and urge all interested in great art to make the same pilgrimage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice surprise","review":"The sisters�� story sounded somewhat boring, but I LOVE the art period discussed and was nicely surprised by the book. I learned a lot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read about two extraordinary women","review":"Became interested in the Cone sisters when attending an exhibit of their collection. I wanted to know more about these two extraordinary women. This book filled in a lot of the back story. It is well written and a joy to read. I missed reading about them every day when it was finished."},{"rating":"1","title":"For frisbee collectors only","review":"Don't be fooled by the title, this is not the complete book of frisbee. Ultimate only rates a couple of pages, for starters. There is nothing to speak of on throwing technique. It is not particularly well edited, either - many assertions and heresay have slipped through the net. Lots of nice pictures of collectable discs, if that's what you're into. A bit of a disappointment given the dearth of books-in-print about throwing technique and ultimate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Biased Opinion","review":"I would have bought this book even if I weren't a D&D; geek, because I am a rabid fan of the Black Company books. I read it cover to cover with the compulsive, sweaty-palmed fervor of a devotee, but I can see some problems for most normal people:The rules make some radical departures from standard 3.5 games, totally eliminating some staples of D&D; (clerics, for instance). This has an effect of many other aspects of the game (no clerics? no quick healing...no quick healing, much higher body count). I would not recommend this for the average Greyhawk or Forgotten Realms player. Personally, that's what attracted me to the books in the first place: no elves, no unpronounceable names, and a sword in the guts will kill even the most beloved characters.The editing is ugly in places but that's a quibble.Recommeded for Black Company fans and / or very open-minded d20 players in search of some gritty and grim action."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gritty and Daring","review":"Dark fantasy and gritty realism merge to form a world where you can almost smell the battle fields and seige engines. The classes are unique and the magic system is flexible but deep beyond first blush. I spent hours just figuring out the basic spells and was amazed at the effects possible and prices the mage would pay to create them. Fans of the Conan novels or Grey Mouser will find this a good fit where magic is terrible and great but not slick and quick like classic D&D. Glen Cook's novels are well studied and the detail is amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Handy-Dandy rice cooker","review":"This rice cooker is perfect for (relatively) small batches.

It is a welcome replacement for my 14-year old Tiger cooker."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute Little Rice Cooker","review":"I got this primarily to make hot oatmeal using the timer feature so it is ready first thing in the A.M.. It works great for that. Oh, and it also makes rice! I have a large rice cooker already, but found I really needed one suited to smaller batches most of the time and this is perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great but instructions are annoying","review":"I've never had a bad batch of rice even after leaving it on warm for 8hours.The only downside is the instructions are complicated and poorly translated. I would recommend people use the quick start guide and only look at the booklet once comfortable.Also, I'm very excited to read the tips others have listed on this review. I'm going to check out the oatmeal and polenta recommendations.Last, I think it's a bit cutesy as it has a little 'song' it chirps at start and end of cooking but it does help distinguish it from other appliances which beep.So why am I not subtracting stars: wonderfully tidy on a counter with its detachable cord, nice aesthetic, great at cooking and fits inside my narrowest cupboard when not in use (and that's pretty small), it also is just obviously better workmanship than other cookers out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing.","review":"I followed the directions for long grain brown rice and it ended up entirely too moist and sticky. I really regret this purchase, given the price I paid. I will try again later in the week and cut the water by 25% and see what I get. It plays a happy tune when the rice is done, but I would rather skip the music and have the clock show me the total time left for cooking once I start the whole process - not just for the last 8 minutes!

I called their customer service dept and they told it needed to be repaired because computer chips could be damaged. So I asked them if it was under warranty since I only had for a month, they said no. They said it is not a manufacturing default. I asked them I cooked the rice according to the instruction, if it is not a manufacturing default, then what could that be? She said she had no answer, however she insisted on that was not the manufacturer's fault. I really don't understand her and don't understand her logic. I asked to talk to the manager, but only got the voice mail. I asked them to call me back but they never did. It is a very expensive product in terms of rice cooker.

We eat rice 2-3 times a week and for years it's been, \\"Is it boiling yet?, Turn it down to low heat, did it over boil?\\" Those days are over. It is easily worth double what I paid for it.

No more under-cooked or over-cooked rice for meals!Edit: I have revised this down to 4 stars due to the cord retraction mechanism. After using the cooker for about a month, the cord often will not retract and has to be stored with the cord hanging out. I would say we can get it to retract about once in 10 attempts, and the one time it works it no longer retracts fully."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the design and workmanship.","review":"Reviews are true, this cooker makes fine rice. The design and construction is first rate. I think the tactile feedback of the controls, carrying handle, cooking pot and paddle are a pleasure.

Nice job Zojirushi."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Little Machine","review":"I received this machine 10 days ago and I'm completely satisfied with it. Every batch of rice is perfect, and it's a snap to clean. The timer is a terrific feature. One note though: some reviewers have warned that the white rice capacity is only 2 cups. This isn't the case. The same scale on the bowl is used for both white rice and \\"mixed\\" rice. The scale is misleadingly labeled. The manual states that the white rice capacity is 3 cups, while the \\"mixed\\" rice capacity is 2 cups.

I own 3-4 lunch box, 1 cooljar water jar, few hot tea carriers etc..but the taste of rice is really bad. doesn't taste good at all, you could buy instant bowl of rice that use microwave to heat up, has better smell and taste than this machine. it's just small size and that is it. I'd love to return it but I already use 4-5 times to find out it wan;t me that made a bad bowl of rice...:(SO IF YOU NEED THIS SIZE RICE COOKER AND DON;T CARE ABOUT THE TASTE, THAN THIS IS THE PRODUCT FOR YOU.

Since so many rice cookers say the amount of cooked rice this led me to believe that one could put 3 cups of uncooked rice into the pot with an appropriate amount of water and turn it on. When I received the product and opened up the lid to look inside it had only a 3-Cup \\"COOKED rice\\" pot inside. It IS a 3-Cup (COOKED) Rice Cooker and Warmer, Not a 3 cup Uncooked Rice Cooker. Why they used the word \\"Uncooked\\" is beyond me. One star because of this. I don't know how well it works since I did not use it. People told me this brand is good and if 3 cups of \\"COOKED\\" rice is all you need then it's probably a good choice for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deceptive Description","review":"This rice cooker advertises it is a 3 cup cooker, which is what I wanted, but no where in the descriptipn does it mention that it cooks ony 2 cups of WHITE rice, which is what I always use. It's hardly worth the effort & $$$ to cook 2 cups of rice, in a 3 cup cooker I might add.

I think this is deceptive & should be added to the online description."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Must Have Missed The Memo...","review":"Somewhere in all the research I did I must have missed the part where they said this rice cooker was going to work well. We only cook whole grain rices and the brown rice I made was worse than wallpaper paste. Never seen such a gluey, nasty mess in my life. The directions for this are dodgy at best. Somewhere I also got the impression that this was going to be a fabulous improvement on cooking rice the regular way. No one mentioned that it takes twice as long. Maybe this is a good product if you are cooking white rice, but if you plan to use it for whole grains and brown rice don't waste your time. I'll be going back to my regular steamer with it's rice insert. That wasn't great either, but way better than this. On my way to return this now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rice steamer ok","review":"This is a very nice steamer.

Perfect for a couple or a single person, anymore you would need a 5 cup model. The warmer is awesome! It still warms the rice like you just cooked it, without it going smelly or hard. Another great feature is the programming, it cooks when I want it to cook automatically!The bad qualities of this product is minor. I wish they would make a more attractive style. Even though it is stainless steel accent, there is still that plastic white around it. Also the porridge setting works, I was mistaken for it to make congee. So it does makes mushy rice porridge, but it does not make watery congee rice. I wish it comes with a steamer rack, but I guess this version is too small. Another minor thing is the cooking programming time, it goes by military time, not by 24hr."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Cooking Appliance I own!","review":"This machine is extremely well made and the performace is great.

Compared to me last rice cooker, that would burn to the bottom and spit everywhere while producing dryer-than-preferred rice, the NS-LAC05 is a dream. Add to the fact that it is small, super quiet, amazingly easy to clean, chimes \\"twinkle-twinkle-little-star\\" to you, has a retractable cord that is very long, easy to use and is even kind of sexy, then you have yourself a hit! Setting a timer and coming home to perfectly cooked rice doesn't hurt either. I am eager to start preparing some of the \\"Ultimate Rice Cooker Cookbook\\" recipes as well.

Works great for me"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this rice cooker.","review":"This rice cooker is one of my prized possessions. I literally use it every day. It makes rice perfectly. Isn't that what everyone wants in a rice cooker? I live alone, so it's nice to be able to make just a cup of rice. I love the little music it plays when the rice is done. If you're cooking for one or two people in your home, this rice cooker is for you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy Excellent Exact","review":"I couldn't be happier with ours. Set it in the early AM to go off sometime in the late PM and you'll come home to the base of a fantastic dinner. Looking for a treat? After it is all cooked, sprinkle some white or brown sugar on brown rice and add berries, nuts, or raisons (or all of the above). It even takes well to cream.Of course, for healthy eating, it can't be beat. Add anything to it and whatever you invented will taste great.The 2 cups max for this cooker makes more than enough for my husband and me - 1.5 cups is just about right. I think it could easily serve 3 to 4 adults, especially if the rice is mixed with other things.Best - it's EZ to clean."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Rice Cooker","review":"This is the best rice cooker i have ever owned. Its easy to use and makes wonderful rice. I make steel cut oats every morning and brown rice every night. I just set it at night and its ready for breakfast and then put brown rice in and set it for when I get home from work. I would highly recommend this rice cooker if your a rice \\"expert\\" and appreciate the taste and texture of well cooked rice. BEST KITCHEN APPLIANCE EVER."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"Before having rice cooked with this rice cooker, I didn't know how tasty rice could be... Well, this cooker is great! Only drawback is the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Rice, Great Look, but all good things take time.","review":"It's a great rice maker - makes good rice without effort. My only cause not to give it 5 stars is that it takes a long time to make the rice - approximately 2-3 times longer than my old cheapo rice cooker. BUT the rice it does make is way better. I especially enjoy the timer function so I can wake up to freshly made rice or oatmeal in the morning. I would say that it is definately worth the money so far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible!","review":"I used the comparable Sony rice cooker for a long time, and was generally satisfied with it. But this one is far superior. It cooks perfectly every time and cleanup is much easier than with the Sony. I recommend it wholeheartedly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice little rice cooker","review":"Upgraded an older rice cooker with this one and am very glad that I did. No mess from the rice bubbles / resulting film. A little concerned about the life of the battery that runs the internal clock since it appears that you are supposed to send it in for sercive when it dies.I'm not 100% happy with the need to use the included measuring cup since a 1 \\"cup\\" measure is really only about 3/4 cup. This means that you're portions will be off if you ever lose (or forget to use) their measuring cup.

The cooking surface is a non stick coating (probably teflon). I returned the item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misrepresented. Steer clear if you care about your health.","review":"The headline on this product says \\"Stainless Steel.\\" That's BS. The outside of the cooker is stainless steel. The bowl in which the rice is cooked is coated with a miracle space age material, manufactured along with the rest of the product in--you guessed it--China. If you want to ingest that unknown material along with your rice, buy this cooker. Otherwise, stay away. I didn't even bother to try it. Just put it in the dumpster. There are less risky ways to make rice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Updated Review","review":"UPDATE:Gave this thing away - too complicated, the instructions are mostly in japanese. Found that I got better results on stovetop.The operating instructions are quite vague. I am still trying to figure out how to use it. The timer is a little difficult to figure out. I'll post again once I have mastered it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"I always read the reviews to see what others say, so I will add a very short comment. It works great and it holds the rice to keep it warm without drying out or scorching. Replaced a $60 rice cooker with this one and am not sorry. I can't believe that you won't be happy if you buy it. Don't do like I did and try to save money and buy a cheaper cooker, or like me, you will end up settling for less that perfect, way less, or spending the money for the cheaper one and the good one. Hope this helps you as so many reviewers helped me decide. Spend the extra, buy it, use it, be happy with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love my Zo","review":"This rice cooker is the best small appliance I have ever bought. That seriously means allot because I have ALLOT!. All you do is rinse the rice , measure accurate and the results is amazing , Delicious rice. I think I'm on about my 30-35 batch in 2 1/2 months and all have been almost perfect. A little more water ,than asked for, is improving certain grains. I am thinking of buying a second for the work place. But for that i am going to go to the larger size so my co-workers can enjoy as well.

Highly recommend it, well worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic - I use it regularly","review":"I purchased in 2009 and it is still going strong (2012). Still works perfectly and still looks good. The size is perfect for a single person. It would also be fine for a couple and perhaps a small family. It does not take up too much room. While I do not use all of the features of this great little machine, the features I do use are very helpful."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'll Never go Hungry Again...","review":"This thing is incredible. Don't waste your time with other rice cookers that will just make ok rice then you won't use anymore. It's amazing how evenly this thing cooks the rice. There's no bottom layer of burnt crispy rice crust like you get with cheap rice cookers. I wasn't a big rice eater till I found this gem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where have you been all my life ?!?!","review":"I recently purchased this very rice cooker. With as much Hanmi steamed rice that I eat, I easily justified the expense. Incidentally, I found the lowest price right here at Amazon.com - simply couldn't beat it!This unit is one amazing little computerized cooker. I didn't think it would be possible to have the restaurant quality rice at home.

I can't say that the quality of rice is any better, and it does seem to take a long time to cook. My daughter loves the little song it plays at beginning and end though. The timing and other features work well, though we rarely use them. It makes good rice, just not anything special as far as I can tell. We eat rice just about every day."},{"rating":"2","title":"A better rice cooker........really!","review":"This rice cooker really does make better rice!

The cover of this book shows an attractive naked girl lying down in front of an older man and a dominant-looking older woman. So far, so good. But the inside of this book is overly raunchy and far less erotic. There's precious little lesbianism, and instead there's lots of XXX-rated male-to-female stuff that I found far too hard-core and generally uninteresting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasant Surprise","review":"Right off there are definitely cheaper ones available on Amazon but those got horrible reviews.

I admire the author for keeping it short and sweet, for not overextending the material.It's a pretty basic plot: Rustin Parr admitted to the murder of seven children in Burkittsville, Maryland in 1941. He was a hermit, anyway. Sentenced to be hanged, he confessed a shocking truth to a priest named Dominick Cazale on the night before his execution. Cazale doesn't reveal the truth until he is own his own deathbed, 60 years later, as a result of a tragic house fire.As with the Blair Witch movies, the twists and the ending of this novel tie-in are ambiguous and open to interpretation.

The suspense and drame, tied in with the few action scenes that are in the film really make this a must-see for any Heston fan. Heston is perfectly cast as the pilot, who is ready to go down fighting for his passengers and aircraft. James Brolin, young, vibrant, and extremely unpredicable and intense as the flipped out Army Vet is absolutely convincing as the terribly misunderstood villian. Check out the scene where Brolin uses his Green Beret karate tricks to take on Rosie Greer and some of the other \\"Hero\\" passengers. It is one of the best moments in the film, when Brolin pulls out a grenade and yells out, \\" Alright you hero's, come and get it!\\" But of course in the end, it comes down to only two who must square off face to face in this wonderful suspence drame. Supporting cast is great too. Pick up your favorite beverage and pop some corn, sit back and enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"just terrible","review":"This movie is a total waste of time- except maybe for the sequences showing the 707 in flight- still a beautiful airplane.The plot is contrived, and stupid. Charleton Heston is his usual overacting self- and most all the other actors seem to be just going through the motions. Roosevelt Greer was attempting to build a career as an actor at the time, and you can clearly see why he's not acting now. James Brolin's performance as the hijacker is embarassing to watch, particularly when he starts to look like a wild-eyed lunatic.One of my favorite parts of this movie is when the Soviet fighters (North American F-100 Super Sabers)intercept the airliner in Alaska and then proceed to escort it ALL THE WAY ACROSS THE SOVIET UNION to Moscow.One particularly hilarious thing is where they dub a deeper voice for John Fiedler (the mousey guy who always played a dormat.)

However, anyone shopping for a grill should consider the full-size, 22.5 grill.We bought the 18.5 because our family is small and I figured this would be plenty big enough. What I didn't consider was that a larger grill will give you lots of additional options for indirect cooking and smoking. The 18.5 just doesn't have the space, even for a small family. If you only want to cook burgers and hot dogs for 3 to 4 people, the 18.5 will serve fine but you won't have much versatility.Now that I've \\"grown\\" as a griller, I wish I had the One-touch Platinum. This model gives extra space, an ash catcher, temp gauge, sliding lid and 2 side tables. However, my 18.5 is still going strong after 5 years of steady use and sitting in the elements.

In addition, there are charts summarizing key grammatical features of the language.Less useful is the Atajo CD that accompanies the book. Buy the book used if you can, and don't worry if you get the CD with it-or else just ignore the CD when you get the book. The word-processing program is nice if you have no other way to type accents in Spanish, but take a couple hours and learn to type accents in Word and you won't need this program anymore (hint: for PC users, type CTRL+apostrophe+vowel to get the necessary accents ��, ��, ��, ��, ��; CTRL+~+n (make sure you release the shift key before typing the n!) for the ?)...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Texas","review":"Was not as promoted (very good condition--and I even asked if it was suitable for a gift)--yellowing pages and frayed a little"},{"rating":"2","title":"Texas on the Halfshell","review":"Most if not all recipes my wife uses has come from this book.

I'm sure there are some really spectacular family recipes in this book. But do I need forty-eight chili recipes that are all quite similar? Some of the recipes call for ingredients such as \\"1.5# beef lard\\", \\"2 cups Oleo\\", and other ingredients that either aren't common or don't even exist anymore. Some recipes do not list quantities, just ingredients. And some are so simple that I don't know why they are in this book (i.e. Chili con queso: 1 can chili and 1/2 lb. cheese).

The chair is lightweight and the metal parts are very sturdy. The plastic chair seat is not. It broke in six places on the third use, pinching and cutting her in the process. She would have probably had to have stitches if we hadn't also got the optional chair pad.Our relative's surgery was delayed and the chair sat in the box for a long time before she used it. Amazon won't replace the defective seat (we didn't expect Amazon to) and neither will the manufacturer. We are horribly disappointed that VQ Action Care does not stand behind their product or care that it caused an injury. Their response was to sell me a replacement seat for $40.

A DVD comes with the chair that shows anyone how to set it up and how to use the chair. No screw drivers are needed. It stores easily on all 4 legs so it can't tip over. The exercises are easy.

I consider men to be the dreamers, the intuitive ones. I couldn't finish it.I believe that males \\"are\\" therefore they are.

The writing is not very good and the author does not go in depth with each woman she interviews. I found this book boring, and more for those women who insist every woman should experience the joy of motherhood, not those of us who are questioning whether we want children.In my opinion this book is better: \\"Maybe Baby: 28 Writers Tell the Truth About Skepticism, Infertility, Baby Lust, Childlessness, Ambivalence, and How They Made the Biggest Decision of Their Lives\\" by Lori Leibovich. Or even \\"Baby Not on Board: A Celebration of Life without Kids\\" by Jennifer L. Shawne (for a lighter read)."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent review of a growing population","review":"This book was highly insightful and very well written.Women of every age group and situation poured their hearts out to tell their stories. Some still felt it was neccessary to use an assumed name as they did not want to be identified.Just goes to show that in 2001 there is still a stigma attached to being childfree, whether by choice or by chance.I reccommend this book to any woman that has yet to decide on having children, and to those that have made up their minds."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Author is not childless","review":"You can't possibly know what it means to be childless today when you are not childless today. The author describes in the book, a nightmare she had in which she dreams she has no children and awakes in a panic and runs down the hall to find her child sleeping. HUH!? The author has no credibility and nothing to offer."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for anyone who is considering being childfree.","review":"This is an interesting book, and I would reccommend reading this if you are considering not having children. This book is not about the regret that childfree women feel - in fact, most of the women struck me as being happy with their decisions, although sometimes that happiness was not easily won. This is one of the few books that puts life without kids in a positive light and deals with the stereotypes that childless women face in our society. The people who complain about the errors in statistics are missing the point. This book isn't supposed to be an in-depth statistical analysis of fertility rates. What it is supposed to do, and does well, is tell the reasons for why a person would remain childless and the effect that this has on her life."},{"rating":"2","title":"A look at an important -- but largely ignored -- issue","review":"I am a 27-year-old married woman, and I grow more uncertain by the day as to whether children will ever be a part of my life. Ms. Cain's book helped me examine the choice that lies ahead of me from more perspectives than I would have thought possible--each intriguing and thought-provoking in its own way. \\"The Childless Revolution\\" sheds new light on this important subject, which rarely receives the thorough discussion it deserves despite the fact that more and more women--married and single, gay and straight--are living lives without children. This is a book for every woman who is touched by this issue: those who are childless for any reason; those who have never considered childlessness an option; and especially those--like me--for whom this issue presents one of life's most important decisions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get your Kicks!","review":"What fun this book was to read!

The drums are hard, and the paaaty jumps, but this c.d. is not a wise investment. These scene jumper poopies lack charisma and are not midi-savvy. Much luck an otter, your date is gunna book it to the river if she sees this [stuff] sitting on your desk!!!!

I have some slower cards and they do not perform as well, which is especially noticable when shooting a sequence of shots, I can get more with these cards.Of course the burst may not be something you need/require, but I prefer having it just in case. Also the download speeds to the computer does save time. Again it reallly depends if it is important to you.

Now I'm not a person that hates slow music in general, but if something's going to be slow it should at least be heavy, or have a strong melody, or an interesting structure, or high-level musicianship, or SOMETHING.

I remember picking this album up shortly after Sept. 11th, I was in my early twenties and the pain and anger i felt were mirrored in a few of the songs. almost ever song follows a mind stimulating formula, come in and hit hard, then get a little melodic then hit hard again!!! I genuinely love this album. Ive had the pleasure of meeting and hanging out with the band, and you wont meet a more down to earth group. theyre not millionaires, just guys who make the music that they want. This album will continue to be my go to. Thank you Trust Co for making something so damn awesome!"},{"rating":"2","title":"TRUST company","review":"TRUST cO. rocks!!!!!!! If u listen to Linkin Park, Korn,Papa Roach, and u just love that Rock sound.......then go listen to TRUST company. They are really good, and will I just love them=) Peace >out ya'all. And Take my advice on this, TRUST cO. ROCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Album","review":"I tend to read alot of amazon reviews and will purchace cds because die hard fans like to say that every song is excellent. well, i am a fan, and this album is flawless. I love it when i buy a cd and listen to every song and think that this could stand well on its own as a single, and when i bought this cd, thats exactly what happened.

Easy to relate to."},{"rating":"1","title":":(","review":"i was really excited the day the trust company cd came out cause downfall is an awesome song. unfortunately it's the only good song on the cd. they really do sound like a very toned down version of linkin park, as much as i hate to repeat that. as a matter of fact they sound like stabbing westward meets linkin park, and then together they meet n'sync. they sound like a boy band trying to play rock. i was totally disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Linkin Park, but Close","review":"This band is essentially Linkin Park with no hip-hop. It is all straight rock. I must say that any Linkin Park album (including reanimation)is better than this CD, but if you enjoy Linkin Park and want to see a band take the style to a more melodic hard rock style, this could be the rock band for you. The CD is very solid. Unfortunately, Downfall does not truly reflect the essence of this CD. Almost all the other songs on the album are lighter and more melodic. The only real exception is my favorite song on the album, Running from Me. Regardless of its flaws, The Lonely Position of Neutral proves that TRUSTcompany has potential, but in the long run, they will have to change to prevent resemblance of Linkin Park. Competing directly with Linkin Park in the modern rock world is a fatal mistake that this band can't afford to make."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT ALBUM","review":"This is a great album to have if you like melodic hard rock.

It has everything you'd want out of a GOOD nu-rock outfit, yet one thing that sets it apart from most of it's contemporaries is it's listenability. This record is TOTAL hit-or-miss, but if it hits with the listener..it will hit hard! The songs will be stuck in your head for days, and you'll be humming the melodies in your car all the time. The band may come off as a Linkin Park rip-off, but that is debateable. Overall, a great first effort, and I can't wait for a 2nd"},{"rating":"2","title":"Trsut Company Forever!","review":"I've been a fan of Trust Company for some time now. Their debut album The Lonely Position Of Neutral is amazing, and I can listen to this album on repeat for hours. I like Kevin's voice a lot it's addicting. I just wish there were more songs on this album to love, because 11 isn't enough for me. I think they should be more popular than they are. I personally think Trust Company is one of the best bands there is today, because a lot of bands out there today try and repeat each others musical style, and it gets old fast, but Trust Company never gets old. This album did sell well with a half of a million copies sold, but I know they can do better than that. I hope Trust Company is around for along time, because I love them so much. It's really hard to chose my favorite songs on this album, because I like each song the same. My favorite songs on this album are:1. Finally2. Hover3. Running From Me4. Slipping Away5.

The guitar riffs are very catchy, but it stays caught. I bought this CD over a year ago, but the songs are still in my head all the time. I'm STILL not tired of it, and that's something I wish I could say about other CD's.Kevin Palmer has a whispery voice, that you will either love or hate. I personally love it, but my sister can't stand his voice. Give a few songs a listen or two (particularly Hover, Downfall, or Running from me). I still recommend it to anyone who likes rock.Standouts include: Every single song on the CD. Most CD's I buy have only one or two songs I like, but I love every single song on this CD. Everyone I showed the band to loves at least one or two songs, so I think ANYONE could buy this CD and enjoy some of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This kind of music needs to be stopped...","review":"This trend of overproduced, New Kids on the Block/Backstreet Boyz with guitars crap has got to end.

Then I found out that it was Trust Company. Good thing there's only 11 tracks on here. I mean, the only halfway decent track on this album is \\"Downfall\\" and it's already sounding kind of old. The tracks following \\"Downfall\\" all sound very much like it, with the exception of the musical introductions to each song. The introduction of #8 (\\"Deeper Into You\\") sounds frighteningly like Unwritten Law's \\"Seein' Red.\\" Don't buy this CD unless you want to waste some money."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't Trust this Company","review":"There are 2 things wrong with this album:1. The lyrics are trite and at sometimes, make no understandable point. They remind me of something from a depressed 6th grader's poetry book(and the kid can't write). \\"Downfall\\", one of their more popular songs, is a prime example of pointless lyrics.\\"Can I break away?push me away, make me fall,just to see another side of me,push me away, you can see,what I see, the other side of me\\"And what exactly is the other side of you? Maybe that other side could write some smart songs for a change.2. Songs sound the same. Guitar and drumming is basic, high school band quality. This wasn't as bothersome as the lyrics, but it's not enough to save the band.I will give credit to the singer, he can sing fairly well.This just sounds like everything else on MTV that people call rock, I'm sure some skateboarder, GC fan will fall in love with TC."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice","review":"ive had this album for a while and i have to its very good...its kinda heavy and mellowu can almost call it emo-corefor all u tools that wrote reviews in the past,u all have no idea what your talking about.why dont u all go watch mtv.all f u know nothing"},{"rating":"1","title":"Been done before. a lot.","review":"My god.

Every song sounded like every other song. There were no good hard rock screams. It was all just bland music and cheesy lyrics. The guitars were too happy, and played the same three chords all the time. Don't waste your money. Save it for a good band like System of a Down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good debut","review":"This cd is a pretty strong debut.

Trust co. sounds so similar. I would have to say that it is good though! \\"Downfall\\" opens the record, and it just flows through with good straight forward modern rock music, the whole time sounding like Linkin Park. Other good tracks include, \\"Running from me\\", And \\"Slipping away\\". So if your a big fan of Linkin Park, which alot of people are, you will really enjoy this record. Oh by the way I do like this record, and recomend it, however it loses a star for originality."},{"rating":"2","title":"In Your Face Aggressive Rock!","review":"This CD is truly one of the best CDs I have purchased in the past year or so. It has the \\"In Your Face\\" rock that I was looking for, but the lyrics are very well thought out. Unlike many other aggro-rock albums, Kevin does not rely on screaming all the time, he picks his spots, giving the songs a genuine emotional feel. For this price, I would definitely give this a chance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Groundbreaking, but Good","review":"This band is pretty good, but it's a little too radio friendly, and a little too similar to Linkin Park. The guitar parts are great, really crunchy and energetic. The drums and bass are great. The only problem lies in the singing and songwriting abilities. This mans voice is okay, but it's be better for pop music. It just doesn't fit in with the hard rock music in the background. His voice is very light and soft, and his screaming is weak. It almost sounds like he's trying to whisper. Also, while I know that all songs dont have to rhyme, these songs dont even come close.I would recommend listening to Linkin Park instead of or in addition to this. LinkinPark's guitar parts are not as crunchy, but the singing, rapping ... and DJ skills more than make up for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"This toy lasted 2 days in my house.

Coby will take it back for limited warranty service (even though I am 3 days outside the 90 day window), but they are making me pay for shipping to them and then I have to enclose an $18 money order for return shipping.

The noise of the disk running was so loud when it was sitting on my lap, that I had to turn the headphones all the way up. That did not seem like a good, long-term solution.

I was extremely disappointed. Other reviewers have made a big deal about the fact the author is male (details to clothing etc). No one has said anything about Gloria having little more personality than a plastic doll. She is extremely selfish. We never find out the root of her roommates religion, or why Gloria suddenly decides they are friends. We never find out what happened to her friend from her writing class. The book flips back and forth between time periods and different characters' points of view; I think it would've been much more effective to stick with Gloria. I wish she was more sympathetic. It was impossible for me to root for her, or feel any emotion about anything that happened to her. Many parts were overly descriptive, and I found myself skimmimg paragraph after paragraph.

Took out a beef roast from the fridge. My brother tried to make slices five times, it would cut a quarter-inch then blades would stop, but motor kept going and handle would get hot. IN UNDER A MINUTE the knife blades would not cut air. Did much research. problem is mixing plastic in motor with steel to save a few cents. All electric knives are foreign made by people on slave wages.

The new design of the blade is much cheaper and tears the meat instead of slicing cleaning through. You can tell just by looking at the blade that is a cheaper version of the original design. I'm very disappointed that Black and Decker ruined a good product. I would rather pay more and get a good quality knife then to have them cheapen them.I have nearly given up using this knife at all.

I just completed a foam cutting project making cushions. The knife was incredibly difficult to activate as one must begin to push the safety in and then depress the trigger. If you let off pressure for a second you must repeat the process. Did I mention this activation process takes both hands and actually feels somewhat dangerous. Once cutting, the motor is week and cuts very slowly. I was suprised to find it worked better cutting like a bread knife with the power off.

When you pay $8 for an electric knife, I guess you should expect a sub-par product. Plus the safety button was intensely inconvenient. It essentially made it impossible to cut unless you held onto the device with both hands, making it much more difficult to use. Not to mention it whirs with the intensity of an industrial blender! It's so loud, you would swear I was making daquiris with this thing!But this is only my review of the product that I used for less than 60 seconds, because it stopped working after that.

It was a fantastic electric knife. We often have large family get togethers and this was used to plow through tons of brisket, turkey, tri tip and bread. It finally gave out after great service. We ordered a replacement without thinking or comparison shopping. The new unit has the gap that a number of people have mentioned. It more massages / vibrates on the top of the meat rather than cutting it.

This safety mechanism makes the knife awkward to use because if you want to stop between slices (e.g., to position the meat or remove slices), you have to use both hands to restart the knife.

When I used them for the first time (20Aug) it was obvious that they were intended for bread, tomatoes, and nothing more.

It has a small gap between the blades and this allows the meat that you are cutting get between the blades rendering it useless.

But if you want to use it on poultry, buy something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth even the low price of $20.00","review":"I purchased this knife earlier this year to replace a different brand I had for many years, but is no longer available. I chose this knife primarily based upon the reviews I read. It is not worth the hassle of returning it, but it is nearly useless. The blades are set too far apart, and they tend to shred the meat instead of slicing it. And, it is virtually impossible to slice meat thinly. You need to apply a lot of downward pressure to even get through the meat, which really fatigues the hand. If anyone knows of a good quality electric knife, I would love to know about it.

Never had a problem carving anything. Last electric knife lasted 20 years. The blades on this knife collect meat between them and make a nice mess that gums up the works. The knives barely cut through turkey meat...even with some force. I checked to make sure the blades were attached properly as I could not believe someone could sell such a useless product. Also a problem is the safety button mechanism. You literally have to use two fingers to operate the buttons...one finger to push in on the safety button while at the same time using the other finger to \\"pull the trigger\\" to make it slice. Of course it doesn't slice anyway, so really is aggravating.Black and Decker used to make quality products.

I got the knife for my mother, who has arthritis in her hands. She couldn't use it with the safety lock, so I cut it off. Yes, I know, doing that voids all warranties.

It cut fine and made slicing bread and other bakery items very easy. Two months later the blades stop moving any time I try to slice something that is remotely solid.

Now with the blade running you remove your left hand passing under the blade. The worst design they could think of. The real problem is it only worked for 15 minutes and the blades stopped sawing. Do not waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Black & Decker EK700 9-Inch Electric Carving Knife, White","review":"Product was received on time. The ability for the knife to cut through the chicken bone is unsatisfactory. I had to provide extra physical strenght to make it work. I had an electric knife earlier an it was a very good knife. It cuts the meat/chicken with little effort on my part."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs tight grip","review":"I have used the knife on both meat and bread and found it to work very well. My complaint is with the lock and trigger. The lock which is a matter of pushing a pin to one side of the trigger is annoying, but doable. The trigger, however, requires a tight squeeze to stay activated. Keeping the trigger from 'locking' again isn't the issue for me, and holding the trigger in the down position isn't enough, you have to squeeze hard to keep the knife going. We're talking 15 seconds before my hand is cramping and and if I re-grip to alleviation the cramp in my hand, that stupid trigger lock pops out. Having to hold it in the awkward position required to keep that trigger squeezed tight enough compromises the control of the knife blade. I like performance of the knife blades, but can't recommend it for anyone without a super-strong grip or a lot of patience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Show","review":"Xmen Evolution I think is better then the '90's cartoon.

Then buy it for whoever you know is, or needs to be, passionate about the church. You will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mixed Feelings","review":"I suspect that this is one of those books that some readers will absolutely love, while others will be left disappointed. The book is FULL of illustrations; references to movie clips abound. Church growth \\"success\\" stories are frequently described. If you are the type that likes to sprinkle your sermon with statistics (especially with stats that illustrate how we are failing as a church to impact our society), then, this is the book for you! Regretfully, though, I found this book to be lacking in the area of solid content. Upon reading: \\"Lost in America,\\" there was nothing that I read that I had not read before."},{"rating":"2","title":"A realistic look at the problems and keys to the solution","review":"This book has given me a great insight into the challenges facing Christianity in America today. But, better yet, in bringing these things to light, Lost in America also identifies ways that we as Christians can reach out beyond the obstacles to impact our country for Christ.In my opinion, this book is a MUST for any Bible-believing Christian who wants to impact their neighbors with the Good News of Christ. We often need to examine things in a new light, and this book has been an inspiration for me to be mindful of the need to be on mission, and wise in the steps I take.My sincere gratitude to Tom Clegg and Warren Bird for writing this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bio of Immortal 600","review":"I found my gg grandfather listed in this book with a physical description of him.

Calling this effort a book is unfair to other books. It is more properly viewed as a press release. The author spends most of the pages repeating how handsome and athletic Thom (don't call me Tom) Weisel is, and shares very little about the factors, decisions, etc that have made him uniquely successful in building two leading banks. This text imparts more information on Lance Armstrong than it does on the tech banking industry. There is a book to be written on Montgomery and TWP, but this is not it."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a joke","review":"Tom Weisel is a cancer to society, not only for destroying US cycling but also for all his questionnable IPO's.

This workout would be great for people not used to working out. I got it because I was looking for something to supplement my other cardio and weight training workouts. It is a little too basic for me, but if you get a tape that is supposed to be just walking/jogging, what do you expect? The instructor is not annoying and cues well. The background is nice and soothing. My only real problem with the workout is that there is NO warm up or cool down stretching. Besides that, I recommend the workout. I will keep it in the mix on days I don't have much energy to do my other workouts or may even put it on while watching TV."},{"rating":"2","title":"30 MINS. OF FUN AND MOTION","review":"This was my 1st Leslie dvd and I found that over the past 8 months (before I had other WATP's) it was the one I turned to the most over other aerobic dvd's because it's only 30 minutes, easy, and fairly intense. Now I'm one of her biggest fans and alternate her workouts 4-5 days per week. The other one I really like is her 4 mile super challange. I also have the 3 mile Ab workout and thats good too. I've ordered her new \\"Walk Slim 2/3 mile walks\\" (with jogging) and I'm anxiously looking forward to beginning those. I think I'm addicted to the routines, oh dear!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good workout but annoying chatter","review":"This is the latest addition to my Leslie Sansone workout collection. What I like about the workout is that it's relatively brief (30 mins) and easy to do. The steps are very simple and the pace is moderate. Leslie works out in a nice location with four ladies who have also appeared in previous tapes. It is definitely not for the advanced exerciser, but it does the job when you don't have too much energy or when you're pressed for time. What I find annoying though is the INCESSANT chatter. Leslie does not stop talking and giggling through the entire program, and I wished the DVD had the option of \\"music only\\" without the instructor's voice. After doing the routine several times this can be a big turnoff. Othewise, Walk and Jog is a keeper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweat and have fun","review":"I was hesitant to buy this DVD \\"Walk and Jog\\" since I really liked using the Walk-Away-Weights and this doesn't use them. However, the easy to follow interval training between the power walking and jogging quickly made me a convert. The 30 minutes goes by so quickly and yet you feel like you really had a great workout. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to burn a lot of calories in a short amount of time. And you don't have to be very coordinated either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very dissapointed","review":"I have other workouts from Leslie Sansone. I have recommended them to my friends. This one in particular I thought was challenging. Not challenging at all. I didn't even sweat. Very short, not good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my favortie","review":"I love the Walk Away the Pounds series but this one has to be my list favorite. It's hard to follow and it just seems sparatic to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could be better!","review":"Although the workout itself is pretty good on this DVD...I was disappointed that Leslie chose to use the same members (with the mix-matched outfits) that she used on her Walk and Kick DVD in that same dark, dreary setting. It really makes it hard to get into the workout when the scenery is so bad. And the quality of the DVD is terrible. At certain times the faces are blurred. I don't know if I just got a bad copy or this is actually the way it is. I made the decision to buy this DVD and the Walk and Kick DVD based on the wonderful reviews I had read. I wish some of the reviews had mentioned the quality of the DVD, the setting and the way the members are dressed. I doubt I will do this workout again...so that's yet another item for the next yard sale."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not like at all","review":"No problems with seller just did not care for this work out. I have her other work outs and love them but did not care for this at all. I would recommend sticking to her original work outs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bummer this is the same \\"walk and jog\\" on other DVDs.","review":"I like Leslie's videos but needed a little variety. Unfortunately, this is the same as the one included in the \\"Fat Burning\\" series. The other video includes four workouts, so it's a better deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice workout but too short","review":"I love Leslie Sansone. Her constant talking is motivating. Liked the workout very much but if felt like it was too short."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love these workouts...","review":"I was using Walk and Kick before I bought this just to try something new. I love this one. I like jogging but don't always have a chance to get out so this workout is great for those days. I didn't think I would sweat like I did! I don't mind her chatting. These are really fun videos. A great 30 min. workout!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Workout!","review":"This was the first WATP dvd I ever bought and it is great! I expected it to be mostly walking but there's side steps, kicks, knee lifts, and of course jogging too. There's a lot more motion that I expected. You never get bored and she works in intervals so you're always being challenged. Leslie is easy to follow and she gives you the option of high impact or low impact so if you are a beginner or intermediate you can buy this and not feel overwhelmed or underwhelmed. Also, the ladies who workout with her are average women with average bodies and that's refreshing. All in all this is a good dvd and I use it 3-5 times a week in rotation with other cardio and strength training."},{"rating":"2","title":"LESLIE IS MY MENTOR","review":"I have been walking with Leslie for years. I appreciate the wide range of fitness levels that she addresses.....and I love to walk/jog!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"Really enjoyed working out with this one. I worried at first that I might not have been able to keep up with the jogging feature but Leslie makes it enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good work out for the busy person","review":"I've been purchasing Leslie Sansone when they were sold on VHS. I love the Walk Away the Pounds Power series. I have a high paced lifestyle, however, I do eat healthy and I exercise at least four days per week. Leslie's tapes are a part of my exercise routine. This work out is great for the busy person. I do it twice per week, before dinner. It's a great aerobic exercise. You need minimal space to do this and the jog segments are just enough to get your heart rate up. I love the DVD. It's a part of my Leslie Sansone collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"New to running? Short on time?","review":"I only own two of Ms. Sansone's DVD's this title and the \\"Four Mile Super Challenge.\\" Though I now use both rarely this title does not have an edge over the super challenge in my opinion unless one can only spare a half hour and/or desires a 2.5 mile run/walk.The familiar moves such as knee lifts, turns, side to side movements are all featured. The major difference in this collection are the minute fifty average jogging intervals, around every seven minutes.I believe this program is great for serious Sansone devotees, people unsure if they can up their walking pace or consumers such as myself who didn't know their running/jogging pace time when they took their first steps towards running as serious exercise.A solid DVD and great for the beginner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Workout","review":"I'd been using the 1 and 2 miles as my main workouts, and was getting kind of bored with them.Then I found this one, and I love it. The jogging intervals are great, not too long, and they're interspersed at the right moments.This is definitely good for variety. I reccommend ANY of Leslie's DVDs to someone who is looking for an in home cardio workout that's not too hard or too long."},{"rating":"1","title":"REPEAT WITH DIFFERENT PKG!!","review":"This was very disappointing! Made out to be a \\"new\\" dvd! The only thing new is the cover and a brief talk from Leslie. I have this one already and VERY SHOCKED by Sansone!!! There should be a warning that this is the same workout as before only you are missing 2 workouts that were on the original DVD!!!! Will have a very hard time purchasing any more Sansone DVD which I own around 8 and was wanting something \\"new\\". I thought she was a Christian! See what fame gets you"},{"rating":"1","title":"Walk Away the Pounds","review":"This is a good workout for beginners, only. It was not at all challenging to me, too slow. I like the upbeat group workouts better. I really like Leslie, and I like the caring attitude she projects."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good, but I prefer the Walk & Kick video","review":"This video didn't do as well at keeping me interested and pumped up - it was kind of repetitive. I ordered this one and the Walk & Kick at the same time, and I definitely recommend the Walk & Kick. The kickboxing moves are new and fun. While both videos are challenging, the kickboxing one seemed to fly by because you're doing totally different moves, instead of just going from a walk to a jog."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another A+ Workout","review":"I really enjoy the pace and variety of this workout. Leslie hits another homerun. I alternate this workout with the Walk Strong dvd and feel that I am really making progress towards overall good health, toning and weight loss. Thank you Leslie for pumping up this Texas gal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the dvd","review":"Great workout! Feels great to sweat with a little more intensity than her walking DVDs. As a stay-at-home mom I recommend it for anyone wanting to get in shape."},{"rating":"2","title":"good fast workout","review":"Like this dvd as I enjoy all of Leslie's pgms. HOWEVER, I found some of the moves in the boosts and the pace awkward. They just didn't flow right.As usual, Leslie is very upbeat and encouraging. I love that about her!I prefer The Big Burn over this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good workout!","review":"This is my first Leslie Sansone workout video. I always thought the Walk Away the Pounds series were more for beginner exercisers, but after reading the reviews here, I decided to give this a try. It's so simple and basic, yet it makes you sweat and gets your heart rate going. I can see how this might get boring after a while, but what exercise routine doesn't? The music is a little \\"80s aerobic class\\", but I love that it's 30 minutes; you don't need a lot of room; and it goes by quickly. Cardio is not my favorite thing in the world, but this workout makes it tolerable."},{"rating":"2","title":"easy to do","review":"This video was sooo much fun and easy to do. I have a lot of knee pain, and this did not bother them at all. Really makes you sweat too."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Love This Video!","review":"This workout is by far one of the best Leslie Sansone has to offer. The 3-minute spurts of jogging aren't all that difficult, and are kinda fun. The 30 minute workout goes by really fast-before you know it, it's time for the cool-down! Great for the advanced. Be ready to sweat!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but easy","review":"This is a good workout for the beginner or intermediate. The choreography is very simple. For more advanced exercisers, this would be good for light days. The jogging is slow and relaxed. You lightly jog for about 8 minutes during this 30 minute routine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!!","review":"Okay I must admit I am an absolute Leslie Sansone fan, but some of her DVDs are better than others, and there are a few I don't care for, but this isn't one of them. This one is awesome!! With intervals of walking and light jogging, within 30 minutes you get a good work out and a nice sweat. As Leslie says \\"sweating is a good thing!\\" Of course Leslie is so upbeat and fun that before you know it you have done your workout, and feel great. I highly recommend this one, because the intervals kick it up a notch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great intense workout, in a short amount of time!","review":"This may be my favorite of all of Leslie's videos. I get a great (and intense) workout in only 32 minutes, total. The program is not too difficult, although it takes a time or two to get into the jogging kicks and leg swings.

This brush is great. The wooden handle is sturdy, doesn't heat up, and is long enough that you can clean your grill while it's hot (how I usually do it) My one complaint with it is since there is no angle at the head, you end up putting the brush at an angle (since you can't hold it perpendicular to the grill as that would defeat the point of the 18\\" handle) which means only the bristles at the very front get used. My brush has the front brass bristles worn down and full of grill gunk but 2/3rds of the bristles in the back look brand new. If the head of the brush was at an angle to the handle this brush would be way better.That said, it's still a good brush.Be careful though as it seems Amazon is combining the reviews between the version of this brush that has brass bristles with the version with steel bristles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the right product for the job","review":"I have owned several grill brushes with brass bristles and they have all done the same thing. Unfortunately, this one is no different. After a while the bristles mashed down and became next to useless.

It is also not recommended for hair, washing cars, or cleaning fingernails. The long handle helps keep your hand from burning. It does this by keeping the brush area far away from the hand area; because the brush area is the one that is put on the grill, your hand doesn't need to be close to the grill, where the heat is produced.Also, it's important to note that this Weber brand grill brush is fully compatible with all Weber grills, all non-Weber grills, and all items that call for being brushed with an array of metal bristles at the end of a handle."},{"rating":"1","title":"not that good","review":"If you have a webber gas grill the steel slot on the brush is useless - it is sized to clean the thinner wire type grill.

I even had a Baby Alive doll myself when they first came out in the seventies. They are much nicer now. The only reason I would not give this item great ratings accross the board is because buying the food can get really expensive.

Don't know how, don't know why, but when scrolling, it gets to a point and STICKS. This is extremely frustrating when playing online video games where speed is essential.This, in itself, wouldn't be much of a problem if there was a way to open it and clean it. But... there's none.

It is too narrow in the middle (as well as to high), forcing the thumb and ring finger to hold it in an unnatural and strained way. Instead, I recommend a wider and flatter mouse, such as Logitech's optical mouse (which is also cheaper)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just an okay mouse... I can't recommend it","review":"After using it at work for a few hours, my hand began to hurt a bit. I have medium (men's) hands, but not sure if hand size matters. I think the high arch is the cause of the discomfort. Note that I also own the Microsoft Wireless Optical Mouse Blue, and it does NOT have the same problem - I can actually recommend that one.The mouse feels cheaper than other Logitech and Microsoft mice I've owned, but is certainly sturdy enough to last. Also, the scroll wheel is too loose making it easy to scroll accidentally while trying to only press the wheel (center) button. Most people probably won't care about that feature (I happen to need the middle mouse button for my Unix applications at work).I've been using the mouse as a travel mouse and it does it's job. This mouse is still better than any non-optical mouse since I can use it on any surface (I don't need to carry around a mouse pad)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Microsoft Optical Mouse Blue - Avoid","review":"I have owned a Microsoft Optical Mouse Blue for over two years.

I may start looking around to see if I've been missing out on other, more comfortable mice, but this is one mouse that will always have a place on, or near my desk.If you have a choice, try this mouse out.

I have had this mouse about a year and it is great for websurfing but not photo editing because every now and then the pointer jumps around the screen.

Finally, i bought this mouse because i knew dirt would not show up on it like my old white mouse did. I would give this optical mouse a 4 out of 5."},{"rating":"1","title":"Suffers From Opitcal Jitter","review":"This was my first optical mouse. Unfortunately, I soon learned about optical \\"jitter\\". I was unable to get smooth curser movements for small hand movements involving editing of digital photos, etc. Small movements cause noticeable curser jitter on the screen. Do an internet search using \\"optical mouse jitter\\" and you will see this is a common problem for optical mice.I've since replaced it a Logitech MX310, which has no such problem. The Logitech moves across the screen smoothly - and seems to glide across the mouse pad easier.

At time I think that it would be nice to have the top grate that is hinged and lifts up part way.

I'm only giving it four stars as a comment on manufacturing in general these days. Things today just don't seem as solidly built as they did twenty years ago.

Easy to cook with. Easy to clean. Would give 5 stars if it was just a bit more sturdy. If you drop the lid it can cause a problem if it bends. I dropped one and I never got it right again. It will affect the cooking because you lose your air control. I have owned 3 in the last 23 years and still have 2. I doubt if I will ever go to a different grill."},{"rating":"2","title":"Weber One Touch Silver","review":"The grill itself, the kettle and cover is definitely very high quality, however the ash dish is not very good, itsa struggle sliding the clips it sits on up and down to get it in and out,so I tip the entire grill upside down to empty it.when ever i try to roll yhe grill around on its wheels its top heavy and you have to be careful to not let it tip over and send the lidcrashing to the ground, also the front leg keeps falling out when ever its moved. I fixed that problem with a self tappingsheet metal screw. I still rate this grill four stars however because of the quality of the kettle this grill cooks and smokes fantastic.the One Touch Silver doesn't come with a hinged grill, so if you want to smoke something that takes more time than one chimney full of charcoal,you would want to buy one of those."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best bbq !","review":"I have owned two of the 22.5inch one-touch model over 20 odd years. I am about to buy a third because I have worn the second one out. It has rusted a little at the bottom, but I have left it out in the weather for ten years! The indirect method of cooking is the best. Never bought the aluminium foil fat drip trays, always made my own. My current one is red, which cannot be bought anymore (or at least not here in Japan), so I am back to a black one. Recommend this bbq highly because the food is never burnt by the indirect method.

I did some research on the web and narrowed it down to this grill for price and name quality, and I am 110% satisfied!I was surprised that it really takes less then 30 minutes to assemble by anyone. The only tool needed is a hammer for about 30 seconds to tap in the lock nuts on the 2 wheels and thats it.I would highly recommend this grill or any other Weber grill(built in the good ol' USA)The only thing that I will buy for this grill is that lid holder which is less then 20 dollars so that the lid can be lifted and kept on the grill, I think that will be easier then taking the lid off and try to lay in on the ground somewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's ok.","review":"Still not sold on the price tag though.

I have been very pleased and don't need to reiterate what others have said. What I do want to point out though, is my solution to the substandard ash catcher. I purchased a standard 10 quart galvanized pail from the local hardware store to replace the catcher. You can adjust the clips on the legs such that the rim of the pail fits snugly between. I can go 20 grillings before I have to empty the pail. Another tip... when you are done grilling, close the top and bottom vents and you will have charcoal left for the next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks great, low quality.","review":"I bought this grill to replace a Weber I have had for over 5 years and aside from normal wear it has functioned well. This grill I have had for exactly 2 weeks and today the side handle detached from the grill when I went to move the grill. I examined the old grill and saw around 1/2\\" of weld connecting the handle to the grill. The new one I purchased has less than 1/8\\" of weld on each side of the handle and already was showing signs of bad rusting. I have contacted Weber in the hopes of a replacement. My only other complaint about this grill is that all of the internal grate supports had to be bent and adjusted to hold the grates without them rattling, it only took a minute but I think the same minute task could be completed by their staff."},{"rating":"1","title":"nuthin' to write home about","review":"As for being a Weber product the construction could have been sturdier. The legs are light, wheels are cheap so you have to be careful when moving the grill, it can be a bit top heavy if you have anything in it. The charcoal grate grid spacing is a bit wide so I had to put another one on top to prevent unspent coals from dropping through. Weber could have just put in the hinged cooking grate instead of the flat one. Also, you have to jury-rig the ash catcher. For the money, Weber could have done better. I am disappointed in this product just because it's a Weber and I don't feel that they lived up to their reputation. I'm glad I didn't go for the gold."},{"rating":"1","title":"DANGER BURN HAZARD!! This is a hazardous product!!!!!","review":"I have owned at least 6 Weber kettles in 40 years of grilling. The current plastic used for the lid handles conducts heat unsafely and can burn your hand as if it were made of bare metal!!! I couldn't believe the blister I got from raising the lid to look at what i was cooking. I thought i had made a mistake and touched the metal or maybe the screw that holds the handle on had come in contact with my skin. No, i checked and it was the plastic handle!SHAME ON WEBER-STEVENS FOR MAKING THIS PRODUCT AND NOT RECALLING OR REPLACING THESE UNSAFE HANDLES!!!These grills are the best for the price and just about any price for cooking, but i guess it's worth injuring your faithful customers severely to save a dollar or two.

Its a no-brainer; it works, is big, and is relatively expensive.Its easy to clean out the bottom, and easy to control the temperature of your coals by adjusting the vent at the top and bottom. And, after you're done, you can close both vents and put the top on to smother the coals. I always end up being able to reuse most of my coals the next time I cook out.The body of the grill is still in very good shape. I can find no corrosion to speak of.My only complaints are that the ash catching plate, the way its held on, and the legs are kind of cheezy. Ive only had a couple times where they gave me any problems, none of which were serious.I'd also suggest you get the weber chimney starter and coal baskets to go along with your grill. They've both made grilling a snap.Definitely a good buy for the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weber quailty has plummeted.","review":"I used to swear by the Weber as the best quality charcoal grill available.

I have pale skin and if you rub this product in well, it does not give you blotchy spots. Take care to not get it too thick in your elbow and knee creases. I want to say if you don't want your body to have a shimmer then do not use this product. I, however, love the subtle shimmer. I also just bought the face product of this as well and love that too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Self-Tanner","review":"This is the best self-tanner I've ever tried. I have fair skin that tans only after it burns, and this product is by far the most natural looking I have ever used. The result is tan, not orange-ish, and I love the subtle shimmer. A few people have commented on not liking the scent, but I really love the mango scent."},{"rating":"2","title":"effective but kind of smelly","review":"I was slightly hesitant to buy this product because of other reviews mentioning that that this product leaves your skin smelling like fake tanner, but this seemed like the self-tanning lotion with the best reviews and I didn't want to be pasty white this winter, so I decided to go for it. Sadly, the other reviewers who say that it kind of smells were right- its got that very distinctive self tan smell but it isn't out of control strong (although for sure is noticeable) and it definitely gives your skin a nice tan color, not too splotchy or orange. If you look really hard you can see the sparkly thing other reviewers talk about, but I can't even tell unless I'm in really bright light and looking at my skin super close up. I would (and will) buy another bottle of this stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm covered in sparkles","review":"Okay, I'm a novice at sunless tanning lotions, so I think that the streaks are probably my fault because I didn't do a fantastic job of rubbing it in evenly... But that doesn't change the fact that I'm now at work and my body is covered in shimmery specks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glittery!!!","review":"I'm a male who wanted a good base color for a beach trip so I decided to try this product. Given the glowing reviews and mild description I figured it would be a nice, subtle change of skin tone. After applying yesterday I noticed on my commute to work that I'm glittery as hell. Luckily I didn't apply this to my face, but I'm forced to wear long sleeves for a while...So unless you want to look like your from a Twilight movie I suggest you go with another 'natural looking' tanning product."},{"rating":"2","title":"good ladder for a tent trailer","review":"I bought this ladder to help climb up into the bed of our tent trailer.

His new album, Devil Without a Cause is so musically diverse and creative. From hip hop to metal, Kid Rock delivers on all levels. From the first track on, the Kid shows all that he is for real. Bawitaba, Devil Without a Cause, and Bullgod are awesome metal backed songs. Check out Joe C., a guest rapper who steals the track on Devil Without a Cause. The other tracks are range from guitar based songs, hip hop freestyle, and the very introspective and revealing White Guy, Black Chick. This is a can't miss album.

Nick travels through time and becomes embroiled in a search to expose a dark and terrible conspiracy.

What made me keep reading this book was that I wanted to find out who killed Otis. My favorite scene of the book was when Nick first found Slim. The author did a great job of expressing Nick's fear. My favorite character was Nick because he was a great spy for Slim. I recommend this book because it is suspenseful and full of adventure. Any kid my age would really enjoy it.

Its easy to use - you turn it on, light it, wait 5 minutes, and away you go. Preparation area is satisfactory with the fold out extra shelf. The food results are very good due to even heat. Also, spare parts are readily available if you need or want new grates or flavor bars.

He presents credible data showing how religion benefits people's mental and physical health. This approach is quite unlike the anti-scientific rant of anti-religious treatises like Wendell Watters' book Deadly Doctrine, which relies mainly on anecdotal evidence, personal bias, and theoretical speculation. Instead, Koenig uses controlled studies to prove his points. I'd give him a few extra brownie points for managing to show a Christian attitude to people like Watters, whom I find maddening."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice alternative to a wallet with built in change purse","review":"For a long time I had a wallet with a build in change purse.

I've had it for a few weeks now and I find it serves exactly the purpose I was hoping for.It's small enough to sit in my front pocket and stops any rattle the change can make. It has two pouches, so I can hide a couple of coins that are useful in special circumstances without fear that I'll spend them accidentally.I doubt a change purse is for everyone, but if that is what you're looking for, this one is at least as good as any you're likely to find, and (I believe) better than most."},{"rating":"2","title":"best spatula for delicate jobs","review":"The thin (but strong) and relatively narrow blade of this spatula slides under delicate food easily.

It's tight though, so if you have a Glock other than models 26, 27 or 33, it probably will be too tall; length isn't the issue. The quality of the bag seems to be very high; good stitching and seams, big solid zipper with a loop that would allow you to lock it with a travel lock if necessary. I ordered two of the 12\\" versions for my Sigs as well and those are the same excellent quality.Update; this bag also works great with the Springfield XDs sub-compact 45 caliber 5+1 pistol.

The new violin arrived and I was able to tune it fine. My five year old son has been performing around the house almost everyday!Now a word about the quality.

There is one clinker in the bunch that strains credulity more than usual (a mark develops amnesia), but this season also features one of the best episodes of the series so far--Mickey (Adrian Lester) and Danny (Marc Warren) square off in a challenge of grifting skills: both are abandoned naked in the middle of town at noon to see who can accumulate the most by the end of the day.

Season Three solidified me as a fan, with the engaging plot lines, beautiful London locations, great acting from the principal cast and the guest stars, and the top-notch cinematography, giving the show the \\"look\\" of a big screen endeavor.Season Three boasts my favorite episode: \\"A Bollywood Dream\\", a tale in which the \\"hustlers\\" deal with a ruthless sweatshop owner who, through a case of temporary amnesia, suffers a \\"reformation\\", causing the con artists to re-evaluate their goals. The musical number that accompanies the installment is well-executed and a lot of fun.Just that one episode alone is worth purchasing the entire compilation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hustle","review":"A great British tv program.

Wish it had a locking handle like the new version!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Weber 10020 Smokey Joe Silver Charcoal Grill, Black","review":"This is a good little BBQ with one big flaw, it doesn't have any handles like almost all the other brands, which makes it quite difficult to clean the grill while it's hot, which is how I prefer to clean it. What were you thinking, Weber?"},{"rating":"2","title":"I Love My Smokey Joe","review":"This small, light-weight, portable, durable charcoal grill is perfect for cooking for a few people. It wont work for a giant dinner party, but if you fire it up for a couple of steaks or a few chops, nothing beats it. I will be cooking on my Smokey Joe for many happy years to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smokey Joe Sillver Review","review":"I used my last little smokey at least 3 days a week 6 mounths of the year here in MN for 18 years. I am only cooking for two so it works out perfect because you get the preformance of a Webber but you use verry little charcoal. Don't forget to shut the vents when you are done cooking, this smuthers the coals then you can just add about half as much as you would otherwise need next time. Getting a chimney gets your charcoal ready with only newsprint as your starting aid in about 10 minutes. As far as preformance goes you can't beat a Webber you can grill (no lid extreamly hot), or you can smoke or bake with the lid on. Read the cook book that comes with your grill and you will be an expert in no time. The only negative is they replaced the wooden handle with plastic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grilling & more...great at this price","review":"I did not give full stars to this Weber on purpose.Pros:- Extremely light weight and easy to use- Ash collection plate is very useful- Great control of air flow for high & low flames (even long lasting)- Enough space on the grill for 4 medium steaksCons:- The vent at the bottom is difficult to reach in case you want to start a fire using a piece of paper- The steel (or iron) grills are low quality- No handles or hooks - in case you want to move it while still hot. You have to pull from one of the legs.I used it in my camping trip to grill meat, fish, corn, potatoes even boiled water for coffee. The campground did not allow campfires, so we used this grill to have a little hot stove for ourselves (controlling the heat). For the price of this grill, there is no substitute. This is my second Weber, and I will keep on upgrading as and when space allows.DO NOT BUY the charcoal starter on the side, this grill will not need it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smokey Joe Silver is the way to go - Bottom vents matter","review":"When I started looking at these grills I almost immediately went with the gold. I figured that the portability was worth the extra 5 bucks, but when I looked further I found that the gold does not have the bottom vents which are a major part of the Weber design. Because of the vents and because I don't really need the grill to be portable (although it could be easily placed in a plastic bag and transported) I went with the Silver and I have been very pleased with my purchase. It can easily feed four people and I have found that even after I have cooked the first batch i can then cook a second using the charcoal I started with. This is very economical. I also recommend the addition of a charcoal chimney starter as this will save money in the long run through savings on charcoal starter fluid. Happy grilling."},{"rating":"2","title":"cute little grill!","review":"I ordered this item because I live in a small apartment and have no room for a regular-sized grill, but enjoy cooking out on occasion. This grill is perfect for my application. It was inexpensive, fits easily in my outside storage closet, is small and easy to clean, but big enough to cook for a small get-together. The only down side I have found is that I wish there was some way of securing the lid onto the grill for storage or transport. Overall a good product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Melted in a matter of minutes","review":"I was so excited to receive my Smokey Joe, the positive reviews also guaranteed that the Smokey Joe would be a great buy. We assembled and realized that all of the washers (seals) were missing, but it assembled well nonetheless. We lit the coals and to my horror, after burning a few minutes, the bottom cover melted and fell out! It proved useless for smoking the food as there were open holes in the grill. It seems I got a defective product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeps goin' and goin' !!!","review":"We have uesd this grill for about 8 years now and it gets a full work-out. We grill on average 2 times a week throughout the year and this is our only grill. The grate has finally started to melt away so we are ordering a replacement grate today. Some people would just buy an entire new grill but I like to keep my stuff out of the landfills. Anyway, this is a magnificent little grill, obviously durable and well-made. There are some drawbacks to the small size i.e. just the small surface area is a problem if you want to cook bigger quantities than we do. But a larger grill means more charcoal etc ....Highly recommended product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The classic","review":"What can you say? This is THE grill for small family/friends grilling-up to about 8 people. This will be only our third one in about 30 years.

With ano lighter fluid small bag of charcoal from the grocery store, I havebeen able to cook 2-3 full grills of meat both times. Easy cleanif you place foil over the round metal charcoal catch pan, and sprayyour grill with Pam for grilling. I also put a sheet of foil on the insideand poke holes through for the venting. I shut the vents to let it cooland once cool bring it in and set it on the stove after dumping thecoals in a bag. Then, I can clean it at my convenience. Who everthinks you need a huge grill to throw down on the BBQ is deadwrong. You will not go wrong in buying this product. My goal is to seehow long I can make it last over the years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"This grill is simple to set up, easy to use, and uber transportable. I've been giving it as housewarming gifts and people love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy the gold or platinum","review":"I grill year round and in many weather conditions. Unlike the gold and platinum grills, the silver grill does not have a carry handle to keep it shut for transport (see the review about the burnt down car), nor does it have the ability to prop the lid as a wind/rain shield. The silver grill works fine in nice weather for fast, hot cooking, but if you want to grill in a drizzle or in a little wind, the ability to prop the lid up (available on the gold and platinum models) is essential. I lost my gold grill. Last night I tried cooking in a little rain on the silver grill, and it wasn't up to task like my gold grill was. I'm going to buy a gold or platinum grill this time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Way more capable than you would think.","review":"I bought this grill when I was younger and single and didn't expect it to be able to feed my family as it grew, but to my surprise it still does. 2 kids, a wife, and the occasional brother or friends stopping by are not too much to feed with this little work-horse. Its Economical on charcoal because of its small stature, but it still has enough room to fit several steaks and a chicken breast, or a rack of ribs and some kabobs. I keep putting off buying a bigger one, because this one hasnt let me down yet. Yes, I do have several other grills and smokers now, but many years and countless meals later, this little grill is by far used the most. There are not many things in life that only cost about 40 bucks and will give you this much trouble free use.

If you want to cook 4 burgers and some veggies or potatoes, it won't work.Here's why. 1st, the cooking surface is very small. 2nd, if you put to enough coals in there to cook for an extended period of time, it gets to hot. If you only put in as the instructions say, it's not enough heat or after your burgers cook, the coals won't stay hot. It could be that there isn't enough ventilation to keep the fire going.Regardless, it's not enough grill for me. For cooking hot dogs or roasting marshmallows, your good. For steaks, fagetabotit!Bottom line is that this small grill is not for beginners. And if you're going to use it, make sure to follow the instructions, then add 20% more coals on top."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Product","review":"The vent at the bottom gets filled with ashes quickly and then there is no ventilation from the bottom, you put the lid on, the coals go out.

Specifically, the balance between orchestra and piano is completely off...with loudness of each being equal as far as my perception is concerned.

To keep pace with this goal, the mathematical level is pretty accessible and never demanding ( just basic derivatives and almost no integral, the few ones have solutions described in the text ). The good facet is the analysis of supersonic cruise of airplanes and the perfomance of hypervelocity reentry vehicles. Since other textbooks are scanty on the matter, albeit more advanced in mathematical presentation, this volume is a good complement to a course textbook in those fields.If the reader is looking for a comprehensive text, this volume will provide many answers to his/her curiosity.

There are a few ok solos, but the guitar really lacks balls! They toned down the music, and the instrumental Catapult to Extinction is bland. The song \\"Everything is Everything\\" really sucks; I can't hardly stand to listen to it. A few of the songs are ok, being Lucifer's Hammer, Golden God, and Empty Man. Even though these songs are ok, the album stinks and Racer X have really put out crap this time.

Paul Gilbert always seems to be trying something different once in a while and then coming well off the rails. His solo albums were never a real hit with the Racer X faithful, except a few, but this album again is a diversification away from what the ardent fans really want to hear. I would love Racer X to return to their Eighties heyday and release a blistering album like Second heat again. Energy shred with monster riffs is what Paul Gilbert was always famous for and whilst the previous 2 albums aren't bad, I feel the original magic that made Racer-X one of the best live bands in their heyday just isn't there anymore. I only hope they could get it back. Perhaps Paul Gilbert should look for an additional shredder to join the band because that may be whats missing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Average CD","review":"First of all I just want to say that Racer X is one of my favorite bands of all time.I have all of their albums and all of them rock.Personally my favorites are Technical Difficulties,SuperHeroes and Second Heat. Even though Getting Heavier doesn't rank up there with the classics,it's far from being a bad album. Songs like Heaven in 74,Dr. X,and Lucifers Hammer just rock.The album in general ain't that bad but nothing really stands out.Most of the songs on the CD are B-sides songs.They're okay but in general the album fails to grab the listener by the throat."},{"rating":"1","title":"uninspired mix of boredom","review":"as much as i like speed-metal and this band, i cannot recommend this cd to anyone...95% of it sounds like bad Metallica...very uninspired..with the 2 previous recordings (Technical Difficulties and Superheroes) you would think that this would be the complete classic Racer X...not so! 2 great tracks (60-66-60 and catapult to extinction) does not a complete cd make...Paul Gilbert is an amazing guitar player, but maybe the hype has just caught up with him, meaning that he puts out fragments of brilliance and just expects you to buy it..not me and neither should you..Racer X - R.I.P."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kept my excitement going","review":"She did it again.

The central page is just the same image flipped 180 degrees. The image quality is rather poor and most of them are just show torsos and pubic hair with no face. Lighting and composition are ordinary, and so are the props used. The images that Playboy published in 1985 (which were far better) are not included here.

It was rated-G and that's being nice. I thought it was going to demonstrate how some techniques are performed and all it did was display what any non virgin could have learned from the soaps.

If I had the chance to view the book, which was wrapped, I would have not wasted my money or time on something soo over-rated.

This is absolutely and positively the ugliest artistic rendition of Oscar Wilde's beautiful fairy tales and of that of thousands of children's books I have read or collected over many years.

Some woman who is about the 21, can not get over her past, is immature about herself and her words, is has a large ego for herself, who apprently is trying to find purpose in her family in life. Her disastrous relationship with her family and other aquaintances leads to one bad ending. Much respect goes to her grandfather and grandma at the internment camp, the author totally rips the book of any respect. I'm not sure if the author intended parts about \\"turtles signifying penises\\" or release of bodily gases as the high point of her relationship with her ex-boyfriend has anything to with the book or if it is just something to keep the reader's eye from closing, either way it is unnecessary and way off topic.

Both grills seem to have consistent issues so when I write about one, I am including my past grill also. One complaint with this grill is the starter. It hasn't worked on either grill I have purchased. Fortunately I found the hole in the bottom to insert a lighter wand. It also has a hot spot in the same place my last had. There wasn't anything wrong with my last grill, I just disintegrated the flash pan. It is cruel Weber doesn't supply them as replacement parts in the stores. Good machines go to the dump and unnecessary expenditures occur. If I found them in the store, I would buy 2 - 3 just to have them on hand since I grill so often."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!!!!!","review":"I bought this grill despite the few low reviews saying that it does not get hot enough. When the grill arrived and after hooking it up to both the small gas canisters and the larger propane tank with hose, the grill could not even toast a piece of bread. I followed all the instruction and 'rules' in regards to hooking up the canisters/gas. I did not give up at that point however, I called the company and they even sent me out a new regulator for the grill. Despite this new regulator the grill still can barely heat anything up. Its a glorified low heat oven at this point. I'm just going to have to cut my losses and try a different grill.I'm not sure how in the world this grill got such good reviews. Maybe the grill used to be good, but the company must of tried to take some shortcuts or something cause the grill now is a complete piece of trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage - might be able to heat toast on it","review":"I bought this grill from Amazon.com and it performed worse than any grill I've ever owned. It doesn't get hot enough to cook even one steak, never mind \\"four medium sized steaks.\\" The claims are all false. If you want to leave the lid on throughout the cooking process you might be able to cook a half chicken in an hour or more. For steaks, which require flash heat of 500-600 degrees F, this grill is a total failure. You'll never get grill marks or even a seared side on your steak. Save your money and invest it in at least a 20,000 BTU stainless steel dual burner grill with a full size propane tank."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Good","review":"I purchased this grill to use when camping and decided on this one because of the Weber name. While I will admit the grill is portable and easy to use, I am very disappointed with the way that it cooks. The heat shield that covers the flame makes cooking time very long. The grill is great for hot dogs and small burgers but if you want to cook anything else you better plan on an all day deal!!! It is definitely not worth the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak","review":"Nice igniter, It will last about 2 sessions. Watchout when you light it. It will blow. Chitty design.

I have to say I was disappointed. I had cooked some Filet mignon and Hot dogs and the unit did a great job in cooking but the taste reminded me of a regular stove oven. I think if you are use to the taste of BBQ and never tried a gas unit before my recommendation would be to stick with what you know, especially if you want that BBQ taste. As for the company Weber I give the 5 stars in workmanship! You can't beat a product made in the USA!"},{"rating":"1","title":"dissapointed !","review":"We were sorely disappointed by this grill.

Oh well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Negative 1 Star - LOOK ELSEWHERE!","review":"I've struggled with this cheaply made piece of junk for over two years, and after a final evening of frustration, it sailed off the 2nd floor deck in the general direction of the garbage dumpster. It doesn't heat up properly (some of these units heat properly, others like mine don't = POOR quality control), the way it cooks varies greatly depending on how much propane is in the can, and it takes only a slight breeze to blow it out. Beyond that, the plastic handle is cheesy, the heat shield will eventually burn through, and the whole unit will warp enough to make the grate difficult to take out and put back in. The push starter on mine worked only for a couple months and then broke. If you enjoy ruined meat and disappointed dinner guests, this it truly the unit for you. I'm going back to charcoal and going out of my way to NOT buy another Weber product because of the disappointment this grill has brought me."},{"rating":"2","title":"16 oz canisters are ok !","review":"I phoned Weber Customer Service concerning the 14 oz fuel canister specification. Customer Service advised me that 16 oz canisters work just fine.Customer Service said the 14 oz fuel canister specification is due to the \\"Q\\" grill. Weber found the heavier 16 oz fuel canister could tip over the \\"Q\\" grill. In order to avoid \\"confusing their customers\\", Weber recently changed documentation for ALL portable grills so as to specify 14 oz."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great grill - Easy fix for ignitor to burner gap","review":"This grill is very easy to assemble and is of very good quality -typical of Weber Grills. I found the burner manifold tube was still very loose when assembled with the provided fasteners and moved enough to make it impossible to maintain the correct spark gap for the ignitor. I corrected this easily by replacing the provided washer with a larger thicker washer that allowed the wing nut to tighten the burner tube in position properly. The washer, with the larger hole, now fits over part of the square shaft on screw fastener and the wing nut can then tighten the burner tube firmly in position."},{"rating":"2","title":"Handy little cooker","review":"Bought it to haul in our RV.

The heat diffuser plate works good to keep from charring the food and still allows plenty of heat for searing.The unit comes with a pushbutton ignition device that is located at the far end of the burner. So when you turn the gas control to HIGH and then start using the pushbutton, often - the flame will flash since the entire length of the burner has to fill up with propane as well as the space below the diffuser plate. I now use a lighter to inject a flame closer to the gas control. No worse than any other small propane grill.Of course - light the grill with the lid off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it.","review":"We are still enjoying this grill after 10 years. For the first 5 years, it was our only grill. We purchased a larger weber for a party about 5 years ago, and this grill now does camping/travel duty. This grill was stored inside reasonably often. We have replaced the flavorizer bars once, and it was significantly cheaper than replacing the grill.You can cook 6 burgers at a time. It does a great job with chicken low/medium for ~1 hour. Teriyaki salmon skewers are also yummy. We even use it with a frying pan for pancakes, sausage and scrambled eggs.We purchased a propane hose and a small refillable tank, which is cheap to fill and holds many times the propane of the disposable cylinders which seem to constantly but silently run out while you are cooking. For camping, we added a vertical distribution post (mulitple propane outlets) and attached our propane lantern to the top outlet.It is sturdy and very portable. It makes great food. It is the same price that we paid 10 years ago. We love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little grill","review":"We bought this for use at a beach house, the grills provided at the houses are always dreadful.

I have used it on picnics and grilling at the house.I have found that it does not grill evenly. However, for the price and its functionality, it is still a good buy. My biggest beef is if there is a stout wind, it has a tendency to blow out the grill. On those occasions, it takes much longer to get through the cooking process. Since there is no thermometer, you have to babysit it when the wind is strong.If you are looking for a grill that will compliment a romantic picnic, with steaks and wine, I certainly recommend this grill. If you are a connoisseur of grills and want consistent, even grilling, then this might not be the grill for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"No good in the breeze...","review":"I bought this grill at local HW store, works OK but has a very annoying tendency of blowing the burner out in a slight breeze. Had a Charm-Glow before this one, did the same thing. I do like the coating, and the stainless steel burner but the grate rusts as does the flame spreader. Update!! Pulled the regulator knob sticker off and adjusted the screw to raise the pressure, much better! Stays lit now."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Portable Best BBQ ever!","review":"Hands down this BBQ rocks. The auto ignite and flavorizor bar set it apart from the your $20 to $40 range grills. As far as some people talking about rust, well yeah if you leave it out all winter it is going to rust just like anything else, but I have used mine year round for 5 years and it is just like new, maybe even better.It is one of the best investments you can make for camping, tailgating, etc. The adapter cord to a 5 gallon propane tank makes it more affordable to use where weight is not an issue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Up to Weber Quality: 4 Year Owner","review":"I'm a huge Weber charcoal grill fan, but this grill is a rusted out POS. I've owned it for four years, and it lacks the durability I have come to expect from Weber.Weber essentially replaced all the parts when the grill was one year old because it rusted something awful and the ignition stopped working.Today I need to replace the grate that protects the gas element again ~ the cost with shipping is half the price of a new grill. The ignition doesn't work either. Again. Yes, I can light it manually, but this is a messy pain.It is a good introductory gas grill. It converted me from charcoal to gas. Steaks are done to perfection in 15 minutes or less. The other plus is that it doesn't take up much space on an apartment balcony.However, it is very cumbersome to use because the lid is not attached and the legs collapse easily.After reading the reviews, my next grill will be a Cuisinart. Yes, it is twice the cost. But, who needs a grill that rusts out and falls apart?"},{"rating":"1","title":"dangerous starter","review":"The grill works fine. However, the automatic starter is dangerous. By the time it is hit, there is enough gas to make a loud bang and flash that scares me. I will use a manual lighter instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"Total Junk. The regulator on the one I received only rotates to the \\"MED\\" setting, where it blasts propane at a high rate.When I try to turn it down, I discovered I had an operating range of about a half inch of rotation on the regulator.I can only heat food on the left side of the unit, as the right side temp is very low.The handles get too hot to grip without heavily insulated gloves.Perhaps if you get a decent regulator, and the minions assemble it and adjust it correctly, then it may work.Crappiest quality control I've seen in a long time.The one you buy may work, then again it may not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Go-Anywhere grill by far","review":"I used a Weber Go-anywhere grill for years - for camping, beach parties, etc. It finally wore out, so I bought a cheaper version to replace it, made by some other company - it was, indeed, \\"cheap.\\" I bought another Weber and what a difference!

This grill, however is a piece of junk. Within the first year the Flavorizer bar was completely rusted through and the bottom has started to rust as well. I have taken care of it exactly as the manual instructs (and how we have taken care of all our other Weber BBQs.)

It's a solid grill that grills everything nicely. Steaks, burgers, fish...anything works!The only problem I've had is the starter, but I just use a Bic lighter and light it from one of the holes on the bottom. It's no big deal, a minor irritation, but not enough of an irritation to keep me from giving it 5 stars.I saw some reviews where the reviewer claimed the grill did not get hot enough. I've never experienced that problem at all. In fact, I use it in winter when it's real cold outside and it still works great!When I want smoke, I just put some small mesquite chips on the burner plate, or whatever it's called, and I get nice smoke.I love this grill lot more than my fancy $900-something grill.One more thing....I use it to warm up pizza. Works like a champ and makes a real crispy crust!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great portable grill.","review":"Great low cost portable grill. Most of the grills like these today are junk and they seem to stop working after a short while due to the gas valve eventually going out (the valve on theses looks much better made). I have only taken mine out a couple times so far. It does have some very nice features over most similar grills; electric start, which is much easier then trying to light by hand, the grill also has a nice feature that allows you to hang the lid on the grill while flipping your food, and a clip to lock the metal legs to keep the unit from moving while in-use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Portable Grill","review":"My husband received this 5 years ago as a gift from work and it still works great.

Perfect for our RV."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected from a Weber","review":"I thought the number of positive reviews meant that this is a solid grill. Unfortunately, it seems to be more in line with the negative reviews.The first issue I have is with the starter. I have tried placing it at different distances from the gas pipe, but no luck. I have to use a lighter to start the grill.Secondly, it doesn't get hot. I've cooked hotdogs, brats, and a veggie patty on the grill and I barely saw any burn marks on the dogs. They also took forever to cook. I guess it might be a grill that requires having the lid on. I would never try to cook a steak on it and I'm hesitant to toss a chicken breast on it.The heat is also uneven right-to-left. I wouldn't expect to cook a variety of foods on this sized grill at any time so the heat should be more uniform."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not reliable","review":"I've owned this grill for about 4 years. I originally bought it because it was small and would store in my R.V.. I started having problems with it not heating up or going out altogether and having to be re-lit a lot. I would sometimes have to shake the bottle and then it would cook o.k. for a while. I've replaced the temp/regulator control valve twice so far: I sometimes seem to get a good flame if I use a pair of vise-grips to hold the dial down. I've switched to a bulk propane tank and there are times (like on Superbowl Sunday trying to cook wings for friends) when the grill simply would not heat up, kept going out and I ended up pan frying the wings in the house. And there is no flame height difference between low to high. It's all the same. 'C'mon Weber: this is a simple B.B.Q! Make it work right! Use a quality temp control/regulator valve not made in Korea!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Go anywhere weber grill","review":"Not sure if this is a problem with the entire line or just the one I bought, but after spending the time putting it together and attaching the small propane tank, and after a few tries at getting it to start with the ignitor, it only produced a minimal flame even on high. After 2O minutes on this grill the thin chicken tenderloin strips weren't even starting to cook. Had to take them inside and finish them in the skillet on the stove.

Mr. Hofstadter has wide-ranging interests, and his enthusiasm is laudable, but it is sadly not married to a disciplined or artistic sensibility. He has no ear for language; he thinks that poetry is merely a matter of sing-song rhythm and relentless rhyme; he has no sense of the magical qualities of certain words in certain combinations. This is an amateur's hack-job of a translation, made more egregious by the arrogance of the translator."},{"rating":"1","title":"A truly misguided translation of a great work","review":"Hofstadter is a brilliant man, with no ear for poetry. One aspect of human intelligence that computers have some hope of matching is pattern recognition.

I agonized over which model to get and finally settled on this one. It went together great. Quick simple easy. I'm currently cooking my first pork butt on it and I love the way it's cooking. My only complaint is the hook for the lid to rest on the side of the grill. It seems to be shorter than the hook on my old grill. In any case I don't recommend using this hook to hang your lid on the side. I barely bumped it and the lid fell to the ground and bent the handle. From now on I'll just set the lid on the ground. If the hook won't properly hold the lid when rested there it should not even be on the lid.

With the ash-catcher on the Gold model, I feel comfortable using it, even when the wind is blowing pretty strong. (Which it does a lot around here!) I don't think I would have felt comfortable using the Silver in some of the wind / heat conditions we have around here. I also love the hinged grill. I barbecued some pork for several hours to make pulled pork (my first try, and it turned out GREAT!) and it was easy to add extra charcoal from time to time without losing a lot of heat.

I put it together and sure enough, this time it is not out of round, it's just a BAD FIT between the lid and the bowl. I believe the quality of these grills has dimished over just the past couple years. I used a friend of mine's one touch silver that is two or three years old and her lid fits great! I'm very sad to write this review because I've always been a big Weber fan, I have a Weber Smokey Mountain cooker that I absolutely LOVE! Wish I could say the same about this.

The charcoal chimney starter is also a great product that take the fuss out of lighting charcoal. Its also healthier as no fluid is necessary for lighting. I know the instructions say to clean once a year but but I clean my grill after each use with oven cleaner. Just spray it on and clean in 20 mins. and all the gunk is gone.

Luckily, Amazon is great on returns, so I sent it back (on their dime) for a replacement.The second one arrived over night (thanks again, Amazon!), and, lo and behold, the handles on this one was bent radically out of shape, with the finish flaking off the handle and on the outside of the kettle near the handle.I'm not sure what, exactly, is going on with Weber, but, with the quality I'm seeing on these grills and the price they're asking, I just don't think they're a good risk..."},{"rating":"2","title":"great grill","review":"This grill has turned my husband from a grilling amatuer into a grilling pro.

Most electronics with external AC adapters work for 100-240V @ 50-60Hz, which means they can work in Japan, Europe, and the US. The only problem is all the stupid outlets and plugs are different!If you read the label on your AC adapter it should clearly state which voltage (V) and frequency (Hz) bands it supports. It won't convert the voltage or frequency, so be sure to check. Most laptops made for the US market are safe to use in Europe and Asia, but always check the voltages and frequencies supported by your device and the ones used in the countries you will be visiting.

Eric reluctantly takes them into his RV and then begins with a series of statements redolent of macho nonsense. Since he has the gun, it seems Greg and Jesse have no choice but to go along. And yet they don't.The main problem for me with this film was the combination of stilted acting and the characters' ill-considered choices.

The batteries still seemed to be good because the LED was bright. I replaced with fresh batteries in spite of this, but it didn't help. I also tried to 'reconnect' the mouse many times and installed the intellipoint software - all in vain. Completely jumpy - you have very poor control over the pointer on the screen.

You get what you pay for with a cordless mouse. For a cordless mouse equal to a 30 dollar cord optical mouse you would need to buy a cordless worth 80. Dont buy a cheap cordless mouse they just dont work. I recomend a logitech mx300 or a dual optical you will then get precise mousing for the same price. THIS MOUSE DOES NOT OUTPERFORM A BALL MOUSE so unless you want to sit there ignorantly pretending the mouse actually performs well as you get out kick of seeing a cordless optical mouse YOU SHOULD STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRDOUCT.

Very little \\"troubleshooting\\" in the software, Microsoft online support basically told me to reinstall drivers, etc. Even though I performed initial installation correctly, I redid it, with no improvement. I'll be returning it for a mouse that works correctly - I like the scroll wheel function in a mouse, and am not willing to trade it in, in case a mechanical problem, since it'd be at risk to not work again.."},{"rating":"1","title":"More clutter than a standard mouse!","review":"I was very surprised upon opening the wireless mouse packaging to discover that the receiver (with very long cord) is about five times the size of my wireless network card. I cannot understand why a mouse would require such a large receiver. Furthermore, this totally defeats the purpose of buying the product if you want to reduce cords and clutter. This should be shown in the product information provided."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great except more heavy than cord mouse","review":"This mouse is great. I use 802.11b network, 2.4 Ghz cordless phone, and a GSM cellphone(I think also runs on 2.4 Ghz frequency). The mouse doesn't interfere with any of the products. I use to have a Logitech cord mouse which also works great; but it looks ugly (the newer Logitech looks good too, but I think M$ looks better)and has a cord. This mouse is much better looking and obviously doesn't have the cord tangle problem. However, cordless mouse is heavier than cord mouse. Without the two batteries, cordless mouse is only a little bit heavier than the cord mouse. So bottom line, if you got a trackball mouse, definately get an optical mouse IMMEDIATELY. If you absolutely hate the cord tangling together, you can not go wrong with this mouse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horribly Inaccurate","review":"i had been wanting to go wireless for a while, but i also wanted something optical. when i saw the MS had come up with an inexpensive solution, i jumped at the chance to try it.i'll cut to the chase. the mouse is extremely erratic. first, don't even think about using it with the ps/2 port--the mouse will hardly respond. it works far better on USB, but there's a significant lag that does not go over well if you need the mouse for anything requiring precision. i tried the mouse under a million different OS settings (winXP), changed the mousing surface, played with the receiver, swapped batteries---nothing improved the performance of the unit.basically, if you're a gamer or an artist, stay away. this mouse will frustrate the heck out of you. shame on microsoft for not testing this thing a little more."},{"rating":"1","title":"decent mouse if you get one that isn't defective","review":"It has the great convenience of being wireless with good range.

I have had this mouse for 6 weeks or so. It wasn't long after buying the mouse that my double click with the left button started to cut out. Sometimes lasting 5 mins other times days. I have spent a few hours on Microsoft Tech support trying to fix it. It finally started working on its own. Today however it stopped working in the middle of a Photoshop project. Can any of you imagine working on a Photoshop project with a left mouse button cutting out? The only thing that kept me from finding out what the interior of this mouse looks like by utilizing a tool I call \\"My living room wall\\" is through repeating the serenity prayer while ocaasionally slamming the mouse down on my desk. This thing isn't getting any better for me. If you buy this mouse after I have written this, better check for new drivers or find your receipt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for office applications, lousy with games!","review":"I think the title of my review says it all. I gave this mouse only 2 hours of use. It worked ok for using office applications like Excel or Word and fine on browsing the internet, but I was always left with the feeling it is slow and imprecise. When I tried it in Age of Mythology, it was downright too slow to work effectively. I could not click on my units as quickly as my regular Logitech Optical mouse, so I am returning MS' wireless blue mouse tomorrow. Note, I already upped the precision and mouse speed all the way to max, but it was still slow! I do not recommend this item as a gamer's mouse.

But, it lags and skips around sometimes which can be very annoying when precision is needed (ie. playing games) Even on the desktop, the cursor will sometimes skip totally across the screen while you are moving the mouse.

I use my computers mainly for gaming so I was hesitant at first of getting Wireless, but I wish I had bought earlier! The mouse works flawlessly with Windows XP and all my games, including FPS games where mouse is critical such as Unreal 2, Splinter Cell etc. The ONLY thing I'll miss with this mouse are buttons 3 and 4 I had on my old IntelliMouse Optical. I'll probably be upgrading soon to the Optical Desktop Pro keyboard/mouse combo and giving the Blue to a friend or using it on another PC."},{"rating":"2","title":"decent 3 button optical mouse","review":"I've been using this mouse for 4 months at work now. I noticed the mouse pointer getting erratic, but after changing the batteries it works as good as before.The mouse feels comfortable in my hand.

This mouse is not the same as the wired MS blue mouse (which I don't recommend for extended use).

It is not big enough to serve more people. After several uses we learned that we had to use more charcoal, and once we made the change and increased the amount of charcoal (almost to the top)the grill was able to cook a second round of food. Packs up very easily, sets up very easily, and puts together very easily. Can cook 2 steaks and a few franks OR 6 hamburgers at one time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Takes a lot of abuse","review":"First of all, despite some comments here that would lead you to believe otherwise, this is NOT a gas grill. The dead giveaway is the word \\"charcoal\\" in the product title.Even though this is designed to be a travel grill (with folding legs that secure the cover in place), I use it as my primary grill. I like to grill at all times of the year so I leave it on the patio all year round and sometimes have to dig through a snowdrift to find it. I'm surprised it hasn't rusted out yet since it has been sitting outside for more than five years. The wood parts are weathered, but still no sign of metal corrosion. When this one eventually goes I'll probably get small round Weber since I really don't need the travel feature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reviewers, please note.....","review":"To the reviewers who report that the grille doesn't get hot enough, the slightest breeze blows the flame out and you should need to stock up on extra gas cannisters, I would point out:THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE CHARCOAL MODEL!!Once the coals are fully going on mine, nothing short of Hurricane Katrina could blow them out, and with the proper amount of charcoal loaded in, you have all the heat you'll ever need. I have nothing but praise for mine. Nice going, Weber!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best little BBQ grill in PA","review":"This product is great! Nothing flimsy about it and very easy to put together.

I've been thinking about getting a new grill, but forking over hundreds of dollars for a standup felt a bit much. Even though the price of the go-anywhere grill is cheap, it is pretty solid. I've only used it once so far, but it works nicely. I can fit 4 ears of corn on the grill, 16 chicken wings or 6 teriyaki beef skewers. It took a few minutes to assemble the grill and is brain dead simple. the best part is the portability. I used it for the first time today and as the meat was starting to cook, it started to rain. Thanks to the unpredictable NorthEast weather. Since the grill is portable, I picked it up and moved to the garage. Try that with a standup grill.I would gladly recomment the grill to friends and family"},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy with it!","review":"I got this grill for Mother's Day from my boyfriend. He is really into buying things that last and things that are worth the money. This is one of those items! This grill is great!

This is just the perfect size for a single guy or a couple living in a small home or apartment. The assembly was a snap and definitely very portable and I cannot wait to take it on my next camping trip. The air vents on both the base unit and the lid really gets the fire going and they're all closable for easy extinguishing and saves the charcoal for the next grilling. I was pleasantly surpised how well it performed for its size. I have no hesitation giving this one 5 stars. Regardless of all the fancy brands out there, Weber is an American icon and they know how to make charcoal grills. Did I mention that I'm a new convert from gas grills? I know. Gross, right? Gas grilling. Gimme a break."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great quality, good design, convenient size, hard to find","review":"Another reviewer pointed out that the flat bottom design provides more even heating than the kettle styles. It also uses less fuel. Very durable--I've had maybe 2 or 3 over 30 years. Very packable. I have often used it for camping trips or visits to friends centered on cooking. It is hard to find in retail stores; probably because the profit margin per stocking/retail space is lower than for giant gas grills.

The Joe is very awkward to efficiently pack with its kettle design, and protruding legs. My expectations were that the G-A grill would be comparable to the Joe performance-wise, and provide storage efficiency. Although the G-A grill does consume less space, I don't think it offers a huge advantage over the Joe (I've also travelled with the Joe). I believe the Joe to provide cooking advantages due to it's kettle design, and different air flow, venting, structure. So I give this one four stars because I expected better performance, and more advantages over its cousin... I still really like this grill, and think it'll last forever--something I really value!Hey Weber,Bring back the wood handles!Happy grilling!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent travel grill","review":"Got this for a tailgate event and was very happy. Cooked for 10 hungry guys no problem. Clean up was fine, although it would be nice to have a way to dump ashes and left over coals without removing the lower grate - sort of like the large Webers.

I have bought a new \\"El Cheapo\\" grill from walmart for the past 4 seasons of tailgating. The reason I bought new grills is because they dont last!

Also it has a very low profile when folded up (I can easily fit it in my midsized cars trunk alongside the folding chairs, canopy and cooler). The ablilty to control cooking temps with multiple vents is also handy. Altogether this is a great product and well worth the few extra bucks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Weber Review","review":"Great little grille; perfect for the needs of my wife and I. Air vents top and bottom at both ends allow for excellant cooking control. Lower vents are on sides so charcoal ash doesn't fall out the bottom.It would be nice to have handles on the cooking grille for easier removal.

For those purposes, it's great -- it folds up into a secure, compact little unit that goes anywhere without a fuss. It's also well constructed and has held together through several years of rough use.Be aware though that it's definitely not a good choice if you're doing a lot of grilling in one place -- it never quite gets hot enough to work well as a primary grill, even if you leave the cover on and let it preheat before adding your meat. Any wind at all strips the heat right out of it, even with the lid on.Make sure you stock up on the little gas cylinders or get the tank adapter -- nothing worse than running out of fuel in the middle of a batch of food."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best portable grill","review":"I have had many portable grills, but this is my latest and the best so far. The only problem being that the bottom vents are very difficult to operate when it is in use. But, then I don't expect to use them in the slow cooking mode in the campground.If you really want to get the best out of this, make sure you buy a Chimney to fire your charcoal and then transfer them to the grill when they are ready.I have grilled corn, sausages, veggies, chicken, etc. on this for 15-20 people and I could have continued for more.One time we found the campsite next to ours empty and so set this up on the table there while we were eating at our table.

I agree with some of the comments: it's light reading, it reads like a novel and it's written by a very caring owner. BUT: there's a lot of fluff in it - the essential information could be written in less than 200 pages. Too much one-sided information based on the writer's experience with his own pet. Not much scientifically founded data, considering it's a book of more than 600 pages. Essentially it's not worth your money.

It was so helpful that I told my vet about it, the pet store, and even a stranger I met in the reptile section of the pet store.

A few weeks later we received our first purchase to help guide us ... your book. We were able to immediately determine some of the problems we were encountering. By resolving these problems, we now have 2 healthy, separated iguanas. We were on the verge of loosing one of them and it took us weeks to return her to a healthy state. The information in your book not only saved her life but really both of their lives (as we would surely have continued making ignorant mistakes). We only wish for one thing more ... a video!

I have used it for nearly a year now. This hasbeen the best outdoor grill I have ever cooked on. I have owned a two Weber Charcoal grills prior to this and most recently, a Sears gas grill... The charcoal grills worked well, but were not very convenient. As for the Sears gas grill, I got so tired of burning my food on it that I gave it to my brother and purchased the Weber Genesis. Now, no more burned food! It seems that the secret to success is the construction of the Weber grill: three full length individually adjustable burners, probably 8-10 inches between the flame and your food, and two layers of metal diffusers between the flame and the food. I have success with steaks, burgers, brats, fish, chicken, vegetables, and pork roasts. This is a high quality product, it works very well, and I don't think you will be disappointed. I'm not!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to assemble, highly durable","review":"Weber's quality is far superior to most mass-marketed grills out there. As opposed to my Char-Broil, which I dutifully replaced burners and cooking grates on every other year, all parts on the Weber will last a long time. Everyone I know who has one swears by the workmanship and the cooking quality. Assembly took approximately 1.5 hours, including set-up and clean-up time."},{"rating":"2","title":"I had the same problem","review":"....

I replace the regulator and after about 15 minutes the problem returned. Not sure what I am going to do at this point."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super 'Natural' Recording","review":"For Michelle Shocked fans, there's no need to explain how truly remarkable this album, and artist, is. This review is for everyone else.Deep Natural simply can't be compared to early Michelle Shocked albums. For Michelle, each album is an opportunity to break new ground. As she put it at a recent show, \\"its nice to go home and visit the room where you slept, but you wouldn't want to sleep in the same bed for the rest of your life.\\" No danger of that with Deep Natural.This is an album has a unique joyous, even spiritual tone that grows with each listen. Recorded by anyone else, Deep Natural could have been a too-preachy recording bent on spreading the gospel to non-believers. But with Michelle's optimistic and deft touch, it is an uplifting, transforming effort that will bring a smile to even a confirmed cynic. Buy this CD and songs like House Burning Down will keep you rocking, while Joy, That's So Amazing, and Forgive to Forget may change your outlook on life."},{"rating":"1","title":"The CD player wasn't broken - the CD just sounded that bad","review":"I tried listening to this CD and the music sounded so distorted and awful, I thought the player was broken.

Which is a shame because Michelle Shocked has always been an automatic purchase for me. No more.I don't know if it happened in the mixing, the recording, or with the instrument choices, but whatever it is, it ain't good. The music is the audio equivalent to pouring porridge through a sieve.And since she's found religion, her lyrics have gone from razor sharp attitude and storytelling to just bludgeoning us with a club that is both patronizing and wearisome. She's always written about stuff that is important to her, but she did it in a voice that captured my attention.

The playback is jumpy to the point of being unwatchable (oddly, you can record tapes in EP on this machine and they will play back OK on other machines. I'm not sure what the problem is). Another annoyance is that when you fast-forward (e.g. to skip commercials), it tends to overshoot when you resume normal speed, causing you to miss about 15 seconds of the program unless you back up again... vexing! One good thing about the machine is that tape rewinding is blazingly fast."},{"rating":"2","title":"My new VCR","review":"The VCR arrived in good shape in good time.

It has easy set-up and decent features, but the sound and picture quality are very bad. Audio playback is noticeably muted. I had been using a Samsung for 12 years and would continue using that same unit today if not for the fact I had to open it all open it all up to retrieve a snagged tape - and then never got it back together right. So I thought, well it is time for a new VCR anyways. I have always liked Sony equipment - TVs, CD players etc. However the images on this one are just plain bad - even on the best tape speed. You can not see details on people's faces, colors wash together and there is a lot of noise on screen. Compared this unit right next to a friend's old Funai and theirs is so much better. Went back and forth hoping that maybe it was my set-up. But in recording and playback, this Sony really stunk. I am returning mine and looking for something else. Oh, if I could only have back my old VCR!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Expected more from Sony.","review":"I knew my expectations shouldn't be set that high for a lower priced VCR, but the poor playback quality and even poorer recording quality was way below my already low expectations. I tried several different combination of VHS tapes and recording speeds, including premium high grade tapes, but got the same poor results from recordings; fuzzy, blurred, dark, and even audio was sub-par. Playback of retail tapes while not as bad as the ones I recorded were the worst I have seen from any VCR. I thought perhaps the unit had a factory defect, but upon reading these other reviews I see that it is most likely not the case. The other complaint I have of this unit is the rewind and forward mode is very annoyingly loud. It also lacks VRC+ and s-video input/outputs. I really expected more from Sony.

Finally we called the seller to see if they got it ok. A week after the call the replacement came with a little sticker telling us not to return it to them.

Plug it in, plug in the output to the TV, and your're done.The VCR itself works great, and is very straight forward. The quality is good too. My only complaint is that it is clearly not made very well (but I bet none of them are). It's cheap plastic and I'm sure if I dropped it 2 feet it would be toast.

Even after I proved I could record in color using a borrowed 8yr old Zenith VCR and the identical cables/hook-up and tape, Sony refuses to acknowledge a compatability issue with Tivo. They did make me the generous offer of shipping me an identical, \\"refurbished\\" model for $45-$80 dollars (depending on warranty status)...that also won't work.

Almost better to figure it out yourself or talk with a friend who is like you."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Tedious Read","review":"I found this book hard to read as it is so tedious, especially the first half. She belabors so many points. It might work well as a textbook, but as a book for the layperson to read, it wouldn't be my best recommendation.One gets the impression from reading the jacket that you are going to get a lot of help from this book, especially in finding your calling. She tells you what happens when you do, but no concrete answers about how to get there. Her whole idea is you have to grow. As you grow you will find better ways to cope with the workplace. I don't need her to tell me that. To me this is a cop-out after she promises so much help.There is some straightforward advice about how to handle bullies and how to negotiate a better situation for yourself at work.Ms. Jaeger may be good at personal counseling, seminars and workshops, but as far as I'm concerned, writing books is not HER CALLING."},{"rating":"1","title":"sometimes useful","review":"This is a somewhat useful book for those who accept the highly- sensitive-person designation. Ms. Jaeger provides some helpful advice, though a fair bit is so general as to render it almost useless. Also, I think even she is aware that there are many cases in which people with family obligations simply cannot afford to leave dull, menial, and wearisome jobs, however soul-destroying such work might be. Ms. Jaeger's book deserved a much more careful editing. It is full of grammatical errors, most glaringly--pronoun-reference problems and needless repetition, which frequently obstruct the message. I appreciate the efforts of the author to tackle the subject, but the book ought to have been much shorter and more finely-tuned. A good editor should have assisted her with this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best little grill out there! Period!","review":"I bought this grill back in 2005 and still it is with me today. (It's actually my 2nd one which I had since 1998) I cook on it at least once a week and have made bbq for 1 - 10 people. It's perfect for the beach, patio, camping, etc...I have learned this pit well and I have no problem grilling beef ribs (2 racks), beef fajitas, sausage, 1 chicken (split halves) all on one grillin. You can make awesome steaks, fish, etc... anywhere you go without too much pit to carry or too much wood/charcoal used.I chose this one over other similar Weber models because it has the vent on the lid AS WELL AS THE SIDES. Without these, the fire smothers too easily. You can't beat the price either.Pay attention to buying the \\"Gold\\" and not the \\"Silver\\" as the silver doesn't have the vents on the side, but instead on the bottom."},{"rating":"2","title":"Weber Makes a Real Performer","review":"Weber's Smokey Joe Grill is a real performer. We are so pleased we purchased one of these. We cook a lot on the grill weather permitting. The Smokey Joe Grill fires up quick. The Smokey Joe Grill also cooks up burgers, hotdogs and steaks evenly and in short order to perfection. I really mean it. We love it. The food is ready in no time. The Smokey Joe Grill is really an efficient unit and is quite innocuous in appearance. It is quite mobile and seems to fit anywhere for use or storage. It is actually quite amazing. We have noticed that we use less charcoal, lighter fluid, save time, get better tasting food and save time on cleanup. We own two depending on how much we are going to cook. The smaller units are perfect for two people or a third or even a forth if somebody happens to stop by."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less than expected","review":"I purchased the Smokey Joe as a camping/alternative grill. I have been disappointed in its' performance. It is very difficult to get a good coal bed established! It appears that there is not enough ventilation from the bottom to allow sufficient air to the coals. It is very difficult to get the charcoal hot enough to grill steaks/hamburgs/hotdogs. I would not buy another"},{"rating":"1","title":"NO HOLES ON BOTTOM","review":"I just got this grill, I DO NOT Like it, it needs air holes on the bottom. It doesn't seem like the coals stay hot enough, not enough air circulating...ok as a small back up grill, but I wish I had purchased the original one with holes and plate on bottom. The locking lid is the only part i like on this Gold model apart from the other one. I DO NOT recommend buying this grill. I think I'll order the bigger 22.5 inch one next.

It it built very well and looks good too but this little gye has a MAJOR design flaw!! The vents on the bottom of the unit are too small! If you cook with the lid on and all vents open (max air flow possible) your charcoal will be cold and nearly out in 20 minutes and your chicken or whatever will be uncooked. Now the fun begins. Take everything out, blow compressed air on the coals to get them going or add more lighter fluid... It's a matter of air flow being adequate to keep the coals hot. I plan on drilling more holes but rust will limit it's life. Maybe I will complain to Weber?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Get one","review":"If you bbq away from home this is your grill.

I definitely recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smokey Joe Grill","review":"Love it!!!! It was a gift for my husband and he said it was the best gift he can remember."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Little Grill for Home or Travel","review":"This is the third little Weber I've had in the past 20 years - I've never worn one out; the first two were stolen! I like the locking handle on the new model. One great feature of these grills is that when you are done cooking, you can close all the vents and the fire will go out in about 15-20 minutes, saving whatever's left of your charcoal for the next time. With the handle locked, it won't spill in the back of your pickup on the way home.It really does do a great job of cooking, as good as the larger Webers, just for a smaller crowd. We had a Mulberry tree trimmed in our yard and I saved all the chipped up wood to use for smoke flavoring. You still need a charcoal fire for heat; just throw in a handful of chips before you put the meat & corn on the cob in and close the top vent down to make it smoke. Mmmmm, Mmmmm!You can eat like a gourmet anywhere you tote this to! Just add a cooler full of longnecks....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shipping Limbo","review":"When you charge my credit card, you need to ship the item.

Weber 40020 Smokey Joe Gold Charcoal Grill\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"No bottom vents","review":"Unlike the Smokey Joe silver, the gold model does not have vents on the bottom under the coals. The vents on the gold model are on the sides above the coals and are held in place by the carry handle frame. This location does not allow for proper air circulation as in other Weber charcoal grills and I had trouble getting the coals hot enough to cook even after letting them burn for a half hour. I had to transfer the food to my gas grill to cook 4 chicken breasts. Placing the cover on the grill seems to extinguish the coals. The coals were a brand new bag of Kingsford and they were dry."},{"rating":"2","title":"cooked 4 tray of drumsticks perfectly","review":"let me tell you this bad boy is great. i was able to cook 4 tray of drumstick perfectly.must have grill."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor heat; coals go out because no air flow from bottom up","review":"I've used this grill twice now and what a total waste of time. I totally agree with the person who said the coals keep going out because there is no air flow under the coals. The food stops cooking and you have to relight the coals. I just saw one by Char-Broil at Lowe's for $30 that I plan on buying after work. That grill has a venting system (not just a louver) positioned in a separate cavity under the grill that draws air from the sides of the cavity and then up towards the charcoal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Only 1 adjustment","review":"I only gave it 4 stars cuz now I really wish the ashes had a way to get out... but hey... for mini-grill it works great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Weber fan, but this is not their best work. Design Flaw (SJ Gold)","review":"I'm a long time Weber fan and love the majority of their products. I've had a number of their charcoal grills over the years and figured the Smokey Joe GOLD would be a nice little addition for balcony and picnic grilling. Unfortunately, Weber designed this grill with an inherent flaw. Unlike their other charcoal grills, the air inlet vents are above and to the sides of the coals rather than below them. When you place the lid on the grill (as Weber encourages all customers to do in all of their literature/instructions), the coals cool and go out rather than cook the food. To use this grill, I've had to make it a 'lidless' cooker and never use the lid. I may try the SJ Silver or the Go-Anywhere as both of these grills have the air inlets below the coals and shouldn't have this same problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I had listened to the poor design reviews. Very dissapointing.","review":"The overall build quality is pretty good as to be expected from Weber. However, it really does have a serious and perplexing design flaw. The ventilation holes are located high on the sides of the grill, where the handle attaches. This places them ABOVE the charcoal so it never gets enough air. Not only is it difficult to maintain a temp of over 325 degrees but you will have trouble keeping it lit with the cover on. Forget about cooking a steak or burgers on this grill as it doesn't ever get hot enough to cook beef properly. Weber should have never let this product go to market."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Vent Design","review":"I own many Weber products and find that the design is almost always first class. That is not the case with this gold version of the Smokey Joe. As others have said, the vents being on the side does not allow for proper air flow through the charcoal bed. As a result, it does not produce enough heat to properly seer and cook a steak. Other foods cook very slowly as well. It is so bad that I don't find it to be worth using at all. Although the quality of construction is excellent, I plan to discard this model and purchase the silver, which I have used at the home of a friend. The silver model produces a hot fire and cooks as expected. It will not be as easy to carry, but that is a small price to pay for proper cooking ability."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for smoker conversion/modification","review":"I purchased this grill specifically to convert it into a portable slow smoker. Do a Google search for \\"Mini WSM\\" for more information on this conversion . No modification is required to the Smokey Joe itself, but you do add a 32 quart tamale steamer between the base and the lid. The result is a fantastic smoker that is every bit as good as the Weber Smokey Mountain, but at a fraction of the cost. Because no modification is required to the Smokey Joe, it easily converts back into a regular grill. The side vents on the Gold version are better suited when used as a base of a smoker than the bottom vents of the Silver version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best little charcoal grill I ever had.","review":"I have own this grill for over 6 years and use it at home and when my wife and I travel in our 5th wheel RV. I like the locking lid and when you close it up after cooking you still conserve charcoal for next time. My son has a larger gas grill but loves charcoal cooking so I got him one of these for this Christmas. This grill is good for cooking meals for up to 3 or 4 people if you keep the meal fairly simple."},{"rating":"2","title":"40 BBQs and Still Going Strong!","review":"I bought this grill to replace a cheap portable Bayou grill that fell apart after 5 uses. We have been extremely pleased with this great little Weber. I have no problem fitting enough food for my entire family on this grill. It's been very durable and hasn't rusted or warped at all. We bought this as a temporary grill until I could find a deal on a larger charcoal grill. We ended up liking this one so much that I never did buy a bigger one. I'd highly recommend this Weber Smokey Joe Charcoal Grill.
