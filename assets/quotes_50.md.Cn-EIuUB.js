No scratches or anything. But what upset me the most, was that every single cd case was damaged inside. I'm talking about the plastic button you have to press in order to take the cd out of the case. All of them were broken to a point, where the cd's dont have a hold, and they're basically lose in the case. I think the reason is that they choose a slim cd case for 2 disc's.

Smaller plates (or bowls for that matter) are not secured by the inadequate wire lips ( about 1/8 inch )so they fall flat and then fall out onto the floor because the sides are completely open (3 1/4 inches) . Anything small dumps out of the side opening and onto the floor. The utensil basket has a divider which moves around and your utensils end up laying down in the bottom.

I was wrong and Polder should be ashamed of such inadequate design!"},{"rating":"1","title":"polder stainless reversible dishrack","review":"I should have listened to reviews I read. The rack does not hold plates/bowls securely. The utensil bucket is not deep or narrow enough to hold common utensils upright.

Also, I kept finding water next to the tray and discovered that it was collecting on the rolled lip on the bottom of the tray and spilling over. We corrected this by placing a board under the high side, creating more slope. This could be done by making the plastic feet on that end higher. The addition of verticle bars on the front of the rack would avoid small dishes slipping through.

At all.The package I had was not crunchy in the usual sense: the little cubes were tough to bite into, and little bits of cube stuck to your teeth. The cubes were barely sweet and had no discernable taste of peaches. After an initial handful, no one in our family would go near the things. I ended up throwing the remaining cubes into a batch of cupcake batter, figuring that it might add a bit of extra nutrition. It did that, but even better, the chocolate cupcakes have a mild taste of peach.But there is no way I would buy these again as a subtle cupcake flavoring.

In the case of this book by Mr. Ladinsky, there are two completely separate questions:1. Do you (did you) like the poems in this book?2. Were these poems written by Mr. Ladinsky, or by Hafez?It is very important not to confuse these two questions! The fact that you like the poems in this book does NOT mean that they were written by Hafez, any more than it means that they were written by Shakespeare.I don't know a lot of Persian (Farsi) myself, but my own reading over the past few decades, plus some input from a dearly beloved friend who is a professor of Persian poetry, tells me this: Hafez NEVER (or very rarely) uses the word \\"God.\\" That would be \\"khoda\\" in Persian, or \\"Allah\\" in Arabic. You can read for entire weeks in Hafez, and never find the word \\"khoda\\" or \\"Allah,\\" unless it is in some formula, such as \\"al-hamdullah.\\"So how does Mr. Ladinsky explain this?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Hafez","review":"While the poems may be interesting at times, this is not Hafez.

It is an imaginative appreciation of Hafez via abracadabra! He and his publisher are shameless.Ladinsky's many defensive rationalizations to the contrary prove him to be incorrigibly anti-intellectual and narcissistic. One of my favorites is his assertion that no one really translates Hafez in any case because the text is so corrupt! (From an Amazon comment.)How so very fortunate we are to have Ladinsky's priceless gift to liberate Hafez from the shambles of a corrupt text he can not even read, so that we can be graced by his miraculous translations!

There is not a dry eye in any room of my house.If I could read Hafiz in Persian, of course I would.

You can't use dishwasher detergent that has citrus, because that eats away at the stainless. You must take the flatware out of the dishwasher and dry it completely, or it will rust.

Look for 18/8 or 18/10 (18% chromium, 8 or 10% nickel) - but beware - several Oneida flatware sets claim to be 18/10 in the Amazon description but in reality are 18/0 again with zero nickel content and again will rust.

We have well water with alot of sulfur in it, and i have yet to see a speck of rust on any piece of this set. my only complaint is that it's not quite as shiny as when i first got it, but other than that it's held up wonderfully and i've had it for almost a year. the brushed pattern is really nice too, helps hide the inevitable scratches that we all see on our daily use tableware."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heavy Duty Flatware","review":"My husband bought me these on Christmas 2011, so I've had them for a year.

I recently bought this flatware set and could not believe after three weeks it started showing small rust spots on the handle of the pieces. Additionally, there were sharp edges on the spoon and knife. I was accustomed to the quality of the Oneida silverware my mom used. Now I realize that their products are no longer made in the Oneida NY factory but rather imported from around the world wherever the labor costs are probably cheapest and without regard to quality control. This product is very disappointing and I wouldn't even consider ever purchasing any products imported by Oneida. - Deeply disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice","review":"This is a reasonably priced high quality set of flatware that is perfect for basic needs.

I have won many live and online competition and playing in many professional tournaments. I also teach spades to intermediate players looking to become advanced players. I reccomend this book to all of them. It is an excellent source to the knowledge of the strategical and logical approaches to the game. The strategies he covers are widely used by advanced players and his sections on last hand bidding are the best I've ever seen in print. It is a great stepping stone and guide from begining spading to advanced spading.

This is perfect, albeit I'd agree with another reviewer that the two storage containers are pointless and annoying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great litter box for multi cat households","review":"This box is huge!

We have one long-legged, big cat who is a Lynx Point Siamese/Tabby mix and he could not get turned around in the box to get comfortable. I wish the openings at the end for the litter scoop were not there and the box was longer and that the indentation was not in the front making it less wide. It is now in the garage waiting for a yard sale and has been replaced with a Home Depot large mortar mixing tub! And, in another part of the house we have a large, under the bed, plastic container now being used for a litter box that is both long and wide. Both work great for our situation! We use scooping litter in both and have small wastebaskets near each one containing a large litter scoop."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT for 2 CATS!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Finally, a decent litter box! We had 2 reg. size litter boxes for our 2 cats. My male cat is 23 lbs and could barely fit in the boxes. He would be half in half out. Litter would be flung everywhere and when they tried to cover up their stuff, they would reach outside of the litter box for imaginary litter. I could never find a large litter box so I was going to make one out of a rubbermaid box but I saw this and figured I'd give it a try for the low price. This is the greatest thing ever!!!!!! Even if you only have 1 cat, this is a great litter box, no more mess and the scoop holders are great! And the price is lower than smaller litter boxes at Walmart! Just make sure that you have somewhere to put it because it is BIG. Also, the picture shows a blue box but the one delivered was off white, so if color matters to you, you might want to check into that."},{"rating":"2","title":"ENORMOUS","review":"My two cats are starting to have quarrels, so we've been doubling up on all the cat essentials so they don't have to share things. Our first litter box is pretty large by litter box standards, and I thought that this one would be comparable in size. I was shocked when I opened the box that it came in and discovered that the litter box filled up the entire thing! This was obviously my fault for not reading the details, but I love the size anyway. It also has storage for your litter scoops, which solves the dilemma of \\"where the h*** do I put this thing with poo residue all over it?\\" without having to buy an overpriced scoop with stand. Great price for a great box! Just make sure that you know just how giant it actually is, otherwise it may be too big for your needs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its big","review":"The item is large and high enough to keep litter in the box .

Now I only have to clean out this litter box and 1 littermaid for 6 cats about twice a day. It holds so much litter at one time which means I don't have to have mutiple boxes of litter around the house. I don't have to refill it everyday because it is so deep and holds so much. The neat compartments hold litter scoop, litter deodorizer, and even a place to have a bag to hold the waste as you scoop."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Investment","review":"This litter box is amazing. I have an elderly cat who was having trouble keeping his waste inside of the box. I wasn't sure what I could do about the problem. I was cleaning his box more than twice per day and he was ruining my floor. I read a number of reviews on the Petmate and decided to give it a try. Finally, a bOx big enough for him to keep everything inside! I couldn't be happier. He gets in and out with ease he can dig until his heart is content. There is less spillage and tracking. The tracking has not completely ended mind you, but it has significantly decreased. The only thing I struggle with is moving the darn thing with litter in it. The unit is quite heavy so I suggest emptying it before picking it up or moving it.

Even to this day, Shakespeare must surely remain as one of the finest craftsmen (if not the finest) of the modern English language, and all English-speakers would do well to harken to the Bard.Anyway, this printing (hardcover) is very attractive, at a distance. The leather (if it's genuine) is not of the highest quality, the pages have a tendency to stick together upon first opening of the book, a result of which is the rare white streak in the text. On a more positive note, the glossary at the back is of frequent use, though it lacks some words esoteric to this modern, American reader. I haven't really read their notes that also come in the back, so I can't comment on them.However, the fact that one can obtain the complete works of Shakespeare, hardcover in leather, for a reasonable price, itself makes this edition desireable."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't enjoy this book","review":"I thought the book was not very good.

I don't want to seem harsh or rude, but if you are looking for a well-acted Christian movie, this is not what you want to go for.

But it is far from your typical watered down mushy \\"Christianese\\" novels. The rawness of the story may turn off some people, but it is not for titillation or perverse enjoyment. It is real life. And completely necessary to present the truth. I've read all of the Church of England books by Ms. Howatch and loved them all, but this one had the biggest emotional effect on me.

Keep in mind that Mr. Gotti never granted anyone an interview or testified on his own behalf,and has never collected one dime off his name while these so called \\"organized crime\\" beat writers make millions off of the gullible public.Do yourselves a favor.

Apparently the women's sizing runs large, but the junior's runs towards the small. So, if you're short like me and on the fence, go for the women's small and take it in. Otherwise I thought it was a good deal. It doesn't look like one of the $80 costumes on here - but it looks far better than any other bargain costume I could find.

This page turner follows Twig in his efforts to save himself, but more importantly, his fine and loyal friends.This novel is far and away the best of the series thus far. In addition to the well told story, we get a closer glimpse into the personalities of the individual characters that we are learning to enjoy. Here's hoping that the rest of the series continues to build with the success we have seen this far!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Get Carried Away With This Book","review":"Sanctaphrax, a city built on a floating rock, is in the path of an incredibly devastating storm. Twig, a young sky pirate, is aware of the approaching danger and is bent on saving the magnificent city. This is the third book in this fantasy series. This is a thrilling adventure that takes you away with it. It is for younger teenagers. Each character has a special vibe and its own personality. Just reading one makes you want to read the whole series. The reader gets drawn into the story and goes along for the ride. The book is well written and the plot is exciting.

We received the product in two days. The instruction is straight forward and easy that my son can do it by himself without my help. We also bought the spot flash light for about $10 from Home Depot to use it as a sunlight for indoor. This worked really well for the fan, but for the light bulb you need to use the sun light as well. Overall, this product is good for young kid science school project.

The paslode was easy to load and setup. I was able to put my mouldings up in no time. It always fired and the 2.5 inch nails I was using went into the studs without a hitch. It was so convenient not having to drag a hose and compressor everywhere especially since I was up on a ladder. I used it all around the house and it never jammed. It's definitely on my xmas list this year and I definitely reccommend it to everyone I know. The only thing I recommend to get in addition is a set of cheap ear plugs if you are using it indoors and doing crown moulding as your ears are fairly close to the tool and its quite loud."},{"rating":"1","title":"Paslode angled cordless finish gun","review":"Gun did not work when first received.

It was great for locating areas in the dark that I would not have found without it. The radio works without any problems. This GPS is my first, and I can't believe how intuitive and responsive it is. Extremely easy to operate, even if you've never used one before. The only drawback is that the GPS comes with a very minimal map the is almost usless... So you have to buy the Garmin Map ranging for $70-120. I thought that with the price, they could have at least put on your local area topos. Thanks to Amazon for being about $100 dollars cheaper, I could afford the 1/24000 maps that I wanted.

It gets bad reception even at a 1/4 mile from a moving vehicle, and unless it has a clear pathway to the 530 it doesnt seem to update.

I purchased 3 of them so that my sons and I could keep track of each other's location, without having to talk and spook game. Well, when they work right, polling the other person is great, but they don't always update, even if you are not very far from each other! Sometimes this can be as close as 100 yards! Also, when someone transmits, sometimes it sounds like the other person is pushing on and off the transmit button. Again, distance doesn't seem to matter so it's not a matter of being out of range. We have also noticed that sometimes the map doesn't show that your location has changed, even though you have moved quite a distance. We found that by turning off the unit, and starting it back up again puts you in your correct location.I checked online at Garmin, and the operating system of the Rinos are up to date.

I believe THE AMERICAN PHARMACEUTICAL ASSOCIATION PRACTICAL GUIDE TO NATURAL MEDICINES is a MUCH BETTER (a FIVE star) resource--especially since it's a 1999 publication that cites sources including German monographs that are basis of PDR. The description of APA Guide, on Amazon.com, does not do this book justice. Once I got PRACTICAL GUIDE TO NATURAL MEDICINES I no longer used PDR."},{"rating":"1","title":"Alfalfa and Buckwheat","review":"I'm glad that someone put together an herbal PDR... I just wish they had done a decent job. This looks like it was written by The Little Rascals (Alfalfa and Buckwheat). First of all, the latin names are wrong throughout the book. No author of the name is ever given, the capitalization does not follow convention, and no effort is made to use the currently official names. This makes it difficult or even impossible to know exactly which species is being discussed, in some cases. And it makes it seem that the people who wrote it don't know what they're talking about. It is also interesting to note that the literature reviews which went into making this were not very comprehensive; the book will often say that no data exists when a simple Medline search will prove otherwise. Perhaps for the next edition, \\"Our Gang\\" should hire a botanist to help them do the latin names properly, and a medical librarian to help with finding and citing literature."},{"rating":"1","title":"I sent mine back!","review":"This \\"PDR\\" may excite a few biochemists and hard-core pharmacists, but it has little real clinical value for practicing physicians other than bibliographies for each item. See Practical Guide to Natural Medicines by the American Pharmaceutial Information. It is about half the price and far more clinically helpful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading Photographs and Typo-laden Bibliographies","review":"As a pharmacist specializing in traditional Japanese medicine, I am greatly disappointed with this title. Apparently, the parts of the plants featured in the photographs are arbitrarily chosen and have little relevance to the medicinal parts actually used (e.g. Asarum LEAVES featured in the photograph). And the bibliographies in some monographs contain typographical errors in the names of researchers and periodicals in Asia, which render the overall value of this title as a reference material highly questionable."},{"rating":"1","title":"They failed to make this a practical guide for the USA.","review":"This book is a major disappointment.It's not that there isn't alot of information presented,but rather that the people at PDR took the simple way out and seem to have just literally translated the German version.The problem with that is seen when one tries to look at dosages and dosage forms.Instead of,for example,getting the most common preparations and practical doses for St.John's Wort or Kava Kava available in this country,you get a description of dosage forms not available in stores here.This is a major shortfall for physicians and patients actually trying to use herbals here.They missed a great oportunity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Repetitious","review":"I found the PDR to be repetitious, but still, it is the most complete and informative reference book I have yet seen. Just hoping to see it in software someday. Definitely a must have for any practitioner or student."},{"rating":"1","title":"Longevity is not its best quality","review":"While the content of the book is great (good reference guide), the materials its made out of are a joke. I buy books for life, this book will last a few years at best. Given its cost, I am considering returning it and finding a digital copy. I love to have quality hard copy books in my personal library, but this is made from some cardboardish material, and the pages are newsprint. The ink smears if your hands arent bone dry. THe pages tear VERY EASILY as you turn pages. The quality of production is very poor, and in no way justifies the price. FAIL."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most Complete I've Seen!","review":"While most of my herbology books give brief blurbs about different pills and teas, this one focuses on the specific names, uses, side effects, and contraindications of herbal medicines. Like the traditional pharmacology PDR, this one has different indices. In this particular PDR, the indices allow the reader to look up specific herbs, specific physiological problems to treat, and specific side effects. Although every herbology book is lacking some information, this one is lacking the least. It is the most comprehensive book on herbal medicines that I've seen to date."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect, but NOT for herbalists","review":"This is a great book, exhaustive and full of information. It can be easily read and understood by medical doctors. The information included are clearly presentred, including reports from trials and preparation methods. It also includes indications according to commision E (which is not FDA or EMEA, but they try to do something equivalent).This book is not intended for herbalists or people who practice herbalism! The language is different. This book is intended for physicians who would like to learn some basic stuff about herbs and maybe try to use them somehow. But remember, this is a reference book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyers beware on this one.","review":"This was published by Medical Economics and no author is listed. If you're a true herbalist, expect this book to be slanted to the drug cartel's viewpoint.Andrew Bentley (Alfalfa and Buckwheat) aptly pointed out that info is left out and it says some data is not available, but it is.Jerry Cott in his review points out their report on St. John's Wort. Do you really think this was not done on purpose? Imagine the dollars lost if people stopped taking the drugs that this herb will sometimes help.Be sure to read what the pharmacist said. I applaud you as your lively hood depends on this type of manipulation of the truth.Buyers beware on this one if you want the truth."},{"rating":"2","title":"PDR Herbal Medicines","review":"Though this book was bought used it was in GREAT condition. It was just what I needed to do my research."},{"rating":"2","title":"Typical . . .","review":"Typical John Sandford, typical Lucas Davenport. Lucas needs to retire; we need a younger, meaner, \\"hungrier\\" hero - - like Lucas use to be. Sandford's early books were raw and grainy - - they made me very nervous and I like being nervous when reading a psychological murder-mystery."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good","review":"This book was pretty good. It was predictable but good. There was plenty of suspense and character building. The book starts out with a bang. Two murders and lots of action. It leaves you wondering why. What did these two people do to deserve such a horrible and graphic death? You will have to read it to find out but I will say that the killer had his reasons for doing it and when you find out why you will wonder why he didn't do much worse. You really get attached to Letty a 12 year old girl. She is a tom-boy who has cared for her mother all these years. She is independent and has a real spitfire attitude. She makes a great character. She is funny and I really enjoyed her. Even though you see a lot of things coming it was a good read and Sandford did a great job on the plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Phoning it in","review":"In his earlier books, Sandford's characters were fascinating, his plots were gripping and his prose was clever and really descriptive. Now the books are very bare-bones. Almost all dialogue. Davenport sleep-walks through the story. The villian is underdeveloped and not interesting. You don't really care what happens, you just put the plot-points together -- click-click-click. Also, there were huge plot holes -- the whole town is involved with one felony or another and, c'mon, after all he's been through, wouldn't Davenport have the slightest inkling that Letty might become a target? Compared to, say, Rules, Eyes, Silent, Certain or Winter ... this book doesn't hold up. Sandford could do much better, but I get the feeling he doesn't really care. And, judging from some of the gushing reviews from his fans, no longer needs to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read but Davenport Seems like a Supporting Actor","review":"I've read all the Prey series and I may be getting a little tired of them as this one had nothing new for me. The story was compelling and moved along nicely but I have always enjoyed the Prey series for the character Lucas Davenport.In this book, it almost seems as if Davenport is just along for the ride. He doesn't seem to affect the goings on - rather, he's just there to wrap things up. I didn't see him do anything to advance the plot or solve the murders..And while I'm at it...POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERT>>>>>>>>Was I the only one who felt that whole hanging thing in the begginning eventually had little to do with anything? All in all, I felt like events hurried along with very little resolution."},{"rating":"2","title":"Naked Prey","review":"I want to read every book that John Sanford writes and he know how to keep you in total suspense."},{"rating":"2","title":"John Sandford book 'Naked Prey\\"","review":"The book arrived in time, and the book itself is in very good condition, but the cover does has some shelf life damage, but, having said that it is still fairly presentable as a gift, which this is, and yes I would use them again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Our hero buys a firearm for a child. Some hero.","review":"My second Prey book and I don't know that I can finish it. While the banter between Lucas and Del is witty and the story moves along at a steady pace, I have a hard time with the kid not really being a kid. And Davenport buying her a firearm? No cop is going to buy a child a deadly weapon.I suspect Letty is going to end up the adopted daughter of Lucas, her gun supplier, and smarter than all the educated adults put together, solving crimes Lucas, the FBI, and CIA combined couldn't solve without the child's help. Someone, please, tell me I'm wrong. Until then, I'm going to put this book down and work backward from there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forgettable Entry in a Great Series","review":"I'm a huge fan of John Sandford's PREY series. The character of Lucas Davenport is a terrific protagonist and normally I thrill to his latest case involving some of the most interesting criminals in current fiction.Normally...Naked Prey however just isn't up to the high standards of other entries in the Prey series. The premise starts out nicely but then tends to meander. The antagonist(s) aren't as memorable as previous villains in the series. And, it seemed like it took Lucas far too long to get from Point A to Point Z...far too long. Naked Prey feels like a 200 page story that has been stretched needlessly into a 390 page book.Here's hoping Sandford and Davenport get back on track with the next entries in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the Prey books!","review":"I am always excited to see another Prey novel!

I cannot see where the series is doing anything other than getting better as it goes. Very interesting to me to see Davenport move smoothly from a young guy to a 'middle aged' guy.Great, great series, for me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Small town humor","review":"Sandford writes an intriguing mystery with fascinating characters. His portrayal of a thirteen year old girl caught between childhood and adulthood was wonderful. The young girl's imagination and naiveté helps the prime detective, Lucas, solve the crimes.Sandford does a remarkable job of bringing the characters to life. He shows us that not even small remote towns are immune from the atrocities that man does against his fellow human beings. The only difference is that in a small town everyone's life is touched. Good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to get through- didn't flow","review":"didn't live up to the last books he's written. Fell asleep most of the time.

I like the writing style and the story was fair, but I will agree with other reviews, all the crime going on in this small town lost some credibility and was hard to believe, but I know its a fictional story. The part that I could not stand is the constant barrade of blasphemy's with GD and JC. I mean come on, cant you use another form of \\"filler\\"? I would of rather heard sh%% or something. It was overkill and completely ridiculous. I wished I would of counted, it had to be 100+. In addition Mr. Sandford must quit promoting his liberal agenda in his books regarding, the republican party and he must deal with his religious issues in a more constructive way! Disappointed...."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big disappointment","review":"Sandford mailed in this lackluster story. He stumbles and bumbles in the backwoods country, not even giving a thought to what may happen in response to his actions. Normally a master of the cunning psycho villain, Sandford's villain is too far from the action to be effective. Finally, the ending: pathetic melodrama. A waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Naked Prey","review":"John Sandford and Lucas ride again.The horrific murder of a mixed race couple at the beginning of the book starts your mind going in one direction, the towns reaction get you going in another. Each chapter creates more and more chaos.

A good beach read and the author never seems to disappoint. Isn't it time for a new Kidd?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Prey yet","review":"Lucas Davenport has a new job, and his first case is a wild one. Letty, the 12 year old muskrat trapper is one of the most enigmatic and likable kid characters I have come across in thriller fiction in a long time, and Sanford knows how to tell a yarn without too much digresion. The changing back and forth of POV (points of view)gives the plot just the right balance without giving away too much, too soon. Without giving the ending away, I suspect Letty will be back and that can only be a giant plus for more Davenport Prey books, and those of us who thrive on series characters and writers of Sanford's standards."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for Davenport addicts","review":"Lucas, Del and team using their talents in the usual way(known to fans of course). Don't put the book down until you got his next unread novel at hand!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Minnesota Cold Excitement","review":"I have now read all of his books and could read them again. This was not the usual theme but was enjoyable, a old crone, a idiot deputy, some Nuns and then throw in the ringer, a baby muskratter. The last 50 pages are always exciting as he molds everything together and brings it to a rousing conclusion. There are only a few writers I equally enjoy, I surely will await his next novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Like others have mentioned, Lucas Davenport's character is becoming lackluster and is only mildly interesting in this story. His character has been known for his feistyness and bravado but that isn't apparent in this latest incarnation of Lucas. He actually takes a back-seat to his co-hort Del Capslock. I also found the story difficult to follow, too many threads trying to hang together and too many characters. Sanford's writing is also going downhill....I mean those run-on sentences have got to stop! I have read every Prey book to date and have not been impressed with the last couple. I am hoping that Sanford either finds a better editor or spends a little more time using his grammar check. Otherwise he is going to lose this long-time fan of his."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's Lucas","review":"As another reviewer wrote, the first prey were very good, the last lacking, the only one that was worst is the one before this one. Lucas spends 50% of the book riding back and forth up an icy road at 80 miles in his Acura. Since you know fairly early who the main culprit is , you only have to add up the body count and see when he going to figure out who is the main killer. I won't give away ending but an average detective should have known way before Lucas finally figure it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Naked meets Winter as a favorite \\"Prey\\".","review":"There's something about small towns in the dead of winter that make for excellent Prey novels. Part of that goes out to the way that the author captures the charms and dreadfulness of life in rural America. Letty West is a treat. Unlike most smart tween characters in books of this ilk, she's not the kind of smug that gets under your skin. Her ability to roll with the big boys and still be a kid makes her a great character. Lucas and Del were at their best. While the mystery wasn't the best I've read in the series, the complete cast of characters and how they handled it made the book stand out from others with more complex plots.It was also nice to see that the phrase \\"pulling my weenie\\" was not used by a single character in this book. Up to the this point in the series, someone had to say that line at least once. Unfortunately, it comes back to rear its ugly head in future installments."},{"rating":"1","title":"WE ALL HAVE OUR BAD DAYS, I GUESS...","review":"This album was actually recorded prior to 1980, between the release of their albums LIVE & SLEAZY and CAN'T STOP THE MUSIC. But it wasn't released until 1983, two years after the album RENAISSANCE which was their failed attempt at cashing in on the New Wave music fad. It's a sad sad attempt at funk. The VP are uncomfortable singing this garbage and it come through in the vocals. The whole thing is boring and lifeless. In fact, it's so bad that it was only released overseas on smaller labels, no US label would even touch it. The main single was \\"Fox On The Box\\", a wannabe straight-song about a female radio DJ. It was a minor hit in Spain, but that's about it.Save your money and stay away from this one. Thankfully, the VP redeemed themselves a hundredfold a couple of years later when they released the fantastic 1985 album SEX OVER THE PHONE.

I won't give another plot overview; Dawn has already given a great one.This story is the perfect translation of a ballet into a novel. It has multiple layers and tissues. The reader is shown from afar the glittering beauty of the lives of ballerinas and their passion for their art, then is taken in closer to show the reality, the pain and the dirty secrets of those lives backstage. But it's not all drama and angst. As with all great passions, there are the breathtaking highs as well as the crushing lows.Besides getting a stunning story, the reader is also treated to the world of ballet from the inside which, as someone who will never dance, I found fascinating. I cannot recommend this book highly enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only fit for Hustler magazine","review":"What a disappointment. Nothing but cursing, unlikable, manic-depressive characters, the crudest possible language and ugly sex scenes...if it weren't for the few segments on Balanchine this book would have gone into the trash much sooner - but the 'author' has taken quite a bit of literary license with him beyond what she admits to (for example, Suzanne Farrell never visited Balanchine in the hospital when he was dying)...anyway, if you are looking for a story about love and the ballet, I recommend passing this horrid thing up and not wasting your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a love story, but a LUST story","review":"This book was my book club's book this month. We were all disappointed with the shallow, psychotic characters and the depressing story line. The title and cover make one expect a love story, when really it follows more along the lines of a sick and twisted tragedy. Foreshadowing was too obvious, and love did not seem to be a priority (promiscuity, death, and drug use seemed to be the main topics here). Stay away if you are expecting a love story, or even a very interesting book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"I had high hopes for this novel, but was very disappointed by the ending that did not tie up any loose ends. If you are like me and like a book to have a conclusion then don't read this. The author seems to be confused on who is the main character, making the reader believe that Adam and Sandra are, while it ends with George Balanchine's thoughts, and leaves the lovers at odds. It had potential to be a good book but Sharp screws it up by the vague and meaningless ending. It was vulgar at times, and not the romantic love story the jacket cover makes you believe. Don't waste your time with this one, it is not at all satisfying, only infuriating."},{"rating":"1","title":"hackwork","review":"There are other sources of information about Lou Harrison, such as \\"The Music of Lou Harrsion\\" by Heidi Von Gunden and \\"The Lou Harrison Reader\\".

In short, I don't think we ought to put up with this piece of clumsy mannered hackwork. (By the way, the chapter on Lou Harrison's sexuality is ridiculous and unnecessary: Take him at his word.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"An eclectic look at an eclectic composer","review":"Miller and Lieberman's biography of Lou Harrison has become the definitive work on this California composer. Rather than simply writing a chronology of his life, the book provides a brief biography and then tackles different aspects of his work in a series of brief chapters. These include tuning systems, calligraphy, instrument building, political activism, dance, gay rights, and many more.The result is an eclectic and somewhat experimental book, fitting for the composer. Occasionally some of the chapters fall short of being comprehensive, particularly the one dealing with Harrison's sexuality. But in general this book is a refreshing read, with much new information and analysis.A CD with several unreleased recordings and demonstrations is included."},{"rating":"1","title":"much ado about very little","review":"This is a fairly drab and banal account of a marginal self-consciously eccentric American composer. In the chapter devoted to tuning I should have thought the authors would have either critiqued or defended their various extravagant claims, which to a reasonable person who knows something about this will seem so much numerological fetishism. They did neither."},{"rating":"1","title":"Publish or Perish? The Latter, Please.","review":"Heartening to see how the authors's cronies have rallied to the defense of this tiresome and mindless random heaping up of information. Nevertheless:If it were truly a \\"scholarly\\" work, I think the author's would have something reasonably intelligent to say about Harrison's acoustical \\"theories\\", which were, in fact, to cut to the chase, wack.If more of the information heaped up were firsthand, this might at least be of some service to real Harrison scholars (if Harrison scholars we must endure). Instead we have, for example, a passage about Harrison's long-term stay at a mental institution lifted directly from John Cage's \\"Silence\\". Better to skip this and read the Cage."},{"rating":"2","title":"I would give this 6 stars if I could","review":"It's a combination of two albums - India 2000, and another, whose name I forget.

Subramaniam would sound a lot like that traditional-sounding East Indian music. I was surprised to find out that L. Subramaniam (at least as represented by this CD) is more of a fusion/jazz artist. Many of the musicians he appears with here, are in fact jazz oriented (Maynard Fergerson & Hubert Laws). Although I always liked jazz, I never got into the more \\"electric\\", \\"fusion\\" or \\"new age\\" type sounding jazz. This CD is all of those things plus some of that traditional East Indian feel. It is also quite \\"funkified\\". Given an even chance, this CD is quite nice, and Dr. Subramaniam is quite a remarkable musician. Parts of this CD are quite soothing and other parts quite dazzling.In terms of genre, it is hard to pin down though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magical!!","review":"Dr. Subramaniam simply surpasses himself in these compositions.

It is a hard aged cheese, in my opinion more like Regiano Parmesan than anything made in North America. It has sort of crystalline fracture lines in it, and is quite tangy, which makes it offset fruit nicely, but as it is hard as well as tangy, it does beautifully in place of more ordinary grating cheeses such as Romano or Parmesan. Some very old cheddars are a little bit like that, but North American cheddars are never this hard and grainy. It has bursting hard crystals of lactic acid and milk sugars."},{"rating":"1","title":"packaging bad.","review":"Spoilable cheese was shipped with 1 sandwich size icepack.

Of course Readers who have a pre disposition against the Catholic Church will make an effort to twist the Truth contained within the book.

It is very well organized as a reference book, but it's not very exciting to read straight through. I'm a bit disappointed that it doesn't contain more delight in the beauty of our faith, awe at the depths of God's revelation of Himself, or simply more practical examples for day-to-day living.Just as you wouldn't read the encyclopedia from cover-to-cover, neither will you read this book straight through.

I was able to understand the relation between all of the characters, considering the amount there were. I could also relate to the warm, loving family that took care of Tom.This book is realistic, as well. Often Newfoundlands are found in oceans and seas. As a major Newfoundland dog breed fan, I was able to enjoy this book. If you read the ending, this is based on a true story. This author didn't use make-believe places.

The explanations of grammatical patterns seemed haphazard, at best, and were difficult to follow. Many chapters started with paragraphs of arabic sentences, with English translations, with explanations of the grammar used following. Important information often comes pages after the arabic examples it explains (for example, the fact that singular indefinite nouns are always prounced with 'un' at the end, three pages after seeing the words and the incorrect transliterations). The romanization used was inconsistent across the book.I am not stranger to foreign languages, with my studies spanning the globe from standard Romance languages (French and Spanish) to Japanese.

I will not go into it but I was truly disappointed by the ending. When I had about 30 pages left I knew already it wasn't going to end worth a damn and I was right. Maybe some are fans of leaving plots unfinished and people left in limbo but I am not one of them. It was like \\"well i don't know how to finish this with a great ending so I will just have the pig fall over\\".And yes I figured out who the shadows were I always did from the plot in the second book.I enjoyed the story up until the end although they were seriously dry and disjointed in several areas. Read three books to have a final that was in an epilogue because the writer couldn't be bothered to write an ending for numerous interesting characters and plots. I don't think so I will not be reading anymore of this nonsense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good start but trouble later","review":"The first half is great continuation of the previous book. Unfortunately at about half way it gets bogged down in personal reflections, illogical character shifts (or maybe legitimate senility?) and masses of repetition. The latter lost the book a star for me, repeating the same explanation of events 3-4 times (often for the benefit of characters in the book - couldn't they have just read the earlier chapters?) is boring and frustrating.No problem with the main story though.

Adults with more than 50 page memories even."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible disappointment if you like the preceding books","review":"This was a terrible step for such a great series. I so thoroughly enjoyed Revelation Space, Chasm City, and Redemption Ark, I was really expecting something great with Absolution Gap. I was disappointed.The new characters were poorly developed.

I cannot understand what the seemingly widespread problem is with some readers and the end of this book. IMHO, Reynolds very much described the who, where and why of the inhibitors throughout the entire series, and if you were awake for the end of the last book,'absolution gap', between the shadows, the scuttlers, the inhibitors and the nestbuilders, one would imagine the relationships of the galactic raceswould be very clear by then.

I had a hard time getting past the story line of moving cathedrals...the moving, I understand (as much as I can understand most religious mumbo-jumbo reasons for doing anything), but how did a poor planet make these things? Of course, I couldn't get past this question for Tatooine either, but Star Wars (the movie) was less than two hours and was a fantasy, not sci-fi. This was not worth my time--or yours."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a crapout ending....","review":"Geesh... why is it that every epic series I read just ends wrapped up incompletely, suddenly, and tritely like they just ran out of time, money, patience or interest????Incredible series up to the last 100 pages..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really?!?","review":"What a terribly disappointing conclusion to such a wonderful series. That's really all I can say. I felt like Mr. Reynolds had just played a prank on me: \\"Ha, ha. Made you read\\". I mean, Peter Hamilton writes better endings! I only give two stars out of respect for the previous books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Imaginative - but boring. Not \\"space opera\\"","review":"Ok, so it's the third in the RS line. I was hooked with RS, disappointed with Ark, and bored to death with this one. Reynolds has turned Reefer sleeping into a literary device to skip all the stuff he doesn't have time/ doesn't want to write about. And honestly, that \\"stuff\\" is apparently space travel. So it's ironic to me that an author known for writing about space suddenly has an aversion to it. It occurred to me while reading this that it would make a terrific movie, unlike most scifi I've read that are just too vast to contain on a screen. I don't know if that's an insult or a compliment - maybe both. I'd only suggest reading this one if you just haaaave to know what happens next and have too much time on your hands."},{"rating":"1","title":"Believe the bad reviews!","review":"After the first two books, I figured that the bad reviews here couldn't possibly be true.

Oy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Badly needed an editor","review":"This book made me wish I hadn't started the series. Reynolds put about 350 pages of story and ideas into 700+ pages, and then leaves you with a very rushed ending that has characters act out of character, one character come to an end I still don't really understand (it took a couple sentences), and too much deux es machina. Either the editor did not do his job here to guide Reynolds, or he ignored that editor."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Cosmic letdown...","review":"I seriously was mad at Reynolds.I had spent a lot of time reading the books (the 4 in the series). I invested a lot of thought to follow the plot line and sub-plots. I found his writing captivating.Then I get to the end of Absolution Gap...After 750+ pages of story, the summation of the 4-part series, the conclusion is only given a paragraph, or maybe just a sentence or two of attention (throughout the entire book). Something so undeveloped, it felt as though Alastair ran out of ideas and was like, \\"The detective knew he was going to be killed by the killer in the next room, but somehow, suddenly, someone scared the killer away. The End.\\"I was ticked, to say the least.This series is, perhaps, worth the reading just for the sub-plots and style, but in the end, it's a huge disappointment. I'd welcome any comments to convince me why I should read any of Alastair's other books. I want to believe they'll be better..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save yourself","review":"I got hooked into reading this series till the end. The first book was pretty good, leaving you with a taste for more, curious about how all the loose ends would be tied together. However, after getting through the 1500+ pages of the second and third books, I can say that author had no idea where he was going with the story. It is a laborious read, carried by many irrelevant characters that the author throws your way to make an uninteresting story drag on endlessly with no rhyme or reason. Almost all threads started and never developed to satisfaction. The actual conclusion of this ultimate book is just plain random and unrelated to anything. As a recommendation I would suggest reading the first book and then the epilogue of the third book (which is the actual lame ending), realizing that the content of the epilogue actually has only a vague tangential relationship to the content of the third and second books.. so you really havn't missed anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"On the opposite quality spectrum than the other parts of the serie.The way author solves the few crisis threads just revolted me.

The choice was clear. I bought this and don't regret it. The neck muscles began to loosen up after one use and is fine now. It did take a couple of weeks of use for all the pain to go away, but the reality is, I would have to have gone back to a massage therapist at least two times to fix this problem.This unit is powerful! and I like the curved head on it so I can use it on my shoulders, neck and previously unreachable places on my back.I didn't give it 5 stars because this unit sometimes sounds like it has a bearing problem, probably associated with the flexible head."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good massage machine","review":"This is one of the best Massage machines out there.I use it all the time.

People who are older will appreciate its light weight and non-abusive power. However, I personally like a lot of power to work on my sore muscles and this product doesn't cut it for me.

Guys, if you want a plug-in massager that will please your wife or girl friend, the Hitachi Magic Wand is what you need. However -- gals, if you want a plug-in massager that will please your husband or boy friend -- the Panasonic EV2510K is the one! Why? Because the Panasonic is more powerful than the Hitachi, and its hard plastic roller head is better suited to a man's, um, contours. In addition, the Panasonic is quiet and causes no video interference, a selling point in case you augment your \\"massage\\" sessions with some video stimulation... The only reason I don't give the Panasonic five stars is that previous \\"Panabrators\\" have proven less than reliable; typically they seem to last about a year before they conk out.

I use these in the bedroom as a left and right channel, although I feel that they would also do just fine in my main entertainment room. They stay clear at very loud volumes, and I've been tempted to use these to replace my entertainment room speakers.I'm not crazy about the way these handle the lows though. It's not an issue for me as I added an old Onkyo sub for that, and I'm completely satisfied with the sound this way. The sound is awesome.I'm not sure that I'd use these as a center channel though(like they do their 5.1 theater set up), as I'd probably look for a center speaker with more direct beam of sound.

You need one tablet to do the cleaning. So, with that info at hand, you can do the arithmetic to estimate how long this pack of six will last you. I usually tack this order onto a book order that comes under the $25 super-saver free shipping limit.There are other Jura cleaning tablets, so make sure you are ordering the right one.

It always felt and looked unfinished to me. The ALX on the other hand has smooth, comfortable aluminum scales that looks killer, like a premium quality knife. If scissors are a must then go for the Charge TTi. Personally I rarely use the scissors so the dual bit driver on the ALX is the perfect configuration for me. Its nice to always have a philips and flat head driver/allen key on you (since some jobs require both). Combined with the Leatherman bit kit the ALX is the most capable multitool Ive come across and can tackle most medium duty tasks."},{"rating":"2","title":"gr8 knife","review":"amazing tool use it every day at work very quick delivery and amazing video will play till its over,just what i needed for play time and that's that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this thing","review":"When you can carry SO MANY DEVICES on your belt it's a great idea...

This includes an field where you need to be creativity such as a parent, a manager, a lawyer, a writer, a student, the list goes on. Every field needs people who think. This book will help you get started.+++Gil Michelini, author\\"Daddy, Come & Get Me: a dad's adventure through a Guatemalan adoption\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Good idea","review":"The whole subject of this book is something I've never even thought of.

In an entertaining and easy-to-follow style, Jack Foster explains the common causes that prevent certain people from coming up with ideas of their own (wrong mindset, self-doubt, ineffective thinking skills, lack of knowledge on the subject, etc.) and proposes some well-tested techniques to circumvent or overcome the problems. In each chapter, tons of real-life examples and quotations are given to substantiate that similar views or approaches had been shared by many accomplished creative icons such as Edison and Newton.This book is highly recommended to anyone who wishes to hone his creative skills. Even though you may not become the next Thomas Edison or Agatha Christie, I'm sure you will at least get something useful out of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth it!!","review":"Easy to read with straightforward and imaginative ideas, this book is well worth the effort, especially if you are trying to teach anyone about ideas.

I thought it looked cheap and something about it made me think the book was mediocre.Never judge a book by its cover, a wise person once said.This book is a treasure, whether you're on the hunt for ideas or not. It will make you see the things around you in a different perspective, it will alter the way you've conceived and thought about achieving something. Some would say it's basically common sense; granted, it doesn't offer anything magical, but when followed through it can really make you THINK.Absolutely superb, get it for yourself, get it for your friends, get it for your nasty mother-in-law.

I'm still missing a couple of bolts and the assembly manual but I'm tired of fooling with them - won't do it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too melodramatic, Voice over powered by instrumentation","review":"I found Back Tuva Future to be melodramatic and awkward. I love the Tuvan Throat singers, including the experimental melding of their music with other cultural flavors, but was disappointed by this CD. The obvious rhythmic relation to country western music was handled with a heavy and somewhat corny hand. Ondar and his extraordinary talents were also often obscured by what sounded like movie track music. I can only assume that he has either fallen in with producers who have no empathy for the possibilities of Tuvan throat singing or he himself cannot differentiate between good innovative western music and bad.I\\u0012m afraid there is no comparison to the musical quality of the Tuvan Singers, Huun Huur Tu, both in the direct traditional songs as well as the experimental mixes of ethnic rhythms and melodies. Perhaps Ondar\\u0012s next attempt will offer either a clearer vision or a less intrusive instrumentation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Music!","review":"This CD is quite worth it. Even if it dosn't seem like something you might like, you will probobly grow to love it. The upbeat songs make you want to get up and dance. Ondar really has a lot of talent and can make wonderful music. The drumming by Richard Feynman is exellent too."},{"rating":"1","title":"no, no, please noooo!","review":"I can not believe the reviews on this item. There must be a lot of people who like country and western music. I really love Tuvan throat singing but i don't like country and western. This compilation was like a horrible nightmare and the destruction of all that is good about Tuva. They even have dance tunes which are so out of date they should have stuck to traditional music after all. The thought that people will buy this and think they have heard Tuvan throat singing makes me want to cry. Although it did put a smile on my face as i laughed in disbelief. I only hope that it does lead it's listeners to buying the real thing.A good introduction would be 'Shu-De Voices from a distant past' or 'Tuva: Voices from the centre of Asia' but not this - please anything but listen to this cd again!!!!

Although I appreciate the attempt by the producer to mix in an assortment of sounds and other non-Tuvian music, Ondar has such an incredible voice that any attempt to 'add' to his own music can't do anything but diminish the overall effect. It gets a 4 star from me because Ondar shredds, but I rarely listen to it because of all the other annoying crap on the CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Delightful Change of Pace","review":"It's a great cd for people who are looking for something out of the mainstream but not too odd. The beats are enhanced by Ondar's beautiful chanting.

His talent captivated me and I was convinced that I had to find the CD. It took me over four months, since no stores had it in stock. However, once I got it, it was amazing. Blending in the Western sounds with traditional Tuvanian music creates great listnening.

If you started out with Volume 2, it's predecessor might be disappointing at first.

Outstandingly researched, it is the unsurpassable MFU guide book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Man from U.N.C.L.E.","review":"It was a delightful surprise to see a book devoted to my favorite '60s television show. Well researched and well written, it was a pleasure to read. The numerous photos added greatly to the memories the information was evoking. I was especially impressed to see the introduction written by Mr. Vaughn. His willingness to be associated with this work speaks well for the credibility of the author. Many thanks for reintroducing me to a show I enjoyed then, and now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ignore those negative reviews","review":"Boy, am I glad I ignored those negative reviews.

The Other Side of Time is worth the wait. I enjoy the various genres. The CD doesn't seem discordant, rather it feels like a luxurious quilt sewn with silks and velvets. My only complaint is that Mary's tour dates primarily seem to include the northeast. I am in Orlando and would travel anywhere in Florida to see her live! Bravo, Mary. You have managed to take the soul of what your fans loved about October Project and created a beautiful, personal body of work."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Other Side of Time","review":"I purchased this CD as I was drawn to this woman's \\"Going Home\\". I think this track is wonderful. However, I found much of her other singing almost painfuly dismal.

Don't get me wrong, I LOVED Mary Fahl in her October Project incarnation. But, where should I start with this new material? Trite......calculated.....so overproduced that I am afraid the focus groups are still on-going in some mall in Wisconsin. If you are October Project fan, steer clear of this.Goes to show you what happens when great singers lose access to the writers of their best material."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Huge Mistake--You are WARNED","review":"Allow me to dissent. This one deserves ZERO stars, not even one. I was eagerly awaiting this CD, and was shocked by it--and not in a good way. To call it a misguided misfire is anything but an overstatement. I found these songs to be fake, calculated, overproduced, and in some cases, plain laughable. I *really* wanted to like this CD, but it's just an embarrassment for Mary, and it left me feeling badly for her. It just goes to prove that October Project's success was truly the result of a collective effort, not just one very talented singer."},{"rating":"1","title":"WOW What overproduced, overhyped junk!","review":"I bought this album on the recommendations of folks who like Cindy Alexander (one of my faves) and Aimee Mann, so I had high hopes, but man...it's AWFUL. It's dripping, smeary, OOZING with enough smarmy schmaltz to embarrass Celine Dion, and while Fahl has a lovely voice, she wastes it on this stuff. It seems she can't decide whether she wants to do serious \\"high\\" art or pop-schlock, so she tries to combine both...to horrid effect. Suitable as the background music for a \\"Lifetime\\" movie, or for a tampon commercial, perhaps, but not to actually \\"listen\\" to. Awful."},{"rating":"2","title":"wow! we've waited too long for this!","review":"After way too many years of waiting, it is here! And YES! It was worth the wait! I can't add anything that the others haven't said already, except that I will be anxiously awaiting the next one, and the next... and the next!!!!Keep it coming, Mary--we love you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Genuine artistry","review":"Having stumbled upon this cd much by accident, one can only wish that all such accidents in life would come to such fruition. Upon purchasing this cd, I immediately sought out a ticket to watch the lovely Mary Fahl perform in concert... for it is certainly a majestic and luscious vocal performance on the album. Could that luminescent and radiant voice transcend through a live performance? Without equivocation, the answer is a resonating 'yes.' Such a lovely performer, in every sense of the word... and such an effervescent personality to match. I consider it to be an honor and a privelege to have been given the opportunity to listen to such a wonderful album and such a remarkable concert. If you get the change to listen to this incredibly performer (either live or through your stereo system) you must treat yourself to the ethereal sounds of Ms. Mary Fahl. Congratulations on a wonderful album, Ms. Fahl and we all await with anticipation for future works from you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Excellent Excellent","review":"I am so happy Mary Fahl has a new CD out. I have been a big fan of the October Project since they began and her voice is what made that group so great. This CD reminds me alot of October Project's first 2 CDs. This is definately a must have for anyone who likes to hear something a little different with a big sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"A VOICE A VOICE !","review":"I was a fan of the short lived OCTOBER PROJECT. Mary's voice was haunting then and if it can be richer, now. A bit unusual for pop, I guess she is pop, folk, whatever.The album has a few weak songs but her voice makes even bad songs sound good. Put the CD in, press play, enjoy Mary Fahl.Why isn't she better known??"},{"rating":"2","title":"Moving Music","review":"The performer has a deeper than usual voice for this genre, but it is a pleasant change from the ordinary. The second band, \\"The Road That Will Lead Me Home\\" was used in the film, Gods and Generals during the funeral procession of General Thomas \\"Stonewall\\" Jackson and so, of course, it brings back images from that great film.This is an excellent addition to the collection of people who appreciate actual music instead of noise and lyrics that can be repeated in good company."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the background of our lives.....","review":"This is a lovely cd. Her voice is beautiful and chilling at the same time. The instrumental is superb. This is a quiet sort of relaxing cd; something that plays nicely in an Artist's gallery or a bookshop.

It is calming, soothing...and don't we all need that from time to time?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective Item!","review":"Poorly made product. Arrived with pieces fallen off and missing.

After boiling them for several minutes, the corn starts to sink but also starts to break apart when they are thoroughly soaked. With this little gadget, we can put 3 tablespoon inside the little cage and they stay under. You also have no need to grab a strainer as everything stay snugly inside except for the very minute morsels.This infuser is made of stainless steel. A hook is attached to the end of the chain so you can hang it at the side of the pot. Chain is long enough to accommodate taller pots.

My only regret is that I began to browse it over the weekend and then literally gobbled it down. I wish I had waited for a lazy summer day so I could have relished it slowly. I opened this book, which was a gift, skeptically as the subject matter is not my usual cup of tea. Then I couldn't put it down! Abramowitz must have conducted her interviews with exceptionally sensitivity to be able to give her stories such detailed drama and emotion. This is not gossip and this is not just for women. This is a must for anyone who wants to be a player in a very cutthroat world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sharp observations with the insider sizzle of gossip","review":"I bought this book because I heard a humor piece Rachel Abramowitz did on public radio, and loved it. I was not disappointed. Reading this book was like sitting down with a witty and observant friend in the movie business for a lovely long dish session. It showed me how far women have come behind the camera (and how far we still have to go), and gave me a real appreciation for the women who have made their mark on the film industry, and for what it cost them. This book is well worth purchasing, because you'll want to refer to things you remember in it, and anecdotes about movies you've seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"What????","review":"I do not own this box set, but I remember most of these songs. This cd set seems to be ok, and may satisfy some. But how can you title a Metal Cd Set as \\"Youth Gone Wild\\", and not include Skid Row's song \\"Youth Gone Wild\\" on it? The song \\"Youth Gone Wild\\" is one of the best rock anthems from the 80's ever written.This is like another Cd compilation I've seen before. It was a compilation of power ballads from the 80's like \\"Every Rose has its Thorn\\" as so forth. It was titled \\"Love Bites\\", yet it didn't include the #1 hit power ballad by Def Leppard entitled \\"Love Bites\\".

I do like the ability to record songs, but most of the songs are cut off in the beginning or the end or both. It reminds me as a kid trying to tape record songs from the radio.I do have the optional car kit which has a weak FM modulator. It is easily over rode by surroundin broadcasts.

I like it but would switch to a different model if it could fix the concerns listed above"},{"rating":"1","title":"not so great","review":"I purchased this to replace my roady XT because of it's smaller size and easier portability. I wanted to use it while walking or doing yard work. The reception is poor at best. I've even tried placing it in a holder on the dash in the car but anytime you go under a powerline or by trees, you lose reception. It has to be hooked to the wired antenna or you will be disappointed with the reception. Also, the remote that came with the unit doesn't work. I have contacted the seller and Pioneer. The seller tells me that it is up to Pioneer for warranty work and Pioneer tells me that the seller is not one of their authorized dealers so they will not replace it. Very frustrating. Also, everytime I have tried to contact Pioneer, I have had a 15 - 20 minute wait to speak with anyone. I will definately not purchase any Pioneer products in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not all it's cracked up to be","review":"I purchased this with the intention to be able to record shows, music, etc. and the reception was aweful. The only way this would work is if you live in a very rural area. Seeing as I live in the city I had hoped this would work out, but it never did. I'd have two bars of service and it would cut out, even while I was on the train platform. This needs to be a device that can really be used \\"anywhere.\\" I sent it back and canceled my XM service after a week. Nice try Pioneer, but you just didn't give it the power to perform the way you say it should."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor reception","review":"This satellite radio is a disappointment. It gets no reception indoors. I have to go outside to listen (often in the rain). Pioneer recommended I buy an earphone antenna which I did. Now reception is slightly better.

The INNO does things my XMP3I cannot do. An example would be the ability to record a block of programming and if you want to keep 1 song in the memory, you can single it out and save it. You can also go back and forth between recorded programming and live radio with the touch of a button. The Inno has the ability to work in the home kit with no power from an outlet which means you can use the antenna without the need of an external power source just the battery. The only thing that my unit does that can be bad is sometimes when I turn it off and resume later the recording is at a different point from when I turned it off. This could just be my unit or from age. My INNO also has good reception. Overall my INNO is a good piece of equipment. I would recommend getting it with the holster with the belt clip just like an old Walkman. The Inno also has good sound. No compressed sound like the Sirius Stiletto. I would recommend the Inno to a friend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective merchant, not product","review":"The main radio that was sent appears to be a REFURBISHED item, not a new radio. It's got scuffs all over it, glue patches where original manufacturer stickers had once been, the battery cover is loose, etc. etc.It further appears that the seller tried to pass this off as a \\"bulk package\\" item (no box, etc.), claiming that this is what was ordered, when the listing doesn't mention anything about bulk items, and even carries a customer photo of the packaged box.

In all honesty, my very good friend- a freshman in high school- writes better music.

Spaeth needs to push the boundaries and develop his creativity a little more before he produces a cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"The music is just too simple","review":"This cd has very little significant meaning,music wise. The melodies are very simple and plain. Don't get me wrong simple melodies can be just as beautiful as complex ones. But this recording was just too simple.

Believe and trust me when I say this is an incredibly mature work of art (both compositionally and emotionally).Oh, and you must get the collector's edition CD - it's autographed by Spaeth himself and absolutely worth it (only a penny more!! :) ).

The concept was the same and I had high hopes, but this game just didn't work for us. Depending on the cards showing in the middle, you are supposed to made certain sounds ... with everyone going at once and the sounds able to be in any order, it was simply impossible to tell who had completed the task correctly/first. Even when we had one person not participate, but just be a judge, it didn't work. The kids were very unimpressed ... and I'll be racking my brain to try and remember the rules to SPAZ, which used hand movements in a particular order and therefore wasn't subject to the same problems ... and doesn't require the purchase of new cards. Thumbs down for this game."},{"rating":"2","title":"uber interactive","review":"This product is very interactive. The four panels on the mat not only match the stepping locations on the screen, but also serve as the function keys to add your age, weight, workout type, etc. Jackie Chan is your instructor but gives no verbal cues, unlike an aerobic class. To keep your rhythm, these dots slide/ drop down the screen and when you step on the correct segment of the mat the dots bounce and/or change color. So, once you get the rhythm, you have a steady dot bounce.

Many mountaineering videos don't adequately capture the trials necessary to climb big mountains like Cho Oyu. This one gives an accurate account of the challenges and difficulties they faced. Although the title suggests that this is an \\"easy\\" mountain, their experiences were much different, with only a small fraction of their team actually making it to the summit. As a documentary, it showed what a humbling experience it truly was.The DVD was well very professionally done, which is something I don't always expect in mountaineering films. It was well narrated, and seemed like a show I would expect to see on TV sports documentaries.I thought the DVD was worth the money, but I may also be biased as I summited Cho Oyu at the same time as this documentary was produced and got to meet the people involved."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just O.K.","review":"It seemed like a cute idea and my girls thought it was fun for an hour or so but its kinda small and I think I would just get a regular bigger potato head next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work","review":"Tried a few times but people complained about static.

It's a simple story about three young hippos who have to go on an adventure to see what is at the top of tall cliff. Never mind the fact that the adults know more which they learn going through the scary jungle. In the end all works out.The story is simple and to some adults they may think it makes no sense. My girl likes it so for me that is all that matters.The art work is really good and I think that is what interests her. The little hippos are cute after all. She also found it funny that Mrs. Hippo knew carpentry.There is a crocodile but nothing scary. In fact children may find it funny when Mrs. Hippo scares it and runs it off."},{"rating":"2","title":"One to love","review":"What is it that makes this book irresistible? Maybe the lovely illustrations, which are so warm and inviting that the jungle rolls into your living room. Maybe the funny plot, which centers on three little hippos who long for an adventure but aren't quite ready for what comes along with it. But mostly, I think, the child-like heart of the story. These little hippos have big dreams--they want to jump off Tall Cliff--but are cheerfully oblivious to their own limitations. They can't remember what to be scared of in the jungle, they can't remember what to look out for on the way home, and even though they decide that Tall Cliff is really too tall to jump from, they are just as thrilled and proud to jump from a lower ledge. Perhaps most importantly, the lessons they learn go down easy and never seem to spoil their fun.

WHat's great about it is the objective tone, the sheer *readability* of it, and the insight. These guys, as editors of Gnosis magazine, apparently had access to all kinds of people and sources and they used them intelligently. This is the first 'survey' of the esoteric I've seen that made me feel like here's someone who really understands their subjects deeply. Sufism, mysticism, the occult, gnosticism, Gurdjieff--it's all there. And it's so well written, so not-boring.

This is a book which is believed by many to be a work of historical accuracy. This book is not, however, historical by any means. Golden has written a book which is pure propaganda and which attempts to appeal to the emotions of its readers. Golden pretends that she herself is a martyr and writes the poems from many different perspectives.

The hero extricates himself from laughably dire situations, not by his own wits, but by the petty stupidity of his adversaries. This does not make for a satisfying read.The pacing is obviously abetted by a good editor, as is the dialog, but, like a remake of \\"The Bad News Bears,\\" even Scorcese could only do so much with bad raw materials.I tend to alternate between non-fiction reading of some weight and light fiction in the thriller genre.

As one person stated before, yes, it is gritty and no, it will not dissolve completely. I am unable to just mix this drink with water and enjoy it-- it's not good that way. I instead have learned to throw it in a blender with a little stevia, maybe a banana/any fruit, and ice. When you get it to that heavy shake consistency, it's great! You just have to play a little bit to figure it out. When you know how good hemp is for you, it's hard not to go through the extra effort to figure it out. I also want to note that the fiber content in this is unreal... throw out your current fiber supplements... this stuff beats it all! There truly is no comparison.

I only took two sips, then threw the rest away, and rinsed out my mouth with water. Nothing about it was good, and I don't consider it a product sufficiently developed that it should have even been released for sale. The texture, freshness, taste, and mixability all were seriously lacking. To my mind, why would anyone consume something this bad, when there are so many other options available?

Two couldn't finish it because they found it so trite and the rest of us (being proper Minnesotans) finished it based on Lutheran guilt which requires us to always finish what we start. The story went on and on with no discernable plot line. To resolve the only interesting plot element, the author use the wimpy literary device of giving a character a terminal illness. If you're from Chaska MN you may find all the references to local landmarks fun, but if not don't waste your money. This book will be on the remainder table very soon if it isn't there already.

If only Mr. Allen had started with his friends letter, then elaborated on his ideas and understandings of the physics texts he'd read. Maybe he could have trotted the globe and actually talked to philosophers and scientists. Maybe he could have used the book as an excuse to actually go on a journey of discovery. Perhaps when Mr.Allen is older he can revamp the book completely and spend less time on mundane life and more on sharing (from his own voice) the excitement of discovery and wonder his new found ideas had given him. Then he'd have a book as worthy as a Brief History of Time that people who purchased it would actually read.

Having lost a loved one to AIDS I could relate to Bryce Courtenay's pain and I could feel the anger and passion he felt writing this book. Through Bryce's amazing talent for telling a story I felt I really knew Damon and his family. When I got to the last page I let out a deep sigh and cried for Damon, for my own loved one and for everyone affected by AIDS. I thank Bryce for having the courage to write this important book and for sharing Damon's life with us all.I've read several of Bryce Courtenay's books and every one is a gem. I'm only disappointed that his books are not published in The United States and not readily available in our local bookstores.I highly recommend this book to everyone and I know you'll be hooked on Bryce forever afterward."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Beautiful and Moving Book!!","review":"Courtenay does it again!! A difficult, but MUST read. It brought this grown man to tears."},{"rating":"1","title":"Important topic, but not well-written","review":"As a B. Courtenay fan, I was eager to read his new work. However, it did not live up to his previously high quality of writing. He took his anger and frustration out on the paper, but instead of giving the story energy, it detracted from the story of love he was attempting to tell. Although he attempted to invite the reader into his son's life, due to his need to relieve his pain through writing, he failed to give the reader a view of the emotions inside his son and partner, which are the interpersonal connections that tie a reader to the characters. It felt more like a laundry list of doctors, hospitals,and medicines."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious is the word","review":"I have read other books by Courteney which I have heartily recommended to others. I love his insight into life in Australia and South Africa. I found this book informative, but tedious. If it was half it actual length it would have suited me well. It's a sad story of life at its hardest. There are definitely some positive moments. On the whole, however, I ended up skipping about half the book. Disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reality","review":"From a writer of, at times rather corny, \\"African\\" fiction, the searing honesty of April Fool's Day caught me by surprise. Bryce Courtney might not make his fortune from this book, but it is the one of which he should be proudest. It is a heart-rending Australian echo of the classic \\"The Band Played On\\", and the only book which comes close to conveying the tragedy of AIDS that can hold its own alongside \\"Borrowed Time\\". Love might no longer conquer all, but it goes a long way towards giving life dignity. Bryce Courtney, take a bow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious and disappointing","review":"Half way though this biography I thought surely there cant be another half a book to go - the main messages have already been fully (over) developed, Damon's sad situation is all downhill and more and more of the same.

This kid had so much promise, and was faced with the prospect of trying to live fervently in the short time allotted him by the two diseases. The only gripe I have with the book is it was unnecessarily long, and needed some serious editing. I don't think every member of the family needed to weigh in with their perspective. Courtney should have consolidated all the view points or just stuck to his own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moving and inspirational. A must read!","review":"Since purchasing this book when it was first released I have read and reread it yet it still has not lost the power that gripped me originally nor the need for tissues. Bryce Courtenay tells a personal, emotive story with a great deal of feeling. His descriptions of the life of a person with aids are thought provoking and compassionate. I feel as if I know Damon and Celeste just through what is written. April Fools Day is a must read for all people. It will keep your attention right through to the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Heart Felt Book","review":"This book was a very heart felt book and one in which leads the reader to feel for the family. Not only the pain and suffering that the family went through, but also the love that they had for each other. It is a real inspiration to anyone who reads it.

This was a great book and I recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little overrated, but still a wonderful, touching book","review":"Before you bash me for not giving this book 5 stars, please listen to me first.I truly loved this book. Bryce's family and the suffering that his son, Damon, went through nearly broke my heart and it was vividly written with plenty of emotion.On the downside, the book was at least 30 pages too long. There were unnessecary parts, such as going on about the lighthouse light in the apartmenmt window and Damon's junk-bucket car that really got to me because they were repeated and dragged out too much for my liking. Also, the graphic descriptions of Damon's injuries and infections are not really something good to read with you lunch.Also, I found the book to be a little bit overrated.I don't consider it a masterpiece like \\"The Power of One\\" but it's definitely not a cold fish like Courtenay's \\"The Potato Factory,\\" which bored me to tears. I'd rate it at about a 7.5/10 or 8/10, putting it in the same league as \\"Tandia.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Courtenay always hits a home run","review":"Courtenay, author of The Power of One and Tanya, as well as Matthew Flinders' Cat and many other works of fiction (or possibly thinly disguised memoir?) hits the ball out of the park with this tribute to a son, Bryce.

One was a close high powered major station. I had to buy an antenna amplifier to get back my lost channels. I have not seen any increase in picture quality with this one and it has a smaller pick-up window then the 20 year old. I constantly have to tweak the rotor to get the channel back in.It's only UHF so I thought it would be stronger and more focused for that frequency, it's not. I miss my Canadian channels too, I know they are VHF and will not switch over until 2011... But, I cut off the UHF from my old antenna, mounted on my backyard cabin and pull in those Canadian channels crystal clear.This antenna may look high-tech but, you could get better reception with rabbit-ears."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works very well at 65 mile fringe area","review":"We are right on the edge of the UHF reception area from Duluth MN, with some open water and highlands between our place and the broadcast towers, so no direct line of sight. The antenna is on a fairly tall rooftop mast about 25 feet above the ground. With an amplifier it receives all the available UHF channels, sometimes at 100%. It is very directional - even five degrees makes a difference in the reception. The antenna is lightweight and not particularly sturdy, and it's hard to say how many years it can survive with the harsh weather it will see, but right out of the box it performs better than expected. I paid about 50% off retail for an open-box item and am very satisfied."},{"rating":"2","title":"free tv is good","review":"Good antenna. Easy to put together. Works great.

But once you get figured out what is front and what is the back, it is easy to put together and the picture you get with it is AMAZING!!!

We were getting stations crystal clear that are well over 70 miles away."},{"rating":"2","title":"best antenna at great price","review":"I brought the top rated 91XG, got a great price, got it fast, put it in my attic and am now picking up about 35 OTA DTV stations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not work for us","review":"This product arrived very fast, but did not work for us. We are about 40 miles away from the Washington DC area. Perhaps it had to do with interference between us and the broadcast stations, but a cheap, old antenna did a much better job -- so we switched back. Also, the product arrived with evidence inside that it had been opened and perhaps installed elsewhere before we received it. It was missing one connector plug for the little wings. Nothing looked broken, however."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pulls in the stations","review":"This rather large and unwieldly UHF antenna does work well. I'm in a fringe area of NYC. Coupled with a high gain UHF preamp I was pulling in most of the stations I was interested in. I even was receiving ABC which is a VHF frequency. However this was in winter without the leaves on the trees. I suspect that, I hope not, after spring when the leaves fill out on the trees, I may lose many of the stations. This antenna appears to have less wind loading than the large bowties, but may not hold up to birds sitting on the elements. The published gain values are among the highest available for this class antenna (Fringe) However, this also means it is very directional. It needs to be accurately aimed toward the station or stations you need to receive. This is the final option, if you can't get the stations with this, you won't get them with anything."},{"rating":"2","title":"Picks up UHF stations more than 60 miles away","review":"I added this to a VHF antenna on a mast mounted to my fireplace chimney and am running it through a VHF/UHF combiner. I can now see the UHF channels that are more than 60 miles away. This antenna has about a 30 degree beam and it is not so directional that you have to change antenna position for every station.

First I purchased a small indoor antenna.......no signal. Then I decided to purchase one of those cheap made Lava 2605 HD outdoor antennas....no signal. So after sending that junk back I went to tvfool and entered my address and the guys on the message board suggested this antenna. WOW! I hooked it up to my TV and pulled in 12 channels that are crystal clear and put the satellite to shame. This antenna can pull in the channels from far away! I have $200.00 in the entire setup(antenna, rotor, wire, pipe)and also stream my movies/tv shows from netflix. I went from paying $90.00 a month down to $9.00 a month for netflix. No cable/satellite company can compete with that."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Exceptional Antenna for Fringe to Deep Fringe","review":"This is one of the best antennas around for deep fringe viewing when all the stations are in the same direction. I live in the mountains about 90 miles from the transmitter towers. I've tried other antennas and could barely get any signal but this one gives me a good to excellent picture on all available UHF analog and digital signals. I do have a preamp installed on the mast with the antenna. For those giving this a poor or very poor rating and saying they live 20-40 miles from the station it is because it has too much gain for their location. They are over driving the input to their television. As an old Air Force radio technician I highly recommend this antenna if you live in fringe to deep fringe areas."},{"rating":"2","title":"91xG hdtv antenna","review":"Shipping was pretty good, everything packed well; when I went to put it together everything was fine till I mounted the elements on the boom, the elements where loose they moved around in the wind, so I had to put little plastic wedges in the element clips so they where snug on the boom.

Isbin proves that truly great music does not need lyrics to speak to you. There are so many subtle nuances to the composition- an unexpected note here, a syncopated rhythm there. \\"Julia Florida\\" is achingly beautiful. The South American flow keeps my fingers tapping. There is a Latin jazz influence that permeates throughout, perfectly belnding with her classical, intricate guitar style. If you're interested in classical guitar and enjoy a lot of jazz and rhythms, you should search out this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Journey to the Amazon","review":"Sharon is a wonderful guitarist who has been concertizing since she was fourteen years old. She plays with technical mastery and feeling, but more importantly she takes risks and has not gone stale. A few of the more well known compositions hold up very well next to other versions of say, Segovia and Christopher Parkening. Why would you want to hear these recordings since other masters have already done them so splendidly? They haven't been done with Brazilian percussion and saxophone. The other reason to purchase this CD is because of the wonderful world premier of Thiago de Mello's compositions. Two for one: familiar Brazilian compositiona by Barrios et. al, with a little more \\"Brazilian\\" feel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beyond beautiful, a wonderful work","review":"This recording was one of my early exposures to Sharon Isbin on CD. I had the pleasure of experiencing her live performance prior to the purchase of this CD. As a fan of heavier guitar music, (i.e. Steve Vai and Eric Johnson), I never believed I would enjoy a classical guitarist. I was so completely moved by the performance Ms. Isbin gives on this CD, that I promptly purchased \\"Dreams of a World\\" and most recently \\"Baroque Favorites for Guitar\\". I highly recommend this CD if you want to hear a guitarist whose work defies traditional categorization. I give it 10 stars! Please try to see Ms. Isbin live in recital if she comes to your area; you will experience a remarkable performance."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great series with a great re-master","review":"Finally fans of this series can enjoy it on BR/DVD without an outrageous out of print price tag. The remaster to the visual is pretty good, but the audio remaster is where this set shines. Contrary to Zetogamer's comments, this is not misadvertised. The original U.S. OVA release only included the first 13 episodes, with Ryo-Ohki being a separate release (you can find the Ryo-Ohki DVD set sold by Amazon for less than 20 USD, in addition to Tenchi Universe and GXP for relatively inexpensive).

I decided to study design after reading this book, even though I grew up being told I would be an architect or a writer.On the visionary chapter titled \\"what is a designer\\", Munari made it clear to me that design is a much needed public and collaborative art. He wrote as translated to english in 1966: \\"Art is once more becoming a trade, as it was in ancient times when the artist was summoned by society to make certain works of visual communication (called frescoes)...\\" and keeps going. It never made sense to me that art could only be self absorption hidden in galleries, but I guess that is yet another kind of trade.He writes with humour and honesty, and keeps me focused on my discipline.

Very comfortable to wear, keep the water out completely, do not get foggy (I ordered the black ones), and do not hurt at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love them","review":"So I originally had another pair of goggles which just kept fogging up over and over, pretty much ruining my swim every time.So I decided to get these and let me tell, you. They have not fogged up once on me and I swim laps for around an hour on average. These ones are absolutely perfect and do exactly what I need."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to these?","review":"I used to be a fan of these goggles and used them for several years with a level of satisfaction that would have earned them at least a four-star rating. However, after purchasing a new pair recently, I've had nothing but problems. No matter how I adjust the fit, I get incredible leaks after only 25m. It's a shame because I really do like the clarity of the lenses and how bright and crisp everything appears through them. Obviously, though, when you're not able to get an effective workout for having to empty your goggles every 100m (if you're lucky), nice lenses are hardly worth having. I won't be spending my money on another pair of these again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Former swim coach","review":"I do not personally use this type of goggles, but when I coached age group competitive swimmers these were the first ones that I recommended. They are easy to fit, they don't leak if properly fitted to the face, and the nose is fairly comfortable for kids about 9 and up. I recommend the junior for those with a small face or small bridge to the nose."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great goggles","review":"These goggles have never given me any trouble--no drops of water, no fogging.

They were lovers, not just good co-workers. I just saw \\"Carmen & Geoffrey,\\" which granted was made decades later, but that work stated the couple was married, not just artists who got along well.

When the local Safeway store got a supply in, I decided to try it again, and it was nearly as bad was the previous one. I can only suppose they had a very bad batch or somebody didn't put the proper blend together; I don't know what their mistake was.

I fully agree, and have lost a couple of action shots through the confusion. My biggest problem is with the physical strength of the camera. I was taking pictures from a boat, and the lens gently nudged a bulkhead. This was a gentle nudge, but enough to dislodge the lens, which fell off completely when I shut the power down.

In any lower light photography, I would be more inclined to use a standard SLR on a tripod as a larger diaphram opening would be necessary. Digital cameras and Film cameras each have their place in photography and neither does exactly what the other is capable of, so don't expect your digital to do everything.The 5 times zoom is the best I have seen and even the farthest away object in the photo is displayed in all it's detail.The voice captioning is another neat feature that allows you save your images with their own talking display.

However, the big down fall is Fuji failed to incorporate an optical viewfinder. This makes it nearly impossible in very bright conditions (like the Arizona sun) and dark conditions (any indoor activity with low lighting) to see what you are shooting. You can point and re-take as many times as you need, but I missed too many shots this way. This was my third digital camera, and I returned it because although the prints were beautiful and clear, and I loved the zoom, it wasn't worth sacrificing my compositions for. I played with all the controls to try and adjust, but the only solution was either a tripod or bring your own lighting. I exchanged it for a Canon and am very pleased with it. It has less features and zoom, but at least I can set my picture up the way I want it, the first time.

I was wrong! It fits and even leaves some inches spare at both sides. Power supply and other accesories like a mouse, digital camera cables etc. also get tucked away nicely without making the bag look bulky and overfilled (not at all like the huge leather bag the laptop came with). And it even looks beautiful and professional. If you travel a lot, you can take your favourite DVD's along to pass time in airports. I only wish it had more space for files and documents in the front compartment. But it's worth the price and looks very durable. I definitely recommend this bag!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Item","review":"This Targus BlackTop Standard Notebook Case was perfect!!

However, this is the least powerful epilator I have ever used in my 14 year of personal epilation history. (I have gone through six epilators.) It takes forever to clear a small area."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work. Time consuming.","review":"I had bought this because I was tired of shaving, and too chicken to wax. Unfortunately, it doesn't actually work well. First of all, it hurts. I will admit that my skin is very sensitive, so that may have a lot to do with it. But It hurts unbelievably, especially if you do tender ares such as feet and armpits. I quit using it because of not only the pain, but in the time it takes to do one leg I could have shaved ten times. Its definately not worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"I sent it back","review":"It does good for the bikini area. However you have to hold it at a back angle for the tweezers to grab the hair properly. It did not work on legs at all. It would pull a few hairs and broke the rest. Without the guard it feels like it is scraping the skin. The tweezers area is so small it would take a week to finish a leg even if it did grab the leg hairs. Razor attachment does not work to my satisfaction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great buy","review":"I was a little worried about this one, based on the price, but it's worth it.Yes, an epilator is painful, so if you don't want pain then don't buy one.You won't get completely smooth skin right away, it'll take more than one session over the course of a few weeks, but the hair you remove won't come back as thick or as densely.I recommend using the skin guard if you're doing your underarms, since the skin is more sensitive there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Handy little machine!","review":"Pros: Small, easy to use, pretty colors, it will work for a while without charging.Cons: It's somewhat hard to clean, but not a pain in the behind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Written in 1965","review":"The March 1999 date is misleading -- that's the reprint date.

Killjoy (of Necrophagia), Christ Reifert, Danny Corales, and Clint Bower (all of Abscess and Autopsy), and Danny Lilker (S.O.D. and Anthrax)...a lineup made in hell, you just know you're in for some brutal, raw, blasphemous, and gory music. Right from the first screams of Satan, you know this is not a tame album. Every track bursts with brutality, hard-hitting drums, violent guitar attacks, and of course Killjoy's tortured glass-gargling voice. There really isn't a stand out track, the whole thing plays out like a long death metal symphony of gore and misanthropy. I will say the samples were an interesting touch on songs like \\"Orgy in Dog's Blood\\" and \\"Keep My Grave Open.\\" They just add an eerie quality to songs that already sound like they were made by resurrected corpses. ... These five metal maniacs have created a masterpiece. \\"Assembled in Blasphemy\\" is THE gore metal album."},{"rating":"2","title":"RAVENOUS is Assembled in BLASPHEMY!!","review":"This is some raw, killer black/death metal at it's sickest! Killjoy of Necrophagia/Viking Crown does vocals on here, and they are pretty lame and weak... The chainsaw guitar is right up in your face, and the drumming is good. Also the production is pretty dirty, which suits this musick very well.. Most of the songs are killer.. some highlights.. 'Keep my grave open' , 'Dead cut up and ready..' The lyrics are ridiculous, though.. they mainly deal w/ gore themes, like cutting up a babe and then doing the nasty w/ her. heh.. I guess if you're into the whole perversity of gore, then you won't mind.. Anyway besides that, this album is decent, and definitely worth getting if you like bands like Necrophagia, Autopsy, etc. They need a new vokillist, though. :P"},{"rating":"2","title":"D'Amato's Chilling Thriller","review":"As a mystery writer with my debut novel in its initial release, I was fascinated by Barbara D'Amato's HELP ME PLEASE. I love the way Ms. D'Amato effectively works the criminal use of the Internet into this police procedural. Danni Gaston, a young daughter of two celebrities--an entertainer and a politician--is abducted from a church. The snatched child appears on the Internet a matter of hours later, and the kidnappers demand the release of a web-terrorist. Police detective Polly Kelly is given the task of solving the crime and finding the child. Kelly finds herself pressured by a camera webcasting Danni's every move as well as the child's deteriorating condition. Ms. D'Amato has written a fine book with a realsitic setting, a highly contemporary plot, and realistically drawn characters.

I think Natalie will be bying a new shirt. But that's okay 'cause she's a lib. Funny how when someone puts down someone else it's okay 'til one of thier own gets picked on. Simply put it's hilarious. Buy it for the cover of him posing like the Chicks did on that one magazine cover. Luckily he's not totally nekkid like they were, whew. But has Stars & Stripes Boxers on w/writing all over him.

Judd was once funny at one time, but his overexposure on CMT has made him tiring. And why is it on this lousy 4 song CD all he can think to do is put down the Dixie Chicks, who are REAL country artists? I guess it's just because he's Toby Keith's best buddy. Maybe one song is to be expected, but four? You'd be better off throwing your money into the fire than wasting it on this CD.

I find myself at odds with them (because I am moderate and independent), but I respect them for who and what they are (unless they start talking nonsense-ha ha). Cledus T Judd should take my advice. He is the Weird Al of country music, but this time he hits an all-time low. In order to cash in on the Toby and Dixie Chicks feud, he makes this EP blasting the Dixie Chicks. How are you going to get involved in something that doesn't concern you? Even Toby is ready to let this thing against the Chicks go because he realizes that's its hurting country's music. Cledus is obvious proud of this \\"accomplishment\\", but its obvious he has no class. Have your fun, Cledus. But you are a joke!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame, Stupid And Certainly Not Funny","review":"I'll admit there was a time when cledus was actually funny, but his latest attempt at parody not only comes off as lame, but it is also very much not funny. can't people get over it, i mean for him to still think the dixie chicks incident is still worth slandering and discussing, almost 8 months after it occurred, is truly sad. Well, cledus must have though it was still funny to release four songs about it, neither striking a single chord of humour, but rather comming off as childish and juvenile. I would recommend you burn your money in a toaster before you spend it on this piece of mainstream trash. A release such as this only affirms the newly held notion that free speech is a right, that when exercised, becomes liable to slander and vilification. the dixie chicks are only one of a few remaining musical acts who really understand the meaning of music, and are able to produce music with amazing dignity and quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weird Al Ripoff","review":"I just have to laugh at all of these folks that are slamming the Dixie Chicks for what they said about Bush. First of all, they had every right to say what they said. The US Constitution guarantees the right to free speech. As far as the Chick abandoning country music, \\"Home\\" was a great traditioal country recording, and last year's Dixie Chick tour was one of the year's biggest, selling out wherever it went. So complain about the Chicks all you want - they aren't going anywhere.Cledus T, Judd, on the other hand, is a no-talent country-fried version of Weird Al Yankovich...minus the talent. His parody songs are unfunny, and after seeing him live the other night opening for Rascal Flatts, it's a wonder the guy can put two words together.

For example, when the hurricane force starts-up on Mars, they just stand there and watch it...that's not normal...at least back away. And when the ship was hit by meteors and they saw all the damage, there would have to be other sensors that tell them the fuel tanks have been hit (it's supposed to be 2020; if they can go to Mars, then they have the technology). Although there isn't much swearing, they do take God's name in vain several times, which is completely unnecessary. And the worst was near the end (at which time I turned it off): They teach people that aliens and evolution populated the earth...both are lies. God created all things, and for His pleasure they are and were created. Only God is worthy to receive glory and honor and power.

I have been part of a large group, and therefore have some real world experience in the private practice world. This book's author is a psychologist, and I found many sections of the book were just not applicable for a medical practice. For example, in the section on scheduling appointments, the leading suggestion is that the practitioner schedule his/her own appointments as a means of establishing a personal connection. This just doesn't jibe with the reality of a medical practice which has a much higher volume of calls and patients than a therapist - who probably sees 6 to 8 patients per day. Many other aspects of the book are therapist-centric, and either irrelevant or simply inaccurate for a medical practice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Made me mad - no star","review":"This book just made me mad. Myers rounds up all of the usual suspects: divorce, pornography, the media, out of wedlock children, and tells us that our permissive, rights-oriented society is to blame. He hops on the Communitarian bandwagon without critical analysis of how one compels community and whether it would be worth the price.For example, he suggests, without a hint of analysis, that the 14th Amendment, rights of due process and equal protection, should trump First Amendment free speech. He hasn't a clue about how complex this argument is or where it would lead. Professor Myers claims impartiality as a \\"social scientist\\" when, in fact, the book skews the research to prove his point. Unfortunately, his \\"point\\" (our society is in the toilet - big surprise) doesn't lead anywhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing O-Ring","review":"The call was missing the O-Ring that was supposed to be in it to change tones.

And it is Charles' vibes that elevate this performance above the standard late 50s blowing session, as his pleasantly unexpected melodic counterpoints to the frontline horns provide the album's most interesting moments.

(Why HAVEN'T you told him to back off?) She offers a smorgasbord of effective responses to choose from, some witty and all wise.One point that I found especially instructive: When dealing with bullies, all the \\"I\\" messages in the world (\\"I'm upset about that,\\" \\"I feel hurt when you say that,\\" etc.) only fuel the fire. \\"You\\" messages (\\"Stop it.\\" \\"Don't use that language around me.\\" \\"Clean up your act.\\" \\"What did you say?\\") work better.

This book provides a good base for understanding the historical, cultural, religious, political and economic background of the Kingdom. The book is a bit dated by this point (2001) but remains a great starting point for investigation of a complex society whose structure today is largely a mirror of a much older tribal structure. Very readable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Content with this product","review":"We had one of these of unknown age and it broke when the bike toppled over - to much leverage on the plastic. We liked it enough to replace it, and now we have the \\"rack\\" on both Mom and Dad's bikes and one seat. I've used both front-mounted and rear-mounted seats and neither is ideal - it's a little awkward and wobbly one way, versus the other. But biking with the child is still wonderful. This doesn't hold that big a child, our girl is four, petite, about 30 lbs, and her legs are down at the bottom of the \\"holsters\\" for her feet. I think this is a good model, the price is good, and it gives you a \\"rack\\" you can use with a bungie cord for carrying this or that instead of the child seat. Easy to mount on and off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Locking-in mechanism too good","review":"This seat is OK. My only complaint is the locking mechanism, which requires you disengage two levers in both the front and the back. While this certainly reduces the chance that the seat will fall off, there is also makes it very difficult to remove. I actually fractured a finger while trying to remove it, lodging it between the provided rear rack and the front latch of the seat (and I am NOT a clumsy person). had to have surgery, a pin, PT, etc...To bypass this problem now, I use a flathead screwdriver to press down on the lever so my hands are nowhere near that connection!"},{"rating":"2","title":"she loves it","review":"The rack was a little tough to install because of the configuration of the rear sprocket on my bike but once I got it on the rack is light and sturdy, useful for other things as well. As far as the seat goes it is light, well balanced, easy to get on and off the bike, oh yeah and my two year old loves it. She was a little scared at first but as soon as we were moving she started to giggle and tell everyone we passed that she was riding on the back of Daddy's bike. Very good vaue for the price!"},{"rating":"1","title":"May not work for your bike","review":"I could not mount the bike rack on my very normal bike with the parts included.

Fortunately I don't have to remove the seat but otherwise I would have considered returning this item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Make sure it fits your bike's geometry","review":"I purchased this seat for my commuting bicycle (a converted Giant cyclocross bike). It simply doesn't work with my bicycle's frame geometry. Neither my bike mechanic nor I could get the bottom of the seat to sit parallel to the ground. The seat exhibited a *significant* backward tilt ... so much so that I was afraid to put my daughter in because I thought the fasteners/fittings might not be adequate to support her weight in that configuration. I had nightmarish visions of the seat becoming detached and falling backward while I was pedaling. I'm sure that the seat would work fine for most bicycles. But it my case, it was a waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great seat, can't beat the price","review":"We are very happy with this seat. Installation of the rack and seat were simple on my Specialized HRXC and after a few rides I can't think of a complaint. The foot straps are a little low, but it is very easy to place them on top of your childs foot for a secure ride. Based on other reviews, we might have gotten lucky with our release lever. Its easy to press and the seat is off within seconds.I recommend this seat for both short and long rides, my son would ride for hours if we would let him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Returned my returned seat!","review":"First...arrival: the seat had obviously been returned before. The box was kindof beat up with a lot of old tape. There was no owners manual. I found it online though.Second...installation: it was very, very, very difficult to install. I had to take the back tire off to get the screw in backwards. Then I could not get the seat onto the bike rack with all my strength. My husband got it but bent the metal trying to get it in. This is bad because I wanted to be able to remove the seat sometimes!Third...use: my 22 lb, 30.5 inch tall 9 month old fits wonderfully with room to grow, BUT, the seat really throws off the balance. I feel wobbly if I'm going very slowly and it is hard to start and stop.Therefore...I'm returning it and opting for the WeeRide Kangaroo bike seat, which sits infront and shouldn't throw the balance off so much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Instructions are misleading","review":"The instructions for this suggest one can simply slide the seat onto the rack. That's not the case, however. After a maddening hour or so, I used a flat-head screw driver to leverage the seat on the front of the rack. Looks like a design or manufacturing flaw prevents one from sliding it on. I haven't used it yet, but I came within minutes of packing it back up and returning it. Let's hope its flaws do not extend to how safe it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"It has a nice Sleeping Beauty Suite","review":"If your looking for a Tchaikovsky Ballet Suites version that's conducted and interpreted by Tchaikovsky's countrymen, this is it. This was my first Tchaikovsky Ballet suites CD and I really enjoyed it a lot. It also features other Tchaikovsky works, specifically Capriccio Italien and the Eugene Onegin: Waltz & Polonaise. I'll recommend this cd for Tchaikovsky fans who like to own different versions of his works.The Sleeping Beauty Suite in this CD is a delight and the Pas D'Action, Panorama, and Waltz is more romantic than my Karajan and Dorati versions. My only complaint is the recording is not as loud as my Karajan and Dorati versions. If you only want one copy of Tchaikovsky's Ballet suites, go for the Karajan version. If you prefer the complete versions, the Dorati CDs are the right ones to grab."},{"rating":"2","title":"how do you communicate?","review":"Communication is very important in today's world.

Due to the stretch factor of this cushion, I felt like there was no support for my wrist at all. I may as well have not used this cushion at all. I don't have a big wrist at all (my braclet size is 5.5\\"), so when I rested my wrist on the cushion, the fabric would give and all of the pellets would move out to the left and right sides of the cushion (as the fabric stretched out) and then it left me with no pellets beneath my wrist...which meant no support at all. This was really a waste of money. I am sure that if the fabric were not stretchy at all, then the shape of the cusion and would probably have provided the support I was looking for.

Scott's short, scholarly book makes a compelling case for the future growth of regional economies and explains the key role they are likely to play in shaping future global political and economic development. Though written in dense, academic language, the book makes its points clearly and supports them with research, theory and statistics. Scott's guidelines for \`regional directorates' reflect many experiments that are already under way around the world, and seeks to capture the best features of each. If his basic idea is correct, then a conscious effort to build regional institutions should speed economic development and reduce world economic stresses. This book is heavy reading, but it is concise and to the point. We [...] recommend it to executives in multinational corporations, entrepreneurs thinking about where to locate, urban planners, civic leaders and government officials - in short, anyone who wants to promote or profit from regional economic development."},{"rating":"2","title":"Damn this band was good....the earliest the best,once again","review":"Sisters of Mercy were impressive.

The recording is not of the best quality, but as history states, that's how it was back then and that's how it should be heard now. Certain songs are rough, but others are smooth and worthy of much praise.Perhaps the greatest reason to purchase this cd now is that it is nearly impossible to find in the United States and when it is, it is extremely costly.Some Girls Wander By Mistake is a modern classic of early gothic and industrial rock."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Gothic of the early 80's","review":"This album isn't that bad.

It provides a synopsis of the past years events, as well as a lot of science, entertainment and sports news. The facts and figures (population figures of several cities, Government represetatives, etc.) are also fascinating. To some, it would be a great source of business information, if that's what you're looking for.It's only shortcoming this year, was it's failure to cover the 2001 World Series. Even though the games were held later than usual due to 9/11, it was only by a couple of weeks. They should have delayed publication until it's completion so that coverage of the games could be included.I've purchased other annual almanacs, but this is only one I buy every year, and is by far the best of the breed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book of Facts!","review":"I gave this to my husband for Christmas, and he has not been able to put it down since!

It's loaded with many charts and statistics on just about anything you can think of. From the population of major cities to the Nobel Prize awards you can always trust the Almanac to be useful. Finding information in this almanac is simple because of the index in the front and the quick index on the back cover.Sometimes when I'm bored I pick up this almanac and find myself browsing through all the interesting information.

This was surprising and sad after what seemed to be a decent amount of success of Heartworm- which is hands down one of the best moody rock albums ever. While I liked Heartworm better, this one is still very strong and has very emotional music. These guys don't screw around with sappy superficiality. Strength and honesty don't come together in 'pop' music (or any music) very often, and when it does, as here, it really affects how one defines 'good' music. Whipping Boy is one of the few bands making this sort of music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow! This book is bad!","review":"I recently found this book in an old box of books I've had sitting around since the 80's. When I came across it, I vaguely remember not liking it, but I gamely re-read it just to make sure. First of all, none of the characters are really very likeable. Andrea, our heroine, is annoying, stupid, and behaves in ways women at that time would never have behaved. Besides being almost implausible, Ms. Coulter wrote it in the first person narrative which is not well done and very annoying. It's supposed to be, I think, a suspense romance. The plot isn't very well written, the romance is mostly non-existent, and the suspense makes me think that Ms. Coulter confuses supense and insanity. Maybe this was one of her first books? I've been reading romance novels for more than 20 years, and believe me when I tell you to skip this one and try one of her better ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"GE 27930GE3 2.4 GHz Cordless Telephone","review":"I bought this phone at Office Max for the same price as Amazon ($$$). The price was good and the phone felt good in the hand. I liked the antenna lighting up - it gave a visula indication that it was working, but I wonder how much extra battery-time it sucks up. The clarity was good as long as you were near the base. BUT, the volume was too low, even at the highest setting. I kept having to ask my caller to repeat what they said. I also did my usual test of going outside and seeing how far away I could go before the signal became noisy. I barely got out the door before I got all this crackling and static. The range was no where near my two other 900 MHZ phones. Back to the store for a refund with this unit. Bottom Line: Nice features, nice price, poor performance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Even though it's cheap....it's not worth the money","review":"Even though the reception was ok, I quickly got discouraged with this phone. I guess it's true you get what you pay for...unfortunately. First the CID screen started getting scratched up, even though it wasn't being mishandled. Then, suddenly, I noticed it would take 2 - 3 times to dial out and get a connection. At first, I thought it was the phone company or my lines on my house. Then one day I just happened to hear what was going on with it. After pressing the buttons on the phone, you hear the phone's buttons emit their tone and afterward you should hear the actual dialing out of the number for the tone dialing setting. Well some of the numbers weren't dialing out and it was random to any number at different times... i.e. #2, #5 and #7...it seems like an odd problem to me. I've had this phone for more than 6 mos at least so I guess I'm stuck with it...so buyer beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is an Analog Phone. DIGITAL is always better!","review":"This is an analog phone (not digital). GE (as many others) do a sneaky job of advertising it as 2.4 GHz without touting that it is an analog phone. When checking out phones pay attention to analog vs digital. Digital is more secure and of better quality. A 900Mhz DIGITAL phone will most always be better then any 2.4 GHz ANALOG phone.Another thing bad about this phone is they way the Caller ID screen sticks out it gets scuffed up after a short period of use. I imagine that after a year of use you will not be able to view the caller ID screen. This is just bad design.On a good note the way I do like the way the stubby antenna lights up when the phone rings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst phone I ever purchased","review":"I liked the looks of this phone, the attractive price and the 2.4 GHz. However, when I set up the phone and used it after the required battery charge period, I was very disappointed! The sound quality is just poor. Not just \\"tiny/metallic\\" but annoying is a better word that comes to mind. At first I couldn't hear the other person, so I turned up the volume - yes, it got louder but so did the noise. The signal to noise ratio must be incredibly bad. I originally purchased the phone so that I could carry it with me outside - at least to the back yard - yet the reception was so bad that I couldn't hear the caller. And this being only 25 yards or so... while my 900 MHz Uniden was able to receive calls a 1/4 mile away.Poor quality, poor reception... don't buy this phone."},{"rating":"1","title":"This phone is HORRIBLE!","review":"This phone is horrible.

The only thing I don't like is that I cannot see the caller ID display too good without my glasses but that is a personal issue, not a problem with the phone. I find very good clarity with the phone and if I needed more, I would buy more. Another good feature is that since I have voice mail through my telephone company, this phone is compatible with it and a light flashes to let me know that I have a message waiting.

It frequently \\"loses\\" the base and I have to set it back on the charger once or twice to persuade it to work again. I cannot talk on this phone and use my microwave at the same time - I hear a dreadful buzzing sound. It makes an annoying screech when I receive a call on Call Waiting (I have the Caller ID Call Waiting). If someone calls several times in a row, it only recalls the most recent call time, and for that matter, it does not seem to sort my calls in chronological order.On the plus side, it sometimes chirps right before a call rings, so I can impress my guests by with my psychic knowledge of an incoming call. Unfortunately, that does not make up for all the flaws in this phone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it!","review":"I bought this phone because I figured GE was a good, reputable company with high-quality products. Well, I was wrong. This phone may look cool but it has very poor reception (I get static even when I'm standing 1 foot away from the base) and the volume is never just right. People on the other end of the line are always inaudible and when I turn the volume up, it increases the volume on my end so it sounds like I'm yelling but I still can't hear the person I'm talking to.I called GE to get it replaced (along with another GE phone I have that stopped working after less than 1 year) and they requested that I pay shipping and labor costs on both phones, which came up to more than [price], with no guarantee that my phones would be fixed and no replacements would be made.

Around page 100, there is a good scene. At 200 there is another. Close to 300 the action begins. After that, the book is quite solid, well written and entertaining. However, most of the first three hundred pages consist of long, boring internal monologues by just about every named character in the entire book about how and why their severe mental problems make them anti-social. It's boring, it's irritating, it's pointless - and it just keeps going, one character after another. In the \\"about the author\\" section it says this is her first novel.

There is no way anyone of either gender would be able to look up to her, and to trust her judgement in tense situations. Snappy, childish, immature. Ugh!Overall, I thought the book opened really nicely, the prologue was great but then it was kind of dropped.

If you slightly turn one too far it will split the plastic in half. Mine actually cracked (the first time)sometime during a move and setting it up. The next one I was responsible for.

You might as well just not even use a tripod.Save your money and invest an extra $10-$20 to get something professional. This one truly sucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"missing set screw on one leg","review":"The tripod was sent to us with a set screw missing on one leg. The leg kept falling off.

Sent from the factory without being checked I assume."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crappy Plastic used","review":"My first review on Amazon----I bought this product last year, Sometime in Jan(2010), Used it only a couple of times before the plastic inside broke sometime in March 2010. There is absolutely no way to fix it. Cause there is a plastic ring inside one of the legs and it got cut into two. I checked the quality of the plastic,It was pretty brittle. Contacted the seller twice, they refused to reply to my emails.I have been using it since then with certain modifications, I put on some Tap, and instead of using 3 levels of Heights, I just use two.It is a little too light, Hence if you use this in a Windy place during night, You get bad shots.For a beginner, I would recommend this cause this is more like an experimental one before you buy a better one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very unstable and low quality plastic knobs","review":"The plastic knob cracked just after 1 day of use.

I used it 2 times around my house and the third time I pulled it out of it's carrying case one of the legs had come unglued. Yes, unglued. It is very flimsy and cheap.

I would probably give it 5 stars even though its not the best quality.I'm only giving it one star because mine doesn't sit perfectly strait.

Yes I know how to adjust it, but the adjustment is already at its maximum."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth for good photography","review":"If you are serious about photography, this tripod will be a real waste.

Some say its cheap and flimsy, but really - for under $20, seems like a wonderful deal."},{"rating":"1","title":"They just shouldn't produce items this cheap","review":"This is no fault of 47th. Street Photo, but this tripod is junk. The price is so cheap that I selected it for my wife because she is interested in photography and I thought it would be a good starter model. I planned on replacing it with something better if she ended up actually using it.The plastic on the tripod is very cheap and brittle. She tried to turn the crank to extend the camera upwards and the plastic gear broke off some spokes, rendering useless the ability to raise and lower the camera. Also, the camera doesn't seat into the top very well. It's wobbly. When you turn the camera on it's side to take a portrait picture, I was actually afraid it would come loose.With the shipping, all I did was add $22.00 to the price of the new tripod I will end up purchasing. Bottom line: They just shouldn't make things this cheap. Do yourself a favor and pay a little more for something that will last longer than 2-3 days."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware SLR owners, will not support camera's weight","review":"I was excited to receive this tripod, it has some cool features and seemed like a great bargain. When we screwed our camera to the top, we found out that the top piece, that adjusts the camera's up and down angle, couldn't handle the weight of our camera(nikon d60). The adjustment handle/screw piece would bend when we attached the camera and cause it to be out of alignment with its corresponding nut; and not fully tighten. I even tried replacing the nut, but it didn't solve the problem. I believe this is a design flaw and not an issue with the unit we received. This will likely work for a small digital camera, but not for a SLR or camcorder.In this case, I'd recommend paying more to get better quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for camcorders , bad product.","review":"This probably one of the worst products I've ever bought. So disapponited. Firstly the tripod that was sent to me was a used one but sold to me as NEW. You could clearly see that it was a returned item. Had scratches all over. I don't mind used items but what I don't like is paying for a new item but shipped a used one. Secondly, the tripod is horrible. It makes this squeeking sound when you go up and down and not only that but it also does not turn smoothly as it's supposed to when you use the camcorder. Imagine you record something important and you have all those squeeking sounds when you turn up and down and sideways? I'm guessing it's ok for people who will be using it for small digital cameras but not dSLRs. I wouldn't use it with my E-510. It might collapse down when used with Zuiko 70-300mm lens.Just horrible product overall. But as they say \\"you get what you pay for\\". This tripod is going right back at amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm no professional, but it's great!","review":"I bought this as a birthday present for my wife, for our digital camera. Neither of us have used a tripod before, but it was very easy to figure out, set up and start using. I see no faults with this tripod. I can't think of anything I would change about it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"You Get What You Pay For","review":"While this product is labeled as a digital tripod it is certainly not for use with a DSLR. The quick release mechanism, while it sounds like a good idea, is not (unless you want to keep it attached to your camera at all times). The product is poorly made but the design concept is good. On the positive side, it is light and portable. The leveling bubbles are a nice touch. On the negative side is the instability of the quick release mechanism. If you put a DSLR on it, it will wobble. The wing nut controlling the horizontal rotation did not function and returning the product for this is not worth the grief. Do your self a favor and spend a little more money for a more substantial product. You'll be happier in the long run."},{"rating":"2","title":"Small price, Big Tripod","review":"I read over 75% of the reviews before I bought this and I was NOTdisappointed!

Get something slightly more expensive and thank yourself later."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tripod Broken after Minimal Usage","review":"I am by no means a professional photographer so I figured that a light, inexpensive tripod would be perfect for me (I really only shoot photos indoors for my blog). I used this tripod for about a month with my Nikon D3100 without any problems. Next thing I knew the bottom extension of one of the legs (the legs extend 2 times) completely detached from where it is locked into place (with the black plastic piece). I attempted to reinsert the leg but was not able to get it to lock into place like it was originally. I used the tripod for a few weeks with the faulty leg, but it just became too much of a headache (the leg would suddenly collapse mid shot, I couldn't get the leg to stay extended, etc).I wish I could return this item for a new one, maybe mine was just faulty? Who knows. Either way I'm buying a new tripod with hopes that it works out better for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Tripod is Crap!","review":"Junk, Junk, JUNK.

It has nice added feature such as the handle, a hook for center-weighting and swivel feet. However the plastic-on-plastic head does not allow for smooth pans and tilts. It is very jerky, no matter what level of tension you put on it. The worst feature is the quick release mount...the plastic screw head is hard to access and will not tighten down enough to hold the camera steadily in place. Bummer. Oh, and \\"carrying case\\" is overstated."},{"rating":"1","title":"weak tripod","review":"I did not know that a tripod could be made as weak and flimsy as this. I can not complain too much as the price was too low to expect anything better. I should have researched this item further, but at the time I was flying through buying gifts.

I had concerns of how long the grips that hold the leg extensions would hold up,and I did not like that there is a removable piece that connects the camera to the tripod head. The lock mechanism for that piece also concerned me that it may not hold up over time.

I can tell you right off the bat it is a piece of junk and a waste of money. At first I was somewhat impressed and the sturdiness of the body and its build quality seemed decent, but the head is such junk that it does not screw to my DSLR properly and the camera is left slumped and wobbly. Because of this you can not take a simple, straight photo, and feared constantly for my camera. It doesn't even let you adjust the tilt vertically up or down.

The cheap plastic on the pan head was just shattered! It had been stored in a corner of the closet, and I had not touched it since the day it arrived.

It comes with a carrying case that makes it more handy. If you don't want to bring the case around, you can hold it through it's built-in handle grip. What else can I say, it's plastic so it's really light BUT it's durable enough to hold my DSC-H20.

It stands perfectly my Sony Alpha 200 that is not the lightest LSR in the world!In conclusion, I strongly racommend it!

Overall, the tripod wasn't horrible for ~$20. But, the materially was cheap, the stability of the tripod was questionable, and, perhaps most disappointing of all, it wouldn't hold my dSLR in place in a vertical position. While my Nikon dSLR wouldn't \\"fall of\\" the tripod, it would pivot around the screw rather than stay in a locked position. In short, it's not a product I was comfortable putting a $600 camera on. If you're buying this as a tripod for a smaller size point-and-shoot camera, it'll be fine, but if you want any real use of a tripod, this isn't a good buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for with this tripod.Yet good deal","review":"I didnt expect much from this tripod despite the reviews at the 17 dollar price tag .

Out of the box I thought this was an awesome product. Looked stable, liked the carrying handle, liked all the levels on it. My old tripod didn't have all these frills. Well last night I decided to try it out to take pictures of my Christmas tree. I had it nice and tight, but when I went to take pictures the connection to the camera and tripod kept on coming loose my camera looked as if it could fall at any moment. I took it off, got it all tight again and put it back on the tripod.I would not recommend this tripod to anyone.

The legs were hard and sticky to get out. The top part of the tripod (where you put your camera on) was very loose (even when it was tightening). The worst part about this tripod is that the single stick that's suppose to come up from the middle will NOT come up at all. I had a $5 tripod at Wal-mart and it worked perfectly fine. Everything was top notched. But this tripod was horrible and it will not work properly. It also had a weird mercury smell to it. I highly recommend getting a different tripod.

One I liked that my previous tripod did not have was the camera base has click-on mechanism, which allows you to perform one hand operation of placing the camera on the tripod.Bad: The plastic molded parts were clearly not finished. There was plastic sticking out at various places. The screw that fixes the camera to the base which is typically metal has a plastic top that looks like it is going to break off.Ugly: 3 days in my use of the tripod, a tiny screw fell of from the tripod and one of the legs completely detached from the tripod. Because of the way the screw was positioned, I could not even use a regular screw driver to put it back in. I had to fashion a small \\"L\\" shaped screw driver just to screw it back on.

Even with this balance issue this tripod holds it great. It may be a bit gracile if one wants to use it with a manual shutter release but with care it should work well. At $18.80 in March 2012 this is a a pretty low cost so it probably is best suited to the casual photographer. If you have a $5,000 camera a $20 tripod may not be your best choice.

So, this book's premise itself is a little tenuous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was very disappointed by this little book. As a student of Buddhism, it left me bored and wanting much more. Sorry, but I just don't like it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Embarrased","review":"I'm embarrased I ever bought this book. Not because I'm some macho badass-I'm not. But just because of the ludicriously trendy CONCEPT of this book: \\"Hey,everybody loves the Buddha...Lets do a book about dating with Budaha in the title!\\" Come on-for one thing Buddhas do NOT date, I think that's right. An another: America's sub and upper cultures have suffered from too much Buddha worship. It's help to make us al passive little zombies. THE END"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great antidote for John Gray and the \\"Rules\\" books","review":"This may not be the best book for people already very familiar with Buddhism. In fact, Kasl also takes spiritual ideas from Sufis and Quakers. No matter. It's about forming relationships based on honesty and openess, creating a real connection based on authenticity - rather than trying to entrap someone. Quite refreshing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"EMPOWERING, and if you're a grrl, read \\"Women, Sex, and Addiction\\"","review":"Kasl's books are amazing, IF YOU ARE ON A SPIRITUAL TIP. Ladies, her earlier book, \\"Women, Sex, and Addiction\\" is the most eye-opening book I've ever read in my life. That is more of a \\"medical therapist\\" book than this one, but an amazing read that changed the way I view all relationships. I truly feel that this is the perfect book to read AFTER reading \\"Women, Sex, and Addiction\\" by Kasl. She is truly a godsend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good","review":"The author(Charlotte Davis Kasl, PhD)'s previous work was so fantastic that I thought I'd give a try on her other books. This didn't come close to her previous work(Finding Joy)but it had some interesting insights. This book is uplifting and made me realize how negative my outlook was toward a relationship and life in general. This book is helping me to be more a positive person. I recommend this book to people who are feeling blue because it can cheer you up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book","review":"This is a great book for someone interested in developing an \\"intimate partnership\\". Seeing the truth is difficult in close relationships, as we often deny the things we see in the name of \\"love\\". Dr. Kasl encourages us to seek the truth in our relationships, and in that way they continue to mature (or fade away naturally with as little pain as possible).I hope to practice dating like the Buddha myself someday!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Useful reading","review":"It is a useful reading with many wise thoughts on personal equilibrium, life, and relationships. I strongly recommend it for those who wish to seriously work on themselves. This book offers the base for beginning a process of in-depth personal development."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mostly helpful","review":"I can see why Buddhists might take offense at the concept of the Buddha dating, but I picked up the book because I suspected it might offer an alternative to the tiresome array of best-selling dating guides that simply feed our insecurities about being single.What I found helpful was that the book *does* foster a certain detachment toward the dating process: not detachment from doing it, but enjoying the experience as \\"a passing show.\\" For me, recently divorced and very anxious, it helped me to be myself and not worry so much about the impression I was making. I also like that it encourages honesty rather than the game-playing that is so often dictated (esp. for women).She nearly lost me, though, when she mentioned astrology and handwriting-analysis. Aaargh!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It ...[stinks].","review":"This is a nicey nice book with very little new to say. Just be yourself in a relationship and take it slow. That's about it.

The only good thing about this book is she turned me on to Quantum Psychology - which I find fascinating. 2 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lessons We all Need","review":"I bought this for a friend, at the suggestion of another friend, and had to read it first.

I'm actually in a relatively new relationship and this book has helped me understand the dynamics of what's going on and decipher the bond being created. As a person who has read lots of love advice, I think this book has the most refreshing take on dating and finding the right mate. Before reading, I read a review that the beginning is a little meh and drawn out. I agree. But if you stick with it, there are some really amazing insights ahead. I will use many of the lessons in this book (and refer back often) forever."},{"rating":"2","title":"If the Buddha was a Reseller","review":"I love this series of books, including \\"If the Buddha Got Stuck\\". It is refreshing to read a down to earth treatment of these topics from the perspective of non attachment and compassion. I was also pleased with delivery of the book as it was described and prompt."},{"rating":"2","title":"Challenge Yourself","review":"This book was recommended to me by one of my best friends. She told me to read it and then go watch the movie Eat, Love, Pray. This book teaches you about \\"coming into yourself\\" if that makes sense. I didn't really read the dating aspects so I can't tell you about relationships. But I do know that by learning yourself, understanding yourself and truly believing you have power within yourself... your relationships can't help but to flourish (as well as many other aspects in your life). If you're not ready for change or looking for answers about your life... do not waste your time reading then, 'cause it won't make sense to you. Oh and if you think Eat Love Pray sucked, just like I did after trying to watch it twice before reading this book... all I can say is... paradigm shift. I now own the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"What a wonderful book. I thoroughly enjoyed it. It is uplifting and gives you a great insight into Buddhism. The book teaches you how to remain more calm and stay aware. There is also some great tips on meditation, such as Tonglin which is nice. I am now living more in the now and can't wait to go back and read it again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great guide to relationships","review":"Although the title may sound strange (or even off-putting) to some browsers, don't be fooled - this is a book for everyone who has trouble with, or who wants to greatly improve, their realtionships. It is written with humour and insight - and you learn about yourself, about friendship and love, about how others respond. I have now bought six copies and given them to friends I am so impressed with the book and what we can learn from it. It is a great read! Try also \\"If the Budda Married . . \\" - another great book of insights and how to make the most challenging of relationships thrive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soap for your Spirit","review":"People used to piss me off. In fact, i've avoided dating for so long just because i can't stand any of the women i've met. This book was perfect for me. Not only did it pinpoint my problem as being overly judgemental of my partners but also if revealed that alot of my problem is actually a problem with myself. I think this book was extremely enlightening and serves as an excellent way to awaken the hidden spirit within yourself. Although it touts itself as a book about dating, it is actually about self-discovery and self-acceptance. In an almost backwards approach to dating, Kasl's mantra is: Fix yourself and all the rest will fall into place.

Members of my family still ask for \\"that great pork loin stuffed with apricots dish from your favorite cookbook!\\"--and I never tire of making it, since the directions are easy to follow and not loaded with fat.

I have the brittle, dry, thick hair genes. On top of that, for the past couple years, my hair was recovering from a bad perm job. So, I needed some hydration for my hair, STAT! Prior to discovering the clay esthe pack, I used various hydrating shampoos and conditioners (both cheap and expensive) that just didn't work for my hair. My hair somehow got even more brittle and experienced more split ends. Then, my friend introduced me to the clay esthe product, and I love it! After using it, I got compliments on how much shinier and healthier my hair looked. I find myself spending little to no time inspecting my hair ends now. I didn't buy the molto bene shampoo, but I've found that any hydrating shampoo works well with the clay esthe. And on the plus side, it smells great and feels great on my hair. For those with very dry, brittle hair, this product is worth a try."},{"rating":"2","title":"I really like this dish.","review":"It is white and wide enough to hold two sticks of butter. When using the top it is hard to cover if you have two sticks on it without gettting butter on the top; they could have solved this one problem easily by making it a little longer.It also cleans up easy and you can wash it in the dishwasher. I like the top too because it is clear and you can see how much butter you have left. It is sturdier than my old glass butter dish, which is a plus, but still breakable so if you have a toddler like me watch out. It is not a bright bright white but more of a white/ivory. Still, it looks good with my white dishes and serving platters and bowls."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ok for casual use!","review":"I wanted something for casual use so didnt want to pay too many bucks.

The big example (a drawing program called Sketcher) is developed over several chapters and is used to demonstrate all sorts of language features including a good intro into Swing. Even though I feel that this is a fairly solid book that I would recommend, I am only giving it 1 star to bias my vote and communicate a message to Wrox: Hire at least one book editor that has some quality standards.

An emotionally haunting tale about a childhood cut short by a tragic event, causing a young man, Joe Scot, to take a twisted trail in his adult life after he runs away. Though the spontaneous path he chooses brings him wealth and fame, it certainly doesn't bring happiness. Joe continues to be running from his past, and himself, until he is forced to look back on his childhood after his best friend dies and he re-visits his memories and the widow; a girl he loved long ago and might have married had fate allowed. A very edgy, heart wrenching drama that will stay with you long after the credits have rolled past. Excellent acting and music! Though the beginning starts out as a semi-porn that will cause some jaws to drop, I promise the story is much, much deeper than just sex.Chrissy K.

It didn't get any better.If you're looking for a crisp, clear story that follows a line of action, this isn't it. \\"Flashbacks Of A Fool\\" made me feel like one for sitting through it twice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stylish film, worth rewatch","review":"I was surprised by Daniel Craig's performance, perhaps because I think of him as Bond. The scene where the dark haired girl receives the letter, and Eve's character are very natural. The story is heart breaking and a stirring portrayal of Craig's character, who plays a washed up \\"has been\\".The film's look is what actually captured my attention. It is very stylized and visually appealing. The story of his return home was very sad, and the music is effective in accelerating the story. It keys in on the various emotions througout the film. Very refreshing to see Craig in this role. Worth a second look for its artistic statements."},{"rating":"2","title":"A warm return...","review":"When all around seems to fall very short, there evolves a nostalgia from the depths of blockbuster lack-lustre. Daniel Craig surprises you with an edgy hark back to the style which suits him so well and, not so surprisingly, afforded him the darker 007 he performs. If you're a Brit from the 70's, then this will sadden you as it brings home just what we had then. At the same time it will also light a old flame of those days, which you may have missed!Attention to detail here makes this a pleasure to watch and with a soundtrack to match, although the soundtrack could have been deeper in volume, rather than reflection. Some nudity and adult scenes, necessary for the context of the plot, which don't offend.A great Sunday afternoon watch and one to recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really bad, but kind of a waste of time","review":"The acting by Daniel Craig is quite good, but he is only in half the film at most. The story just wasn't that compelling and it was depressing at times. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone other than the die hard Daniel Craig lovers out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Literally Flashbacks of a Fool","review":"When I requested the movie, I had no idea the title was literally flashbacks of a fool. That was exactly it though. Joe Scott, played by Daniel Craig, is a washed up Hollywood star, who receives a phone call his childhood friend has died. As Scott travels back to his hometown, he flashes back on the event that lead up to the reason he left.The acting, in my opinion, was phenomenal. There were some who really stood out - Daniel Craig, of course, as well as Eve, who played Scott's personal assistant. There were others like Harry Eden, Olivia Williams, and so many more.My major problem was the ending. Though realistic, it left a bitter taste in my mouth. I really was dissatisfied with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Been There Seen That","review":"This film should be titled Deja Vu of a Fool because I have seen everything before and in better films.Daniel Craig is a burnt out drug out over the hill actor. But when he is informed of the death of his childhood best friend, he flashes back to childhood or his teenhood.Not much of this film is original nor much of it interesting.DVD EXTRAS: Interviews with Cast and Crew (2:30 mins)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hedonist, Examine Thyself","review":"I'm sad to report that this \\"morality tale\\" of a debauched fallen star confronting the emptiness of his life when his childhood friend dies is one of the worst films I've ever seen--pretentious, self-conscious, clumsy, slow paced, not a character that's slightly interesting.The opening shot with a maudlin ballad sounds like a made for TV soundtrack from the 1970s. Attempts at \\"ironic dialogue\\" fall flat. The soundtrack throughout is amateur and sounds like trite 1980s low-budget (except for the opening, which sounds even older).Cluttered with cardboard characters, a script sodden with trite, self-conscious dialogue, overblown cliche scenes like ocean waves crashing, this film should have never been made.Yes, the self-indulgent, nonexamined life is not worth living. But sadly this film is not worth watching."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rated a \\"real\\" R","review":"The idea of the movie was good, I just didn't realize it was rated a real \\"R\\". My fault. To much skin and sex for my taste. Surely someone has enough intelligence to figure out a way to convey a movie without being so visually pornographic. It is okay for a viewer to use their brain and think instead of just observe. And, it would have been more interesting to know if Joe really got his life in a better place, he was certainly trying at the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantasy","review":"This product was very entertaining and exciting.

Besides that, it's a great find and has been very helpful with learning medical language."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Tripod for the Price","review":"For the price this tripod is an amazing value, it does exactly what it claims to. It works perfectly with still cameras, but the head doesn't move smoothly so its a problem when using a video camera, it is fairly sturdy, and has a hook to attach weights when the tripod needs to be weighed down. This tripod is extremely portable, and the carrying bag that comes with it is great, its super light and you barely notice when you have to carry it around. For the price that you can purchase this item, it is definitly worth it, but if you are looking for a tripod for a video camera search elsewhere, the head doesn't move smoothly, which will result in jerky video."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a No-Go","review":"This product broke about two weeks after I got it. The Crank for the top of the camera stopped working, and the plastic easilly chipped, so now it's broken.

It is very flimsily constructed, the center pole regularly comes disconnected, the handle for raising the top bar appears like it will fall off any day. I would not recommend this product.

This is a must have for gamecube!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This games is WEAK!!!!","review":"All this game has is graphics, and that's about it. The controls are horrible, and the gameplay is even worse. It kinda felt like I was watching pee-wee football while playing this game. I must say I was highly disappointed with this game,judging by the excellent job EA did with previous years of the Madden series. Trust me save yourself the money and do not rent or buy this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"So What if it Looks Great?","review":"I paid $6 to rent this game, and even that was a complete waste of money. John Madden annoyingly says the same things after similar plays (so by the second game, you've heard it all), but that's just commentary, that's not that big, right?Well, when I tried to view an instant replay, none of the players showed up, just the ball.When I made a pass, as soon as I threw it, it was called a fumble. I know the rules of football. That was a PASS.The same lame rap song plays during the game and during all menus.The gameplay is aggrevating and was designed poorly for the Gamecube controller.I could go on, but I'm limited here. Its not worth it and it falls way below many of the other great football titles I've played.Avoid this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Madden game without innovation","review":"If you like this game then pick up Madden '98. It's the same game. Decent running game and pass rushing, but everything else falls flat. Stunning graphics, but they don't save this stale game. EA has gotten complacent with mediocrity over the years, which is why games such as the 2k series have taken the throne for sports games. Do yourself a favor and avoid EA's lackluster sports lineup, especially this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"It really stinks","review":"ive played this game before and it is the worst ive ever seen. do yourself a favor and dont waste your time buying because you will be unsatisfied."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad as in terrible","review":"I bought this game for my kids and my husband to play.

My husband a fan of the madden series, but not this one. poorly designed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of all three","review":"I'd expect the developers of this game to know the most about it. EA Canada, the division of Electronic Arts that has developed this game for GCN, PS2, and XBox, has said themselves that the GCN version is the best of the 3. They said that the textures, the lighting, the animation, the framerate, is the best. The modes of play are the exact same, and since the GCN verison is the last to come out, it will have the most recent team changes. The only downside to the GCN version is that the franchise stats only save for one year, rather than five. Not a big deal. If you are loking for a great football game, get Madden 2002. I know I am, along with NFL 2k3 and NFL Blitz next year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"Madden 2002 had way better graphics than the one for Xbox!

The other books are BUILDING A FOUNDATION FOR PRESCHOOL LITERACY, ORAL LANGUAGE AND EARLY LITERACY IN PRESCHOOL, LEARNING ABOUT PRINT IN PRESCHOOL, and USING CHILDREN'S LITERATURE IN PRESCHOOL.

I was genuinely impressed by his tracks and find that there is a fine bit of peace in the music that has not been seen in the vast majority of music in recent years."},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD's Great!","review":"I knew Craig David was a hit with 7 days and Walking Away, But I hear this CD the day I get it and it's a Smash. When David come's to the States, I am getting tickets. The remixes are excellent. I enjoyed the whole CD. This is my kind of music. Mr. David you read this...Keep it up if you are born to do it again, then do it again, again...and AGAIN!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ready for some new stuff?","review":"Craig David is new on the scene to Americans, but I expect with his tight beats and smooth singing, this guy will get attention. With all of the R&B on the radio right now, it all seems so recylcled and old compared to this new sound brought to us from a freshman to the scene(who has already been noticed in the U.K.). This album is hot, the 2 songs that caught me were 7 DAYS and FILL ME IN, I still can't get enough of them. The rest of the album is down too, you'll be stuck to it...trust me."},{"rating":"1","title":"SOUNDS LIKE KEE-RAP!!!","review":"I was very excited when this came out since it was the first Slade collection to contain all of their UK chart hits. Imagine my surprise when I listened to it and discovered that the sound was awful! I thought this set was supposed to be remastered, but it sounds worse that any other Slade cd I own. What happened here? Did I get a bum copy? Fortunately, all of Slade's albums are now getting the deluxe treatment and are being remastered with bonus tracks along with a 4-cd boxset coming out in the fall. Until then, I guess I'm stuck with this sonically inept travesty."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible awful very bad clock","review":"If I could rate it zero stars, I would.First off, it arrived broken.

For those of us who grew up in the area and who have treasured memories of Kennywood, this is like having a family album around the house."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why write it?","review":"The fascination with or against Byron is a natural response... but why the good Benita would have spent ten years on a subject she is so cool about is a puzzle.There is no new information in the Eisler book except a retelling of other's tales and the settling of certainty on any malignant gossip ever piled on Byron to extinguish him as a political contender.There are many well- written books on Byron with better love of accuracy.The Marchand biography is a good reference but within three volume it fails to capture the essence of a man and leaves us with a mere shadow. Anything written by Malcolm Elwin, John Chapman, Ashley Hay, Drinkwater, Thomas Moore, Doris Langley Moore is a better read than Eisler and the general biographers of the 1990's and the 21st century. Lady Longford's Byron is better written than the more recent dishes.And in the end do you want to know a man? Know then his feelings and views first-hand: read his poetry. Discover his charm for yourself, unabridged."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less Than One Star, But I Can't Put That, Apparently","review":"Please do not buy this book. As an academic whose specialty area is Lord Byron, I urge you to avoid this sensationalist and poorly written work at all costs. It is, aside from anything else, full of small mistakes regarding dates, etc. If you are looking for a reliable recent biography of Byron, buy the Fiona Macarthy book before you buy this one. If you are willing to spend more and hunt more, and don't mind a book that, because of the time when it was written, scants the issue of Byron's complex sexual tastes, the undoubted go-to bio is Leslie Marchand's three volume work from 1957. Old, but still the best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sensationalism","review":"Sadly, the recent biographic trend on Byron has been to concentrate more on his sexuality than on the fullness of his life. This follows that trend slavishly, it reaches for sensationalism and fails to reveal the poet. It is a glossy superficial biography that appears thinly researched and accepting of much rumor as fact.Serious students of Byron should avoid and seek out the much more balanced and accurate Marchand biography."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull as Dirt","review":"Another book about Byron, I thought when I saw this. Hmm. Have their been new discoveries? Does the author have new interpretations? No, I realized as I read this book. Despite all the juicy details of Byron's erotic adventures, this book is the dullest volume I've picked up in some time. It's the details. They weigh the story down, and it wasn't clear to me why the author thought this book needed to be written at all. She certainly included everything she researched but nothing is new and nothing is fresh in the telling. Byron comes off as despicable and self-absorbed, which is probably ok--no doubt he was horrid--but the author also makes him sound boring, which I bet he wasn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"best book ever","review":"I have known Ed since we were in pre-school. the man knows what he's talking about. buy this book and learn from the jedi master of slackers."},{"rating":"1","title":"zzz....boring","review":"Okay, this flick was good for a playboy movie...however it was boring.

Most of them are ok when had with milk or soy milk, but not that good when had with plain water. After a strenous workout, the best way have to have a protein shake is with water, since that is the fastest delivery mechanism.The fruit blast protein shake, is a whey isolate, which means its absorbed faster than plain whey protein by the body. It mixes pretty well with water and tastes pretty good too. I have been using this product for the last 3-4 months and feel its a great bargain for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the taste!","review":"This is my go to protein especially for post-workout.

It turns out it is not for me... at all. Compared to something like Isopure, I seriously have an aversion to this, and I am not that picky. (I tried to stay open-minded and tried to like it over several days. I shudder now just thinking of it. In the end it got where I couldn't even swallow it anymore.) Tastes a bit like raspberry milk of magnesia. I know, right? Just wanted to put my two cents out there. If you are thinking of purchasing based on good reviews of the flavor, maybe try to get a sample first.. or order the smallest possible amount. For me this purchase was a HUGE mistake.. but everyone's tastes are different."},{"rating":"2","title":"4Ever Fit Whey Isolate, Fruit Blast, Cranrazz","review":"This is a great tasting protein powder, even mixed with plain water. I like the fact that it is produced through a combination of cross-flow ultrafiltration and advanced microfiltration for an easily absorbed form of whey. However, it didn't mix up instantly as was advertised. I found it necessary to use a stick blender to prevent lumps of undissolved powder.As for cost effectiveness, it was a good deal to supplement my protein intake since I bought it on sale, but probably wouldn't buy it again at the full price of $69.95."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent flavor, poor quality powder","review":"I ordered this product because I've never been a fan of \\"traditional\\" whey flavors (vanilla, chocolate, etc). The flavor was ok, but this stuff foams up like a son-of-a-gun! The only way I could keep from nearly having to strain the foam out is to stir it slowly with a spoon in a glass...which defeats the purpose of my portable blender-bottle, or using my full size blender to add in other ingredients.I used it for about a week, then went to a local nutrient store to get something else.

But this volume is chock-full of awesome stories, and will not disappoint readers. My absolute favorite story was 'Three Septembers and...' about Emperor Norton. I had thought he was fictional, but then found out that he was real. Kudos to Mr. Gaiman for spinning off a fantastic little tale, and Norton's end was bittersweet. Overall a fantastic volume."},{"rating":"2","title":"The medium of comic books has finally reached its potential","review":"The Sandman series is comic books as high literature and high art.

I would never fall in love with this opera based on this recording, the way I did when I heard Rene Jacobs' recording (Harmonia Mundi France #901330), which is much more sensuous and lyrical than Harnoncourt's and makes the love story of this opera sound like one.

I have yet to take a picture with the camera on this where it is not blurry (due to shake). I do not have a remote for my camera, but with the camera mounted to the tripod, I always use the delayed timer, so I am not touching the camera or tripod to take a picture.

Well, that's exactly what happened. I took Malcolm's ideas and started incorporating them into all my talks, classes, and speeches. It seems that overnight, I was being complimented more and more, and I myself feel that my speeches have much more \\"pizzaz\\" - but not only. They also are more well-built, educational, and get my points across fast. Malcolm Kushner's book is also very humorous.

First, no illustrations of the excercises since I forgot what some were( and he gives them crazy names too) , secondly, he just devotes a couple of paragraphs to \\"rah, rah you can do it\\" philosophy and nutrition. The book ends up being book of charts to check off as you go thru his \\"program\\". Then he pitches some supplements he obviously owns thru a company. Very disappointing...not up to the SEAL creed of performance I say.And he doesn't include swimming in the program. Do yourself a favor..don't waste you money.

And, for the record, I've read 316 of them to date.This series started out less than stellar for me and this book just nose dives almost into unreadability. The story lines are less than interesting and take forever to get through. There is minimal space action and minimal alien action. It's not really fair to classify this as a Star Trek book. Having completed the entire series, I also fail to see where this book added much to the overall story.If you are a bit obsessive like I am and simply must read the book to mark it off as \\"read\\", do so with the understanding that, by the end of the book, you'll be glad you didn't have a phaser available or you may have ended it all in a final burst of energy.

As for the vent hole in the shrink wrap to which another reviewer refers, I have seen this type of hole in the plastic shrink wrap before and they are no bigger than a single hole punched in paper for a three ring binder. I suspect it is a vent to release any humidity created in the manufacturing process so that rust doesn't form. I'm pretty sure that a huge manufacturer like Denso is not going to intentionally put a hole in the plastic cover reckless to the fact that their filters will become engine bombs because of it.So I'm putting my money with Denso and I just bought one of their Denso 150-1013 oil filters for my next oil change. I like the idea of using a bigger filter compared to the tiny Honda one. It just makes sense - more filtering media should result in better filtration and the ability to flow greater oil flow.

This memoir is so shallow after all that is said and done. The person that told him to make it light, was not doing him a favor. I'm sure he has more talent! The only interesting character in this book is a guy named Francisco, who actually likes the men he sleeps with. Even the \\"nasty\\" ones. A book about Francisco's hustling experiences would be more compelling in my view. Rick's character is as aimless as his writing. By the end of his story, you feel little for him. And you imagine that he'll be drugging and cruising sometime in the near future. Well, maybe the fact that he's ageing and balding will put the brakes on that notion!

The writing is competent, but nothing new; when the author complains about not being able to sell his novel, one can't help but think that he was already planning this memoir as he was turning tricks. And even that could have been interesting, but the overall effect of the this book is one of numbing indifference, but perhaps that is the effect that hustling has had on this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Demons made me do it","review":"Short and an easy read.

Since each workout is about 30 minutes,if you have the time, you can easily tag either 10-15 minutes of extra cardio or strength/weight training and get a really nice intense workout in a still relatively short period of time. Jillian knows her stuff, works your core, and I am so glad that I discovered these dvds.

Jillian Michaels will yell at you about not giving up for the last 10 minutes, just when you want to turn the dvd off and take a rest on the couch!

I have kept it up even after the thirty days, I just alternate weeks 3 and 4 and throw in some No More Trouble Zones and 30 day Shred and 6W6pack. I didn't follow the eating plan to a T, but used a lot of suggestions from it.

There's a modifier in each workout to help you if you're not up to doing the full exercise yet. I love how Jillian motivates you to get through the workouts.

I like the format of this dvd and although I'm not all of the way thru the levels, I like the combination of moves and her promise not to repeat moves from level to level. Classic JM circuit training, so be prepared to work! Level 1 seemed a little easy, as I usually do all of her level 3 workouts. I wanted to try this for the full 30 days though and see what type of a workout it gave me. Level 2 has come challenging moves.

At the end of the month, I felt awful. I did not feel good. I've since stopped doing this one. It will sit on my shelf and collect dust.

I'm in pretty good shape, but I worked hard to finish it and was even a bit sore the next day in my glutes and hamstrings (yay!). I was also motivated to keep doing the workout and move through the weeks. Really good for a short workout. Jillian is a nice mix of tough, funny, inspirational, and high energy. If you want a sweet girl coaxing you into working out, this ain't for you. If you want someone cool to push you through a short but intense workout, she's your woman. I watched week 2 and it looked good too.BUT, when I tried to preview week 3 and 4, there was nothing to watch. Apparently no one put those files on this particular DVD.

Do I feel \\"ripped\\" yet, no...but I feel better about myself, and I just have to convince myself that this is a slow process. Once finished with week 4, I will redo the dvd with the more advanced moves and see if I get ripped then.

Glad to know it's a good DVD, but disappointed that I paid for it and can't use it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jillian Micheals videos","review":"I like Jillian Micheals but the workout routines in the videos are very extreme. To me the routines are too hard for home video use. I injured my knee once trying to keep up with the pace. I try it again after I healed slowly and injured my knee once again."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing dvd","review":"if you are looking for a good workout this is the dvd for you. im so glad i bought it and i am on week 4 and ripped i am. i was getting bored doing the same workout video daily. this is 4 different workouts that are grueling but only 20 minutes so i suck it up and deal with it. love this dvd!!!!!!! buy it you wont be sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"great workout","review":"I would receommend this dvd to anyone who loves Jillian Michaels, it a great workout along with every other workout dvd she has ever created."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT WORKOUT!!!","review":"This is definitely one of my favorite workouts from her - and believe me, I have them ALL. She introduces new moves that aren't in previous DVD's. I could probably do without her snark remarks about the other girls asses and the quarter test and the biting, but I try not to pay attention. She is my favorite trainer I love the aggressiveness she has. The workouts are 25 mins - perfect for me (a full time worker during the day, full time mom at night to two little ones!). I have to workout after they go to bed, and this workout is no joke! I'm soaked and shaking by the end but feel amazing! I am on week two, lost about 4-5 lbs but you must diet with this! Don't ruin all the hard work with crappy eating!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"I am shocked! I bought this for fun workout to alternate with my trips to the gym (I have been trying to lose 15 lbs) Long story short - this workout whipped me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Workout!","review":"This is the first Jillian Michaels workout video that I have purchased. I am a big fan of Jillian after watching her on the Biggest Loser, so I had high hopes - and she didn't let me down! I consider myself intermediate to advanced, but found myself using many of her modifiers because the moves are so tough and my heart rate was elevated throughout the workouts. I followed it through the 4 weeks faithfully and can definitely see results. I plan to go back through week by week, but first I plan to purchase other videos that she has done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many new moves!","review":"I have done Jillian's 30 Shred and found this product to have too many moves forced into such a short time. The yoga moves were too rushed, she rotated between moves too quickly, and frankly I felt like I couldn't concentrate on form and quality and was being pushed towards injury. I have returned to the Shred and also added Tony Horton to the mix. What's up with those girls helping her out anyway?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Please STOP TALKING!!!","review":"I'm sure this is an excellent exercise plan, but I never got past the first five minutes of any of the four workouts because Jillian Michaels NEVER SHUTS UP. She's not funny or clever and it's just too damn annoying to listen to her prattle on and on for me to use this DVD. A waste of money for me. If you have no patience for Jillian's attitude, pass on this one. I prefer Amy Dixon's style--doesn't yell at you or try to be amusing all the time. Still a challenge, but sweet and helpful rather than abrasive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inappropriate","review":"The video has inappropriate language and behavior. She starts off the week one workout using the a** word to describe one of the girls. Later, about 1/3 of the way into the week 1 workout, she has the girl she called an a** put her head into Jillian's clevage to speak into her mic. Not sure what else happens in the video, turned the video off before week 1 workout was done. Not going to subject my self to the inappropriate language and behavior just to work out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great Jillian workout!","review":"I have all of Jillian's dvds and couldnt wait to get this one, after having trouble finding it in store, I ordered it & finally received it 3 days ago. I dont like to do the same workout day after day, so Ive been alternating level 1 and level 2 so far and Jillian has once again created a great workout that works the entire body in a short period of time. I love that I can get a great workout in about 30 minutes & with the 3-2-1 program the workout goes by quickly. I enjoyed 30 day shred, but like this one so much more! I cant wait to try the other dvds she has coming out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely worth the sweat!","review":"As an avid \\"workoutaholic,\\" I am always skeptical about whether or not a workout will truly challenge me. Well...after only week 2 of this dvd, I am no longer skeptical about JM's promised to kick butt! I can only imagine what the week 4 workout will do to my muscles. This dvd is awesome because it gives you 4 workouts that progress in level of difficulty, and JM always provides modifications for each move. So, basically, there is no excuse for not being able to do each workout. She's also quite entertaining, which helps you work through your sweat. If you want to challenge your body to reach its potential, buy this dvd!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Level 4 rocks!","review":"I've been doing DVD work outs all my life. Started purchasing vcr work out tapes.........30 yrs. and 5 kids later, my collection of work out tapes, dvds would make your head spin! Anyway...Still a size 6 but I have problem areas like saddlebags and flabby arms that make me insane. The level one work out was no problem for me. Level two was a workout, but still I could probably do it twice in a row and survive. Level 3 I was sweating profusely by the end of the warm up and was exhausted when it was over. Level four is where Jillian loses her mind. This workout is so intense I had to stop and take breaks. LOVE Jillian and her instruction! Overall Ripped is full of cardio and toning moves! Love it Love it Love it! FINALLY I found an dvd that that makes me question, do I really need to get on my elliptical now?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great workout- esp on mute","review":"I would have given this DVD 5 stars however Jillian Michaels herself made me give it 4 instead. I'm a HUGE fan of 30 day shred and honestly like Jillian in that workout. In this workout though, it's like the fame has gone to her head. It's almost comical listening to her trying to be \\"gangsta\\". But I digress...besides this annoying fact, the workout itself the way she has set up is great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't try this if you are a beginner","review":"As a beginner I wanted a short but effective workout. Although I liked the workouts on this DVD, but I was left with terrible backaches even though I only did the modified versions. Some of the moves I couldn't do at all. I wouldn't recommend this for a beginner at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jillian Kicks Your Butt!!!","review":"My husband and I gave ourselves 5 weeks to complete the program (adding in an extra week 3 workout). We tried best we could to stick to her 1600 calorie diet and worked out 4-5 times a week. After the 5 weeks, I lost 10 lbs and 2.5 inches around my hips and my husband lost 14 lbs and 2 inches around his hips! Now if that isn't results I don't know what is!!! We both went down one pant size. Make sure you take before and after pictures because she kicks your butt!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT!!","review":"I LOVE Jillian's DVD's. This one has 4 weeks of different workouts to gradually work up to although week 1 is not as easy as one might think. LOL! This video has great versatility and is very effective if done consistently. This is also a pretty short workout for people with limited time. She says it's 20 minutes but I think it's about 30 with the warm ups and cool downs. I love Jillian's stuff mostly because she works EVERY single part of your body & not just one area. This is a great workout. I have 3 of her DVD's which I rotate. I really recommend it. If you are a motivated person, she will kick your butt into gear! I have been alternating her DVD's for 7 weeks now and I cannot believe the difference in my body as far as toning & shaping. She's amazing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent DVD","review":"I absolutely love this DVD. If you are a beginner def start with week one and continue doing week one until you can do week two. Its not easy. I usually do level 2 or 3 (trying to get to 4) and then I combine this with six pack abs. You honestly do not need the gym with Julian Michaels DVD's. She is not the easiest trainer. I am in decent shape, but due to previous back surgery and medications I gained tons of weight. Sometimes with my schedule its hard to get to the gym so I tried her DVDs and they work! I have been slowly getting back to doing hard core aerobics and have even managed to have less back pain bc my core is firmer and my knees and legs ache less due to my weight loss. I highly recommend this to those that do not make excuses and are willing to put the work. U do not need a gym or lots of money to be in shape. Try this DVD. its great and quick. Others that are good are 6 week six pack abs, no more trouble zones, and Banish Fat Boost Metabolism! GOOD LUCK"},{"rating":"2","title":"work","review":"This DVD is well worth the price! The workouts are hard, but only 30 minutes. You can easily make time for this work out. There is no time wasted and you get four workouts that you can switch between.

It's so worth it"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favs!","review":"In my opinion, this is one of Jillians best videos. It kind of reminds me of the 30DS, but these workouts flow a lot better and keep my attention. I have only done week 1 and 2 because I got pregnant shortly after I bought it, but even at 32 weeks pregnant I still am able to do week 1 and get a great workout (with some modifications)."},{"rating":"2","title":"You can't bet a JM workout!.","review":"This DVD is frickin crazy! It got me into the best shape ever bearing in mind I NEVER got past Level 2!.The reason for that was I'm just set in my on little ways. I set to workout 6 days a week and if I only did 4 that was no good, so had tostart Week 1 again and again lol!. Think the word I'm looking fir us ISSUSES!. That said I obtained a rocking body and for less than 30mins so who cares!.The only thing I did not like about this DVD is that it gave my upper body a manly boxy shape. Wish I could work out which exercises to leave out in order to not get that shape. My weights are extremely low I'm talking 1.5kg Max. I NEVER use weights normally which is why my body responded well to themAny suggestions what I do to avoid getting that shape as I'm going to do this DVD again.All in all an excellent DVD which delivers awesome results!."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hardcore workout","review":"I just recently started doing some of jillian's dvd's The first one I used was from biggest loser collection and the the kettlebell workout. This is the third one I have used and I love it. The workout are great. I like the fact she gives modifications for some of the exercises. I usually don't use them but when tired I do. She keeps the workout fresh and exciting. I also like the fact that she jokes around with the other people. Anyone interested in losing weight and improving strenth needs this dvd. Another job well done Jillain!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweating Buckets","review":"This workout was thrilling it got my adrilline running so much that I did the first week 3 times!! Awesome!! My whole back and shoulders were wet with sweat I never had it happen like this!!

I got inside my own head on week 3. it has taken me 5 weeks to get to week 4. only because im a creature of habit. results were fast. upper body and mid section noticeable end of week 3. 140lbs to 132 lbs in 4 -5 weeks. not \\"ripped\\" but definite major changes!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love me some Jillian!","review":"After doing 30DS, NMTZ, and 6W6P I thought I'd try Jillians Ripped in 30. Yes she did it again! Week one was pretty easy and slow for me because I'm intermediate/advanced in terms of exercise, so I skipped it and went right to week 2. I also stayed with the different levels longer than a week. I really enjoy the short workouts filled with a lot of work. I like to get in and get out and this workout does that! However, the reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because I prefer more cardio (like level 2 of her 6W6P). Did I get ripped in 30? I don't know. I didn't see much of a change, but I felt great after working out with it! Overall I would recommend this over and over again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tough, but gets results","review":"I'm a huge fan of Jillian's workouts, and this is one of the most effective ones I've purchased. I find the four workout system to be very effective, and it also keeps things from getting boring.I wouldn't say that this workout is for beginners, but you certainly don't need to be crazy-advanced to do it. If you ARE a beginner, start out with 30 Day Shred and then try this one. If you're diligent with it, you'll get good results, even if you do the modifications for every single move."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ripped in 30","review":"I don't have any complaints with the workouts. They are tough which is what I wanted. The problem is each time the DVD is started I have to go back and say \\"no\\" to the sub-titles. It's a waste of time when you only have a limited amount of time to get your workout done. The DVD should be set up in a way that you do not get the sub-titles UNLESS you choose to have them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent video - not for beginners","review":"Varied, very tough video.

My clothes was not fitting as it use to and was in between sizes! I have done other videos, some being ok but this is the best one ever! It truly transformed my body back to normal. I alternated with running, so do want to put that out there. But the changes in my arms, my waist and legs as well as abs, was all Ripped in 30! You will not be dissapointed! I cant wait for Jillian's new release. I am trying now to figure out what to do next, after this amazing program. It will be almost impossible to top it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kicked my butt!","review":"I have almost all of Jillian Michaels' fitness dvds and consider myself to be in good physical shape, but this workout took it up a notch.

I'm going to start week four workout tomorrow, and I have to admit, I'm a bit nervous!"},{"rating":"2","title":"J.M. Ripped in 30","review":"Great workout - even though there's no way this 64 yr old, un-conditioned body can do all these exercises as illustrated, I can certainly do what I can in following the workout which is challenging, to say the least, and since its far above my capabilities at this time, there is room to grow and there are challenges to be conquered. I'm enjoying the exercise and I'm excitedly anticipating the positive changes in this body in 6 months' time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love, love, love it","review":"Love this video and would highly recommend it.

You will be tired afterwards."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great workout","review":"This is a very hard workout and you will sweat!! I was exhausted after and consider myself in pretty good shape. Was looking for something to do at home when I can't go outside to run or bike and my weight training off days. I bought several of her workout DVDs and money well spent. She is a great motivator, talks you through the moves and keeps you going but also has the option of music only. Her workout DVDs are a perfect adddition for anyone's workout schedule."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very annoying","review":"Although jillian's exercises are always good and challenging, she is really full of herself in this DVD. She constantly talks about what a tough trainer she is, rather than just encouraging everyone to work hard. And I really get sick of her flirtatious behavior with the people doing the workout. I'll give this one away and stick with the 30 day shred."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jillian Will Kick Your Butt","review":"I absolutely love this dvd. It's a great workout. I have been riding a bike 6 days a week for 40 minutes so I thought I was in pretty decent shape. I was wrong!! Jillian kicked my butt...big time! My legs were incredibly sore for 2 days after. But you know what, I loved it! If you want a great workout, buy this dvd!"},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent video","review":"This is a hard kick butt video.

I like to combine two of the four workouts for a little extra but certainly one workout on it's own will get you where you want to be!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another kickbut workout","review":"Jillian Michaels proves once again why she is the best trainer in the business. This latest DVD is a combo of the majority of her other DVD's so if you have her other one's this one will come as no surprise. However, if you are new to Jillian, then prepare yourself for the best workout you can get at home. I really love how this one is broken down into different weeks to get you going, or you can be insane, and just jump into week 3! But why do that?! Doing this a few times a week in conjunction with her other DVD's will leave you feeling like you were at the gym for hours. All that's needed in this is a mat and a set of dumbbells and you are ready to get moving."},{"rating":"2","title":"jillian michales dvd 3 2 1 workout","review":"Great workout dvd.

It's quick and fun, and I can get it done during nap time. I might change this to a 5 star once I am done with the full four weeks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked this program!","review":"Jillian's workout is 3 circuits of 3 types of excercise- 3 min of Strength, 2 minutes of cardio and 1 minute of abs per cirucit. It is great that she does not do a lot of repetitive exercises either. Each circuit has different moves and routines. I have completed the 30 days and am currently on round 2. I also like that it is only 18 minutes of actual workout--that works for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh...","review":"I have to agree with others. Her ego is ridiculously huge in this DVD and she never shuts up. It was really hard to make it through 30 days. I like that she has moderators. The workouts are intense but are overshadowed by her rudeness and constant talks about nothing that matters. I had a better experience with her Kickboxing Fastfix. I am looking to try her Banish Fat, Boost Metabolism and No More Trouble Zones soon but Ripped in 30 is in the closet as a back-up for real hard times...if that!Sorry, this DVD was not tolerable on any level."},{"rating":"2","title":"jillian michaels ripped in 30","review":"that was really qcuk to receive this item. i was really surprised.this was for my friend birthday present.she will love it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great workout!!!","review":"This is a great workout series for people who want to spend 30 minutes or less per day.

I think she said that it's a 20-minute workout, plus warmup and cool down.

I refuse to workout on weekends. This is a great workout. Even after 3 months of it, I still end up dripping sweat and feeling it. As far as loosing weight goes, I really don't know since I don't keep track of my weight. I can say that my clothes fit better in about 2 weeks and I just plain felt healthier. As far as anything said on the CD, I don't know because I turn the sound off and listen to music at volumes reserved for jet air planes and Ozzy Osbourne concerts. I'll be using this one for a long time to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Jillian workout yet!!!","review":"This DVD is not for the faint of heart. It is quite challenging and you'll be pouring sweat after just a few minutes. I've made it through all four levels, though I've only done level 4 once. I'd say that level 1 done with 8lb handweights is the best overall workout on the DVD. If you're looking for an intense 30-min workout that hits all the right places, this is the one for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Home workout","review":"This is harder than it looks but WILL get you in shape fast !

My body looks and feels significantly better, I feel stronger, and I've already lost 5 lbs.I haven't tried many other workout DVDs but I must say that I love this one. The moves are very flexible and range from novice to advanced. For every move she offers a novice alternative and provides great instruction on doing the moves correctly to achieve the maximum results.After I go through a workout once, the next time I turned the volume down and put on my favorite music!

When my kids get ready to start a family, I'll give them each a copy. (I just hope they're still making cassette players then :) )One of the big lessons was how to associate consequences with behavior without generating a lot of fighting/drama. Setting ground rules in advance and then adhering to them really works in avoiding fights down the road. I think it also teaches kids to understand that their actions have consequences - they learn limits and they also learn not to be spoiled.

In fact, they're so helpful that my teacher used the outlines from the study guide instead of making up his own."},{"rating":"1","title":"an okay book for beginners","review":"simplistic and to the point. not necessarily a bad thing in a book about writing, but Writing Horror seemed specifically geared towards people who are *considering* writing horror, rather than those who are actually doing it.also, the book itself is pretty cheaply made. i dropped it (at a distance of about 2 feet) and the binding split."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for the novice","review":"I'm glad I purchased this book. It's basically a \\"beginners\\" book for anyone considering writing horror fiction. I've taken writing classes, but none that specifically focus on the horror genre. I want to write horror short-stories, and that's the main focus of the book. Belkom gives great advice and examples of the various ways to start a story, how to decide if your tale is best suited to short story, novel, etc... He also talks about dialogue, and many other things the novice horror writer should be concerned with - format, story ideas, and characterization just to name a few. I think it could've gone a little more in-depth on most of the topics, but that's my only complaint."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must!","review":"Writing horror is a must for any horror fan and aspiring writer. It asnwers EVERY question one might have about the craft of writing and about the process of selling and publishing a story/novel.Van Belkom, who has written more than 150 published short stories and some very amazing novels, takes the genre apart to teach his readers the bare bones of horror writing. Everything is touched upon; from the provenance of ideas, to the actual writing (grammar, techniques, and dos and don'ts), selling, publishing, revising, finding an agent... You get it all in this book.This wonderful book answered all the questions I had about the process of writing horror, and I'm sure it will do the same for any aspiring writer. It is a great reference book that any writer should keep close to his/her writing desk, as you'll keep coming back to it whenever you have a question that needs answering."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great, Practical Reference","review":"Edo van Belkom is no stranger to genre writing. He's sold 160 short stories, 4 novels, and numerous non-fiction pieces. He knows his stuff.Writing Horror is a lean, mean practical guide, written in a friendly, earnest style. Van Belkom lays it all out for you: POV, sub-genres, submission format, market advice, etc. Perhaps the most enjoyable aspect of this guide is the interview with current genre writers like Gary Braunbeck and Doug Clegg.All-in-all an indispensable book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Prevent and Treat Diabetes with Natural Medicine","review":"This is not the same book that was advertised, little if anything is mentioned about using natural medicines.the titles are of the books are similar, the copy I received is \\"How to Prevent, treat and self-manage Diabetes and related complications (2nd edition), by M. K. Ansari.I don't know if they are one and the same book, if so I am very disappointed, would not recomend this book for those looking for natural options."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good information,clearly demonstrated","review":"Danny Gill is an excellent player and teacher. Tons of great licks over a C minor rock-blues. Danny is a very clean player and my only critique would be that his playing somewhat lacks the rhythmic nuances that Jimmy Page is (in)famous for. No tab, but I believe one learns more effectively without the tab, as it makes the student actually listen to the phrases, and commit them to memory. I have about 15 of these Quick Licks DVD's and I believe they are the best on the market. The Larry Carlton, Yngwie, Steve Vai, and Jeff Beck DVD's are my personal faves. There is much quality knowledge to be gleaned from these great learning tools!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Petey","review":"I use this novel in my 7th grade language arts class. In it, there is a great lesson on how important is is to know someone and not to judge based on appearances. The story revolves around Petey Corwin, a man born with severe cerebral palsy in 1920. As we read, we follow him through his early life in a mental institution to his later days in a nursing home. His condition leaves him with extremely limited communication skills and virtually no control over his physical movement, but his life touches those who take the time to know him. There are many moments when my students (even the boys) have emotional reactions to what is being read. (Anyone that teaches middle school knows how difficult a task that can be!)There is no teacher's guide available that I can find, but creating discussion points and activities was not difficult at all. This novel is full of possibilities!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Petey","review":"Petey was a great book because, it showed us how we take things for granted and taught some lessons. This is why I liked the book Petey. We take so many things for granted that when people like Petey do them, they are amazed. One of the lessons I think this book teaches is that you cant judge a book by its cover. When people first met Petey they were a little scared and ignored him. This is why Petey was scared himself. After a little while spent with him, they loved him. This was a great book to read and I had a good time reading it. Petey is a book that should be read and shared with everyone. It can be very sad at times. When he was younger, it was a very sad part of the book. Petey was a wonderful book and I would read it again and again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Petey","review":"This is an amazing story. I loved this book. If you like books with a lot of action you probably wouldn't like this though. It's a little slow, but if you don't mind that it's a wonderful book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great book from Mikaelsen","review":"Again, Mikaelsen has written a great book!

Granted, it had a very interesting premise, the treatment of the disabled in the early 1900s, but the characters, especially Petey, were two-dimentional and unbelievable, and the tone of the book was sappy and sentimental. I couldn't relate to the narrator at all. I wouldn't reccomend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah.","review":"OK. How do I start this off? So I was forced to read this book for 8th grade Language Arts. The plot is a good one, if Ben Mikaelsen could write. His writing if for 5th graders, however uses vocabulary for 9th graders. He doesn't describe some important parts in Peteys life and put to many characters into the book which causes confusion when he doesn't describe them. Please, save yourself the money and buy To Kill A Mockingbird instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"it's sad, but wicked good","review":"Petey is a guy that has cerebral palsy. His parents sold everything they had to pay for the hospital bills. People thought that he was retarded so they sent him to Warm Springs Insane Asylum. His best friend Calvin, Owen, Cassie, Joe, and Trevor were the only ones who really understood him. I thought this was an awesome book to read and I recommend it to anyone because people need to not judge a book by its cover and learn from it, like what happened to Petey."},{"rating":"2","title":"Petey Review By a Northwest School Student","review":"Petey really opened my eyes to the life of someone with Celebral Palsy. I think that the conflicts that go on between Petey and society are really true. The fact that the glaring eyes that stare at him don't bother him is a special trait. Before I read this book I would have looked at Petey in the same way that Trevor looked at Petey the first time he saw him. (Trevor was scared of Petey and didn't want to spend time with him because it was awkward). I thought about how many times people may have been misdiagnosed for the worst. At first I didn't see how you could fall in love with a man talking gibberish, but as the book went on I grew to like Petey. I think that Ben Mikaelsen uses a descriptive writing style. If everyone who didn't like crippled people read this book, I think they would change their mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"No time to enjoy it","review":"Got the product, with an expiration date of 2 days after I received the product.

Understand perishable, but not something that is unedible."},{"rating":"2","title":"The only game worth the cost.","review":"This is the only game I have purchased in the last 5 or 10 yrs which was worth the cost. I like fast paced, action games with lots of shooting and variety of weapons & ammo.I like to explore and this has fantastic areas to explore, usually filled with bad guys. Some puzzles/problems to solve, yet I didn't spend all evening on one scene, trying to figure how to get beyond it. Challenging in parts, yet never boring or bogged down. I recommend it without reservation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Serious Sam is a trip... and LSD trip...","review":"I was just looking for a shoot-em-up game and this one was good. But, like many of the games, you have to shoot the opponent a zillion times to make sure they're dead...

This one is worth the money..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Correction to Leo C Robinson's Review","review":"Reviewer does not have his information correct.Serious Sam 1 and 2, by Croteam, does NOT use the Quake 3 Engine. Serious Sam (1) was originally merely a tech demo for a graphical engine, now known as the \\"Serious Engine\\". The game was later built around this engine, when the engine proved to be so popular and impressive. Serious Sam 2 uses a modified/extended version of this engine."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Top Gun!!","review":"I've played alot of video games but I can say straight off that this has been one of the best I have ever played.Why do I say that?Well the great graphics,sound,gameplay,intense immersion and challenge aside,this is one of the few games I own that I keep coming back to play again....and AGAIN!Both of the incarnations of Serious Sam(1 & 2)are on the same high quality scale of the first person shooter genre and rate very high marks indeed.Croteam the creators of the Serious Sam phenom were to release a third and final game to end the series but to date this unfortunately has not come to pass.But I'll continue to keep my fingers crossed and on the trigger ready and waiting for that day when Mental and his minions challenge us once again to a battle to the death.A game no true gamer should be without in his collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long loading times","review":"First of all I watched all the demos in this game and I have to say I just couldn't wait to get a new game started. Then when the game started to load it took for at least half an hour to load and when it was finished the game went blank screen.

Just look at the disk when you get to the car and don't be like me and miss all of the action."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent game for price","review":"this is a good game in fact both are! I got mine on e-bay for 20$for both. Just buy both and it will keep you distracted from therest of this annoying world for a time."},{"rating":"2","title":"What's with all the bad reviews?","review":"What does the game have to do with some people's inability to configure or troubleshhot their PC?This game deserves 5 stars, ESPECIALLY because of the price. Everyone already said everything about the graphics, so no need to repeat it.I stopped playing shooters because I like single player mode (can't stand playing on the web, where half the people cheat). This game brought it back for me.If you are a person, who spends 18 hrs a day playing FPS's, you will probably find many things wrong with this game (just like you do with all the others). If you're just looking for Serious fun - it'll be the best 19.99 you ever spent on the game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally Serious about Sam","review":"This is an addition to the game that everyone needs. The second encounter is chalked full of new weapons enemies galore, and, of course, the typical Sam witticisms. It is what you would expect from Serious Sam; none stop gratuitous violence, great scenery, and quality grasphics. I would gladly recommend this game to anyone that likes FPS (First Person Shooter) games."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice Height, Poor Legs","review":"This tripod seemed to be very nice... Until we tried to extend the legs all of the way. Two and a half of the legs worked well, the third had a section that would not stay extended. The locking devices are pretty poor. They are made of a cheap plastic and I believe that even the ones that do work well now, will not last very long with even moderate use. Next time I will try to find a tripod with a set screw type of leg extension lock."},{"rating":"1","title":"So-so","review":"The height is very nice but why does it woble so much even when it is not fully extended? I also did not like the way the leg clips are made. They are plastic and one has already broke off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheaply constructed.","review":"I feel this product is cheaply made. It's very light and doesn't have a sturdy feel to it. Also, at one point one of the legs completely disconnected from the main connecting point on top when moving it. Luckily I didn't have my camera attached at the time. I would not recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"I give up!","review":"I have tried 4 recipes from Cupcakes Galore and I am now convinced that I must stop! As a semi-pro home baker I use high quality ingredients (organic eggs, Irish butter, top shelf liquor) and my results have been consistently disappointing to the point where I am throwing away most of every batch. Each recipe has been bland or one-dimensional. I can appreciate the lack of cloying sweetness--these aren't doctored cake mixes--but I cannot get past the unpleasant texture of all the cupcakes. A heavy cake with a coarse crumb seems to be Wagman's preference, which doesn't work well in a small package. These recipes seem to be more suited for rustic loaf or bundt-style coffee cakes. I love to tinker with recipes, but hers all need more time than I am willing to invest to produce results. I'll keep the book around for the photographs because I like her decorating style, but I am now convinced her recipes aren't for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty pictures, dry cupcakes","review":"The photos in this cookbook are lovely, and the recipes are inventive. However, the cupcakes from the three recipes I have tried so far have turned out dry and crumbly. I don't think the cupcakes were overbaked -- it seems like there was something fundamentally wrong with the recipes. I would recommend this cookbook only to bakers with enough experience and knowledge to make the cupcakes moist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible cookbook","review":"I find it hard to believe that anyone tested these recipes before printing this book. I found myself saying many times while baking these cupcakes, \\"Well this really doesn't seem right. But they claim to be cupcake experts so I'll give it a try.\\" There were multiple editing errors (such as ingredients being listed in the ingredient column, but never mentioned in the actual recipe). The cupcakes tasted bad. I'm so upset that I wasted my money on the ingredients.Don't waste your money on this cupcake book. If the recipes seem somewhat simple, they turn out bad. I didn't even attempt the crazy complicated recipes because they were labor intensive and called for expensive and/or exotic ingredients."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tacky and outdated","review":"I returned this book after flipping through it. The recipes seem bizarre and the decorating ideas are distractingly tacky. I would strongly recommend Hello, Cupcake or Martha Steward Cupcakes over this outdated book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A cookbook to share with others","review":"Buy one for yourself and give one to a friend -- or two. You don't have to be a great baker to have loads of fun with this book, achieve mouth watering results, express your inner self, and awe your friends and family. Ms. Wagman is inspired by the flavors, textures and colors of her own life: the instant chocolate pudding and malted shakes that were staples of childhood in the United States, pastis from the south of France, orange trees in Marrakech, beer and peanuts in a pub in England, Austrian linzertorte, and the much in demand chocolate charlottes enjoyed for years by customers at her restaurant. There's even a cupcake in honor of Yeti, the Abominable Snowman. Surely Ms. Wagman is the J. Peterman of cupcakes. She and her husband Alain Schons have also written Far Out, a basic cookbook for those who want to experiment with African and Asian cuisines."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty pictures... but it ends there","review":"The book includes many beautiful pictures, but the cupcakes are pretty much meant for their looks. If you are looking for an exellent cupcake book, go out and get the cake doctor book. It has excellent ideas. All of the cupcakes are creative and interesting, but nothing i would go out and immediately make."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"Being an avid baker, I was given this cookbook as a gift from a coworker, and I couldn't be more disappointed in the actual taste of these recipes. I've now tried four or five of them, and each batch has been inedible. I think I have LITERALLY thrown away every single batch (which is probably the only reason I am even writing this review). The first ones I tried, just a vanilla cupcake, I thought I had maybe done something wrong, so I made them AGAIN and the results were just as unfavorable. The cupcakes are dry and flavorless. Even though a lot of the recipes look really good, I'm afraid to waste any more of my time and money trying out recipes that I could end up tossing in the garbage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great photos, clear directions-- but not for everyone","review":"The photos are beautiful, the instructions are very user-friendly, and the portions are small (a dozen instead of 36+ cupcakes) and therefore good for experimenting. The downside is if you don't like alcohol, it rules out most of the \\"After Dinner\\" cupcakes and a few in other sections (almost 30 recipes include some form of alcohol). If you do like wine, beer, liqueurs and spirits in general, you'll probably love this book! Also, the \\"Gourmet Cupcakes\\" and the \\"Cupcakes Plus\\" section looked intimidating for an inexperienced baker. Overall, though, there are so many recipes to try, with such beautiful photos, I'd say it is a good buy. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks nice, but taste leaves a lot to be desired","review":"The cupcakes in this book seem to be geared for presentation, but they don't taste good.

I love the tips from a pro and the book is presented in a very playful, yet passionate way--the author obviously loves baking. It's super for both the simple cupcakes-with-frosting of my childhood and for the many fantasy cupcakes for special occasions. Great layout and photos, too! Out of the many cupcake books that are suddenly around, think this is the best I've seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty pictures, awful recipes","review":"This cookbook is quite pretty, pictures are lovely, nice glossy pages but....the recipes are just plain and often awful. Like many of the other reviews these are tasteless recipes. Most of them the amount of time and cost to icing 24 individual cupcakes you could just purchase them at a bakery and save yourself hours worth of work. The Hot Chocolate and Marshmallow cupcake just calls for making dark chocolate cupcakes (which were way too dry) and then toasting marshmallows and putting them on top as the icing. What?!If you need a cupcake cookbook purchase the Cake Doctor Cupcakes by Anne Byrn. It's well worth the money, this cookbook is not.

Theoretically that's not a bad idea; it's just that he obviously has no clue as to the meaning and feeling of the Psalms. His presentation is outright harsh THROUGHOUT the entire Book of Psalms.

Besides the hassle and postage would cost more to send it back then it would be worth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"After maybe 30 minutes of using it I was able to get a very, very slight curvy in my eyelashes. I could've gotten better results by using an old metal eyelash curler in 3 minutes for only a few bucks! A total waste of money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It works!","review":"Great product. For lasting effect, I use it after curling my lashes and mascara. It really works!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"I honestly did not notice any improved curling with this product, in fact, I think that the heat melts my mascara and the comb makes my lashes look thinner and sparser (I had heard that it worked better AFTER putting on mascara). No better when done before mascara either. Metal eyelash curlers are the better way to go."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well","review":"I like this little gadget. It heats up quickly, gets warm but not too warm, and does the job. It gets down at the root of the lashes much better than the pinch type lash curler (which always pinch my eyelids). I use it to curl my lashes before mascara, and then do another quick swipe after I put on a coat of mascara. Works great and makes my lashes POP!"},{"rating":"1","title":"just ok","review":"No noticeable difference in curl. I already have naturally long lashes so the old fashioned crimp style curler works much better for me"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hate it","review":"I've used a lot of eyelash curlers and this one sounded interesting, but it really does nothing. If I work at it for a very long time, I may see a little difference in my lashes, but a metal curler works way better and much faster."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nada.","review":"Does NOTHING. It stopped working after first week. BOOO !It goes through your lashes but the heat provided is very VERY minimal and your eyelashes will look the same afterwards.No bueno."},{"rating":"2","title":"good","review":"very good''just a little heavy! But works good! I like panasonic, those Japan stuffs! Good quality!You can buy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"worthless...","review":"This applies heat to your lashes, but DOES NOT curl them. You are better off to take your blow dryer and heat your plain metal drugstore curler for a few seconds than to buy this. It does absolutely NOTHING to curl them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good for short asian eyelashes!","review":"This is soo hard to use, and it probably works way better on a person with longer lashes. Other than that, it heats up fast and curls after a hundred strokes on my short asian lashes."},{"rating":"1","title":"SUCKS!","review":"I tried this out and it does nothing! Do not buy this! This heats up and that's it! I did buy a curler that heats up but it's the one you crimp and use heat. Get that one! I love the other one. Don't waist your time with this one people!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Be Afraid... Be Very Afraid","review":"Panasonic has a great reputation... but for TV's and other electronics. The reviews ran the gamut, so I decided the price was worth gambling I would finally find the eyelash curler of my dreams. One reviewer mentioned the curler is flat, and that's correct; it's shaped like a little toothbrush. So you can envision the problem with that: If you have George Clooney lashes, no problem. If you have short, straight lashes like me (which is why I use a curler in the first place), BIG PROBLEM! It's not only scary to put a hot mini-iron so close to your corneas, but just not worth the risk of a slip-up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for my thin and short lashes","review":"I've purchase this product from watching a youtuber. It can get really hot so becareful when using it. I have asian lashes, therefore it's thin & it don't stay curl all day but this really does the trick."},{"rating":"2","title":"ok product","review":"Overall it's a pretty handy to have around. I have long asian eyelashes and this doesnt really seem to give me as much curl as a normal eyecurler gives me. it still curls, but it's less noticeable. The batteries definitely die fast after maybe around 5 uses? My eyelashes dont fall out when i use this as opposed to the normal eyecurler. It just doesn't give me the oomph i want in my eyelashes. It helps separate my lashes and give them a slight natural curl. if that's what you're looking for then this is the product for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"good till it stopped heating up","review":"I bought this heated curler because my traditional eyelash curler was breaking off my lashes. The Panasonic did curl my lashes (although not as much as a regular eyelash curler). It was also good for unclumping mascara. Unfortunately, after a couple of weeks it barely heated up. Changed the battery and no difference. I ended up returning it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Great!","review":"This curler works great! I don't have to use a regular curler any more. I am buying this for my family and friends. It's too good not to share."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much curl","review":"Well, it technically does curl your lashes but not very much. You have to hold it on for 1 minute to get anything. Then you need to apply mascara or something right away in order to keep any curl. I haven't used it more than once since I got it. Not very happy with this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great!","review":"This is the best heated eyelash curler I've ever used! I was having a problem with traditional eyelash curlers - they were just bending my lashes. With this heated lash curler, my eyes look so much more open and my lashes look so much longer. I use it before applying mascara and then again after I apply mascara and my lashes hold a curl all day long. Really makes a big difference in how much longer my lashes look."},{"rating":"1","title":"Curler is flat","review":"This curler is unusual in that it has a broad, flat heating pad, so it is diffult to manueuver your curl. The visuals displayed on this site do not portray this. I returned this product after finding it nearly impossible to use without taking a long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that effective, wouldnt recommend!","review":"I would not recommend this product. It takes a lot of time to heat up, and I hear that if you leave the batteries in then it will drain the battery juice, so it takes a lot of hassle taking out the battery after each use.Anyways, on my eyelashes, it takes so much time to have the heat fully penetrate the lashes and you have to swipe it along your eyelashes multiple multiple times, for each eye! I personally don't have time to do that every day unless it was for a special occasion and I spend extra time heating up my eyelashes. I personally would just stick to the traditional eye lash curler for now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lasted six weeks-what a disappointment!","review":"I bought this for my daughter for Christmas-she loved it! It did everything advertised...for about six weeks. The heater stopped working, even though she tried multiple battery changes. Of course, the return date expired ten days before the product did... : ("},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I thought it would Do","review":"I was losing eye lashes because of the eye lash curler so I thought this would do the same thing, Curl my eye lashes. Bascially it did nothing for me. I used it for about 15 minutes and tried to curl my lashes. Really did not work like your basic curler. I will keep it only because it is a pain to return."},{"rating":"2","title":"good.","review":"nice i like it. willing to purchase next time. thank you very much. as the as i expect. 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"works as expected","review":"I liked the idea of an eyelash curler that would'nt pull out your eyelashes so I ordered this one. I am basically pleased with it and it works even better when you have mascara on. The only thing about it that is different from the usual type of curler is that you cannot get the sky high lashes you can with that one, however you do get a nice, natural curl (without pull) that will last throughout the day or evening."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST EYELASH CURLER!","review":"I LOVE LOVE LOVE this eyelash curler and I honestly can't understand how anyone gave this less than 5 stars! I have straight eyelashes that point almost downward, and normal eyelash curlers leave my eyelashes crimped no matter how I use them. I have tried what seems like a MILLION products, and this by far is the BEST. While other heated curlers of similar design worked well at my curling lashes, they did not allow me to re-curl once I had applied my mascara. This one can be used before or after mascara application (or if you are me before AND after). I found this device VERY easy to use and was really surprised to read reviews claiming otherwise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"This is a terrible product. It did not heat up nor curl the eyelashes. I had to go and purchase a different one within 2 days. Would not recommend to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heat Setting Is Too Low!!!","review":"I wish there was a higher heat setting because it's way too low and takes FOREVER to curve my lashes. Wow. Horrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"I loved it til it stopped working....","review":"I was in love with this curler it heated very well the first couple of weeks, but now it barely heats, and if I want to return it I have to pay the shipment.

I do have thick eyelashes though but I would leave them under my lashes for 20 seconds to no avail."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Work Well","review":"I wouldn't recommend this. Perhaps my eyelashes are too thick, but it never curled them. It is a neat product in theory, and not expensive, but it never worked for me. I ended up buying a heated one that is very similar to the non heated ones that clamp your eyelashes, and it would perfectly. I'd recommend something like that. For me, this was a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't like it","review":"I didn't like it, it never curl my lashes at all. I have long eye lashes but I wanted to make them curly. And I thought this would help, but instead it gave me a headache"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the one.","review":"I have used the lash curler from Sephora for some time but had to keep buying them because the casing always ended with a tiny crack which prevented good contact with the battery. So far the Panasonic has been great and seems to have a more secure connection."},{"rating":"1","title":"BIGGEST WASTE OF MONEY","review":"I ordered this hoping that it would be my new best friend. Boy, was I wrong. It did absolutely NOTHING to my lashes. I have long, straight lashes and it's difficult to keep curls all day with the weighing down of mascara. I tried this curler before and after mascara. Did nothing before, and it didn't separate all my lashes naturally after. In fact, it clumped groups of eyelashes together. Don't waste your money buying this useless thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"I have tried one or two others that I purchased at local stores, then gave away. I thought that it was just my lashes, but this one worked. I love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"dont' do it!","review":"Do not waist your time and money,It will not grab the eyelash to curl stick with the classic style curler."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works, small learning curve...","review":"People that this sort of heated curler is NOT working for are probably not using it right. Using this device intails a learning curve to get it right, and the instructions it comes with are rather basic and poor. Once you play with it, and get the angles right, it really does work well, particularly if you use clear mascara, or a primer, before curling. I can get a little bit more dramatic of a curl curve with my traditional eyelash curler, but I often pinch my lid, and it's just more of a PITA...! This unit can get a teeny bit hot near your delicate lid skin, but you quickly get used to it. Check out EnKore Makeup's video on YouTube for a great instructional video on using heated eyelash curlers. It REALLY, really helped me to start using this thing faster..."},{"rating":"2","title":"It take time","review":"I brought this item few days ago and yesterday was my first day trying to use it. I think it should be use without mascara instead of using it after you apply mascara because it will melt the mascara a little bit. It really make my eyelash curl but with lots of patient because you need to wait for the product to heat up and put it on your eyelash and wait some times. You also might need to repeat the steps to ensure your lashes curl.I personally think it takes time. But, the advantage of using this product is it won't spoil your eyelash."},{"rating":"1","title":"not recomended","review":"I WOULD NOT RECCOMEND THIS PRODUCT PROBALLY WHY ITS CHEAP IS BECASUE AFTER THE SECOND USE OF THE PRODUCT IT NO LONGER WORKS ONLY GOT 2 USES OUT OF IT"},{"rating":"1","title":"Gross","review":"This toy is disgusting.

It is fantastic on nose hair (and yes, that is embarrassing to write). Every other razor I've tried has pulled painfully and smelled gross, like oil. This worked smoothly and painlessly.

It works well overall, and is great for trimming and shaping the eyebrows."},{"rating":"1","title":"All It Removed Was My Money","review":"I've used the Finishing Touch for hair removal before and have always been pleased with it. But this time when I needed to buy a new one, I saw the Panasonic Pivoting Head Facial Groomer. The fact that it pivoted is what sold me. Boy was I wrong! First of all, the Panasonic doesn't have the power that the Finishing Touch does and you can't press it hard when you need to. The big problem was that when I changed the blades the second time, the locking mechanism simply broke off. Although both devices are made with plastic, the Panasonic is made with a much cheaper grade of plastic, and that is why the locking mechanism broke--it was plainly too flimsy to last. I'm happy that some others have had no problems with their Panasonics, but I won't chance it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than I'd Hoped!","review":"I didn't have very high expectations for this shaver. Most small face shavers scratch, don't shave very closely and die pretty quickly. Not this one. It's exactly what I've been shopping for. It does a close, smooth clean up (especially on those little downy hairs) and the doesn't nick while doing it. Now that I'm at the time of life when I'm experiencing my own private summers and all that involves, facial hair has become a real problem (and to be honest, I really don't like the idea of having to shave my face at all!!), but this little shaver is meeting all my needs. I can absolutely recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"No more long peach fuzz.","review":"This little trimmer is ideal for women who want to cut down on that fuzzy face look.

My only criticisms are, since it has so many pieces, providing a little case to keep you from losing them would be ideal. Also, the plastics do seem a little cheap, i hope they'll last over time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good littler razer","review":"This works pretty good for cleaning any small areas.

Works better than some others that I have had. Fast shipment and packaged well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh","review":"Pretty disappointed mainly because the attachments are confusing and not intuitive, furthermore the instructions are impossible to follow so I've basically put all the attachments away. It says it comes with a carrying case to hold all the pieces - and there are a lot of attachments - but no carry case was included. Also there is no pivoting action yet it's listed as a selling point. I don't think I want something that trims my eyebrows to easily pivot anyway. I'm also slightly annoyed that it's girly pink and somewhat resembles a vibrator. Similar items for men are much better designed with superior functionality. I will buy a men's trimmer next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Panasonic Trimmer","review":"I was forced to return this product for the following reasons below:First of all, it was packaged in a hard plastic case and I was forced to use a sharp knife to even open the package. Then I discovered the product was missing a piece (which looked to be broken off before packaging). Needless to say, I could not assemble it with a part missing, therefore it was useless.I bought this product because of the high ratings. Why couldn't the manufacturer have put it together before shipping, then they would notice if a part was missing?? I was forced to put the cheap plastic bits and pieces in a plastic bag for the return. I will think twice before purchasing another product like this. It was discounted and now I know why, cheap, cheap, cheap!I am a good customer of Amazon and will have to say they are very good about refunds and exchanges on defective products. That's why I continue to order from Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"not impressed","review":"I have used this only for one month & then stopped using it. I used it for eye-brow shaping.

This really works great & doesn't pull your skin like the other ones do; really does what it says!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Great Product","review":"I bought this product primarily just to get rid of the facial hair I get around my upper lip. For that purpose, this product is wonderful and painless. Just for that I would give this product 5 stars.The groomer also does eyebrows, but I found the mechanism for doing the eyebrows to be way to much trouble to go through. If I were to rate the product on that, I would give only 3 stars.I would say if you're looking to get rid facial hair in general, then this is for you. If you're looking for something to sculp your eyebrows, try something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"When my old facial trimmer finally bit the dust, I bought a cheap one from a local drugstore. It was useless and I knew I had to find something better. This trimmer is it! One \\"blade\\" is extra long, so it covers more area and thus gets rid of more hair with less passes. And the shorter blade is perfect for eyebrows- no more accidentally shaving off the ends of your brows. I don't really care for the pivot- I had forgotten it had that feature and almost sent it back thinking it was broken. All in all, this is a great little trimmer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Actually works well for me","review":"I almost didn't buy this because of the mixed reviews, but I really wanted it for trimming my eyebrows and stray hairs my electric razor misses. For that it works beautifully."},{"rating":"1","title":"WILL NOT STAY WORKING","review":"I would love this trimmer if it just kept working. 2nd Panasonic trimmer that just stops working within a few month. New battery, works for a day, then stops again. Now completely stopped. Is it even worth returning? Now, it has to be done through Panasonic, blah blah...ship to them. I prefer companies that stand by their product, they ship you the new one and you return the old one when you get it. They have all my proof of purchase,, etc.They just don't make things they way they used to, when things worked for more than a year at least?!?!?!?!Never again Panasonic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work well","review":"I don't think this product works well. I have to run it back and forth over my eyebrows several times before i feel like it's trimmed even a few hairs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the wait while it was backordered","review":"I waited over a year for this product to become readily available and did not purchase another brand. It was worth the wait. It works exactly like it is supposed to and is lightweight and portable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing spectacular","review":"It did not come with any carrying case, in spite of the claim that it does. So now I have all the little pieces (combs, extra blade, cleaning brush) to find a home for. I don't see that it does any better a job than a regular razor, and the brow combs are a waste of time. TO be honest, I would never order one again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Panasonic Facial Trimmer","review":"Works well. No more \\"razor burn\\". It is lightweight, and battery operated. I would recommend it to anyone who has used a razor blade device and got cut."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"This product help me keep my eyebrows trimmed to the right length and I can also use this to shape my brows.

Just got this Panasonic trimmer yesterday and used it today. Absolutely THE best of all the trimmers I've used. It didn't feel like my face was being sliced off, which I loved, and it trimmed every single bit of peach fuzz off my face. I've never had a trimmer that cut so close. My skin looks like a kid's again. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A little loud, but good for touch-ups","review":"I usually do threading to remove my facial hair and keep this product around for quick touch-ups. The groomer doesn't irritate my skin and does the job than other similar groomers I've owned. But a couple things. First, the exchangeable trimmers are small, kind of flimsy, and easy to lose -- it would be nice if the groomer came with a case as mentioned in the manual. Also, I wish this thing was quieter -- it could be a lot worse, but the whir of the motor feels a little too loud when I'm surreptitiously trying to trim my 'stache."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally a great product to get rid of facial hair, five stars!!","review":"A problem that many women do not like to admit is having excess/unwanted facial hair. In the past i had used sally hanson creams and what not to get rid of upper lip hair, ect. It worked great for a few months then one day out of the blue i had a horrible reaction to it, my skin was burned and the marks did not fully go away until about a year. Obviously i was done with creams and such. I took a chance on this item because of the affordable prices, great reviews, and it looked to be a great item.IT IS! The large blade is PERFECT for getting rid of upper lip hairs. It gets rid of it quick and easily with almost no irritation. I also tried it on other hairs on my face and it worked great. I have not yet used the eyebrow blade but i might in the future.

A side project of Cezar of Christ Agony and the late Doc (died 2005) of Vader, they have a sound that sounds to me like a poor and uninspired imitation of Emperor. Add to this some lyrics written in poor English that often don't make sense, which are sung with a heavy accent which makes them even more difficult to understand. Nothing worthy of note here. I found even one listen a waste of time.I'm glad I just picked this up pretty cheap used so I don't mind the little bit of money I spent taking a chance on an unknown new group.

The advice given on the video is overly limited and available to anyone on the internet, in dozens of books, and magazines. Also, these producers are at such an amateur level that they don't even discuss high quality equiptment. For example, they used a HOME DV camera to shoot this video (and it shows) and stated Adobe Premier (THE standard in this business) was more than they needed.

Sometimes the subnet (inside the firewall) would remain working, sometimes not. I upgraded the firmware, tried several different configurations, reset the thing repeatedly, and always had the same problem: when network traffic got heavy (say, when my web server got several requests or when several of us were using the network), the thing would freeze, requiring a hardware reset.I ended up buying ther NetGear equivalent product (the RP-114), plugged it in, configured it and haven't had a single problem with it.

There was no good documentation with the D-link product(no manual). Had to download off the web. The tech support kept wanting me to reset the router.

Don't make my mistake - this is one of those items which you really should spend the money intended for such a product. Cheap pricing in products like this can only mean trouble. I would recommend spending at least $90+ on a lamp like this. The one I had before was around $100 and it worked great for years until I dropped it and shattered the lens...oops"},{"rating":"2","title":"Help for us old blind guys","review":"I had been looking for a cost effective solution to my failing eyesight.

For example, it talks about how husbands are almost never allowed in the delivery rooms. Come on!!!

The best aspects of this book are its unpredictability (ok, it does get a little predictable at the end...) and the frenetic pace of the narration. Though I am often skeptical of reviews which claim that a book is difficult to put down, this one really is. Deborah Christian really has that spark which enables her to interleave storylines without losing touch with the narrative thrust. This is the work of a mature novelist and it's hard to believe it's her first attempt.

I am reviewing it at this late date because I stumbled onto this patently unfair average review of 3 stars. It gives Amazon customers--not Harnoncourt--a bad name. This is the performance that made me realize it was Mozart's most important opera. Of the reviews, read 'a music fan' from 1999. Disregard all of those that approached this with the fixed idea that some conductor (e.g. Giulini) or some singer (e.g. Siepi) had already done THE great Don. In case you doubt my opinion, I will add that of the modern recordings only this and Giulini are diapason d'ors."},{"rating":"1","title":"not one for the list","review":"This recording was made shortly after Mr. Hampson sang his first performances of the title role at the Metroplitan Opera. A critic in the NY Times had the gaul to compare Hampson to the great Met Giovannis, Siepi and Pinza. As John Wayne might say, \\"Not Hardly\\". Hampson's affected and monochromatic singing characterize this entire recording. From top to bottom the cast is colorless and soporific, save for Barbara Bonney's charming Zerlina. There are substantially superior recordings available and for a lot less money. Try the classic London label recording with Siepi, Corena, and della Casa with Krips conducting. There is real Mozart singing and playing. If you must have Hampson, get one of his song recital cds, in which he uses the microphone to full effect."},{"rating":"1","title":"I could not add additional handsets","review":"Twice I went through the hassle of ordering an extra handset (#3), but my base would not accept it.

This project falls under the category of \\"No hit, no field\\". When critics say, \\"I like some country music, but not that nasal whiny hillbilly stuff,\\" this is exactly what they're talking about. \\"Songs About Rain\\" is a nonsensical idiotic diatribe, the rest of the \\"music\\" nose dives from there. I have to wonder if he even opened his mouth while singing \\"Tough Litte Boys\\" (a maudlin touchy-feely effort about todays politically correct sensitive guy type). It sounds like it was sung completely through the nose. If this is the direction country music is going, I'm definitely looking elsewhere for my music. Jim Reeves must be turning over in his grave.

With a few great singles dealing with everything from broken relationships, which is tackled nicely in \`Songs About Rain', to dealing with watching your little girl grow up on \`Tough Little Boys' which is sure to bring even the toughest man to his knees. Songs like \`I Can Love You' and the radio favorite \`Nothing On But The Radio' show that this guy isn't all about failed relationships, he knows how to make the right ones work, and songs like the opener \`Drinkin' Dark Whiskey' and \`Can't Do It Today' show that country is in this mans soul.

And not to win it is absolutely unbeleavalbe. What is going on. I don't know what I can say that has not already been said.

His cd's just keep getting better. I never tire of this cd or Smoke Rings in the Dark (my other favorite) though they all have something to offer a country music fan. He has one of the best voices in country music today. My favorite tracks are, \\"See If I Care\\" \\"Don't Look Away\\" and \\"You Don't Know A Thing About Me\\" but they are all quite good. He is definitely an artist with crossover appeal as my husband can attest to. Don't let the negative reviews fool you.

So it is here, alas. And the other two pieces, where finesse would be welcome, instead sound rather raucous. Yes, I know that Mozart incorporates into K251 a little folk tune called (more or less) \\"The Kitchen Maid Has Lost the Cat-She Don't know Where It's At.\\" Nevertheless, finesse, elegance and a sense of the svelte will pay off here.

Davy dancing with an impossibly cute blonde, and the other three Monkees hamming it up with vaudevillian hats and canes-- that moment captures all the fun and happiness and still woefully underrated musical talents of The Monkees. The shows in season 2 aren't as consistently innovative and clever as the first season product, but the music is superb (Daydream Believer, Pleasant Valley Sunday, Randy Scouse Git and all of Nesmith's country-pop contributions).

Castro, a scientist for the National Marine Fisheries Department, starts off with a very well done introduction to sharks in general. Then there is a dichotomous key to family and to species for all species covered. The write up on each species has a line drawing in profile and of the teeth. Aside from ID information there is a plethora of useful biological info that is hard to find in any one source for all species. This includes litter size, pup size and frequently age and size at maturity.

Then ends of your cords look like big cubes hanging from your windows with large orange warning stickers. Second, they are not smooth and easy to use. The switch that is used to extend the cord is very small and annoying to operate. Finally, the cord never actually get permanently affixed to the device and if it ever comes loose without a safety pin put in place the device becomes permanently useless.

Not only is this product large, heavy and ugly when attached to your blinds it almost DESTROYED my custom made blinds. I followed the installation directions to a T. My blinds can go all the way down, and then open from the top. You need to remove any manufactured installed hardware on the strings of your blinds for the winder to work. So if your knot slips, poof, your binds don't work at all. This is the second product I have purchased to try to wind my blinds and I thought since it was a more expensive product, It would work better. NOT SO.

It's amazing. I had been using a vac-u-vin by the same company and now when I use it I can clearly taste the difference in the wine the next day.The one downside is that the argon is fairly expensive. You can buy a pack of 4 cartridges for approx $12. The party line is that you can store 8-10 bottles with a cartridge. Although I am far from an expert and probably use more argon than necessary, I only get 2-3 bottles per cartridge.

It's totally changed how I drink wine. My wife is not a big wine fan, so before I had this product, opening a bottle was a \\"full bottle commitment\\". This precluded me from tasting the more expensive wines from my cellar without a partner.Now what I do is decant half of a new bottle into a half-bottle (which I wash and reuse). I preserve the half bottle with argon gas. Because there is only 1 cm of air at the top of the half bottle, it tales very little argon! I then enjoy the remaining half of the bottle and save the other half for later. The non-consumed half bottles easily keep a week, so now I can taste my more expensive wines as two half-bottle events instead of a full bottle event. The only downside is that you have to be fairly religious about washing the half bottles and Preservino stoppers.I will give this device to fellow wine-drinkers as a gift.Drink well!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality materials, weak build.","review":"I payed a few extra bucks to get the professional set, but there's nothing professional about it.

I don't find the wine to be atill fresh after 2 days, even if I keep it in the fridge. Do you want to drink your wine before it get spoiled? I suggest finishing the bottle in one sitting. Or try something else.... this product is definitely not worth 50 bucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmm does it really work?","review":"I bought this as a Christmas gift for my wife. It was expensive and fancy looking, but does it work? I think the results are inconclusive, certainly not clear one way or another.

Called ATI tech support, which put me on hold for an hour, and I recieved no help, only a bill for an hour long long distance call to canada (where the ATI support center is based). Later I called dell, who informed me that other customers had had the same problem: a confilct between the tv tuner and ATI mobility video cards.

Unfortunately, the facts that Ms. Riplinger offers in NABV are so scattered amongst her personal opinion that it is hard for the reader to desipher between them. I would recommend the charts in this book to anyone I come in contact with, but I would not recommend the book. Satan is certainly at work with these new versions and the continuous attack on the KJV, but NABV does little to help in this discussion. I would recommend Dr. William Grady's \\"Final Authority\\" to anyone who truly wants to have a serious look at the version controversy that is sweeping our churches today. Riplinger had good intentions, but the book falls short of where it needs to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"How one could possibly agree with this is amazing!","review":"Gail Riplinger, who claims God Himself is to be accredited as her co-author, wrote 700 pages based on imaginative thinking and backed by even more imaginative research. Has anyone really checked her sources? Her blatant misrepresentation of the truth is appauling! That a \\"home decorater\\" would claim to have knowledge of textual criticism is almost comical. She has no study in the Biblical languages and yet she claims to speak authoritatively on this exhaustive and complex subject.

They insist that the archaic words and sentence structure are easily inderstood if you read \\"with the eye of God\\" etc. Well, it looks like God hasn't given me such insights, or maybe I'm just stupid, but I think people should choose a Bible version which they understand and will read regularly.

Upon closer, independent research one finds that Ms. Riplinger either had shoddy research or else purposely mislead the reader to further her own agenda. I honestly and sincerely cannot and will not recommend this book as an truthful and accurate resource. You want truth? Skip Ms. Riplinger's book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A horrible absolute book of slanderous lies!","review":"Yeah, those are strong words, but true. Riplinger name-calls and makes all manner of unsubstantiated, slanderous accusations against a wide-array of widely respected men and women. She gives referances to their books, but almost every time I double checked her she either misquoted them or, many times, just made up the quote altogether! She also claims God talks to her and that whenever the Bible says \\"word of God\\" it means the King James! This is absurd, and to give any attention to this book is a waste of time. I wish I could regain the time I spent reading this nonsense! Should have NO stars, but I wasn't allowed to do that. No, it should be in the MINUSES!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nobody's Mind will be Changed by This Book","review":"If you already believe that the King James Version of the Bible is a supernaturally superior translation of the Bible and that modern Bible translations are the work of the evil, horned, red-pajamed oogly-boogly one, this book will preach to the choir of your heart. On the other hand, if you believe that \\"King James Only\\" adherents are out to lunch, then this book will probably manage to astound you to the point of laughter with tabloid-style theological sensationalism and shallowness. (Ooh, and be sure to read her section on \\"Acrostic Algebra\\"...it's a HOOT!) If you insist on reading this book, I'd strongly suggest reading \\"The King James Only Controversy\\" by James White (you'll see the reviews on his book are also 'love or hate') but his credentials are impeccable.

I'm troubled by her story that God literally dictated the book to her. I encourage the serious Bible student to check all her references--they don't add up. I'm also troubled by the unnecessary division this book has motivated in the body of Christ. The reader is encouraged to examine James White's book: \\"The King James Only Controversy\\" (www.aomin.org). He presents a well-researched, scholarly, and praiseworthy defense of modern Bible translations"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dishonest and scholastically lame","review":"Ms. Riplinger's book is more fiction than fact. If people take the time to check on the people she quotes, they'll find she takes them horribly out of context - at times plucking a handful of words from four pages to create a presumably damning quotation. This is irresponsible at the last, and libelous might be more accurate. Furthermore, she frequently misrepresents the best translations from the Greek when citing textual variants. She completely ignores verses and facts that contradict her findings. Intellectually and scholastically, I would give her text a D-, but only if I graded her on a curve. On top of all this, her ad hominem attacks on other scholars reveals a bitter person who bears no fruits of the spirit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading.","review":"If anyone really looks at what Riplinger wrote and checks all the references they would not believe that any sane person would take her seriously."},{"rating":"1","title":"CHECK OUT THE RESOURCES AND THE FACTS; PURE DECEPTON!","review":"All the reader has to do is check out the facts, her resources, and just look at what she says the English versions say, verses what they really say. Any reader who seriously checks her endnotes knows that Rip wrote this book from a position of non-authority, and from a position she doesn't have a clue how we got our Bible. All through out her book, the \\"Bible\\" is always spelled \\"bible\\" why? What she says is contained in the NIV,NASB, or others, isn't in there at all. Again check the facts. Are the readers of this book that stupid to take what she says at face value? I challenge you to check the facts. In fact start out with Phil 3:3 when Rip says NIV says \\"worship\\", when in fact it says \\"Worship in the Spirit of God\\". To conclude, this book is fantasy, fiction, and made up gooble-gook! Again check out the facts! Hello anybody home?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor research with no ground to stand on!","review":"Every argument she gives can quickly be debunked if you look at the facts.

This book is a pseudo-intellectual farce that aims more for emotional tirade than accuracy. The author seems to think that somehow 1611 was when God finally inspired the Bible (never mind current KJVs are based on the 1769 revision). It is attitudes like that of the author that caused the deaths of men like Wyliff - and caused the Bible to be in the hands of the Magesterium of the Roman Catholic Church and not in the hands of God's church. If one examines the true facts behind the book the ineptness of the \\"research\\" will show itself. It is unfortunate that members of the body of Christ must have drivel like this associated with them."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Book is A SICK JOKE","review":"This book is so silly, filled with error after error, anyone who believes this probably should seek professional help.

Riplinger misquotes her sources, takes quotations out of context, and even makes quotations up (in at least one instance that I detected). She takes the most tenuous of connections between modern Bible translators and occultists as \\"proof\\" that there is a conspiracy afoot to corrupt the Bible in preparation for the alleged One World Religion to come. Riplinger misses no opportunity to belittle any scholar connected with modern Bibles. Furthermore, the book is rife with spelling and stylistic errors, including frequent misspellings of sources' names (she DID have these sources right in front of her, right?)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Scholarship","review":"While this book has become very popular in many evangelical circles, Riplinger's methodology is quite dubious. Her conclusions about the corruption of modern bible versions are not warranted. For a clearer discussion of the issues surrounding the \\"KJV Only\\" debate, I recommend \\"The King James Only Controversy: Can You Trust the Modern Translations?\\" by James R. White. For an earlier book on the subject, I recommend D.A. Carson's \\"The King James Version Debate : A Plea for Realism.\\" White's work is more thorough, however.I give this work a \\"1\\" not because of Riplinger's writing, but because of the poor academic quality of her work.

So I grabbed my copies of the KJV, the NASB, and the NIV. For instance, when she sites Phil. 3:3 saying that the NIV and NASB do not say worship God, she is pulling words entirely out of context. She uses lies to shroud the credibility of the translators. I personally know a man who worked on the NASB and he has a heart for the Gospel and for absolute truth, not for blasphemy. The translators spent hours in prayer, overwhelmed and humbled by the task before them, approaching it with a right heart. The KJV is a great translation, but is not practical for many today. If it's your preference, go for it, but do not alienate other versions based on lies, slander, misquotes, and Scripture taken out of context."},{"rating":"1","title":"The KJV is superior BUT this is Horrible Scholarship!!!","review":"I believe the modern versions are based upon corrupted texts and that the KJV is the best translation in the English language, however, Riplinger&#65533;s &#65533;New Age Bible Versions&#65533; is garbage!

Riplinger has done more harm to the Traditional Text than all of the textual scholars of the last 200 years combined.If you are wanting to read something defending the text behind the KJV and showing its superiority to the modern versions, read anything by Dean Burgon. Also, &#65533;The Identity of the New Testament Text&#65533; by Wilbur N.

However to make big money one should write with a semblance of learning to undermine the works of real scholars. She should be able to retire wealthy of pocket if not of mind. This book has little basis in fact, and time & again takes biblical themes (eg lordship) expanded often by human error, then lambastes such as the NIV simply because they have removed the human additions of the theme. If God started with the KJV she is correct, otherwise incorrect.I use her work in teaching college students about biblical text & translation. I include mischievous cut & paste from her words, making her sound like a diabolist, then making clear that it's not an accusation but to show how cut & paste can present inverse pictures of folk & their motivations.

Not only do many of the words in the KJ mean something entirely different in our language (lists are available), but many older manuscripts are available now than in 1611. Also, discovery of more ancient secular documents help to translate original words more precisely. A lot of devoted, careful teams of people of integrity have labored over these translations.

First, there is little attention to the musical phrase and, as a result, little tension is developed. It is done in a very matter of fact way. Compare to Atlanta's recordings; not even close. But it's not the orchestra in my opinion; its a lack of vision on the part of the conductor.

It would not play in my laptop slot as every other disc I've ever owned does. So no adding that first & last track to iTunes - frustrating.I am a pretty solid Glass fan, but this was not for me.

For my simple purposes of re-heating leftovers or mugs of hot soy milk, this sharp is more than sufficient and 99% of my heating needs are fulfilled with times of less than 2.5 minutes.The microwave is a little loud but it's not terrible by any means. It's a big enough oven than you can fit full-size plates and dishes inside.I've had issues with the defrost function, which doesn't have an intuitive setup and is hard to figure out.

So when this came out for the Cube I thought I should expand my Sonic collection. I a glad I did. The game features two main modes Hero and Dark. Both vary in different ways but share a common goal, to collect all the Chaos Emeralds. In Dark you play as Shadow, Dr.Eggman, and Rouge. In Hero you play as Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles. After you beat both sides you unlock a new mode. In this mode all six characters come togehter to prevent the space statio n from running into Earth. The game itself contains over 150 missions. Exclusive to the Gamecube version is a series of multiplayer games. In these games you can be such people as Chaos Zero, metal sonic, or Amy. The reason this game got 4 stars is because the game lacks replay value and the multiplayer games are a little lacking. Overall,I'd say the game is worth a buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"This game could be better","review":"This game is packed with alot of missions, stages, and power-ups. The only part of the game that really pisses me off, is the biolizard. I could never get past that boss, it took all my 99, yes I said 99 lives. Well the main reason I bought the game and you should guess, the chao garden!! These things are are fun to raise and reproduce. (I'm Ian's son who typed this review, he has no intrest in games.) My personal favorite character is shadow the hedgehog, he is LIVE, that's all I need to say. I recommend this game for you, but be prepared for \\"the biolizard\\" and be prepared for getting pissed off as well. P.S. Have extra $ for new gamecube controllers, you might get so pissed off that you might brake it!!!!!."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bestest game ever.","review":"This game is addictive. I can't pull myself away from it..

When you control sonic the game is fun, but you are not given the option to be sonic the whole game and you end up going on tedious and annoying treasure hunts with knuckles, and terrible mech action with tails. With Sonic being the sole character the game would have been a lot better but even still the series just isn't as entertaining in a 3d world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somewhat entertaining","review":"Sonic A2B is a mediocre game, plain and simple.___Pros___Fun 2 playerSome fun levels___Cons___Average graphicsBad cameraAwful voice actingNo four player racingTerrible storyI wish that Sega would get it throught there heads. Sonic is not a 3-d game. I loved it back when it was a classic 16-bit Genisis game. If they could make a 2-d sonic with Gamecube quality graphics, it would rock. Oh, and take out that chao garbage. It is not fun. In fact that is what gave the game a 2/5 instead of a 3/5. Get sonic for the Gameboy.

The day I got it I was so excited. It was tons of fun beating levels on the hero side, or dark side, But then I came up to a scavenger hunt and it got intensely booring. In a scavenger hunt you get to be the teams hunter, and search for three diamonds. but they give you a hot or cold method of searching, which unlocks confusion, and frustration. Like all the other sonic games there is sonics fast past action levels that are a blast, and tails robot fighting action. This time with sonic they made a new daycare type thing that alows you to take care of a little baby called a chao. With a chao you can fight karate, and have races. If you have a game boy advance and,a gba to gamecube cable you can transfer your chao's into it and get fruit and other things for them. over all I give this 4 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"sonic games are always cool","review":"when i was little i loved to play on my sega genesis with the sonic games there were cool on that systeam and i suspect that this game will be cool alothough i have not yet gotten this game i have gotton to play on the other games that has sonic and tails and dr.

But, boy was I wrong. It's a truly horrible game that's scattered all over the place with no non-linear progression or free roaming abilities of the original.The graphics are ugly, the camera system is the worst I have ever come across and the levels are tiresome and repetitive. Where's the dynamic gameplay of the first game? Or the cool mini-games that keep you coming back again and again? It was just ugly and garish and far inferior to Sonic Adventure. Do not buy or rent.I can only hope and pray that Sonic Heros is better because I have already bought it."},{"rating":"1","title":"[Junk]","review":"When I heard Sonic was coming out for the Cube I was excited, now that I've played it I can say that I'm sorely dissappointed. The levels with either Sonic or Shadow are good but you only get to play them one third of the time, the levels with tails the robot and dr. robonick's robot (why they changed his name to eggman is ALSO annoying) are very tedious and boring not to mention very easy, ALSO the other levels with the bat girl and knuckles are just horrible. SO, if you love playing 1/3 of a good game than this is the game for you. If not, steer clear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty good but could have been lots better.","review":"I think if there is ever going to be a Sonic Adventure 3 it better have all the characters from the first SA game and be a cross between the old school Sonic games for Genesis and the first Sonic Adventure game for Dreamcast.Sonic Adventure was one of the best games graphic wise and fun wise of 2000 so you can bet that the sequel was somewhat of a disappointment.Im sick of the stages where you have to dig for emeralds.What happened to just having a Special Stage?If Sega is going to make another game thats like SA 2 then maybe they should give up on the Sonic idea and think of something else.128 bit versions of the original Sonic games for Genesis would be really cool but unfortunately I dont think that's going to happen."},{"rating":"1","title":"this is ok","review":"i thought it was fun in the end but when you beat the game you dont want to start over im not a sonic freak so when it came out i didnt care but i bot it because you guys gave it 4 stars it would be good i dont like it that much"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sonic Adventure 2 Battle: Greatest game in the world","review":"Sonic Adventure 2 Battle is an awsemone game. You can be the dark side (Shadow,Robotnik,Rouge) or the good Side(Sonic Tails, Nuckles). If you play the dark side You can blow up the earth and some thing happens to sonic but you'll have to but it if you want to find out. It has tons of new levels but still lives up to the old school sonic games and more. I got this game a week ago and am flying through most of it. The hard levels are thouse of nuckles and rouge the bat because you have to find hidden emralds and keys. The good thing about the game is that afetr you beet the level in Story mode you can play it again in stage select with 4 different objectives. You can raise a chao wich is prety fun except that if you take it to chao kindergarton it takes forever to get over. All in all this is the best sonic game I have ever played and hope they come out withnmore like this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sonic on Nintendo","review":"I own this game and I think it's decent in Graphics, game play, and 2p-games rock... one problem I see is the camera angles sometimes there just down right annoying and you can't see what you want to see..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun,at least for a while","review":"I for a 2 month period loved Chao,Sonic and friends.

Infact it is one of the few good games out for the Cube right now. It is only rivaled by: Super Smash Bros., Zelda Windwaker, and Animal Crossing. Get this game it is getting more uncommon to find this game as time flies by. soon this game might be costing you an arm and a leg. One of the most popular aspects of the Game is the Chao, these are creatures that the various Sonic characters in the game collect items and food for during the stages. they are what keep me playing and why should mainly buy this game. you might get bored after about 60 hours of gameplay after beating the game so watch out. This ain't to much of a problem cause it's replay and after game value is good and addictive. Like I said, This game is slowly disappearing so I'd buy it quick if I haven't already."},{"rating":"2","title":"History Repeats its Self","review":"All past Sonic games were a blast to play, even the one not made by Sega (e.g. Tails Adventure, Sonic Cart Racers, etc.) and Sonic Adventure 2: Battle lives up to that. Fast paced and has an exelent music score. The last few stages are rather diffecult, but well worth the trouble. Then we have the Chaos. Amazing little creatures that grow up to many diffrent forms (one even looks like NIGHTS from NIGHTS in to Dreams for the Saturn!!)

I wish this game would come sooner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bored Stiff!","review":"I saw all the rave reviews, so I decided to pick this one up. Talk about a dissapointment. 75% of the time you follow a set path which can mostly be traversed by simply holding up on the control stick. If you want to blow stuff up...well...ok, but you don't really need to half the time. The levels which have a greater degree of freedom have no order, so you basically wander around until your crystal indicator starts beeping. I'm bored of the game already. When are the real games going to start comming out for the GameCube?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dumbest sonic game EVER","review":"When i got this i was expecting a remake of Sonic Adventure for Dreamcast with some cool new stuff in it. What i really got was a sonic game where everything cool about sonic adventure had been removed and now you have to play through 2 characters worth of painstakingly stupid missions just to get to the only fun part which is sonic or shadow's runs through the game (which last a mere couple minutes at most). Tails isnt the tails we all know and love, he is a scientist fox that scoots around in a stupid looking robot. And knuckles...from all the games, he has a special purpose for sonic adventure 2. His purpose is to make the game absloutely intolerable, you get to use him to find emerald shards in massive levels. No running, not much fighting and a littel gliding, mostly digging into stuff...Do NOT waste your time or money on this game, it's pointless."},{"rating":"1","title":"GOOD GAME BAD CAMERA ANGLES","review":"this game is fun... the camera angles drive you crazy and actualy affects game play beacuse sometimes you cant see where sonic is I really dont like this game anymore and i dont ussually get sick from playing on my gamecube so its not me it serriously is the game dont buy it especially if you are sensetive to games and might get sick"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of GameCube's best Sonic games ever!","review":"This game ROCKS!!! My brother and I have played it sooo many times, over and over! This game can be VERY challenging, especially the timed missions (the 4th missions), so I suggest you buy the Action Relay MAX for GameCube from CodeJunkis. This game also has a few glitches in it, but don't bother them. The Chao are sooo cute, especially when they sing in the Chao Kindergarten. And the Chao races can be hard, but not as hard as the origional gaming mode.

Not only is there a lot to do, but it's hard. Why would a hard game be fun? Because it doesn't take two days to finish like Batman. I just got it today, so I'm not real sure on the Chao part. But it's so much fun. The destroying the world is pretty hard, but the saving it isn't as hard. But it's still hard.

Sonic/Shadow levels are the most creative and fun levels I've ever played in a 3D game. The story, like you have been hearing is alright. And two player is a blast if you have someone to play with. Okay, the bad. Almost all of the Knuckles/Rouge levels are terrible. I like Pumpkin hill though, I really play it to hear the rap song. And the camera is sometimes hard to control. But hey, other than that, this game is one of the best gamecube games out there. This also has a big replay value to it. If your unsure about this game, play it at a friend's house or rent it.

If you buy it, good luck!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"Sonic Adventure 2 Battle is great! Graphics are nice, a bit better than the dreamcast version, but they're nothing big. The story rocks beyond anything else, though the end is sad it all gets better as soon as you play sonic heroes... but nevermind that. The music is so great I'm thinking about buying the soundtrack. The camera can be just slightly annoying, but you get used it. The chao garden is also fun. I once spent several hours messing around in the chao garden and only realised how long it had been when I looked at the clock, lol. I was a bit unhappy when I found out you only get to play as tails in the tornado, but it's not too bad. Definitely deserves a top-notch rating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Great Game!!","review":"This game is so freaken fun, its got everything 2 different story modes with new kind of weapons or moves you can get, great graphics,2 player games,u get to train up little chaos and race or fight with them, and the movies they have during the story mode levels are sweet. Out of the 4 games(pikmin,super smash bro. melee,luigi's mansion,and sonic 2) I got, this is my 2nd favorite, #1 is pikmin cause I just plain love this game. So yes I recommend this game to everyone even those people who just play sports games. The only downfall is the cheap camera angles thats what I hate about it thats why i brought it down to 4 stars but everything else about is awesome.

I just got it for my birthday a few weeks ago along with SSBM. Both of these games rule. I have read some of the reviews. One of them keeps on complaining about the voices. But honestly, who CARES! The story parts of the game are still really cool, though the way Tail's mouth moves along with the words does not fit. But anobody who doesn't want to get a game just because the story mode doesn't sound that great (which it does) is kind of creepy. I have to admit that the Tails and Robotnic levels are pretty boring, and I don't particularly love raising chao, and ONE of the multiplayer levels is extremely short and not fun at all, but that is a very small part of the game.

Now they can evolve!Oh, by the way, say hello to the dark side, Shadow, Dr eggmann/Robotnik, and rouge the bat.But before you start thinking this games the best, some stages are dull and you can't get enough of sonic and shadow, but it's probably the best game on game cube."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT SATISFIED","review":"The game did not work when we received it.

The music is not what I have expected it to be, and the camera angles really got me mad. It is hard to figure out what direction you are going because the screan is just spinning.

But it's so unfair!!! While GC gets all the big games like Sonic Adventure DX, Sonic Adventure 2: Battle and Sonic Mega Collection, us PS2 gamers get only the decent-but-multiplatform Sonic Heroes, the awful Shadow The Hedgehog and a toned down Mega Collection.

Well, that was probably the best game for the system. Sega saw that it was an awesome title and released four more. They all had the same exact control feel and it had the same exact object of the game, which was to defeat that fat, bald guy. I got bored of those games because of that reason. This game will be exactly like the other 3D Sonic games on the Dreamcast; repitive and boring. It is a fading classic and I hope they can fix it.

But gone is the side-scroller speed, quirky soundtrack (replaced with modern punk music), to-the-point objectives (too much puzzle solving slows the game down), and above all, effortless fun that the old \\"Sonic\\" was made famous for. One would be better satisfied to simply dig up an old Genesis console and \\"Sonic the Hedgehog\\" cartrige than play this uncreative 3-D version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice chandelier, horrendous packaging","review":"Looks nice, very elegant. However, it is packaged by the factory in rotten, old, thin cardboard boxes with hardly any protection other than a shabby layer of mostly-popped bubble wrap. The box doesn't even say \\"FRAGILE\\" or \\"GLASS\\" on it. To make it worse, Amazon shipped these shabby-looking boxes (which had been all taped together, definitely prior to shipping judging from how old the tape looked) without an outer box. Not surprising, then, that one of the two chandeliers I ordered arrived smashed in a million pieces. How sad when a company makes such nice stuff but takes such little care in packaging it. Amazon should have taken notice, complained to its supplier, and put the bad boxes into a cushioned outer box before shipping to its customer."},{"rating":"1","title":"nice at first","review":"When I first purchased these towels I was very happy. They were soft and luxurious. After a couple of months of use, I am very sorry I ever purchased them. While they are still thick, they have lost any softness they had. They are now great for exfoliating. Also, here's the strange part, the decorative border of the towels has shrunk 11 full inches in width. The towels are now ruffled on the ends. (Yes, I did follow the instructions on the care label.)They were a terrible waste of money. If you would like to purchase a truly luxurious towel, try Charisma Egyptian cotton towels. I have owned these in the past, and will be what I replace the ruffled sanding towels with. They are worth the extra few dollars."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"the music on the \\"noel, Noel!: Noels Francais/French Christmas Music (1200-1600) was not adequately represented in the sample online - much more discordant that I wished ; I also missed the info that it was ancient/pre-classical music"},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT book. High Quality and SUPERB Photography","review":"James Spada has published his best book yet. Not only are the nude men in this book BEAUTIFUL, but James Spada's use of light and shadows in his photography is remarkable. These are some of the most wonderful specimines of fine art photography I have ever seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Caveat emptor: Misleading and dull","review":"Sealed as it is cellophane, it is impossible to view the photography in this book before purchase. This is good for the publisher, because this is not a book of Edwardian men. It is a book of dull contemporary nudes rendered in sepiatone to give the illusion of the era. Spada is about as good a photgrapher as he is a biographer: unimaginative, cliche-ridden and dull. He has got away with terrible showbiz bios, but it is more difficult for him to shade his mediocrity in the realm of pictures. One sees rightoff a negligible talent. There must be excellent photographs of actual Edwardian men in archives in the UK, if not here in the US. Some enterprising chap should do us a favor and deliver the real thing. To buy this book is to lead to real disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Tale for Our Times","review":"Though written about an 18th Century activist, Paine's revolutionary ideas remain very timely--as much so (or perhaps even more) today as in the past. Trevor Griffiths' work combines superb scholarship with an exciting narrative. With a presumption of this being of a historical,scholarly nature, I figured that this might be a dry pedantic read. Was I ever wrong!--The book is full of adventure, drama, passion, romance, and grit, with important ideas thrown into the mix. Though a screenplay, the book was edited in such a way that it reads like a novel--a novel that you cannot put down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Olympic education!","review":"This video does not show highlights of the 1996 atlanta games.

I was pleased with the outcome because it is definitely a good book to help you get your mind right and your attitude right. Although most of the principles in this book are common knowledge for anyone who knows how to control themselves, it is a good refresher and will keep you in line."},{"rating":"2","title":"Timeless wisdom","review":"In our times of economic distress, we desperately need the wisdom taught in this book. The truth about finances will go a long way to solve the problem of poverty. The reason our economy is struggling is because too many people have forgotten these principles. This book is not that difficult to understand, and if enough people read it, our country would quickly return to prosperous times. It is written from a Christian perspective, but in such a way as to be acceptable to those of other religions. While that could offend some, we should remember to learn respect for the way others believe, even if we disagree. The only negative thing I found is several typo errors, I don't think they were in the original, but it is always easy to tell what is being said."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolute Wisdom- a great foundation for anyone struggling with depression, co-dependency, lack of direction","review":"This is not a self-help book written by a psychologist or counselor. This is philosophy in a direct way to life and living well. My description will not do this book any justice so I will simply encourage anyone who is thinking about buying and reading this book to do just that. This book helped change my life, helped me through a very deep depression, along with The Road Less Traveled and Anxious to Please.

There may be pieces of James Allen but it's kind of confusing. some reason I feel like I have been duped on this one. There are good principles in this book but it's not resonating like As a Man Think etc... Did somebody else write an update to this and not put in editor notes. Is there some other James Allen. Definitely not an original."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very unimpressive","review":"Aside from the atrocious editing in the Kindle edition that others have already pointed out, this is just not a very good book. It has nuggets of truth and inspiring passages, but it also contains utterly absurd statements. Allen romanticizes a world that never was and frequently demonstrates a shocking level of naivete regarding the world that is. In hindsight, I would not have wasted the time or the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works perfectly","review":"The built in unit in my home died so did some research online and the Channel Vision had great feedback, so I purchased it through Amazon.

I put a standard cat5 connection on the end each line. This enabled me to plug any line into this device if I want to use the line for phone, or plug it into a network switch if I want the line to be used for data. This gave me a great deal of flexibility. This unit is very well built. I have been using this for over two years now without any problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Megaphone looks good but does not work","review":"What a disappointment! I tried to avoid a cheap megaphone. I wanted something that could be used by an adult, not a child. So I did some hunting and found that Fanon made (so I thought) good megaphones. This short-range unit appeared to be perfect, even when I unpacked it. But then I saw the battery compartment, with the plastic cover required to \\"pressure\\" the batteries for electrical contact (some sort of cheap toy?). And then I saw the volume control, another crappily-built control. Here's what happened: 1) The megaphone did not work unless I kept one hand continually pressed down on the battery cover. 2)The fidelity was AWFUL, include feedback screeching. 3) The crappy volume control managed to stop the feedback only when set close to zero.In summary, Fanon must build quality megaphones but this is not one of them. This unit looks good but works like a cheap toy. (Yes, I did return it.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"SKB Rod Transport System","review":"Pretty well designed.

Although it is not aimed at a juvenile audience, it is likely to be helpful to teachers and parents who are nurturing storytelling in children -- particularly if they want to use reading aloud as a springboard to storytelling. Roney devotes nearly half of the book to reading aloud effectively. Most chapters include sections on story selection, preparation, and delivery. Practice activities and resources are also included. Only one chapter (about twenty pages) focuses directly on the storytelling craft."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointing for the serious reader.","review":"The most disappointing thing about this book is the title. The word \\"encyclopedia\\" suggests something fairly detailed. The book is just barely over 100 pages and is printed with large letters. It is a \\"monograph\\" rather than an \\"encyclopedia\\". The saints listed are almost all Greek or Latin. Almost no space is given to Slavic saints. However, it is a very easy read.

The manufacturers are right about the weight, our youngest weighs about 76lbs and cannot quite make it bounce. I chose it, rather than the pogo stick for younger kids, so it would last longer for all three kids. The reason I gave this product a possible 4/5 is that the foam on the handle bars, while seemingly strong, also looks prone to break after a few of the inevitable drops on the ground.

It was exactly what he wanted and he 'rode' it every day several times a day. Initially, the rubber tips came off after a couple of weeks. I didn't mind too much because he was obsessed with jumping on it all the time. A couple of months(if that) into having the pogo stick, as he was on it, the metal pieces separated and of course he went crashing to the ground. I don't think the product is made well enough. My son is well within the weight requirements and I wouldn't imagine it breaking within a month of two of having it, otherwise I definitely would not have bought it. Fifty bucks down the drain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good while it lasted","review":"My son was very excited to buy this pogo stick, he did his research and then used his own allowance to purchase. The pogo stick appeared sturdy when it arrived. The pogo stick performed well, he was happy with it while it worked. He was able to use for just under a month when the spring actually blew out of the pogo stick while he was using it. Luckily he was not hurt when this happened. This would have been good to know before buying this since he is now out the money and is not able to use the pogo stick.It is worth noting that my son only weighs 85 pounds so it was not as if he was too heavy for the thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"great fun","review":"Very fun product, and great exercise.

Pope had a wide-ranging career, and designed several fantastic buildings. Many of his residences were very fine, and this book does not adequately document them. Even working with the handicap that quite a few of these homes were demolished, I think that the authors did not provide nearly enough exterior photos, especially photos taken from different vantage points, to justify an expensive, large-format book. More floor plans of the different levels of more of the houses would have helped, too. Perhaps the biggest flaw was giving equal weight to a number of quite mediocre houses, houses that for the most part did not represent any special moment of innovation or composition. The writing can be repetitive as well. I will keep the book because it is a decent source of information on Pope's Washington, D.C. townhouses, but I suggest others try the books by Pennoyer and Walker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good in the Sun","review":"I bought this anti-glare filter thinking I would be able to sit outside and work, but there's still so much reflection that it's no use to me.

That being said I can't be 100% sure the result I'm getting now is due to the tabs alone. However I now don't rinse, scrub, pre-wash anything.

Never have to rinse it."},{"rating":"2","title":"great little dishwasher tablets!","review":"I used to use Cascade action packs until I found these. The Cascade ones would sometimes not completely dissolve through a wash cycle which in my opinion means my dishes are not clean because they did not get the soap they needed.

It was an Eco product that always cleaned pretty well even in very hard water. Suddenly all of my dishes and glasses had white, salty streaks, and the color started disappearing off of my expensive cookware. I also had streaks on the stainless steel interior of my dishwasher. I decided to try the sample Powerball Tabs that came with my dishwasher, and I was hooked. After a few cycles most of the white streaks on my Teflon/nylon kitchen tools was gone, the glasses and china sparkled, and the interior of the dishwasher gleamed. I use white vinegar as a rinse aid, rather than the more expensive commercial products."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helps with hard water spots","review":"I've had a hard time trying to find a diswashing detergent to help get rid of the hard water spots on my dishes, including making my own.

I will not be making that mistake again!I have never had as many dishes come out of the dishwasher dirty. In fact, I have had dishes go through several cycles and still not get clean. This is especially true of flatware.When I would use dishwashing powder, I was always conservative and only put a bit in each dispenser, so this is not about volume. I now have to resort to using 2 tablets in each cycle and I still have to cross my fingers that my dishes will come out clean. That means it is costing me over 35 cents for each load of dishes I have to do.I could not be more dissatisfied!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT working as advertised","review":"Contrary to its advertised, supposed effectiveness the cleaner has consistently failed to remove tea stains or baked-on foods such as lasagna.

Arrived with lid open about a third of the tablets are broken.The individual packaging of each tab has allowed them to still be usable.Love the product. Bad manufacturer packaging combined with Amazon's infamous one thing in an oversized box with little to no packaging contributed to the problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"The product has gone downhill","review":"I've been using this stuff for 11 years. It was originally Electrosol, which was a really fine product. In fact it was the only automatic dishwasher detergent on the market that wouldn't stain aluminum in the washer. Then it turned into Finish and the formula was changed, near as I can tell at least twice. Now it hardly gets my dishes clean even when I use an additional tab for prewash. Next time I'm buying something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"--- probably not ecofriendly; ++ finally gets the white film off my glassware","review":"We always use ecofriendly products, so I was seriously bummed to realize that our super earth-friendly dishwashing detergent was in cahoots with our semi-hard water to leave a subtle opaque buildup on our glasses and inside our high-end dishwasher. We put up with it for over a year, convinced we were just using too much detergent, the hard water was to blame, etc.Finally, when we ran out of detergent unexpectedly, I picked these up from our local supermarket and used it. I was surprised to see whole streaks of clean metal on the inside of the dishwasher door, where the white film was gone. And in one wash, most of the glassware was much cleaner; in 3 washes, the glasses looked brand, sparkling new again."},{"rating":"2","title":"I don't like to rinse my dishes prior to placing them in the dishwasher","review":"I have used Cascade and Finish in the past...and I always have food left on my dishes with Cascade. No food left with Finish. I will only buy Finish All in 1 Powerballs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to use and very effective","review":"The Powerball tablets are a lot cheaper than the Quantum tablets and seem to do the same job. They work with just glassware and with dirty, greasy pots and glassware. Quantum gets better reviews but we don't see any need for them. We use the Quantum tablet samples that came with our washer and then switched to Powerball with the same apparent results. BTW, we always use JetDry in the dispenser and use non-heated dry.Note that the Powerball instructions say not to use them with short wash cycles. Presumably, to do their work, they need the longer cycles common on new machines designed to work with phosphate free detergents."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finish Powerball Tabs got rid of my hard water stains","review":"Before I bought Electrasol Finish Powerball Tabs, I didn't know that there was a dishwasher detergent that could keep my glasses looking clear and new. I had been throwing out all my glasses every year and buying new ones because of the milky-looking mineral deposits on them. My dishes have a deep blue on the outside of them, and they were starting to look a bit chalky as well. I just figured all dishwasher detergents were the same and didn't even consider switching. Luckily for me, one day I saw Electrasol Finish Powerball Tabs for a screamin' deal at the grocery store. I picked them up, took them home, and within a week, all my hard water deposits were gone from my dishes. It was amazing! Sure, the individual wrappers on each tablet can be annoying, and the price might be a little more than what you're used to, but this product really works and will save you more money in the long run than if you stick with your current cheap detergent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than regular Cascade for the price.","review":"After all phosphates were removed from soap products regular Cascade just didn't cut it any more unless vinegar or something else was added. Tried the Finish Powerball Tabs as they were less expensive than Cascade Complete. They seem to work very well in our dishwasher. Our water isn't overly hard but we do not soften it either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing special for us","review":"I was excited about using Finish Powerball tablets given the reviews on Amazon. But in our experience, it was nothing special. It didn't get rid of already filmy residue on glasses, as some others reported, and it actually left some minor residue on some glassware, plates, and plastic utensils. Cascade Complete did a better job, and we'll return to using that when this box runs out. First-time users of Finish, don't get your hopes up too high."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best dishwasher detergent I've ever used","review":"I happened to read a Consumer Reports magazine while waiting somewhere, and they recommended several Finish products as the best for dishwashers. I am not that happy with Cascade, so I found these on Amazon for a decent price (and my favorite, free shipping!) and am very happy with this product. I like the convenience of opening a tablet and putting it in the dispenser cup, and just can't really find any negatives about this product at all. I wish I had known about this product years ago because I haven't had clean dishes and glassware like I've had from Finish. I plan to use these from now on, and whenever I see them offered with free shipping I will order and stock up."},{"rating":"2","title":"FINISH dishwashing Powerball Tabs","review":"Love these.

I have enough in this 3-pack to do dishes for a very long time!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"These work very well","review":"Consumer Reports rated these a best buy, and I can totally see why. They work very well, and even in my less than stellar dish washer the dishes do get clean and don't have water spots."},{"rating":"2","title":"As Good As Anything Else But Doesn't Always Clean Heavily-Soiled Pans","review":"I've been as happy with this product as with most others for washing dishes. I have noticed that I still have times when heavily-soiled pots and pans don't get clean even when I run them through several times. The 5 stars are because I'm not sure any other product would have done any better. Other than the fact that no dishwashing product is perfect and this one is no exception, I've been pleased with the results."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love these","review":"I have tried many different types of dishwasher detergent. I've tried other brands and I've tried Finish powder. None of them get my dishes clean like the Finish Powerball Tabs.

I've bought them in the store and really enjoyed them. I thought buying these with the Subscribe and Save would be a great way to get them. However the box I received has many broken or crushed. Very few are whole and therefore cannot work as well as they normally do. The price was great, the product bought elsewhere is great, but buying it off of Amazon was a disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't believe it's actually better than Cascade!","review":"I am one of those that buys the same products I remember my mom using while I was growing up-- Windex, Tide, Downy, Dawn, and Cascade. In fact, up until recently I have never even thought of purchasing a different brand of dishwashing soap/tablets. When it came time to buy it again I realized I was sick of the nasty, chalky film that my beloved Cascade left behind. I picked up these Finish Powerballs instead of the Cascade tablets and I'm so glad I did.Cleans dishes wonderfully! No gross chalky film. We also began to use white vinegar instead of Jetdry and have had great results. Definitely will continue purchasing Finish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh","review":"It's not really any better, as far as I can tell, than any other dishwasher tablets I've used. Although it, for the most part, gets off food residue, there is ALWAYS left over soap residue over my dishes. I end up having to wipe/rinse off almost everything after it comes out.I know that, for environmental reasons, phosphorous was removed from many dish-washing detergent solutions, which led to less cleaning power (would generally still leave rings and residue). Finish, however, still uses phosphorous in their products, which leads me to believe they would clean your dishes better than the phosphorous-free alternatives. This is not the case.Main point here: I don't recommend these tabs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smells awful","review":"When the item arrived it smelled so bad we could notkeep it in the house.

The songs sound like they are trying to be like the Beatles and other Brit pop genre music.In this brit pop gone bad CD The Kaiser Chiefs have abandoned any resemblance to punk. The songs are boring and repetitive with no inspiring beat. The lyrics are lame!!Wow! What the hell happened!?If you were a fan of the first CD, you'll most likely hate this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"No sophomore slump","review":"A read of the UK site suggests that the angry mob didn't like this second album as much as its predecesor. From my point of view, its hard to fault, except perhaps that the delivery is a little too tightly crafted--I'd have liked a little more instrumentation and a little less verse-chorus-verse. Their live shows they have the chops and its time they used them. Still, a very good album and one that hasn't been out of my car stereo for a week now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ehh...","review":"...Buzzcock wannabes. Not a terrible record.

This phone is quite clear within about 40-50 feet of the base, but in our house this doesn't take you far. Get beyond that range, and you might be able to find a position in which to hold the phone that it's not staticky, but if you move a couple inches, you get static again.Another nit: the memory dial only stores 20 digits, which isn't enough to program an MCI calling card, for example.We're going to try the AT&T 5830 next, and we'll see how that works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of garbage!

Bad reception with all kind of noises. People could hardly hear me on the other end talking.I wonder how a decent company can make such a bad product? I hope they don't manufacture cars or airplanes one day or we'll all be in trouble...!I truly wonder why the companies are manufacturing such garbage lately? I believe it is true what some say, that they want you to come back and purchase a new phone each year!

But this one's going back too...why pay more for what is basically the same performance?Again: DON'T BELIEVE THE ADVERTISING B.S. !!!!I'm giving this phone 1 star not for its actual performance, but for the absolutely shameless advertising HYPE around it.(This is kind of like a 3.0GHz PC compared to a 1.2GHz PC: with 90% of commonly used applications, their performance is virtually identical...only you'll pay a lot more for the bigger number GHz.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Audio Quality","review":"The Uniden EXI 5160 is by far the best sounding phone we've ever owned, and that includes corded phones.

It works well without interfering with my Wi-Fi Router. I programmed it to use with phone card to dial 3 long digit strings and it works. The phone is pretty easy to program without using the manual to figure it out but to dial those programmed numbers u must know the trick. The sound quality is pretty good (better than my other 900MHz phones). I noticed when I am ~30 ft away from the base station, the digits it dial is become somewhat slow but still working.

The voice quality and sound is crystal clear. You cannot beat this phone price and quality. It even looks great sitting on my night stand. Just the right size."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not recommend","review":"We purchased this phone and have never been happy with it from day one. First of all, the volume is really low on this phone, even with the volume all the way up, it is still hard to hear the person you are talking to.

In contrast to Niesenson's recent work on this album, this book provides a great deal of new information. The description of the studio itself, an old church, and the engineers who recorded the album and their methods and equipment was fascinating. The book captures not only the almost supernatural alignment of the jazz moons of three of the most dominant figures in jazz, Miles/Trane/Evans, but it also explains the practical business of producing and promoting jazz albums in this time period. I simply could not put it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crazy Coil Worm Float","review":"Ordered this item for my grand daughter in Alabama although we live in Texas.

Good transaction and shipping."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Complement to Statistics Texts","review":"This reference is a good complement to a collection of standard statistics texts. Often, those texts have good explanations of their concepts. But then provide only limited tables of commonly encountered distributions. Part of this may be that to those authors, such tables let them add relatively little value. To an author, her value is in her origina musings, and not necessarily in filling the latter part of her book with reams of tables.Thus, there is a natural inclination of statistics authors to only provide a modicum of tables. The barest minimum! Well, your answer to this might be to amass several texts, so that hopefully, the tables you need can be found in one of these.An alternative is to get this book. Not a text, but a reference manual. Though the editors thoughtfully precede the tables with brief explanations of their usage and some cogent examples. You will find here the most commonly needed distributions in an easy to find and use format."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works but slows down internet connection","review":"I needed an 8-port router to add access points in the house.

It has been ok (mostly meh though for the geeks who may be reading) but its features are somewhat vague to setup even for an experienced user. The port forwarding and firewall setup screens are annoying and quirky with stuff like not letting you edit / select / deselect depending on what its got going on at that moment. Would I buy one again? Most definitely no. Could/would I recommend it for somebody - again no.

It worked OK day to day and this ran a small office of about 10 people but about about 2 or 3 times I found it mysteriously dead in the morning as if it suffered a stroke in the middle of the night and only a reset would bring it back. To the unit's credit, it never croaked during business hours but this morning it croaked for the final time and even a 30/30/30 factory restore wouldn't bring it back. I had the unit protected with industrial strength power conditioners so I do not expect that my power blew it out. I also had problems with saving port fowarding rules regardless of what firmware used as other reviewers mentioned. I eventually got them to stick but it was not easy.The feature set is great for the money but it just isn't built to last but I guess that is what you can expect for the price.

Tempting... I have 3 gone bad in less than 2 years on average. Warranty is only 1 year. The first one died shortly after 1 year of operation. I replaced it and purchased the 3rd unit two months later for our brand new second location. On my 3rd unit I got an extended 2 year warranty but it died 1 month after the extended warranty expired. Actually, both died at about exactly the same: just a little over 2 years - two months apart. Nobody can convince me that this is coincidence.I moved away from Linksys because their SOHO equipment line forgot about the Small Office and focuses only in the Home Office and Home devices. I have had my prejudices about other brands like Netgear, SMC, Allied Telesyn, Belkin and 3Com but I am reconsidering these brands.

However, I thought after reading the reviews that it would suffice. If you've ever tried counting the heart beats of a cat (170+ beats a minute), you'll know that it is a task just getting to the point that you can hear the heart beat. This stethoscope did the trick. Easily pick up the heart beat. Use it frequently. It works nicely for humans too. My other half also has a heart issue so he frequently uses this stethoscope too. You know you are getting old when you bring it out when company is over and compare heart rhythms. (Yes, we are getting there and we have done exactly that).

In comparision, I would say spend the extra money for the cardiology stethoscope it's worth it. I will be putting this one up for sale on Craigs list. I could hear a bruit with my old stethoscope that I could not appreciate with this one, and as a provider, that is not a good thing.

Years ago, I was wondering how my classmates and residents (all of whom seemed to have the Cards-III) could hear murmurs and stuff, and I couldn't! As a resident now, I'm glad I own one. One day, I forgot my own Cards-III, and had to borrow a colleague's stethoscope (it was a Classic II SE). Even though her Classic II SE was also a Littman, I still couldn't hear as clearly through that, as I did the Cards-III.On the downside, it is rather pricey.

I am constantly telling people to hold on while I try and get closer to the base, and sometimes that does not even help with the static. In addition, the TALK button is unusually large and I tend to hang up on people if I try and put the phone on my shoulder. Callers also complain that the volume on the answering machine is very low and they can not hear the message. I have re-recorded several times.

And from Stockholm, Lewi Pethrus went on to spread his form of the gospel all around the world. (The Pentecostal church in Brazil now numbers over 30 million members.)

Secondly, the satellite speakers have noticeable distortion in the midrange frequencies, so much so that I had to stop playing one particular song because I was getting headache from it.I eventually sent these back and picked up the Klipsch ProMedia 2.1 speakers and I've been very happy ever since.

A google search should bring you to this nearly 100 page review of the book. There has been no conspiracy to manipulate the word of God or theology since the first century; there has only been a search for truth. BeDuhn is not immune to bias or his own hidden but evident theological beliefs that peek through the text.

David BeDuhn displayed this quality in his book. I am an Jehovah's Witness and appreciated his objectivity in producing this book. When you look on the Internet, you can find any number of 'hack jobs' against the NWT i.e. 'Bad translation', 'Poor translation', 'Produced by individuals that were lacking skills as Greek translators'. It seems that the translators of the NWT were wise in remaining anonymous, in that the translation would stand on it's own virtue, not the translators. David BeDuhn, not a Jehovah's Witness, did not have an ax to grind, he just set out on a quest to find the Truth. If you are interested in learning about Bible translation, this is MUST reading.

BeDuhn delivers an easy to digest scholarly work that is unbiased in its own right. His critical approach seems scientific and trustworthy, and his conclusions well-proven. It helps eliminate confusion about the reliability of Bible translations. He also unexpectedly unravels the translation process. He weaves in enough of hermeneutics that one is able to learn that translation is not an exact science, but a necessarily subjective one in many ways. Although it only considers 9 translations, readers are left with a sort of mental template by which to critique any translation. This is a must read for Bible readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book, So Jehovah's Witnesses are the most accurate after all","review":"This is very interesting reading material.

Why are humans so egocentric when it comes to our origens. The world in not 6,000 years old, we are not special, and our self-centered elistist Christian ideals will be the death of our civilization.

Reading it was like watching a movie. The story is very exciting and the vocabulary great. I could not guess who the killer was. It really shocked me when I found who he was at the end. I was at the edge of my seat. It was interesting seeing the attorney going through different emotions and suspicions. Her own son is charged with murder and she is trying the case of a homicide detective who is charged with murder. She is a single mom raising two kids and trying to enhance her career and take care of her love life. It is brilliant how the writer brings everything together at the end. I really enjoyed the story and bought 9 copies for friends. I will be ordering more.I read this book on a plane to Australia. It really helped with the long boring flight.

But there is a BIG problem - the title is wrong! It is not a \\"comprehensive\\" listing of her patterns and shapes as the cover implies, but those produced by the A J Wilkinson factory between 1910 and 1964. It has endless pages of pottery by John Butler a little known designer who worked at the factory from 1910-1930, and also obscure floral patterns by Clarice Cliff's sister Dolly. It also includes many printed patterns whereas every Clarice collector seeks her hand-painted ware. A collector who knows more about this than I do went through the patterns and found 40% of those listed are not by Clarice herself. Also, nearly all the images were supplied by an auction house, so it looks just like an auction catlogue, NOT an art pottery book. I have nearly all the Clarice Cliff books and this was the most expensive and least informative."},{"rating":"2","title":"An essential tool for the Clarice collector","review":"This is an extraordinary achievement, leaving for dead most of the previous publications on Clarice Cliff.

Yes having a bulb last two months is better than two weeks. What made these bulbs worse than the dollar store brand was the fact they had the propensity to explode. All six of the bulbs purchased blew out on average within two months of being used with two exploding. Does it have anything to do with my house? Quite possibly. My home is old however I had never had any bulbs, no matter how much or little I spent on them, explode until using this brand.

(This is the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars.)The feathers are attached well enough, but if your cat likes to chew on cords or string then watch the cat carefully when it is playing with Da Bird. My cat has chewed through the strings of 3 different Da Birds and tying the ends back together really doesn't work since the next time the cat grabs the feathers, the feathers come disconnected from the pole.

At this point, I had to put it away - hid it in a closet - and she STILL kept at it, trying to open the closet door.Do not let your cat play with this toy unsupervised, if he/she's anything like my Gremlin, he/she will DESTROY this toy. As in, eat the feathers. Om nom nom.

They love the noise it makes in the air which is supposed to mimic the sound of a bird flying.I recommend putting it away in the closet because the cats will destroy the bird attachment fairly quickly. They love tearing it to pieces on its own. I also recommend getting the value pack since I've already had to attach a replacement feather and it's only been about 2 months since my purchase.

In May 2010, we purchased a new Da Bird and noticed the design is completely different from the Original Da Bird. In the original design, the feather was a ball-chain connect and the handle was one long, heavy piece of plastic. The new design uses what looks like a fishing lure (which is very sharp and I had to cover it with duct tape), and the handle is in two pieces, which separates, thin and flimsy. The feather no longer flutters like a bird, but merely soars through the air. It's obvious from my review that I am displeased with the design changes. I will now be on a mission to find a different bird toy that is sturdy and emulates a flying, fluttering bird.

Then repeat this after another few seconds of play.Comparing this string with our old one, I can see that they are made from different materials. The new one looks cheap.

I haven't had any problems with it since then.One last thing: If you leave this sitting where your cat can get at it, they will. The feathers seem to be way too tempting and my cats will hunt it down, drag the whole thing (stick and all!) to a location of their choice, and chew on the feathers.

The book describes history in light of \\"social justice\\". Social justice is defined as redistribution of wealth and political power from those that have it to those that do not. History is defined by deviding it into those periods in which progress was made in redistributing the wealth and power, and those periods when progress in those areas were not made. Anything towards that end is described as good, and vise versa. In my humble opinion, this book is scary and should be a must read by everyone who plans on going into a voting booth. The book gives you a clear idea of why liberals want bigger and bigger government and ever increasing taxes, but directly from their game plan/text book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little biased","review":"This book is very liberal, which I expected from a social work book, but tends to sound biased in its presentation of topics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well written propaganda.","review":"The author does a good job going through each presidency.

All of these clips were filmed in the early to mid nineties and are all performances from Evening At The Improv. If you are a die hard fan of these ladies and really must own everything on DVD, then buy this, otherwise you are much better off just buying their individual stand up routines. The dvd advertises that its uncensored, but here is the catch, all the appearances were filmed for TV, so they are already all censored. Im sorry I bought this collection. I dont want you to be too.

Originally published under the pseudonym Paul Kavanagh, just like the first Kavanagh SUCH MEN ARE DANGEROUS, Block exceeds the reader's expectations in the unique creation of a taut, tense and memorable novel about a hired political assassin who falls in love with a girl who proves that his actions are very very wrong. The plan is to overthrow the current US government through careful manipulation of the general public through murder after murder of high-profile political figures representing all causes and extremes. Dorn's cruel calculating violence is a marvel to behold, and so are counter-reactions in the public and political spheres. A tragic figure in tragic times. A very powerful novel. If it isn't in print - find it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A work of Lawrence Block that shows his early years","review":"This is an interestng, but in my opinion, poorly written tale by Lawrence Block. In this novel, Block is too obsessed with dialogue. That is the only way the story is told. Instead of the rich extra thinkings of the hero that we usually get from Block, this character is only seen through his speech, giving us an unclear view of what could be a great, tragic figure. Otherwise, the story is interesting. All in all, if I could have known him better, maybe Miles Dorn would have deserved the title evil."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lady Campbell is at it again!","review":"Yes Lady Campbell is at it again!

I recommend them highly to model builders."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good","review":"I thought this was one of the best books out of the 5 I've read so far. I really liked the beginning; how it had him in Cimmeria. I also enjoyed how Cimmerian beliefs and customs were explained throughout the story as well. Taharka and company weren't bad villains, and the whole thing with the priests was pretty cool. One of my favorite sections of the book would have to be all of the action at Croton. I thought the part with the circus caravan was dumb, but it did serve its purpose, and it was hard imagining the bandits setting up a cave base like they did. Overall, I thought it was really good, but I gave it a 4 because of minor things that I thought were stupid and the end seemed rushed and kind of weak. However, I would recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Safety Hazards and MISinformation","review":"I'd really like to give this book NO starts, but I guess that's not an option. I am returning my copy. I can't believe the safety hazards this woman takes with LYE. It is a HIGHLY caustic material. (which Ms. Inlow does state) However, In her instructions she syas to pour your liquids into your lye... DO NOT DO THIS! Other than creating a volcano effect which could boil over and out of the container in which the mixing is taking place, due to Lye being considered a HAZMAT(Hazardous Material) it is actually illegal to do your mixing this way in some states.. PLEASE check with your local HAZMAT safety regulations before following her instructions.Misinformation: After studying soapmaking for over two years, I have learned that CASTILLE soap must have at least 50% olive oil in it, or the name must be changed.

SEVERAL of her recipes are lye heavy and the soap made WILL burn the skin. She instructs the reader to use massive quantities of certain essential oils, such a cassia that are known to be caustic on the skin. The author obviously has not ever used the soap she's instructing to make. If she had, she would be red, raw and probably blistered. What a shame, so many will be injured by using a soap book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good book","review":"This book was short on safety facts for new soapmakers and short on content for experienced soapers.

I did like the spiral bound design."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strange book","review":"I bought this book to learn. Well, what I learned was this book stinks. There are many empty pages, it seems like most of her soaps are the same base soap and just switch the additives (fragances, etc) and the section about how to turn soapmaking into a busness was a farce.

A list of suppliers or something would have helped also."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not alot of variation","review":"I Bought this book hoping to learn some new recipes.

This story of 'second-time around' drew out the pain and confusion that married couples get themselves locked into sometimes, and the chance to have a go at the partnership one more time doesn't happen often. But to Rags and Tell it did. This time they used the wisdom their empty years had given them and they shared their feelings instead of making up the other's truth in their own minds.

Receiving a gift is bittersweet for Filipinos because the giver has some control over you now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Culture Book","review":"This book is very easy to read. The layout is friendly, and the content is interesting, and educational. The Philippines is a country that appears to be Western. Many Filipinos speak English, and Manila can appear deceivingly Western. But the author points out that the Filipino way of life has not really changed over the past 500 years. When one digs underneath the Western veneer, the Filipino is really much different than the Westerner. And this difference manifests itself in relationships, communication, and values.This book is great reading for anyone planning on living or visiting the Philippines. No Westerner should be ignorant of the cultural differences between the Philippines and the West.

I hope it's updated regularly with newer data.One reviewer asked for more of a practitioner approach. Wow, what a waste that would have been. This book is geared to looking at the outputs of what practitioners are doing. To actually present a methodology would have been bizarre.Dry and academic? Not for me.

All the other reviews aren't wrong, they just don't get at the fact that very little in this book can be put to actual use. It's too intellectual, too academic. Where it almost seems to offer something tangible, it in fact is only offering carefully thought out frameworks. Unfortunately, frameworks in todays world are relatively cheap and as plentiful as there are relatively intelligent minds. More useful for a practitioner would be a book offering checklists of specific actions. As far as why I have a right to say that? I manage several teams of developers, churning out real code daily.

I am glad that I popped it in before I had him watch it (which would have been like pulling teeth for him to do) because this was a complete wast of the $10 I paid for it at my local store. there are NO steps taught. only some technice ideas. it is mainly a showing of the 2 dancers doing their own thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully drawn, erotic lesbian elf-girls!!!","review":"Overall, I would rate this one a pleasant surprise. Too often, I've found these graphic-erotica books to contain a pretty cover drawing but then inside it's all raunchy XXX-porn. That's not the case with this one! The elf girls are very pretty, and their Katmite slave girls are very attractive as well. There's a lesbian-theme throughout this book which I found to be really hot. On the negative side, it's to-be-continued, with only the first part of an apparently long story told. Will I purchase book two?

Max McLean's original recording of the NT was anointed, like God reading his Word to the listener through McLean. The original OT was tedious, a work by someone impressed with their own press releases, thrilled with the sound of his own voice. This re-recording is even worse than the old OT production. McLean is even more pompous. Arrogance resounds throughout, out-shouting the Word. There is not a shred of honest zeal in this commercial venture. I'm sure the LORD will provide another voice to draw us into His testimony... until then... if you can find a copy of the original New Testament release buy it.

When I became the director of an English program in Vietnam, I wanted to pack an entire suitcase of books and build a reference library for EFL instructors. Unfortunately, weight matters. So I could only take a few books. This fantastic book made that short, and rather exclusive, list.

The first 4 tracks are unquestionably great from the very hip rocker \\"Mumbo\\" to the more whimsical \\"Bip Bop\\" to the soulful \\"Wildlife\\". Those tunes easily demonstrate how cool early 70s rock could be. After that the songs become more fitting of a romantic interlude which I at one time had the good fortune to experience to this album ;) There's never anything jarring about this album, which again makes it good for a little background romance music, and the first half is at least undeniably cool in a rock sense. A 1971 entry that shows a little of how great the music in that year could be. The 'Paul McCartney Collection' edition of this CD has 4 bonus tracks for a total of 14. No regrets about owning \\"Wild Life\\". It's my second favorite after Venus And Mars, though I've been listening to \\"Wild Life\\" more recently."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice is not a crime","review":"Back in the early 70's, McCartney's output was unfairly criticised because he was seen as the man who broke up the Beatles, and then spent his life being a happy family man, instead of a headline grabbing world trotter like Lennon. Due to this, his early albums (up to and including Red Rose...) were unfairly attacked. This is still seen in the critisism of his early records today. Allthough it must be said that 'Ram' has gotten a lot of positive press in later years. As Lennon turned out to be an uninspired solo artist, Harrison kept making the same album over and over, and Ringo... Well, the novelty wore off. McCartney finally conqoured the World in his own right, with Band On The Run.The prevailing sense of what was hip and what was not in 1971/72 should not keep us from enjoying, in 2007, what is an album of fine, and at times great pop songs. If nothing else, this is a historical first recording, from one of the 70's greatest bands, The Wings."},{"rating":"1","title":"False start for Wings","review":"Although this album has a couple of lovely songs (Some people never know, Tomorrow), overall it's quite disappointing. Strange enough, the 1st Wings album, sounds more like a lo-fi effort by Paul & Linda. But then without really great songs that McCartney and Ram did have. Together with 'Give my regards' McCartneys poorest effort ever. And yet, some of it is fascinating."},{"rating":"1","title":"new band releases practice tape","review":"Once in a while a glimpse of a melody shines through the mix of half-baked ideas and lousy production, as in \\"Tomorrow\\" and \\"Some People Never Know\\". Quickly, though these glimmers are ham-fisted into submission by the neophyte band of seasoned professionals, packaged and released for public consumption, just in time for a tour. Why should we care? Because it's Paul, ex of The Beatles. The only reason to buy this album is to place all other albums by McCartney (and most other humans) into perspective. Shite, to be sure, but the bonus tracks are fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wings' Wild Life is something of a honeymoon","review":"Wings' Wild Life is something of a honeymoon, a very romantic album with Paul and Linda duetting throughout and having a very romantic feeling permeating.So the silly love song king was also a wild raving animal, or so the concept of 'wild life' seems, complete with gruff rumblings and tarzan-like wails to prove the point. Nonetheless (big words make you look intelligent) (or a dopey try-hard), the Wild Life album is characterised by passionate vocals, strong hooks, deep grooves that are easy to get stuck into, and, often, beatiful melodies.But the amateurishness sometimes outweighs the good points. Also, is the rumour that He recruited Denny Laine just because his name rhymes with one of McCartney's best songs true? He obviously didn't think he was too talented, Denny was always limited to one song per album!

It was recorded over just a few days with a fresh band and it feels that way. Songs like LOVE IS STRANGE and WILD LIFE are half finished and tunes like MUMBO, BIP BOP and I AM YOUR SINGER are just worthless junk.The bonus tracks are nice. Give Ireland Back To The Irish is McCartney's best attempt at having a backbone in his solo career. Mary Had A Little Lamb is a garbage response to the BBC banning \\"Irish\\". It have no musical value. Little Woman Love is a nice underrated track from that era. Mama's Little Girl is a lovely little acoustic track that remained unreleased until 1989 or 1990 on the Put It There CD single. It very well may be the best track on the disc."},{"rating":"1","title":"ABSOLUTE RUBBISH","review":"I don't know how anyone can rate this album highly. I've been a McCartney booster for years, and own a lot of his work, but this is almost unlistenable.In summary-- the songs sound unfinished, the playing is tentative and the recording is low-fi. McCartney had said he wanted something spontaneous and while a great idea in principle, it works better if the band has played together for some time.I give this album a star because of two extras-- 'Give Ireland Back To The Irish' and 'Mary Had A Little Lamb' are surely McCartney's most controversial tracks, and are essential listening to any real fans of the great man's work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning...","review":"Having experienced the UT demo in 1999, I decided to purchase Totally Unreal, knowing very well that it would install and run superbly on my new Dell 1.7 Ghz computer system.

His path crosses that of Syd, a girl who has adventured out into the wilds to seek revenge. Bill Hinton may well be who they both seek, or he may just be one of the scaliest rascals loose in a time of buffalo soldiers, feuds, and constant lawless scrapes of all kind.If you expect westerns to be shoot-'em-ups with men in white hats facing off against men in black hats you are in for a pleasant surprise.

It sounds like a really bad electronic synthesizer, and effectively negates any enjoyment one might receive from this album. If you enjoy Scarlatti on the harpsichord, seek out instead Christophe Rousset on Decca, Bob Van Asperen on EMI, or, if you can find it, Trevor Pinnock on Archiv. For Scarlatti on the piano, I reccomend Ivo Pogorelich on Deutsche Grammophon, Andras Schiff on Hungarton, Mikhail Pletnev on Virgin Classics, Joanna MacGregor on Collins, and of course, anything by Vladimir Horowitz."},{"rating":"2","title":"Practical Guide for Do-it-Yourself Wedding","review":"As a seamstress, who has been commissioned for several weddings, I really appreciated the sound advice given in this easy to read manual.

Alexander to be an ideal baroque music singer but here she does a wonderful job: she understands her role and is really expressive. H.P. Blochwitz is also marvelous here. The rest of the soloists and the choir are worth listening to, if not great. The orchestra and N.

I put two of the 4 batteries that came in the package in a wireless mouse; two days later, the batteries were dead. I replaced the other two batteries in the same wireless mouse and they were dead as well. All four batteries had been fully charged prior just moments before placing the two batteries in to the wireless mouse. I don't know, but I think I got a bad batch. All the positive reviews and I end up with 4 that are worthless."},{"rating":"1","title":"one year, little use","review":"We purchased four of these batteries less than a year ago, two of the four are dead, beyond recharging capabilities, according to the LaCross charger. Used less than three or four times at the most. Poor quality. In comparison, I'm still using the RayoVac AA rechargeables we purchased about ten years ago or more.Sanyo 2,700 mAh AA NiMH Rechargeable Batteries (4-Pack)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless","review":"Maybe I am doing something wrong. These batteries were consistently rated among the best of all the rechargeables. I purchased 2 packages of 4 along with a LaCrosse charger. I charged them completely at a slow rate. When fully charged, I put into my Canon powershot camera. Lasted maybe 15 minutes. Tried another pair. Same thing. Put 2 more in a remote control. Same thing again. Wireless mouse- same. Everything I put these batteries into fails after a few minutes. All my other rechargeables, from Kodak to Duracell to cheapy no-name brands from WalMart last for several days, if not weeks. Same charging technique, same charger. Each time I charge the Sanyos, they either last only a few moments if used immediately, or lose their charge overnight. I am extremely disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good performance; good capacity","review":"While I have only had these in service for 2 months, they are, thusfar, performing well. They have superior capacity, with a rating which seems to be closer to the truth than some others. Their rechargability has been excellent. Regarding long term reliability: I will need to wait to form an accurate opinion. While most would prefer a lower cost, I prefer not to sacrifice performance to achieve it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy these batteries. Go for Powerex.","review":"These batteries go bad within a month. Lose their strength after a month of use. Crappy batteries. Total regret of buying these. Compared to Powerex, these are no where near the quality. Bought a few sets of Powerex a month later and they last longer than these crappy Sanyo 2700 batteries. I am a strobist (photographer) and I need reliable, long last batteries. So far Powerex batteries are the only ones have been dependable. Don't buy these if you need a lot of rechargeable batteries like I do. Normal consumer can't tell a difference that's why they are giving these 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"I have used *many* types of rechargeable batteries in my day (I have kids with plenty of gadgets) and these are not very good. I would give them 1 star but they do *work*, just very poorly.I hate to be one of \\"those people\\", but seriously, save your money and buy Eneloop.I do not understand all the positive reviews for these batteries. Perhaps my usage is nonstandard, but I do not think so. I have mostly used them in Wiimotes and now they last only a few hours (after only maybe 5 or so recharges!).My charger is a high quality Maha, so I do not think that is an issue (my Eneloops and other batteries charge very well with it).Note that I have never used these batteries for any sort of cameras."},{"rating":"1","title":"not as I expected","review":"product not as expected, have another brand of 2000 maH bateries which hold a better charge in canon camera than these do. Thought that be purchasing the 2,700mAh batteries that they would last longer. I was wrong,at least with this brand.look into another brand if you want LONG lasting batteries."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fantastic yet Horrible","review":"The first set of these I bought from a different vendor were fantastic. They lasted 2 years in a frequently used camera. I only recharged then because I was going to a cycle meet and knew I would be taking hundreds of shots and I didn't want them to die in the field. They were still working after 2 years use, but I recharged them anyway to be sure.Then one day my cordless phones needed new batteries. I immediately bought these Sanyo 2700's due their previously proven performance. I don't know if this is a bad batch or what, but these suck. Sometimes my camera won't even turn on after a fresh charge. I have recycled them endlessly in my MH-C204F charger. On last attempt I recycled them 4 consecutive times and put them away in a drawer. One week later they were dead - and that's under no load whatsoever. I think I will try some eneloops next. These are trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"For my application, the BAD outweighs the GOOD","review":"First off, this review is based on my experience and not scientific tests. I purchased 8 of these for use with my Nikon SB-900 and SB-600 flashes. When they are fresh out of the charger (La Crosse BC9009) they will recycle the flash extremely fast and last for about 150 shots. However, if I charge them and leave them in my camera bag for a 3 days I'll get about 50 shots. If I charge them and leave them in my bag for a week, they are stone dead. Overall, the batteries that were included with my La Crosse charger (Lacrosse 2600's) out perform the Sanyo 2700 by about 2 fold (again, not scientific). I've been testing a set of 4 Eneloops for about a month and I really like them. The Eneloops give me more overall shots and hold a charge for considerably longer - there is a small hit on the recycle time, but for me the upsides of the Eneloops outweigh this."},{"rating":"2","title":"best i've had","review":"after using duracell, energizer, kodak and a few others, i got these sanyos and they are by far the best ones. now, the bc-900 charger makes a lot of difference too.long life, well built. last 30% longer than my previous 2500mah energizers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great batteries but ....","review":"Personally, I own a couple of sets of the Sanyo AA 2700mah cells and they work well and have a great shelf life, measured in months not days.But ... I'm not sure how much variation there is in the manufacturing quality control. Sanyo makes Eneloops, which have an excellent reputation - so, you would think that this would hold true for the rest of Sanyo's battery line. However the folks at CPF (an eclectic group of flashlight, batteries, and EDC fanciers) have had mixed experience.Reference: […]I would give the Sanyo AA 2700mah cells five stars based on my own experience, but I'll deduct one star based on other published reports. I would buy this product again. And I do recommend it to others for purchasing, if they cannot afford the Powerex 2700mah cells and if they need more \\"oomph\\" than the Eneloop 2000mah cells."},{"rating":"1","title":"Capacity not as advertised","review":"I bought these batteries on the basis of the positive reviews I read here, but my experience was not as good as others. In particular, I did not get the consistency of capacity that R. Anderson reported. I used the Lacrosse BC-9009U charger's testing function to measure the capacity and got widely different numbers for the four cells, ranging from under 1000 maH to 2100 maH. I believe those numbers to be accurate, since in actual use the cells differed widely as well.Perhaps the manufacturing process or quality control has changed since others had good experiences with these cells."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not hold charge","review":"I bought two packs of 4's of these Sanyo 2700mAh rechargables and a LaGrosse charger through Amazon. I also bought 4 Duracell 2450 mAh rechargables from a local pharmacy. I used the batteries in my Canon point-and-shoot camera. The Sanyos lose their charge quickly; I would go through several pairs a day on normal camera usage. In contrast, the Duracell's can last a few days on a pair. I'm buying more of Duracells."},{"rating":"2","title":"They pack some power...","review":"I use these babies for my off-camera flashes, and they work like a charm. After shooting for hours with them, the recycle times for my flashes hardly go up, if at all. I'm rating number of recharges as 4 stars because I haven't had them long enough - but I am fully anticipating that that won't disappoint, either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really delivers close to 2700mAh","review":"The BC-900 recharger indicates that the batteries delivers nearly 2700mAh. This is far better than all of the other batteries that I have bought.I bought 4 packs for my Nikon flash units and it seems that the flash unit is ready for another flash much quicker than other batteries.Buy the BC-900 recharger when the price is about $39. It really is worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Money Money","review":"Don't be fooled by the 2,700 mAh. These batteries have a very short life per charge cycle and lots of memory effect even when refreshed and recharged with a La Crosse Technology BC-700 Alpha Power Battery Charger. Batteries fail completely after a very low number of recharges. Go for the Sanyo eneloop 8 Pack AA NiMH Pre-Charged Rechargeable Batteries. You'll be glad you did."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of money: Buy the Sanyo eneloop batteries instead","review":"These batteries don't hack it. When recharged (and I have a good charger), I'm lucky if they last 10 days without discharging...even if not used. In comparison, the Sanyo eneloop rechargeables are much, much better. Not only do they hold a charge well, they stand up well to moderate duty use. We have had good luck with the eneloop in our Canon camera. The Sanyo 2700's don't last well there, and they won't even effectively power a cordless mouse...a much lower power application."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst ever","review":"If Amazon offered negative stars I would give this -5 as well as tar-and-feather the engineers behind this battery. It loses it's charge instantly and takes forever to recharge. I couldn't possibly imagine a worse battery, unless for example, it grew legs and fangs and stole your kidneys! I'm a professional wedding photographer, and I got a ton of these assuming they'd be better than the eneloop. Nope! stick with eneloop, trust me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy!","review":"This type of battery is useless, It completely looses its charge after two days.I did extensive testing on a LaCrosse charger and all I can say this is the worst battery I ever bought.

Used the BC700 to test them and trashed the ones with only a couple of hundreds mAh capacity left (could not hold it either).bought 50 total of the new Eneloop in recent 6 months and have been completely satisfied with them. They are having less stated capacity but they do hold them well. Hard to believe they are from the same company."},{"rating":"1","title":"didn't work out :(","review":"Battery needed some sort of plastic coating removed from it in order to run the intended mdse; so they were returned and purchased elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"not bad in the beginning ... but fizzle after 4 months of use","review":"I bought 8 of these batteries and a good charger in April 2010. My purpose was for a Canon point/shoot camera that I used for hiking and outdoor activity. I was fairly pleased with these for the first 4 months but started to see a decline in their performance after 3-4 months. I used them on a regular basis and cycled a regular charge so they don't lose their charging capability. After 9 months they held very little charge. I charged all 4 of them the other day and was able to get 24 non-flash pictures out of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware of Older Versions","review":"I bought this quick as my laptop got wiped out and I needed another copy. But I got an older version with a really ugly interface and probably less functionality. Takeway for me. Look closely at the version before buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best out there","review":"This is a low quality product compared to many other brands. Yes it is better than a simple band, but for the cost select a cable with better handles. I would not recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken Cable","review":"Used my Medium Resistance band for less than a month only to have my band break on me. Harbinger is putting out a low quality product that I do NOT recommend. I was doing standard bicep curls and chest presses. I'm sure Harbinger will replace under warranty, but be warned, this could happen to you too."},{"rating":"1","title":"too small and stiff to use","review":"I was disappointed at the small size and stiffness of this band. Also, the way they pack it with a plastic black tie leaves creases on the tubing making it more likely to break at a high stress. I guess it can be used for some applications so, I gave it 2 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Resistence good, size bad","review":"I'll admit that this is the first resistance band I've ever purchased, and maybe I chose this model prematurely. Did you realize that this product is only 18\\" long? While the size may be good for something (travel?) it detracts from its versatility. The exercises you can do with a band this size are rather limited. The handles are soft and flexible, but this is not too practical with increased resistance. I'm off to find a longer resistance band that has sturdy hard plastic handles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comprehensive collection of fly patterns; don't expect step-by-step recipes","review":"Lefty Kreh presents a comprehensive listing of saltwater fly patterns and their application for various species of fish. As a novice fly tier, I found this book to be indispensable at deciphering the quirky names of saltwater flies. The text is sprinkled with little gems of advice on how to fish these flies. The photos are good, but they could provide more detail in places. Lefty gives lists of ingredients for each pattern, but does not give detailed step-by-step tying instructions. This is not a problem if the fly tier knows the basic methods for tying saltwater flies. The chapters could be better organized; for example, bonefish flies can be found in chapters 13, 25, and 28. The chapters are numbered in the table of contents, but not numbered in the text."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"When my kids were little, they would want me to read this book to them almost every night.

One of her top items for Christmas is a copy of this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXACTLY WHAT I WANTED","review":"This was my daughter's favorite book as a child. Unfortunarely she wore out the original! I looked on Amazon for a copy in the same condition as the original was when I got it at a yard sale in the eighties. The one I purchased even had a dedication to a small child from his Grandparents and the name of a teacher whose classroom it sat in just like hers did. This purchase made my daughter extremely happy. This book is very unusual and stimulates the imagination. When read out loud it is an extreme tongue twister challenge. Beware however for the CutitupSnippit. He is a very naughty bird and needs to be kept away from power cords at all costs! Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A favorite from childhood","review":"It was a great picture book that showed how everyone is different - the ice cream cone coot was a bird made of ice cream and there were other birds made of other items as well - I remember the illustrations being amazing and when I tried to tell people about it they thought I was crazy - I have to get this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Schlage keyless entry","review":"The Schalge Camelot Deadbolt Keypad, Satin Nickel product is wonderful.

They told me that was one of the best gifts they have received. They no longer worry about working in the garden in the back of the house and have to remember to bring keys so they can lock the door. Now they shut the door and 10 seconds later the lock engages so all they have to do is just put in the code and they are in. They also have cleaners that come 2 a month and they no longer have to give out keys, they just put a code in for the cleaners. If there are any changes in the cleaning crew they can just change the code."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never get locked out again","review":"I love this keypad. Our doors are the kind where you can open them up without unlocking them. I was so afraid of accidentally locking myself out. Now I don't have to worry about it. My kids don't have to knock on the door and wait for us to answer, but If I don't want anyone walking in I can lock the top lock and no one will get in even with the code.

However, this is very important, crucially important actually. These should not be bought for doors with glass panes. Because one of the glass panes is so close to the part of the door where I installed the door lock, you can tell it's a little off. There is just barely enough wood between glass pane and edge of door to install this properly.

I got it working and love it. My ONLY concern is when I need to change the battery even though the directions state that the battery will last up to three years. The holding post that holds the key side of the lock (the entry side) doesn't seem to me to be very secure and I fear that the lock side will fall off when I take off the house side to change the battery. Of course, that is three years from now, but I think it is a valid concern since the lock is only held by friction of the post. I wish that Schlage had used a nut to secure the lock to the door instead of the mechanism is uses here. Other than that, I am very happy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two out of three failed to work","review":"I purchased three of these, but when we installed them, one would not take the code. Two days later, a second one stopped working. I contacted Schlage and a very nice person explained that it was a known issue with a spring and that she would send replacements.

I love Schlage locks, but this is pretty poor customer support."},{"rating":"2","title":"Convenience and Style","review":"Schlage has done a good job with this product. Installed about a month ago and it works as advertised. Installation is quite simple, just be careful to route the wires to avoid pinching them. The device that is supposed to hold the lock to keep it from falling out of the door while you install it is weak. I would suggest a little blue masking tape to hold it securely because you wouldn't want to bounce test your expensive new lock. This is installed on the garage door. Now I don't have to remember to bring the key to get into the garage. I would leave it unlocked, the wife would lock it, etc. That problem is entirely solved with this very stylish lockset."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product, great value","review":"I have installed several of these in the past on our house and garage, as well as the houses of family members.
