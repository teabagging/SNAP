In the one I got, one of the legs was stripped and never tightened, even a little. I added some toothpicks to make the contact but then while I was wheeling it one day the wheel came off and everything spilled.

Besides being boring and not having much of a plot, the book included gratuitous condescending, disrespectful, and ignorant commentary on South Carolina and the Clemson community. It appears from the text that although the author may have attended Clemson University, he made little or no effort to participate in, understand, or appreciate the Clemson local community beyond eating out and going to bars. It was a shame to find no more on the table than a shallow college student view of the universe.

She sounds like a fruitcake. All she talks about is religion and other bologna. Her book has nothing to do with money other than flaunting her wealth. I'm not sure why she calls the book Money Wisdom, other than to exploit the public's hunger for financial information. After reading this I would never consider reading anything else she writes. I can't believe PBS let's her on to do free infomercials. Sample of her advice: put ten grant a year in a 401k and with 9% interest you'll have lots of money in 20 years. DA!

It is a movie that everyone should see, as it accurately deals with key aspects of the Nuremburg Trials, Nazism and abuse of power. These issues confront us again today, and recur through human history - \\"I was just following orders\\" or \\"I was just following the law\\" is no excuse. People have a duty to judge the propriety of their actions for themselves, and refuse orders that are morally wrong.The cast is a who's who of great actors of the time - Spencer Tracy, Montgomery Clift, Burt Lancaster, Marlene Deitrich. A must-see and a civic duty for all people in free nations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Cast, Bit Preachy","review":"One of the greatest casts assembled for any movie: Burt Lancaster, Spencer Tracy, Judy Garland, Marlene Dietrich, Maximillian Schell, Montgomery Clift, Richard Widmark, Colonel Klink? The performances are tremendous, especially Schell, Garland and Clift. Spencer Tracy seems to be playing the same role in every movie. Strangely enough, Stanley Kramer also directed It's a Mad, Mad.. World. The man had a gift for attracting hall of fame casts. The movie is perhaps longer than it need be and is intent on putting across a point of view, but it holds up if for another reason than some of the stunning performances. Judy Garland is surprisingly good and uses a convincing accent. Look for William Shatner. One of the most gripping courtroom dramas ever made."},{"rating":"2","title":"Judgment at Nuremberg","review":"A masterpiece of great actors exercising their craft amidst the Russian blockade of Berlin in 1948.

To know that this was based on truth makes it more powerful, and there's a tenseness and horror that captures your attention. Mostly set in a courtroom, this movie does go on a long time, but I didn't want to stop watching it to go do the dishes I was supposed to be doing.It's a movie that makes you think about both sides of the story of the Holocost, yet pulls it all back into stark reality and honesty. The speech Dr. Ernst Janning (Burt Lancaster) makes near the end is wonderful yet sad. All the acting is brilliantly done.The only real caution I give is that there is some bad langauge and some of the things talked about are shocking--but the latter is to be expected from such a subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought-Provoking Classic","review":"What a wonderful film of ideas this is! The themes of justice and responsibility from many differents perspectives are explored, along with the temptation of political expediency. Except for the wooden performance of Richard Widmark, the stellar cast is magnificent. Especially heart-breaking are the performances of Montgomery Clift, Judy Garland, and...most of all...Burt Lancaster. Spencer Tracy gives a rock-solid performance of a deeply just man who does not waver in his responsibility despite pressures of empathy towards the Burt Lancaster character, the German people, and the political climate demanding leniency towards the defendants. When I see such an important, thought-provoking film as this, it saddens me to know that the \\"great\\" films of our era are populated with hobbits, CGI special effects, and comic-book characters. I'm afraid a film of ideas like this one would never find funding in present-day Hollywood."},{"rating":"2","title":"A masterfu lesson","review":"This is the one film that has taught me a permanent moral lesson: how dangerous it is to inflict actual harm in order to prevent a potential greater future harm.

Each story will draw you closer in your walk with God as these ancient stories are told with the feelings, thoughts and emotions women struggle with today. I will never look at these women of the bible the same way again. My personal favorite was the story of Mary. I felt as I was quite familiar with this story it would have no suprises for me but the point of view is so real, so raw I cried time and again.

You get a glimace of what life would've been like for these women (and those around them) and a look at how they may of felt during their particular circumstances. It made me realise how much faith these women had, especially seeing that only Bathsheba and Mary were Hebrew. Today, we have insight and the hindsight of the bible, together with Grace. These women only had faith and trust in God, and the little knowledge of the law they were allowed to have.

Facts flinged at random in the circuits drawings. It is missing a datasheet with a annual summary of the winners, speed, fast lap, pole position; also the former circuits drawings (in small picture) to show the modifications through the years.

I picked it up at the HMV at Heathrow on the way to a friend's wedding in Belfast. The liner notes mention Mercury Rev & Flaming Lips as ardent U.S. fans of this man and I can see why. His soft, stunning music is contemplative, dark, simple, quite pretty, and drenched in minor chords and gorgeous harmonies ala E. Smith. Much like Eric Matthews with less horn and more acoustic guitar, each song has a mind of its own. Haunting and slyly nefarious, skewed pop.I hope this release becomes domestically available soon. It's not just for Europe anymore!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining Southern Flair","review":"If you liked the Ya-Ya books,then you will enjoy this one. It is fashioned in the same manner. I really enjoy the element of getting all of the character's views on the events going on throughout the story. It was captivating enough to read cover to cover, but I felt a little slighted at the end when one of the main character's fate was never revealed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh!","review":"There is no comparing this depressing ride through the lives of these women with the laughter and tears we got from Divine Secrets of the Ya Ya Sisterhood.

These southern \\"ladies'\\" lives were better left unexamined, for the scrutiny revealed a basic lack of personal courage and conviction found all too often in reality. Unfortunately, the author seems to confuse stupidity with \\"craziness.\\" I found the novel neither humorous or entertaining. The characters are shallow. I was glad to be finished with this audiobook."},{"rating":"1","title":"Political","review":"This book was nothing but a political zing at the Establishment. The old, very old, Flower Child syndrom.

I fell in love with Delores and her struggle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Book!","review":"If you loved \\"YaYas\\", you have to read this and CRAZY IN ALABAMA by Mark Childress. Ms. West writes beautifully! The characters are not always likable, but very much real. I see the african american character, I believe her name was Pearl - just can't think of it right now, was the best character. Always there for everyone - what a wonderful person she was! Wish they would make a movie of this book very soon. As another customer said in his/her review, I can see Kathy Bates as Dorothy. Further, I would recommend Shirley McLaine as Gussie, Tori Spelling as Clancy Jane, Drew Barrymore as Violet, Alicia Silverstone as Bitsy and, last but not least, Oprah Winfrey as Pearl!Don't miss this one and Ms. West's other book, \\"She Flew the Coop\\". Can't wait to read her other books!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Book I Read This Summer","review":"I fell in love with this charming tale of mothers and daughters. There's never a dull moment, and the characters are so real, you can almost smell their perfume. Their escapades took me through a rainbow of tears, laughter, and smiles. If you loved FRIED GREEN TOMATOES and STEEL MAGNOLIAS, this is the book for you. It's southern in spirit and utterly beguiling."},{"rating":"1","title":"No light at the end of the tunnel for characters","review":"I had a hard time deciding who to like in this story. I thought the characters were unbelievably cruel to Dorothy. Who doesn't invite their daughter/sister to Thankgiving knowing that she had no other place to go and she lives next door. I kept waiting for one of the characters to stand up for Dorothy. The discovery of the skeleton was anti-climatic, and nothing was resolved at the end of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful, Awful, Awful!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This book was awful. I bought this book because it was being compared to Divine Secrets. This book doesn't even come close. I found none of characters likeable. In fact, they irritated me. Crazy Ladies does not even deserve one star."},{"rating":"2","title":"Are There Other Books like this?","review":"I would never have looked twice at this book because I generally (stupidly?) let the publishers guide me to what's good and \\"important.\\" A friend left a tattered copy of this book in my mailbox with a post it note affixed to the cover. READ THIS & CALL ME said the note. I was a little reluctant but once I got started I fell right into the world of these crazy women and loved every minute of it.I am anxious to read other books like this one but I don't know where to begin. I did order Patty jane's House of Curl and adored it too. But I was thinking there has to be other books like Crazy ladies out there. We readers are hungry to find great reads."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a Winner","review":"I loved this book! It's the first one I read from Michael Lee West. Her writing is realistic, yet compassionate and objective. All characters are flawed, but in a wonderfully charismatic way. While you may not agree with their actions and points of view, readers can certainly understand where their behavior comes from. Strongly recommended for women (and people in general) with extended families (with many women)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't even come close to the hype.","review":"If I could have rated it a half a star, I would have. The book started out with some interesting characters and some good ideas but took them nowhere. There was nothing to grab onto, nothing to care about. A huge disappointment and a waste of precious reading time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Am I from another planet?","review":"Wow. I thought this book was a complete waste of precious time...and so did the rest of my book club. The characters were shallow and undeveloped, there were no resolutions of issues, poor Dorothy never had a chance to win her mother's love and I am still trying to figure out why Clancy Jane married the doctor. What galls me even more is that reviewers have the audacity to compare this book to Ya Ya's, which is SO much more fun (although still disfunctional). A book about Pearl and how she put up with these sick people all those years might have been more interesting. But I doubt it."},{"rating":"2","title":"enjoyable read","review":"I really liked this book. Although I wouldn't go so far as to compare this book to the Ya-Ya's, it was a fabulous tale. The main setting was a small town in TN. The main characters were three generations of women from one family. The matriarch, Gussie and her daughters, Dorothy and Clancy Jane, and their daughters, Bitsy and Violet. In addition, we are treated to viewpoints from Gussie's maid Queenie, who has been with her since Dorothy was a small child. I won't go as far as some reviewers have and spoil the plot for you, but I will encourage anyone who likes Southern fiction to read this book. Ms. West shows the trials of this family, how secrets and miscommunication can affect our lives, and how our choices change our lives. This book spans the time period from 1932 until the early 1970's. You will be touched by these women and the problems they create for themselves and how they solve them."},{"rating":"1","title":"it drove ME crazy","review":"This book was a disappointment to me from the beginning. The southern drawl was overdone, the characters lacked depth and what's worse, none of them were the least bit likable, save Violet. And Violet got, what, 2 chapters? I couldn't sympathize with them and most of the time I was annoyed by them, especially Dorothy, what a character! The only resemblence to the YaYas is that it's about southern women and it's in about the same time era. Although the YaYas were sad at times, their story was about finding love, even if only through a friend. This story was all about the lack of love, and how depressing it can be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing plot and self-conscience writing","review":"I did not enjoy this book. I kept reading in hopes that it would get better. It didn't. The characters are not likable and the different voices they are written in don't ring true, instead they get in the way. The characters do not grow or learn from their mistakes and I stopped caring about all of them pretty early. Altogether a disappointing experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Compare to the Ya-Ya's","review":"I fell in love with the characters from \\"The Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood\\". I've re-read that book a hundred times just because the characters are so full of life that you actually feel like you're there with them. But in Crazy Ladies I was forcing myself to finish it. It started off good and caught me immediatly but after the first 4 chapters it only goes on and on about the same problems. Dorothy can't get over her need to be the best and \\"mother dears sweetheart\\". Clancy goes round a round with needing to be free and not couped up. After a while it just got boring and the plot seemed to repeat itself. I would say if you're going to read this book, read it before you read about the Ya-Ya's by Rebecca Wells. You'll see the difference!"},{"rating":"1","title":"caught in a month of talk shows","review":"This story grabs you on page 3 and lets you go after chapter 4. I feel like I have been reading about a month's worth of talk show topics: Murder, teenage pregnancy, cancer, alcoholism, affairs, divorce, abusive husbands, depression, attempted suicides, living in poverty, runaways, eloping, burying someone alive, paranoid schizophrenia, dramatic childbirths, drugs, rape, hippies, war, protests, amputations, not paying child support, jealousy, prejudice, violence, etc. I read this because of the comparisons to the Ya Ya's. There was no humor. It was depressing. The characters were not developed. I couldn't wait to finish the book. I was even more disappointed with the way the book ended. The main characters in the end were not the main characters. Bizarre book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read....","review":"I really liked this book. I'm a big fan of books with multiple narrators (Saving Graces, Future Homemakers of America, ect.) This one was just as good.It's pretty much the story of 2 sisters, one who can do no wrong (Clancy Jane), and one who can do no right (Dorothy), their mother, and their daughters. I have to admit, sometimes I felt sorry for Dorothy (though other times I wanted to kill her), and it really wasn't right that no matter how many times Clancy screwed over her loved ones, they always welcomed her back with open arms.My favortie though was Violet...good for her!! She didn't come from the most stable of environments, but she was the most normal person in the book.Overall, a great read...for women. You become so engrossed in these womens lives, that you can't put it down."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was not a very good book. I was very disappointed.","review":"I read this book because I had recently read The Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood. Reviews at Amazon.com suggested that Crazy Ladies was even better than the Ya-Ya book. This was not so. This book was mediocre at best and a big waste of time. The book is one catoastrophe after another. I didn't like any of the characters one iota. I do not recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless book; complete and utter waste of time.","review":"Totally predictable and shallow. I find it hard to believe that anyone compares this book with \\"The Diviine Secrets of the Ya Ya Sisterhood\\". Sisterhood is well written and a pleasure to read. \\"Crazy Ladies\\" is a tremendous disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ladies Rule even Crazy Ladies","review":"This family had many problems and tragedies in their lives. Reading about all of the bad things that happen to the people they loved, I saw how each character would deal with tragedies in their own way. Sometimes to their own detriment and others dealing without going crazy. Miss Gussie and Queenie held the family together. Miss Gussie's children and the children's children would come to Miss Gussie and Queenie for comfort and in times of need. Both Miss Gussie and her long time maid Queenis always opened up the house with open arms. This book was very enjoyable...it was funny, sad and you would always route for them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Donovan's Daughter","review":"This book was just as wonderful as the first three of this 4 part series.

The young people on the movie are powerful poets who speak their truths through the art form of slam poetry. I am going to tell you this film will change your life. The teens ages 15-19 talk about issues that most of us adults are to afriad to speak on. Their passoinate delivers will have you on the edge of your seat. I dont want to spoil any of the movie but their is one poem that touched me the most and that is \\"Cruches\\". all I have to say is wow. I want you to get this film ASAP! This one is a life changer!

It did have some profanity, but not so much that they would feel uncomfortable nor anymore than some of them use on a daily basis. They REALLY enjoyed this video. It worked out great. The concepts of tone, mood, & some other literary elements really came to life for them. I was very pleased. They were even more excited at the fact that these poets were in their age range."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Breath Holder, Gruesome, Very Gruesome","review":"I really like Philip Margolin's books and this one was nerve racking until almost the very end. Many reviews have been writtn so all I wanted to say that I found the ending of the story very very horrific. Even a killer deserves to be treated better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievably Bad","review":"I have read other books by Phillip Margolin which I enjoyed but this one was REALLY lame ! I wouldn't recommend even investing the money in a new paperback of this one ! I could see \\"who done it\\" from the first time the guilty character appeared on the scene. None of the characters were the least bit believable. How could people this dumb make it through medical /or law school (they're all doctors or attorneys)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"This has to be one of the most poorly written books I have ever read. The unbelievable plot borders on silliness, with cardboard characters, and a ridiculous romance thrown in. The protagonist Amanda Jaffe has to be one of the stupidest characters in recent years. This book is written to move at a fast pace, and as a result some detail that may have saved this book from being what it is was not included. One reviewer compared this book to Thomas Harris' Red Dragon. I can't imagine a greater insult to Thomas Harris' masterpiece. Save yourself some money and skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring book","review":"Pretty predictable. Gratitous gruesomeness. Cardboard characters. Plodding plot. Ridiculous read. Stupid story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"I thought this was an excellent thriller. The story was still suspenseful even after I suspected the real killer. Unlike the other reviewers, I didn't figure out the real killer right away. When I did suspect the killer, it was for a completely different reason than the slip-up that was made. Is the story realistic? Not entirely. The heroine does do stupid things to put herself in danger; things that women only do in books and movies, like go to deserted murder houses alone in the middle of the night. And, where did the killer get all of that money to pay cash for so much real estate? But some of this goes with the genre. There is a certain suspension of disbelief that must take place in order to enjoy these novels. Otherwise, we may as well read true crime accounts. Overall, a very satisfying read."},{"rating":"1","title":"For The Real Blood And Gore Reader","review":"My biggest problem with this book is its lack of artifice; I figured out who the killer was almost from the start. This villian is a fiend who tortures, mutilates, and kills for fun and profit. Personally this is not \\"Thrilling\\" to me; it's sick and it is a substitute for plot, character development, and ambience. Author Margolin is about as subtle as a mace and chain. My regret is that I finished it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast paced read","review":"Good book. I figured out who the killer was too early in the story. The reason behind the killing came later. I wold read another Amanda Jaffe mystery, but wil be prepared to figure ending early in book."},{"rating":"2","title":"3.5 stars","review":"The book was a thoroughly entertaining, however I can't say I really loved it. I'm not going to criticize it anymore because I'm sure other will like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Be Prepared To Clear Your Schedule Once You Start This Book!","review":"Margolin's latest, Wild Justice, is VERY fast-paced, exciting and suspenseful. Without giving away the plot, I know you'll feel that once you start reading this book it will seem that the pages are just flying past your eyes. If you like thrillers, you won't find many recent books in this genre that will stack up to Wild Justice. The only reason that I didn't give Wild Justice a \\"5 star\\" rating is that despite Margolin's many and interesting efforts to keep you guessing as to who the murderer is, I was able to determine the killer too early on in the story. Even if this turns out to be your experience as well, I think you'll still feel that Wild Justice is a book that will keep you on the edge of your seat and is one that you'll want to recommend to others. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Suspenseful and Well Written Thriller","review":"It has become a cliche to describe a book as a \\"page turner\\". However, I can think of no better term to describe Phillip Margolin's, Wild Justice. Once I picked this book up, I was truly unable to put it down. Although I have noticed that all of the other reviewers of this book have described the plot in detail, I will not. Part of the excitement of this book is watching the plot unfold and any decription will lessen that effect. This book is an exciting read and is actually quite scary at times. Any past readers of Margolin's work will not be disappointed and first time readers will become instant fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous!","review":"How ridiculous can we get? By far the worse thriller I've ever read. These people are doctors and lawyers? How stupid can Amanda be? And how much baggage can Margolin throw at Vincent Cardoni and his wife Justine Castle? These guys are surgeons?Flat dialogue. Unclear plot. Unbelievable cardboard characters. Complete waste of paper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Butchery","review":"I have read several Phillip Margolin books and liked them.But this one is too much.Stolen body parts. A self-amputated hand. A re-attached OTHER hand. Not one, not two, but many basement butcher shops--for butchering people.Plastic surgery to evade the mob. Not one but two people planting serial-killer clues to frame others.People getting shot and dying instantly. People getting shot and not dying at all.Mob enforcers dressed as doctors. Someone stabbed through the ear with a bed-spring.YES!All this and more in one book, to ruin your lunch.Margolin is a master of the twist and double-twist, the unexpected swerve at the end.But in this book, I foresaw the real killer 50 pages in, and found the zigs and zags tiresome.Two stars off for one or more serial killers. Tired, tired plot device.One star off for telegraphing his punches.One star off for too damn much blood and gore. Revolting. Laughable.On the plus side, Amanda and her father are quite likable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just not very good.","review":"A co-worker of mine read this after it had been recommended by a friend. But she was disappointed when she finished it. I should have listened to her and skipped it, but I didn't have anything else to read at the time, so I gave it a shot.The plot is fast-paced, and exciting, but there really isn't much more to it, besides a lot of bodies, blood and gore. The characters are completely unrealistic and shallow, and the \\"twist\\" at the end is easy to see coming. I had it figured out around page 125 somewhere.If you like a page-turner with lots of violence, you may enjoy this book. Otherwise, it's not worth the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I concur with the reviewers who found this book to be highly over rated. The murderer was quickly apparent to anyone who has read many thrillers -- the murderer stuck out like a sore thumb. I honestly do not understand how this mystery received such glowing reviews from the critics. It was formula plotting with two dimensional characters. Clearly not Margolin's best effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disapointed","review":"This was not up to Margolin's usual quality. The killer was so obvious by page 100, I spent the next 200 pages saying \\"tell me it's not so.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Obvious","review":".... No mystery! Obvious who the bad guy is early on. Fortunately, it's a very quick read (big type, wide margins)."},{"rating":"1","title":"POORLY DONE","review":"I'M SOMEWHAT SURPRISED AT THE REVIEWS TO DATE---THER MUST BE SOMETHING WRONG WITH ME! THIS IS EASILY THE WORST BOOK I HAVE READ IN THE LAST 5 YEARS. THE PLOT IS TOTALLY IMPLAUSABLE,THE CHARACTERS ARE UNREAL AND FORGETABLE, AND THE OUTCOME IS VERY PREDICTABLE. I HAVE READ OTHER BOOKS BY THIS AUTHOR AND ENJOYED THEM. SOMEONE MUST HAVE INSTRUCTED HIM TO WRITE ANOTHER ONE TO GET TO MARKET REAL FAST AND THE PLOT SHOWS IT !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!","review":"This is my first Margolin book and without question it will be my last. Idiotic in the extreme with the most shallow characters I think I've ever encountered in fiction. It's an absolutely terrible book with maybe the most frightening part being the number of reviews praising it here at Amazon. Philip Margolin is talentless and this book ranks right up there with the Left Behind series in terms of low quality literature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable, poorly written, and a corny sex scene","review":"Like all the others, I had figured out that Cardoni was not guilty by page 100. Of course, I admit I had to go back and reread the beginning pages, but it was pretty clear that the author had taken giant steps to keep any refernce to him off the page when the murderous events were taking place. Unfortunately, no one really cares whether Cardoni is innocent or not. Margolin's main character is a woman, and like most male writers, he lacks the facility to tell the story from the female viewpoint. Most of the characters are cardboard, and the moment the sex scene came up, I said, she's sleeping with the enemy [and hasn't that one been done to death?]. Save your time and efforts. Read something by Robert K. Tanenbaum."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top Notch!","review":"There is a killer out there who is possessed of the lethal combination of medical knowledge and a sick, twisted mind. The question is, who is it -- and how can s/he be stopped?Amanda Jaffe, a criminal defense attorney, is on the defense team for Dr. Vincent Cardoni, a smug, unlikable surgeon who is accused of several murders involving acts of brutal, yet exquisitely skilled torture. Cardoni is let off the hook on a technicality, however, before the case even goes to trial.Four years later, Jaffe is hired again to represent a defendant accused of similar killings. This time the suspect is none other than Cardoni's estranged wife. Jaffe persistently digs to the bottom of this mystery and learns the chilling truth behind these unthinkable crimes.Margolin does a great job all around on this one. The characters are interesting, the villains are despicable, and the suspenseful plot keeps you guessing until the unforgettable ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wild Ride","review":"I really enjoyed this wild ride of a thriller! I did not want to put it down. The characters were well drawn and believable. Many times I had to stop and wait for my heart to slow down, before I could go on. I am glad that the book came out now, in the summr. It was a great read for a day at the beach. I am not so sure that I could have read it as quickly as I did, if it were a cold dark winter's day or night."},{"rating":"1","title":"too easy to figure out","review":"Well written, and I finished the book just to see how the author managed the twists and turns, but... I knew _very_ early on exactly how this was going to play out and the real villain (serial killer) was apparent almost immediately when the character was introduced.This plot line is not at all original, and so was not nearly as enjoyable as it might have been had I not realized less than a 1/4 of the way through who the real killer was.It's not that I'm so smart; the story is just too transparent."},{"rating":"2","title":"a page turner","review":"This was my first book by Phillip Margolin and I enjoyed it alot.Very fast moving and somewhat gruesome but good.I was able to figure out who the killer was about halfway through the book but that didn't take away from the suspense.I'll read more of his books-in fact the first chapter of The Associate was at the end of this book and the first chapter was enough for me to want to read it.He will be on my authors -to -watch -out- for-list."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, Puh-leeze!","review":"I've enjoyed Phillip Margolin's books in the past, having read all of them. This one was so formulaic that if you didn't figure it out within the first 50 pages, you really need to get out more. I could tell you the exact page I said \\"Oh, no...\\", but that would just ruin it for others. I would definitely recommend this book be skipped and another, better plotted book be read in its stead. The two stars are because Mr. Margolin's writing didn't insult my intelligence."},{"rating":"1","title":"a real stinker","review":"a real bore,inane,silly the charactors are so shallow you can see through them.....Save your money and pass on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unremarkable but entertaining","review":"This book was mildly entertaining at best. I read through to the end because I wanted to find out \\"whodunit\\" but overall it's a disappointing read. The author's path to the conclusion is convoluted and clumsy...it's a real stretch! And the violence is gory and gratuitous. It was a quick, easy read and more entertaining than a magazine or most TV shows."},{"rating":"1","title":"author is bigot","review":"Wild Justice has its' moments, but is very predictable.

I picked it up before flying from LA to Chicago & read almost half the book before landing. Quite amazing for me who often suffers from a short attention-span. To each his own but I found this book to be quite clever; a nice relaxing fun reading escape from my heavier HR literature. I loved that I couldn't figure out what was coming next or who the real killer was...til just 25 pgs to the end. I found it a most enjoyable read that was intelligently written. Funny...I discovered I had read Gone, But Not Forgotten last year & loved that book too...not realizing it was penned by the same brilliant writer. Thank you, Mr. Margolin. There's a writer for everyone. You're the one for me! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"One to buy","review":"\\"Sound Doctrine\\" is a text to read over and over. Sid Heal is in an excellent position to balance and compare civilian law enforcement and military tactical thought. Not only does he provide the \\"how to\\" of conducting tactical operations but he provides a clear excellent review of the fundamental concepts behind action. The title is accurate. The book covers the basic doctrines necessary to conduct operations against potenital armed adversaries. Each chapter is well organized and direct.

I recommend this book not only to law enforcement personnel, but to anyone who also needs a solid grounding in tactical doctrine for employing force."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for anyone who thinks","review":"I'm not sure how I stumbled across this book, but here I am with a dog-eared, dirty copy that I've had for years, reading it for about the thirtieth time. I am not in law enforcement or the military, but I learn something practical and immediately usable every time I read it.This book is very John Boyd, filled with information on organization structuring, rapid learning, and tactical scenarios that show you how to THINK as opposed to what to do. This is the key advantage of this book and the reason why anyone who has to function in the increasingly chaotic modern world should read this and apply whatever they can to their own lives, professionally and otherwise.If you're a fan of Sound Doctrine, get your hands on Science, Strategy and War by Frans Osinga as it is the 10,000 foot version of the same subject, and by that I mean 10,000 feet high AND deep, as it's the essential primer on John Boyd's work and its usage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull Drivel","review":"It must be a real challenge to make a sex book boring, but Ms. Khalsa has somehow managed.

I found not much to further explore sex, relationships, or spirituality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pop Psychology Masquerading As Science","review":"Very, very little science in this one and one of many current books taking on a simple metaphor and developing a whole theory around it (...life is a climb, don't quit...or how about, life is like fishing, try different lures each day...or, life is like sharpening a pencil---sharp points work effectively, but sharpen too much, and the pencil grows short...). I went to a writer's workshop and the consultant there stated that the quickest way to publish a book is to think up one of these silly metaphors and write a self-help book around it. Maybe the author of this one was in the same workshop!

Somewhat painful to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbridled narcissism in an arctic setting. ?Spiritual?","review":"I could not agree more with every word of Isha Beharim's review. My first impression at the beginning of the book was of the author's extreme self absorbtion, and the impression never left me, and the self absorbtion never left the author either, despite whatever \\"spiritual\\" experience he may have had. The book, by the way, never comes within a country mile of anything even remotely spiritual, and I think perhaps the word was used in the sub-title only to improve sales, although, who knows, maybe sadly this sort of stuff passes for spirituality for this guy.The book was only interesting as the most extreme example of this sort of narcissist-meets-survival writing, which seems all the rage these days, and which also seems increasingly boring to me. I believe this book has cured me of my interest in this entire genre, and for that I suppose I owe a debt of gratitude."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was initially excited about this book, and it did have some good features. Like its pictures and descriptions of northern Canada, which I found very compelling. But the premise is dumb (why does he _need_ to go freeze himself into the ice?), and Simon's philosophical babblings get really tiresome by the end.

Yet, Simon's narrative is filled with the history and humanity of the Inuit who thrive in the Arctic. A captivating story of determination."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent reading","review":"I found this account of Alvah and Diana Simon's year in the artic both exciting and frightening. I was unable to put this novel down as I wondered what would happen to Alvah next. The glimpse into his grueling 5 months alone in the darkness of the artic will keep you reading on and on. He is very honest and open about the mental status of being left alone in this type of situation for that long of a period. I personally found the information on how the Intuit live and survive was very interesting and informative. I recommend this book strongly."},{"rating":"1","title":"All New Zealand Sign Language, not ASL","review":"Why this book was reprinted in the U.S. (after it's initial publication in New Zealand) is beyond me. This book contains all New Zealand Sign Language, not American Sign Language (ASL). Contrary to what many people think, sign language among the deaf population is not universal. Countries all have their own version of sign language and ASL is used only in the U.S. and Canada. This book was written by a New Zealand author who offers classes in her country. The highly disappointing and surprising twist is that it was published by Perigee, an American publishing house devoted to publications dealing with deafness and American Sign Language, so it's not like they didn't realize the book was not ASL!

It is highly frustrating to open the book read something, and then wonder, \\"Gee, is this correct?\\" Constantly referring to Karen's list of webpage errors was frustrating. Chapter 9 was completely re-written and made available to us in PDF format because the book's version was poor.I'm shocked that the university is still using the text.

This book is one of the worst textbooks I have seen.Is is evident that several people wrote this textbook because the style of writing will change between sections from informal to formal. Some of the sections are better written than others. In the poorly written sections, it can be very hard to follow what they are trying to say. Overall, the writing is very disjointed and care should have been taken to properly introduce topics and create more of a flow to the text.Also, there are numerous spelling errors and incomplete sentences in the text. For a third edition, one would expect those errors to be corrected; they are very obvious.The examples also contain errors. Again, the errors are very obvious such as 11-2=7.I would not recommend this textbook. At first glance, it appears to be a very comprehensive book but, actually it is very poorly written and does not explain the material well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Book Ever!","review":"This textbook is horrible. I am an engineering student and this is the most confusing book I have ever seen. Charts are randomly placed in paragraphs, with no mention of them in the writing.

For example, velocity is defined as synthesis with speed.The authors seem to have an axe to grind with management about facilities planning. Perhaps the saying, \\"Those who can't... teach!\\" holds true. Sorry professors, the real life situation is that a facilities planner may have his/her plans squished like a little bug occasionally to meet an ROI or even a manager's ego, get over it or find a new line of work.Book is also full of little changes in terminology between pages and chapters for the same material that the reader can find confusing. A few errors here and there that are probably typical of any technical text and some dated photos but generally an acceptable introduction to facilities planning.Otherwise, the book is an extremely slow read with little information that you can't find elsewhere in a nice binding.

Harper Lee told it much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"disapponted","review":"I have enjoyed Anne River Siddons' previous books, but it took me a long time to get through this one. The characters were somewhat implausible and the plot was even more so. Furthermore, the foul language was offensive and unnecessary. Why be so explicit? Give this one a pass!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A big disappointment","review":"I usually love books written by ARS but found this one to be shallow and predictable. The part I found really hard to believe was when Nora revealed to Peyton the real reason Peyton's mother bled to death. If I'm reading this correctly, Peyton's mother had a sexual encounter on the day she gave birth? Come on, now! Any woman who has had a child knows this is next to impossible. Try harder next time, Anne."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"I have read all of Anne Siddons previous works -\\"Colony', \\"The Outer Banks\\", etc and have enjoyed them immensly.

It simply wasn't as engaging or as deep as her other books. This one focuses on a teen and does seem more of a young adult book than anything else. It was very easy reading....and I expected more from one of my favorite authors.....for a much more satisfying take on this same era, read Downtown by this author...that was the first book of hers that I read, and it is wonderful...a novel that transports you to another place in time...unlike this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as author's previous books","review":"It seemed more aimed for teenagers than adults. I've enjoyed several of Ms Siddons other books, but this story did not have the depth of those."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slow Taking Off, But It Gets Better!","review":"The beginning of this book is just a little bit hard to get into as it talks about a spoiled rotten kid who felt she had everything to do with killing her mother.But when Nora arrives, the plot thickens and the story becomes much more entertaining and engrossing from there on. Anne Rivers Siddons has a way of writing with a different style with each book she composes, and this one though written well, is quite differently written then her others."},{"rating":"2","title":"truth & beauty","review":"Within the pages of this beautiful little book, the reader finds magic, truth, beauty and healing.As an author,Chinese Medicine & Healthy Weight Management, and healer, I recommend this book highly to my patients and friends, as well as to you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self-absorbed twaddle (negative stars)","review":"If what you're looking for is a personal philosophy that will allow you to rationalize selfishness as \\"being true to yourself\\", then this is the book for you.It's frightening how many of the reviews I've read here seem to whole-heartedly embrace this horrid, destructive message as empowering.And for those of you who would say that the poem is beautiful but the message behind it is not worth reading, I would say the poem IS the message, and the message is gobbledygook."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Poem...should have left it at that!","review":"I LOVED this poem, it was beautiful, ethereal, pleasing to the ear, idealistic, creative...everything a great poem should be. It pulled people in who shared the sentiments for a beautiful dream ride. The book however was a huge disappointment after the poem. Her writing style was easy and even pleasant to read but you got to the end wondering what exactly she had said. She criticized a lot of self help/new age thinking but her book seemed to do the same, just not nearly as well as some. She should have stuck with writing a beautiful poem and not tried to turn it into a book for commercial or social gain."},{"rating":"2","title":"An occasion well worth rising to.","review":"I paced myself best I could, finished it this afternoon. I loved it. It sings on the page as a series of personal affirmations which can inspire the reader either to 'Yes, me too!' or to 'Yes, I also am different (thanks for the permission)' or 'Yes, I have been demanding too little of myself and of my life.' I think it will make a profound difference to many of those stirred to awareness of it by the poem of the same name, and also to those who are drawn to the book by its beauty, as I was. I am already anticipating the first rereading."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Challenging Read","review":"Oriah Mountain Dreamer presents a view defiant of what society would like you to believe is dominant today. Though not in 100% agreement with what she writes, she does present a view-point that is not only a challenge to read and comprehend, but one that reaches one's inner beliefs of today's lifestyles. I found myself re-reading several paragraphs, if not whole chapters, to truly understand what she was saying. This book presented a relief in other books that are out there today. It is different and makes one delve deep inside their own beliefs to not only understand what she is saying - but what the reader believes within... I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in - why - !!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I knew I could not be the only one!","review":"To begin I must thank this wonderful woman for her courage to share this wonderful book with the world. I would then like to thank her for letting me know that I am not strange or weird and nor are my thoughts on living my life as I have thought for so long. She has given me the okay to be who I am, because I strived for so long to let others know who I was, and now I see myself in the pages of her book. I believed all that she writes and hid this because others could not see what I was trying to say. Now I have a book, a guide to pass on to those who look puzzled at me and wonder 'who are you'. I am the one who lives through my heart, soul, and lives life with love.

The Invitation is one of the most powerful statements of life that I have ever read and truly is the best part of this book altogether.

Some you will embrace, others you will disagree with, but through the exercise you will bring your own experiences to the words she has so eloquently written."},{"rating":"1","title":"kind of woo woo","review":"Not to put down the author's life experiences, I found that beyond the nice poem \\"the Invitation\\", there was not much depth to this book. Nice poem though and it makes a nice evocation. I got it at the library otherwise I would not buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretentious","review":"Like others, I knew the poem before I read this book. It was disappointing to read this book because it seemed so pretentious, full of pretty phrases that had as little depth as the reflection of the moon in a teaspoon.

Not to mention, much of what she's written here is repeated (in a more coherent way) in \\"The Dance.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Zero Stars","review":"This book was easy to read but empty of content. The lowest rating option is one star, else I would have rated it a big zero. The author liked to use word painting and her sentences flowed nicely, but if you're looking for insight, information, hope, knowledge, or anything other than learning about the mistakes in life the author has made (was this meant to be an autobiography?), save your money.

However, it has nonetheless had a profound (negative) influence in my life. It seems that someone was \\"inspired\\" by this thing to make bizarre advances on someone I know. Normally, I wouldn't care, but this person ended up suspecting me of doing it!Having glanced over the opening lines of this nauseating garbage, I'm highly offended that anyone would think I would read it, let alone act like an idiot because of it.What has become apparent to me is that readers of this sort of new age drivel are highly imbalanced and confused individuals, and potentially dangerous!I urge anyone of sound mind to avoid this book like the plague, and be wary of anyone who reads this sort of thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little slow to start, then packed with power","review":"For me, the beginning of the book was very slow, but once I completed the first chapter, I knew I was reading something which spoke to my soul.

You have to be up for it as if you were attending a training with Oriah.... Good read and slow read."},{"rating":"1","title":"You're not the Only One!!","review":"I must say I enjoyed the poem but the book was a disappointment - she seems to spend half of the book promising to tell us something insightful, how great her wisdom is, and how often she's taken people on the great journey. Frankly I got tired of the hype. I was left feeling that she got a lot of press with the poem circulating around the internet but no money, and writing a book was the only way to cash in. Reminds me of the old adage that most books would have made a great article, most articles would have made a good paragraph. In this case, the poem was enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice Poem, Lean substance","review":"The Poem the Invitation is interesting and moving. However, the author's attempt to fill out the thinking and emotions behind it falls short. This is not really billed as a \\"new age\\" book but in all actuality it is. Dreamer repeats herself and the same ideas over and over again. I think that anybody reading this book will want to know how a person like this can survive in the world. I am convinced that this means something to the author. Unfortunately if you are drawn to the book through the peom i would suggest reading the first two chapters in the bookstore before you buy it. By this point you will know whether you can handle this type of writing. Mainstream people looking for good, solid, and workable solutions will be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped working within first 5 minutes","review":"I bought this to practice in my apartment.

Sure, it may keep your son or daughter's sound down, but the resistance the SBS gives back to the player is HORRIBLE. This is coming from an experienced trombone player. Not only does the SBS give back WAY TO MUCH resistance (making the trombone harder to play), but, if a person practices only with the SBS, they can come dependent to the way they have to change their embouchure to gel with the silent brass system. If a student, or anyone, becomes dependent on the SBS, real performances, without the SBS, will not be the best. In other words, DON'T GET THE SILENT BRASS SYSTEM!

Music for Two by One for voice only (as are most songs on this CDs) in which she sings syllables and The Wonderful widow of Eighteen Strings with words from James Joyce's Finnegan's Wake which I my opinion is as powerful as any song by Schubert.

This book was completely boring. Like another reviewer, I've just read the two Ya-Ya books and it's more like comparing a Rolls to a roller skate. I only wish that I hadn't spent actual money on it. It took me back to my high school days where I HAD to read something. I forced myself to read this, hoping it would get better, but I shouldn't have wasted my time. Absolutely the ONLY part not totally awful was the Epilogue, which I'm kind of thinking someone else must've written. If you want a summary of my feelings about this book, read every review with a star rating under a 2."},{"rating":"1","title":"a little boring & predicatable","review":"The book was ok. That's about it. The characters were poorly developed so that you never really get to the place of caring a whole lot about any of them or the unbelievable things that happen during the course of their lives.I live in the neighborhood where the story takes place but if it weren't for that, I probably wouldn't have even finished it.My advice: Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Patty Janes house of curl","review":"I purchased this book because Ivillage said this was a good read.

The plot is ridiculous. The characters are likable, but not complex enough.

It tells us the story of Patty Jane and her loved ones. They share good times, and help each other through bad times and each time when the worst is over and new happiness is found, it makes you feel that, to quote, Patty Jane's sister Harriet on her wedding day, after she kicked her alcoholism \\"those days were not as bad as this day was good.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly one of the best books I have ever read!!!","review":"I just happened upon this book at the store and thought it looked good.

Shallow characters and a ridiculously unbelievable plot? Look no further! I don't know when I've encountered so many people undergoing so much trauma and about whom I cared so little. The author would benefit by taking a crash course in characterization, and that's just for starters. The best that can be said of this book is that it makes one appreciate GOOD writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great characters, ridiculous plot!","review":"I was very drawn to this book based on the Minnesota setting. I thought this would be a Fannie Flagg type of humorous novel, lots of funny female characters, but with a Midwestern instead of Southern setting. The beginning of the book drew me in. The characters and the dialogue are just wonderful. But the plot! What a mess! Just got more and more unbelievable and bizarre. And several of the big plot twists were completely predictable. Just a real groaner as far as plot goes. So now I would have to say this is more of a Maeve Binchy lame-o novel, not a Fannie Flagg type of quality novel!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What is all the hoopla about?","review":"Maybe I missed something... maybe my attention was on something else...

I genuinely liked the characters and thought the story, while some of it a bit far-fetched, was wonderful...up until what happened to Thor was revealed. At that point I really thought the book took a bizarre twist. It was as if another book had been written and a portion of that book was inserted into this one.

It's more like a 3 1/2 star book for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"Wow! I read this whole book in a day and a half. I could hardly put it down.

I recommend reading this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The \\"House of Curl\\" is home to a quirky cast of characters.","review":"Patty Jane's House of Curl is more than a place to go for a wash and set. It's part refuge, part cultural center, but mostly a place where friends and family meet to face the triumphs and tragedies of their lives. Patty Jane and her sister Harriet create a wacky world that draws in the inhabitants of their small Minnesota town. Unfortunately, the sisters have more than their fair share of heartbreak, especially in the \\"love department\\". They are a resilient pair however and manage to find happiness amid the turmoil.

The plot, for me, was completely contrived--more like a plot outline than a fully realized book. The characters struck me as hollow, superficial, and cliched, down from the Norwegian grandmother's constant outbursts of \\"Uff-da!\\" to Harriet's plunge, after a single night at a bar, into alcoholism, destitution, and prostitution(!) If the book were funnier, it could qualify as satire, perhaps, and one could forgive the author for her shallow writing and paint-by-numbers characters. The fact the one is apparently meant to take it seriously is worrisome.

Note all the people complaining about the line feed on this trimmer. This is not the only Toro model that has this problem.Like most trimmers, as the line gets shorter, you bump the trimmer on the ground to feed more line. But, with the Toro trimmer, the line breaks too close to the spool. So, you constantly have to stop, take it apart and manually feed more line.Also, the bump process does not work very well. You have to bump the trimmer and hold it down for awhile to get the line to feed. It almost never works on grass. It does work if you bump it on concrete, but it leaves a black mark.The pity is that the Toro does a very good job of trimming. It just takes a long time to trim even a small area, because you are always having to take it apart to get more line."},{"rating":"1","title":"bump feed goes bump in the night","review":"I purchased a Toro electric to replace the Weed Eater that over a couple of years had lost its ability to feed line -- also by the bump method. Alas, Toro's bump feed did not work more than a couple of lawn trimmings until it, too, ceased to advance. To make matters worse, doing that job with a Toro requires more hands (and patience) than I have. At least the Weed Eater was fairly quick and easy to advance the string by hand. Anybody know of a string trimmer that works?"},{"rating":"1","title":"ditto, ditto","review":"Right out of the box, this trimmer never worked right. The line either feed itself out within minutes of use or disappeared completely inside. I spent more time on my hands and knees trying to get the cord to work right than I did using the trimmer.Also, my heavy duty extension cord would fall out of the socket too easily---well, maybe just in time for each pause to deal with string.Definitely a flawed design.

Additionally, the handle often came off. The handle is clipped onto the wand and is held in place by friction. There is no bolt to hold it securely in place. Finally, shield was coming loose because the plastic split in the place where it is attached to the motor.My previous trimmer was a Toro and it gave me many YEARS of service.When I first used this one, it was immediately apparent that it had a much less powerful motor than my old one. This model was much larger than my old one so I expected it to have a MORE powerful motor.Toro should reintroduce some of their old models that were designed to give service rather than conform to the latest fads in industrial design."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that Bad","review":"Most of the folks complaining are complaining about the feed feature. I would be willing to bet they have lost the inner spring and do not realize it. I know this because I have lost two already. It is not mounted in there and when you open the feeder cassette it pops out. When you are hot and tired, you may not notice, I didn't.Yes it has low power. You only paid $40 buck.

Every other sentence contains akward breaks and beginnings. The author's grammer is superfluous and non-varied. I am by no means an authority on writing, but this style just stuck out to me like a thorn. I guess the writing wouldn't have bothered me so much if the plot wasn't so boring. The book's premise promises to be a great thought-provoking story on society, cloning and the the relationships of the 3 main characters. The first half of the book is a VERY detailed, jumpy and slow reminiscence of their childhood. I was hoping for the characters to interact more with the outside world and to reflect how their lot in life is different from the non-cloned. Instead the book DWELLS on the love triangle and relationships of Ruth, Kathy and Tommy.I am sure others will find this book stimulating, but I couldn't even get myself to finish it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book I've read this year","review":"But to be honest, I couldn't wait for it to end. It is so crushingly depressing, so bleak in its portrail of evil's banality that when I finished it, I literally just stared into space. You really feel like your very soul has just been sucked right out of you. It's an awesome work of art, very moving but man... Hard to go about your life thereafter."},{"rating":"1","title":"IT WAS SO MISNAMED","review":"I was drawn into this book not only by the author's name but also by \\"Remains of the Day\\" which was so poignant. However, by page three or four I could not feel any empathy for Kathy and her wobbling little thoughts about her life in the \\"institution\\". I did carry on page after page, looking for the purpose of the book, waiting, waiting. I did understand, like chapters about 'the pencil case' and other little items were symbols but they lead nowhere. She kept promising us, 'but more about that later' and nothing happened and so finally I knew that nothing really was coming later. I suppose that if your purpose in life is to be a body parts donor then there cannot be any joy, yearnings, or creative love but it is not anything that the world wants to be told about because unfortunately that is the fate of millions of us, unknowingly. Remains of the Day, although it came to the same end was at least frought with repressed passion."},{"rating":"2","title":"don't read the library of congress info","review":"It's a shame that I accidentally read the library of congress info in the beginning of the book, because some of the major plot points which are carefully and gradually revealed are spelled out right there in a few terse words. Otherwise, it's an excellent book with a few relatively minor plot flaws which are quickly evident to anyone who can think critically about the finer points of the plot."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Subtle and Affecting Book","review":"Ishiguro never fails to surprise me. Each of this author's books seem a bit different, and they are never quick to disappear from my consciousness, even after long having closed the book.The book is narrated in the first person by Kathy H., a student (or inmate?) of the Hailsham School, which is an establishment that has enigmatic goals for its student body. One guesses early on why these children are special, and yet there is an overpowering tension as you read on, because the reader assumes there are further mysteries to be revealed. There are indeed events that we don't understand oompletely, but the resolution of these is a bit of a letdown--both for the reader, and the characters.Although it was not quite what I expected (I was expecting more traditional dystopian novel), and while I was frequently baffled by character reaction and motivation, I found myself deeply affected by this rather frighteningly plausible story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Premise would have been much more powerful as a short story","review":"Have you ever known anyone who had some interesting stories to tell, but when telling their stories, talked on and on and on without getting to the point? That is what reading this book is like. The idea behind the novel is an interesting one, but the story unfolds at an excruciatingly painful pace. The characters are all unlikable and unsympathetic. The entire story is dreary and colorless, literally. And while I realize that this is a metaphor for the lives the characters lead, it makes for a very unenjoyable reading experience.I will say that the author has a way with words. I just think that a much shorter version of the story of their lives would have made a bigger inpact on the reader.(And for those who have read the book already, are we really supposed to believe that the two old ladies in that old house wield great power and control over the main characters and their companions?)"},{"rating":"1","title":"A page-turner for the wrong reasons","review":"Being a writer myself, I have probably a different take on this book. I expected something different, having read the back cover and having seen Remains of the Day (the film). I have not read anything of Ishiguro's before, but I didn't like his style at all. I kept turning the pages because I wanted to see if I was missing something and, besides I was reading this for a reading group. I have to say, I found the style silly and pretentious. If I wanted to read a book with a Brave New World twist, I wouldn't have chosen this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"The story is not on a par with the good writing","review":"The total acceptance by the clones of their fate is not credible in the late 1990s. They are purported to be intelligent human beings and yet they never use their intelligence to question whether the purpose they serve is of any use or worth the sacrifice. The descriptive writing is admittedly clear and beautiful but the overall content left me unmoved."},{"rating":"1","title":"Intriguing but unsatisfying","review":"The docility of the clones became more and more maddening as the book progressed. They aren't locked up, they know they are going to be cut up and killed in 4 steps, they look like a perfectly normal human being - they just bleat their way to the slaughter house. If not the victims, what about the rest of humanity? I'm just trying to imagine what kind of protests PETA would stage for human clones being slaughtered for spare body parts?A very intriguing premise but I really started to dislike the book. After finishing the book, I feel really let down - I would have appreciated more details. Dumb book."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment...don't bother!","review":"The only thing that caused me to actually finish this book was that I HOPED that something exciting was just around the corner. Boy was I wrong!!Page after page after page I found myself feeling frustrated by the dialogue between characters, as well as wanting to edit out words entirely from each sentence. Although the topic of cloning is in itself an interesting idea for a book, this author tap danced around the issue with such a watery thin plot and characters that I felt like I had wasted my time by the end of the book. We get to the end of the story where Kathy and Tommy meet face to face with the women to ran Hailsham....and their conversation was so ridiculously wordy and stupid that I seriously chucked this book across my car. Huge waste of my time. I cannot understand the positive reviews of it at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"A grave disappointment","review":"After having read and thoroughly enjoyed Remains of the Day, I expected more of Ishiguro. I found Never Let Me Go tedious, filled with unnecessary detail, without surprises or twists of plot, and devoid of characters I cared anything about. Don't we all already know that science has outdistanced ethics? This novelization of the idea of cloning for \\"spare parts\\" was a total waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"b-o-r-i-n-g","review":"The story just drags along, I was never gripped, didn't believe it. A bunch of blah blah blah, I skipped part 2 of 3 entirely, and only finished it because my bookclub read it. I guess the book tries to make one think about the morality of cloning, but I didn't care about the characters and thus felt detached and kept thinking, yeah, whatever. I didn't care for the way the story is told, either, the main character addresses the reader a lot. Most girls in my bookclub liked it, however (for its melancholy? I thought it was just boring)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hollow Characters, Zero Plot, Who Cares","review":"Oh brother. This is quite possibly the worst novel I've ever read. Telling the story from Kathy's perspective made it sound like a diary - a boring, tedious diary. How could people enveloped in such a tragic system have so little feeling? Reading about clueless twenty-somethings is not engaging. And then, to bring in an adult narrator at the end to \\"explain it all\\" was the ultimate betrayal of the reader -- and an easy trick for a lazy author. For the film version to be watchable, the director must have added entirely new dimensions to these flat, unaffected characters -- and entirely new plot lines where none existed before."},{"rating":"1","title":"please let me go","review":"I've read close to 80 books so far the past 5 months - some good, some bad, some excellent, some okay.... this must be the worst! The story is there....and every time you think, yes, something is going to happen now....nothing happens....until at the end of the book there's 2 pages that's a bit more interesting....and then again...nothing happens. There's heaps of potential, but damn, give the reader something to read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing from start to finish","review":"I struggled to finish the seemingly never-ending 280 pages. The narration is redundant and only superficially develops the characters before filling the last 20 pages with predictable climax. I was waiting for a suspense-filled ending but was revealed nothing more than what was deduced from carefully inserted sentences throughout the book's chapters. Unfortunately, there was nothing poetic or novel about the presented themes or sentence-structure."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't \\"get it\\"...","review":"If there is a deeper meaning intended for this novel, then it was lost on me. I found the storyline boring, unoriginal, and predictable, and not particularly well written. The story also lacked believability. I kept reading, hoping the book would improve, but was ultimately let down by a lackluster ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Remains of Soylent Green -and Totally Overrated","review":"I found this novel slow and the characters infuriating. Why is everyone, especially Ruth, so unstable? It's like everyone has Borderline personalities. But the utter LACK of of any scientific explanation incorporated into the story suggests that people can be bred and trained to serve passively, and that's crazy. Even when little bits of their future are revealed explicitly by Miss Lucy, THERE ARE NO REACTIONS from the students. I found this unbelievable. I couldn't wait for a wrap-up and payoff, and when it finally happened (all too briefly and casually), I tossed the book as soon as I finsihed it.(Having read some spoiler reviews before reading my 1st Ishiguro novel, I may have damaged the experience... but I doubt it)"},{"rating":"1","title":"SO BORING","review":"This book came highly recommended, and so I gave it every effort I could. If the authors uses the word \\"daft\\" again I think Ill shoot myself. The characters are SO boring, how can we possibly relate? My cable is broken, its 100 degrees out but I think I'll need to go to the book store and purchase something readable. His descriptions of so tedious yet at the same time lack any significance. I hated this book, if anyone wants it it will be in tomorrows trash."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Horror Story That Could Become True","review":"This book is a horror story that could become true. We are now cloning higher animals like horses and sheep. There have been cases of parents having another child in hopes of getting an organ to save their first born. Is it far (technically) to clone a human for their organ content?Ethically is an entirely different matter. And somehow the photograph of the beautiful young girl on the front cover just adds to the feeling of unease. Of course the gender of the clone would make no difference ethically, but emotionally the photograph pulls heart strings, especially to those of us who are male but have daughters.As for the story itself. It is written as a voyage of discovery. The characters don't know what they are in for and the knowledge builds slowly. This is magnified by the use of terms like being a 'carer' before you become a 'doner.'"},{"rating":"1","title":"Falls Flat","review":"This semi-Orwellian novel has a potentially gripping idea that could have been developed into a deeply resonant exploration of the triumph of spirit over the fraility of our bodily natures. But the novel becomes a bore, always soliciting the reader's sympathy but never earning it. The prose is flat, the characters unreachable, and the plot falls victim to the author's (no doubt brave) attempt to make it reflect the unfeeling system that has engineered the cruel world in which the action takes place. After the first few chapters, you've got all you are going to get from this book. There's little point in going on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can you say \\"plot hole\\"?","review":"This book was a major disappointment. I was left wondering why these clones, when they found out they were clones and what awaited them, didn't just disappear. They could have got in a car and drove, started a new life, got fake IDs, new identities. Why didn't they? Why did they just except their fate???"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, tedious, poorly written","review":"What a horrible waste of time. I suppose the premise is mildly interesting, but not more than that. And while it is technically well written, it really isn't; people just don't talk like that, and the human interactions are unrealistic, very shallow, and unconvincing. Character development is shallow.And this is the most tediously boring book ever. I kept with it because amidst all the [pretentious, in retrospect] praise I thought it would get better. But no. It is a complete waste of time. It is like reading 200 pages about paint drying.It gets one star from me but only because there is no zero star option."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"This is one of the worst books I have ever read. Like many of the other one star reviewers I stuck with it hoping it would eventually get better - believe me it doesn't - ever.I usually give my used books to a friend or to a local book exchange - this one I threw into the garbage - to spare anyone else the pain of slogging through some of the worst dialogue ever published.Don't waste your time on this pointless, plotless and extremely boring book."},{"rating":"1","title":"ZZZZZZZ","review":"Boring, boring boring!! Read 'Brave New World' instead. Brave New World is better written and much more interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Do Humans Have Souls?","review":"The oddest thing about Never Let Me Go is that your understanding of the denoument depends upon your reaction to the idea that most human beings have souls. The most frightening thing about this novel is that it suggests that, if we do not have souls, it doesn't matter we do to each other."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, boring, boring","review":"Maybe I missed the author's point or something, but I thought this book was a real bore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"this was the selection of my book club...I looked forward to reading it because I had enjoyed The Remains of the Day but I did not care for this book; just \\"not my cup of tea...\\" however, several other members liked it a lot while some others agreed with me ...its all personal opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books I have ever read. Masterpiece","review":"One of the few books in recent memory to be critically acclaimed (it was shortlisted for the Booker Prize) as well as genuinely interesting. All too often so-call literary 'works' are dreary collections of an author's attempt to win him/herself a prize.Never Let Me Go is breathtaking in its originality. And, even better, is the equisite style that the writer expresses the shocking future that has been dreamed up. If you enjoyed Margaret Atwoods 'Handmaids Tale' or 'Oryx & Crake' then this book is an absolute must have.Read it, give it to your friends, then sit back and be prepared to while away many happy hours in discussion about the ethical dilemnas posed within."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just ok for me","review":"I loved The Remains of the Day and so decided to read Ishiguro's other books. I was really rather disappointed. I expected and hoped for the subtle intricacies and fulfilling storytelling I got from The Remains of the Day, but didn't quite get it. Of course reading the story still left me with high regard for the author's imaginative and narrative abilities, but I felt disconnected to all of the characters and the story moved slowly for me. I will say this book is way better than Ishiguro's When we were Orphans, which I found almost ridiculous. Great writer, but I think he had it right with The Remains of the Day, not quite with this novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hauntingly beautiful","review":"This novel is a real find. The story is beautifully and sensitively written. Although you kind of know what is happening, you also yearn for the charachters to get the full story themselves. This book very sensitively looks at a very difficult moral issue. This is not at all Sci Fi as some reviewers have said. It is a beautiful story about a possible future. Very thought provoking. Great read for a book club!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I thought this book drug on a long time with nothing much happening. No real suspense and I kept expecting the characters ro act human and fight for survival. Depressing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the tears..and your time","review":"I read this for a book club and while the point of a book club is to read books you normally wouldn't I really didn't think this book would be something I would like but I couldn't put it down. I read the book in two days And while there is some real sadness and a disturbing concept the characters are developed well, you grow to love or hate them and I thouroughly enjoyed it. Yes I grew to love these characters and I did cry in the end when the inevitable came but it was worth it. Kazuo Ishiguro has done it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"How we make ourselves comfortable with a life sustained by exploitation","review":"...and: a meditation on the ironies of human existence, a study of constructive versus destructive responses to mortality, a theory of art and love, a beautiful,tragic love story, an excellent character study. All wrapped up in an elegant plot and gorgeous, simple, prose. How did he *do* that? I don't know, but I'll never forget it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put it down","review":"I had forgotten what it was like to be so engrossed in a book that I literally could not put it down. Kazuo Ishiguro's Never Let Me Go is that sort of book. I was so glad I didn't know anything about the novel going in, because it made it so much more interesting to watch the story unfold. Ishiguro's writing is beautiful and descriptive, and truly a joy to read.The movie, on the other hand, is terrible, and a huge disappointment after reading this beautiful book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Haunting","review":"This is a haunting read that is told in a very interesting way. By having the main character look back from a distance it allows a reader to understand the world at Hailsham while also being drawn into how the future unfolds. It is a very good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring....","review":"I so wanted to like this novel, but it was so slow and the ending was probably the best part."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missed opportunity","review":"I bought this book because a friend was reading it and recommended it based on the first third he had read so far. When he finished he said it was \\"kinda anti-climatic\\", which I have to agree with, and not only because you could tell how the book was going to play out almost from the beginning, but because the characters hardly develop at all. Really, given what was happening to them, I'd have thought that realistic characters would have reacted pretty differently. Also, the universe itself wasn't self-consistent. I'm not sure how to explain that comment without giving away ploy, so I won't.At the same time, it was an entertaining, quick and easy read because it's written in a conversational, first person, dialog-driven style. I was always eager to pick it up and continue, so I'm not willing to say that it's not worth reading at all. And yet it was disappointing, because it felt like a missed opportunity to better explore the reality and characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"The one flaw","review":"This was a beautifully written book, as most other reviewers have noted, but at times it became too obvious. At various moments throughout the narrative, questions are answered in an abrupt fashion. It felt like every time I was beginning to figure out what was going on, a figure appears who answers all my questions and then some. It became disconcerting at times, though the characters and prose kept me going.It was a delightful read and worth the money and time, but it had a potential that few contemporary books do, and it fell short."},{"rating":"1","title":"wrting poor","review":"It was a good theme/topic but poorly written, almost like he did not really know what he was writing about and starts with new sentences/ideas and then continue with a new idea. Also interesting that he writes from a female point of view. Too many questions at the end and you wonder what was the reason for the story?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Revisiting Hitler","review":"Book reminds one of movie about efforts in south America to clone little Hitler's to ensure continuation of the master race. Supposedly motives were higher in this book, but end result is gruesome and terrifying.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never Let Me Go","review":"I didn't like the topic, but I was hoping for a good ending so I read to the end. Character development was intriquing. I liked that each of the student's personality was flawed. Upraising, was basically quite lacking in clear understanding of the world and it's issues."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring!","review":"I thought this would be better. This was one of my daughter's assigned summer reading books. I often read along so that we can have discussions. I could not get into this book at all and abandoned it about half way in. It is too slow moving for my taste!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been great as a short story","review":"Dahl or Poe would have loved the (darker) subject matter of this book for a short story. Unfortunately Ishiguro ruins it by adding page after page of pointless, banal high school anecdote. It seems as he was working on a \\"Catcher in the Rye\\" type of book, but it was too bland so he decided to add the subject matter of cloning and organ donors. Or the other way around, which would be even worst. Anyway, if you liked \\"Remains of the day\\" avoid this, or be very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"How to Transform a Great Premise into a Terrible Story","review":"What a premise! What an idea for a fantastic science-fiction novel! What a terrible story that was written. Instead of focusing on the premise of the story (cloning, morality issues, lack of family, lack of history, the crimes against humanity), Ishiguro focuses on the boring, childish, and uninteresting lives of school children, barely touching upon the premise of the book until more than two-thirds the way through. This was not touching, or intresting, and it really should have been. Ishiguro tried to ring it all in at the end, piling up the \\"moving\\" elements of the story, but it was too little to late. Furthermore, he relied upon ridiculous exposition to fill us readers in on how this alternate world came to be. I was equally disappointed with Ishiguro's \\"When We Were Orphans.\\" This is my last book of his. Read at your own risk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't Get Too Comfortable","review":"\\"Never Let Me Go\\" is a spooky little cautionary tale from the author of \\"Remains of the Day\\" about the ethical implications of a world where cloning is used to create people who grow to serve as sources of transplant organs. Like the young characters at the English boarding school where most of the story is set, we are only given pieces of the story along the way. By the end, the whole scenario is certainly unsettling, but perhaps not horrifying, as those in the society have come to regard it--surely there's something wrong, but it's hard to stop when so many people are being saved. The object lesson, I think, is to not let such a system get started, no matter what amazing advances are achieved in cloning technology."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not an enjoyable read - for reasons both good and bad.","review":"On the positive side - the sense of dread starts on page one and doesn't let up. Reading this novel is similar to reading Atwood's \\"The Handmaid's Tale\\" - you can't put it down, but you feel despair the whole time you're reading it. This is no small accomplishment and I credit Ishiguro with his ability to write something so compelling.On the negative side - also like the Handmaid's Tale, this novel is agenda-driven, and like most novels with an agenda, the characters are just pawns, not seeming to breathe with a life of their own. Ishiguro seems to have made a specialty out of creating the emotionless, repressed character, and receives a lot of admiration for this, but given the situation the narrator finds herself in, it's pretty unsatisfying that she spends the entire novel reasoning her way through it and observing others' emotional moments, not expressing any feeling of her own beyond irritation or mild pleasure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never thought a sci-fi novel would be so good!","review":"It would be hard to decide in which shelve this book should go, it could go under romance, or under sci-fi, I probably would not read it if it was under sci-fi. It is a great story, very well written, with a curious twist that makes it unique. Absolutely worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought-Provoking Story","review":"I enjoyed this book very much. It is an intriguing story with a quiet, sad quality to it. This book has made me think a lot about life and what our role is here on this planet and during this life-time."},{"rating":"2","title":"DISTURBING SUBJECT","review":"Ishiguro's work THE REMAINS OF THE DAY is a study in self-repression and lives of quiet desperation. NEVER LET ME GO can be equally disturbing as it unfolds to reveal a controversial subject matter. The story is narrated by a human clone and is a sort of autobiography, wherein the clone relates her story and that of the other clones she grew up with. Their reason for existence is to be organ donors to the final 'completion', the last donation and final total harvesting. The book is told in flashbacks starting with the clone friends at grammar school in a private boarding school and coming through adulthood and end of life for some. The entire story is from the clone's point of view, and many questions regarding ethics and morality are posed. This book is a good choice for any book club seeking lively debate."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book that leaves you to ponder","review":"This book left me feeling a little unsettled. To be honest I found the story at times a little flat, but the snippets of information revealing the truth about the boarding school 'Hailsham' kept me inspired to keep reading. The scenario as it unfolds puts a 'human' perspective on the ethics of genetic science and raises questions on the implications of its use; all within the story without standing on a high horse and lecturing. Overall a well written book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful.","review":"This book is beautiful. There's nothing that I can say which hasn't been said by other reviewers. I just want to say that it's exquisitely, agonisingly beautiful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let me spare you the agony","review":"While you'd think that the topic of cloning could provide an author with endless fodder for interesting and compelling writing, Ishiguro succeeded in making cloning the most boring topic known to man. The author inserts all of these obscure references and tid-bits that are supposed to intrigue the reader. All fall flat and had me saying: \\"You have got to be kidding me.\\" The first-person narration is repetitive, one-dimensional, and as dull as can be. Neither the narrator nor the main characters has an ounce of depth. Furthermore, the \\"mysteries\\" are revealed in the very last pages of the book. The revelations are even more boring than the book itself. What a waste. This author took a potentially fascinating topic and turned it into a dreadfully uneventful account of the lives of faceless students living at a lifeless, cardboard boarding school. Do not waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much psychological introspection","review":"I listened to the whole thing on CDs in my car. If I had been reading, I would not have finished it. Mostly psychological introspection that goes on and on and on. Too slow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"This was one of the first books I read on my kindle and I have to say I was hugely dissapointed. The author gives so many unimportant details and just when you think there will be some revelation as to what is going on, the narrator takes 10 steps back to tell you the background of the story. You don't really find out what exactly is going on until the end of the book. It was a struggle to finish the book. The character development and relationships were great and the premise of the story was good too. Bad execution."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"I should begin this review by saying I have never been so disappointed by a book that I felt compelled to save my fellow readers from the same waste if time. The premise of this book is promising and even a bit intriguing. However, the \\"secret\\" becomes fairly obvious almost right away. I kept waiting for a twist in the story, but it never came.All in all, if you're looking for an escape or a page-turner, this is not the book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"By the second chapter I was wondering how The Sunday Times could have called this \\"The year's most remarkable novel\\", unless this was faint praise and the publisher's had pulled the phrase out of context. By the third chapter the premise of the book was obvious and I kept thinking it might get better. It didn't ... the characters just seem to meander along in an aimless daze letting their fate arrive. I didn't bother to finish the book - I have better things to do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another success for Ishiguro","review":"Ishiguro has created an intense weave of characters and situations. Even though this book did not capture me in the same way as Remains of the Day which is one of my favorite reads, I am recommending this to my friends who like a thoughtful novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable fiction","review":"Probably the most interesting thing about science fiction and fantasy is when I can see myself reflected in the characters, no matter how different the situations. Knowing the subject of the book is people who had been cloned, I had some doubts initially, particularly when some of the characters seemed to get easily emotional. But the book is an excellent exploration into what it is to be human and how we treat each other: particularly those who we deem, for one reason or another, to not live up to our standards."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uninteresting and very boring","review":"I bought this book because I had seen the movie before but the book is a disappointment. It's so dull and mild and uninteresting that the only thing that helped me to finish it was the fact that one Sunday we had an electricity problem here in the building and so, without lights / TV etc I had nothing else to do, so I obliged myself to read this book. The only thing that I liked a little bit was the solitude of the main character because I am also a lonely person and enjoy loneliness. Nothing else appealed to me. I don't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yaaawwnnn.","review":"What a complete waist of time and money. Not even going to bother watching the movie! I have never been so bored in my life!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Impressed","review":"While the narrative was well-written, the plot itself was bland. Several of my friends had told me what a great this book this is, so I had high expectations. Ultimately, it was a let-down and lacks imagination."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I had high expectations for this book, and unfortunately, this book did not deliver.

If I were Queen of the Universe, this typeface would actually be outlawed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Clone is a Clone is a Clone","review":"What exactly does it mean to be a duplicate of another living being? Do clones have souls? Is your life a lie or does it lie something deeper? What happens when you only have questions, and not enough direction for answers?These are the types of quandaries set up by Mr. Ishiguro's short, but powerful, science fiction novel for those that don't like science fiction. It has it's faults, sure, but the strength of his literary convictions far surpasses the thin plot and lack of memorable supporting cast."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gave it a Try","review":"I've learned long ago that it is OKAY to leave a book without finishing it.

The writing is dull and suffers from so much understatement that the characters do not come alive. After I figured out the situation early on,the rest of the story limped to its flat ending. Actually the style seemed to match that of a Young Adult novel. Even though her subject is not specifically the same, Jodi Picoult's My Sister's Keeper is much better at character development, style, and plot;and it delves deeply into a similar controversial topic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"This was a depressing, stupid book--waste of time--made into a stupid, depressing movie. The joke's on me. I read the book and watched the movie. Teens will LOVE it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A slow paced book","review":"Maybe I should have gathered this, but the narrator's voice is British which through me off at first for a bit. Took a little while to get used to. Also, in general, the book moves fairly slowly. The author throws in some foreshadowing but takes too long to get to those more interesting parts of the book. Some intriguing issues to think about arise, but I would have liked the book to move along faster."},{"rating":"1","title":"the evil of banality, redux","review":"Want to read an excruciatingly dull book full of boring, petty characters whose sole desire is to return to a sterotype of a British public school? Here ya go.Not to mention, every major plot device in this book can be predicted chapters in advance by any half-competent SF devotee. (And that every major plot turning has been scrupulously signposted with a billboard for the presumably ignorant reader.)The only evils of this book that haven't been hashed and rehashed are: 1) the fact that you're going to spend $25 to come away completely unenlightened about anything that matters; and 2) that the leading literary lights consider this to be a work of the highest caliber.If you want to read about the banality of evil in an engrossing and rich book, go read Michel Faber's \\"Under the Skin\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Island or Never Let Me Go???","review":"I usually adore Ishiguro's work but this one falls short of the mark. I still enjoyed the writing but the story didn't deliver. Like other reviewers said, it was too similar to the sci-fi movie \\"The Island\\". Furthermore, there was a build-up as if some big secret was going to be revealed and nothing came of it. I will still keep on reading his novels because I love his style."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well written but gruesome","review":"Give this 5 stars for being well written but negative 5 stars for leading the reader into what is thought to be old school freinds reminiscing and turns out to be a ghoulish story about cloned children that are raised to be harvested for body parts for transplant. After 4 \\"donations\\" they \\"complete\\". I couldn't put it down, but also wanted it to be over and wished I'd never read it. Read this only if you are interested in this gruesome theme! Maybe I'm missing the deeper theme...."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!","review":"I was so very disappointed by this book. I found the language stilted and the dialog terribly childish and stiff. I had the \\"secret\\" figured out after the first 10 pages and the ending was a complete anti-climax."},{"rating":"2","title":"So, Go, already!","review":"Ishiguro's style is impeccable: The the horror seeps and creeps magnificently. Then about two thirds through I started scanning pages. Ok. I get it. These people have real souls, feelings, aspirations; they are real humans. I just don't rave about books that go on 250 pages and then have tell all denouments that come in a burst such as takes place in this book in Chapters 21 and 22. But if you think about it, we, the readers, became the 'students' at the hand of Mr. Ishiguro. We have our own nightmares: Whatever became of all the 'babies'?"},{"rating":"1","title":"the short of it","review":"I'll keep this short. Never Let Me Go: Great premise; unlikeable characters involved in pointless melodrama; boring read; not much really happens. Disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grave Disappointment","review":"This novel offers little more than a nice thread of suspense throughout. I didn't find Ishiguro's book to offer any more insights than a mediocre mass market novel would. The lack of complexity is astounding."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please....let this book go...","review":"This book falls into a category I call \\"overpraised and underwhelmed\\" and I'm the one underwhelmed. To call this book a \\"page turner\\" is a joke. I found it tedious in the extreme, the story incredibly boring. I kept hoping that something would happen on one of the pages to justify sticking with it but nothing ever does. The main characters have twisted interior logic, even for clones. No one fights back, very little is explained. It just didn't do it for me. Sorry Kazuo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious, monotonous + Depressing","review":"This soft science fiction book about people raised for organ donations was over-chatty and annoying to read. The narrative in the first person went into painstaking detail about trivial he said, she said conversations that added absolutely nothing to the book. I can read a novel in a weekend if it's a real page turner, but this book doesn't even come close. It took me weeks to get through the book. The characters are very unbelievable. I kept waiting for some sort of conflict or turn of events to happen, hoping there would be an important conclusion, but one never came. Overall, the book felt like a one-sided, never ending, tedious monologue. I don't recommend it unless you enjoy bland, uneventful writing. Lastly, it's just down-right depressing to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zzzzzzzz.....","review":"Wow. If you want a book that never EVER comes to a climax, this is the book for you. Honestly one of the most boring books I have ever read. It had a slow start, a slow middle, and right up until the last page...SLOW. I had to finish it because it was my book club read. Ugh. If you want to torture yourself read this book. This book could have been written in about 1/2 the amount of pages used. It does not evoke one amount of emotion in my body. I'm not sure why all the good reviews!?The book is written in the first person, by Kathy and all she does is talk about what she says to another character, how she felt when she said it, before she said it and after she said it. And, then talks about the other character's response, how she THINKS they felt, how they really felt and years later how one thing she said had an effect. Bored yet? That's the ENTIRE book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Am I missing something?","review":"Maybe my expectations were too high, based on some of the readers' reviews of this book, but I thought it was a waste of time!! I kept thinking the book would go somewhere, but it was ultimately a slow, boring book. If you like to read for entertainment, skip this one!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Never Let Me Read This Again","review":"Never Let Me Go is exactly what I did. I couldn't finish the book. It was just too boring. The mystery aspect was annoying and trite. The characters were flat, banal, and childish.The theme that all of the other reviewers seem to be raving about as something new and unheard of have obviously missed out on the not-that recent blockbuster film, The Island. This is not a new idea and not something so revolutionary that it merits the rave reviews. So what it makes you question science. I would rather question science reading a Scientific American than forcing myself to read another of page of this boring novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chilling and unforgettable","review":"I read this book with absolutely no idea what it was about so the chilling reality snuck up on me and will never leave me, I'm sure.The character's matter of fact attitude toward their existence was the most eerie part. I have always felt that cloning could have one of three outcomes: first, it won't work, second, it creates monsters and third, it will work and that will change everything. But this book gives a horrible fourth possibility, it works and no one thinks anything of it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"well written","review":"I loved the author's way of writing- very poetic. I was able to place myself into the story very easily.. however, I did not care for the plot very much. Much of it was confusing and kept my mind curious, pushing me through the book very quickly, hoping to find the answers to some of my question... which were answered- to a point. Not a big fan of scifi things mixed into stories that read like a true memoir. It just wasn't of the nature I usually go after and I especially didn't care for the ending. I don't want to tell anything away but I don't like the way Kathy H. parted with Tommy. If it wasn't for the magnificent writing of the author I would have given it 2 stars. I will be sure to check out another of his works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bleh...","review":"Not interesting if you ask me. Premise is pretty good but the writer took it nowhere. I was loathed to finish it but I did. Not a fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me.","review":"I bought this book because the premise was an interesting, if not totally original one and I believed it would be an enjoyable and/or thought provoking way to pass the time on a four hour flight. However, I have to admit I was disappointed by the end product. I found the narrator's voice incredibly monotonous, the plot poorly paced and the characters largely unsympathetic. There were one or two nice flourishes but overall not enough to justify a positive review."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"I read Remains of the Day in high school and I absolutely loved it, so I was very excited to read this book. I hadn't read what it was about because I didn't want to spoil it, so I won't say what it's about here. It's an altogether different story than Remains of the Day, but the same superb, Ishiguro writing style. I highly recommend this book! It's a page turner that'll keep you hooked to the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disturbing reading","review":"The book touched me somewhere very deep in my heart. Even now after some time when thinking of it I feel.. inconvenient. I am not planning to read it again, but it will be impossible to forget what this book is about.It is about love, difference, pain, hope. It is about acceptance of those who are not like you. It is about our cruel world. About ethics. It is making one think how ethical are our attempts to clone, to try and change natural circles of life.I do recommend you to read this book. Please note that it is not an easy bed-time reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow, repetitive and boring","review":"This book was a selection of my book group, so a \\"must read,\\" which, frankly, if not so,would have gone in the \\"don't finish\\" pile. It was a struggle to finish, with little really interesting happening, constant references to \\"if I said this\\" \\"then that\\" or \\"if I had only known this\\" \\"then that\\" and on and on ad nauseum. I read \\"The Remains of The Day\\" and enjoyed it, and very much looked forward to this book--what a disappointment.The plot was veiled but obvious from the beginning--wicked science, out of control, clones--issues which either have been or will be concerning--but packaged in this book--no go. Can't understand either, as other commentators have said, how this particular book was considered for awards.Even my husband the science fiction fan threw up his hands after trying to read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a dissapointment!","review":"I was expecting a science related horror story. Instead, it was a boring story of a \\"doner\\" facing the end of her meaningless life reminiscing about her childhood friendships - which wasn't all that interesting. Other than that, nothing happened. I kept reading, hoping for something to happen; a revolt, a twist, or any kind of action. But no, it just ended uninteresting, and unfullfiling.Maybe if she had fought for her rights or even questioned it, I would have cared about what happened to her. But if she didn't care, then why as a reader should I?*Possible Spoiler*The author must have agreed that clones would not have souls because even after hearing their whole life story, I had no feelings for the characters or cared that they had completed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let go already!","review":"First the good news. The book is written with great skill and parts of it are very beautiful and touching. The bad news is there is not enough here for a novel. It has the feel of a short story that has been stretched out beyond its own life. Under-whelming to say the least. The whole idea of cloning and its possible results, good or bad, are barely touched in the nearly 300 pages. In the end it is abook about many details that I didn't care about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant and moving","review":"Ishiguro is a wonderful prose stylist in every dimension (dialogue, narrative, pace, structure) and this is a sad and thought-provoking book, worth hundreds of droning bio-ethics tracts. A wise, sad and compelling novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good idea muddled in verbose idiocy","review":"I was so disappointed. I love Ishiguro's earlier work. But this story almost bored me to tears. There's none of the suspense and hunger a reader feels when they pick up The Handmaid's Tale. The narrator Kathy is by far one of the worst story-tellers in existence. All the dialogue reads like it's the same person speaking over and over again. The narrator downright refuses to ever get to the point therefore each section is drug out page after page without the reader learning anything but frustration. Didn't anyone edit Ishiguro? Or do they stop doing that after you win a Booker Prize?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Subdued, melancholic, brilliant","review":"What if I told you that Haruki Murakami has recently shared that this is his favourite book of all times? Enough said."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haunting and lovely","review":"Kazuo Ishiguro portrays an exquisitely detailed and emotionally controlled alternate world which simmers with existential questions in the haunting, delicate, and horrific \\"Never Let Me Go.\\" While the book imagines a world where cancer has been cured at a terrible price, I have read that the most basic question raised by this novel is this: In what ways are the lives we are living constrained by our inability to imagine something else? Ishiguro's characters, who we meet as children at boarding school, are by turns loving, capricious, fair-minded, shallow... in other words, they are just kids, struggling to discover who they are. Their humanity only enhances the nagging feeling that this placid world Ishiguro has created was born out of something deeply unholy. Is this a cautionary tale? I'm not certain. Whatever it is, it is a lovely piece of very literate pseudo-science fiction that leaves one troubled for days."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review without spoilers","review":"Listen. The experience of reading this book requires that you know nothing of it. It is an unfolding revelation and to review it is to spoil it. Stop reading these reviews before you ruin it for yourself, and just get the book and read it. I'm glad it was recommended to me by a friend, so I didn't bother with reviews...if I had, a lovely reading experience would have been lost!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"More crude than Life of PI, but no pathos","review":"Simply inhumane, maybe well written prose, but the cynicism is unbearable. It is an exercise in telling an awfully cruel story in the most subdued tone. Literature can and should be enjoyable, this is Hannibal the Cannibal trying to be intellectual."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Novel Is a Let Down","review":"I purchased this book at the recommendation of an avid reader and librarian. I enjoy both literary works and nonfiction that address difficult social issues and had great expectations for this work. Although I did not know the exact subject of the book in the beginning, it became clear. I assume there are spoilers in the reviews, but I won't provide details other than to say the writer lacked artistic talent to reach any real climax or resolve potential character arcs. I finished reading this book some time prior to the film adaptation which was considerably worse than the book. My advice is to invest your time in other literature. This was a slow and boring read and a let down."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good read (but skip the movie!)","review":"I enjoyed the book. The writing style was engaging and made for an easy read. The premise is disturbing but makes for a good book club discussion. I literally had difficulty staying awake for the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heart wrenching!!","review":"This book is so much better than the movie. If you liked the movie, you HAVE to read the book. It will make you laugh, cry, and wonder...what if?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful writing creates haunting moments","review":"It is the sensitive but matter-of-fact way that Kathy H tells her story, describes her life, that makes it so touching. She accepts her lot, doesn't try to escape it. The universality of her school life made her story resonate more. The passages when she and Tommy learn the truth about how the world views them, how those not at Hailsham were treated, the reason behind all that artwork ... so powerful. My only complaint about the book was the pacing. I wish the story had unfolded faster. (Though it's possible I felt that way because I already saw the movie.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't help but let this one go","review":"Overall, Never Let Me Go by Kazuo Ishiguro is a book about clones who grow up for the sole purpose of providing organ donors. On paper this sounds like a great idea, but in reality this book is garbage. It is poorly written and sounds more like a girl's diary than the well-written novel that my school has made it out to be. The character is scatter-brained; she'll be talking about her friend, and somehow it will remind her of another time in which something entirely different happened, and then that reminder will remind her of another thing, and so on. Never Let Me Go is poorly written, and if you can avoid reading it, I recommend doing so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad Story","review":"Twice I started this book (picked it up at the book store because I admire the author) and each time I read 2/3 of the story and had to put it down. Where was the hope?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"I was very much looking forward to reading this book, so I was very disappointed in the novel. I found the characters flat and the story predictable. It amazes me that it was nominated for a Man Booker Prize. Every year, I read the winner of this prestigious award, as well as most of the short-listed books. Although some of the books are not as interesting to me as others, they are at least well-crafted and beautifully written. I cannot imagine why this book was chosen. If Ishiguro was trying to be bland in order to mirror the lives of the characters, it was a stylistic mistake."},{"rating":"1","title":"poorly written, extremely boring","review":"THoguht the book was poorly written, extremely boring. At the end of the story, the author tried to address the unanswered questions in such a junvenile way via some long winded conversation.couldn't understand why people call this a master piece, to me there was nothing master about it. I wonder whether i read the same book. Even the whole story is flawed, lack real logic. Why don't they fight for their own fate, since they have all the capabilities of thinking, acting like human, and the freedom to move around. They also don't want to go through the donation process (ie. ask for extensions). Seems quite silly.anyhow, thought it was a waste of my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just bad writing","review":"The structure was awful, he digresses and goes off on tangents and backtracks. The male characters are all dopey pushovers while the female characters combine self-centered with anything from a grab bag of personality flaws. The main character Kathy is self-centered and condescending. Ruth is self-centered and two-faced.The sci-fi theme is played out and takes away from the attempt at story. Though it looks like the author chose to completely forgo a plot and instead tried to create atmosphere. Any sense of foreboding or consequences is destroyed page one by knowing that everyone survives and they repair their relationships.Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"#1 Worst book I've ever read","review":"This is by far the WORST book I've ever read in my life. It was the flattest, most agonizingly slow collection of nothing that's ever invaded my brain. 50 pages into the book I was hoping every character would be decimated by some catastrophic event and the rest of the pages were ISBN barcodes or something.There were three pages (Count 'em. One. Two. Three.) that were exciting. The first two occur near the end of the book and explain what the hell you've been reading this entire time, and the last page of the book explains a very cool idea.Otherwise, if you like books where things happen, steer clear of this one.Worst book I've ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ishiguro strikes out again","review":"I liked Remains of the Day and I've been waiting for something readable from Ishiguro since then. His new book is not nearly up to the standard he set with Remains of the Day. It doesn't seem like he is acquiring any life experiences from which to draw on for his stories; but his stories are so unimaginative and unexplanatory that they are frightfully dull. It's hard for me to believe that publishers keep publishing his books. My advice on this one: don't even pick it up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended","review":"I enjoy books that do one of two things. They either really entertain me (I'm amused or shocked or fascinated, etc.) or they impart some valuable information or insight. The best books do both. This one did neither.And, as others have mentioned, there are some real problems with the basic premise of the book. The way they go about harvesting the organs seems very inefficient. And why are these people so incredibly passive? There are other questions but probably the biggest one is that we need to imagine that such an ethically repulsive practice could exist in 1990s England. This would have required an alternative history that resulted in a very different England, or world for that matter, and this history would have to be built into the book in some way. But actually, I don't think there's a story here that would have made all that trouble worthwhile."},{"rating":"1","title":"wouldn't buy from here again","review":"The book that I purchased was supposed to be in new condition and it was far from it. It had some gunk all over the wrinkled cover and the inside of the first few pages. It was obviously a well used book that someone had spilt over, I could have intentionally bought one like that for $5."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flat and no Excitement","review":"The subject is intriguing and the story had potential but the more I read the more restless I became because nothing was happening. The writing style and grammar leaves much to be desired and it goes on and on where you keep wondering when it will get to the point. The characters are deadpan boring and emotionless without spark and sense and it ends the same way. No big climax or finale, just the same crap and then it's done. I would not recommend this book to anyone. I was going to see the movie in the hopes they didn't stick exactly to the story which is often the case, but when I read those reviews I could tell that the movie is exactly like the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Too Weird And Non-Engaging","review":"I thought the synopsis for Never Let Me Go sounded interesting,but unfortunately the book was not.I just could not come to care for any of the characters,and I felt they were total non-persons,with no personality,no rational thought,and I just no longer cared."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I could give it no stars I would","review":"It's clear from the opening lines that the book is about an English boarding school that has something to do with clones or organ donors. I think this was a mistake, because it gives the reader the impression that the novel might actually be interesting! My curiosity was piqued, but absolutely nothing came of it. There's no build, no peaks and troughs, no sense of unfolding mystery...on and on it drones. I broke my 70 Page Rule (which states that any book, regardless of its length, should be able to draw the reader in by 70 pages) and actually read about 100 pages (probably because I'd enjoyed Remains of the Day so much) but found precisely nothing to sustain my interest."},{"rating":"1","title":"not believable on any level","review":"The problem with the story is that you have to buy the premise that these donors go to the slaughter like sheep. The society that is shown to us (English Boarding School) is just too human and the idea of the kind of sacrifice they give is too ridiculous to be believed in a normal earthly setting. It would make more sense to have taken place in an alternate world or another world altogether. Even in Nazi Germany, no one VOLUNTEERED to go see Dr. Mengele."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull as dirt","review":"I am a bookworm and am always looking for great new novels. I heard some great things about this book so I picked it up at the library. I'm soooo glad I didn't waste my money! I think it was a really cool concept, but I really had to struggle to finish it. It just drags on and there's never any action or anything the least bit interesting. And if you've read any review about it, you already know basically what's going on anyway. I kept thinking surely there will be some surprise at the end or something really cool will happen. Nope."},{"rating":"1","title":"No emotion","review":"This is one of those books where you like the idea of the book but not the book itself. This book didn't really make me feel anything. I never got so that I cared about the characters. I never came to feel that the characters cared about each other either. This is one of the books that you know you read but you just can't really remember later on. I wouldn't recommend this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Recommended","review":"The book was very depressing. I would not recommend it to anyone. Do not waste your money nor your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"No emotion","review":"This novel had a good premise, and i was expecting excitement and emotions running high. Instead, it was probably the most emotionless, soulless, boring novel i had read. The characters are so unrealistically passive; so much so they are not even realistic. The only gripping and realistic part of the whole story is when one character has a brief existential crisis towards the end of his life and becomes angry with the world. This is about a page long, and the rest of the novel is just void of emotion, rebellion, real questioning, and anger at the atrocities being committed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let it go","review":"I picked up \\"Never Let Me Go\\" expecting, if not something of the caliber of \\"The Remains of the Day\\", then at least a good read. Boy, was I in for a disappointment. Despite its moral implications and what it's trying to say about cloning, \\"Never Let Me Go\\" flunks on a purely literary level. Its prose is basic to the point of seeming neutered, as if metaphors and evocative descriptions were poison. Its narrative devices are cloying and repetitive: seemingly random anecdotes that seem trivial at first. And then stay unredeemed until the end. Its characters are unlikable, difficult to penetrate, but more importantly: they're the epitome of boring.I usually read a book a week. \\"Never Let Me Go\\" took me a month. A month! I'd read three pages and doze off. I only finished it because Ishiguro is the author of a certain story about an English butler.Skip. Toss. Hide. Let go. Believe me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Is this the best novel of the 20th Century?","review":"I recently saw this book on a NY Times list of the greatest books of the 20th Century. So when the movie came on HBO today I watched it - though I missed the first five minutes. I never read the book. I don't read many books because I prefer watching TV. But based on the movie I gave it three stars at first. Then I read the reviews that maintain the book is better than the movie. So I added a star to be fair."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult Read","review":"I wanted to like this book, I really did. It's been made into a movie which made me think it had to be pretty good but I suspect the movie is probably better than the book in this case although I haven't seen the movie.The premise was interesting but it was all explained too briefly near the end of the novel and very little was explained anyway. I really didn't like the characters or the back and forwards of the timeline, and the narrators need to explain things by talking about something and then explaining the back story behind it before explaining properly was incredibly irritating.It took me a couple of weeks to read this book because it was hard to read and hard to want to read. I certainly won't be recommending this book to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"beautifully lyrical overall","review":"A beautifully lyrical piece, deceptively simple prose. Part of the resolution feels a bit forced though; the story would have been better without it. The final few pages, however, help to correct part of this mistake and continues the generally sweet, sad tone of the inevitably of departure.An important commentary on what could plausibly become a major social issue from modern cloning technology."},{"rating":"2","title":"Matter-of-Factly Disquieting.","review":"I finished Never Let Me Go this morning and immediately short-listed it as one of the best pieces of newer fiction I have read. It is simply incredible. The novel is original, but remains consistent with Ishiguro's other works in terms of the style and tone.What makes this particular novel so incredibly chilling is that it is all laid out so matter-of-factly. Despite the more sensational aspects of the storyline, this is NOT just a book about clones who will eventually suffer a terrible fate. Rather, it is written as a sort of memoir from the protagonist's perspective, and the more disturbing details float around the edges of the story - never far from the reader's mind, but seldom thrust in your face. The book is not heavy-handed and there is no clear agenda from the author's perspective. It's not even futuristic in nature. It's just unnerving."},{"rating":"2","title":"In light of South Korea's news regarding cloning...","review":"I purchased this book on CD to listen to on my 3 to 4 time a week 2 hour commute and was sucked in. Somehow listening to a book gives it an entirely different feel for me, maybe because I read rather fast and hearing it spoken (the woman also did the voice for the Blue Fairy in Pinocchio)brings it more to life. I too wondered why they (Tommy, Ruth and Kathi) didn't leave/run away or disappear after they left the cottages. I finished this book at least 3 weeks ago (I'm now listening to Mr. Norrell and Jonathon Strange) and it still is in my mind and with the news of South Korea cloning embryonic stem cells, can image this actually coming to pass. If the future is to grow our own parts, witness the man in Germany who grew a new jaw on his back for later transplant, the producing of clones for harvest is not that hard to imagine. Very thought provoking and highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"An exercise in blandness","review":"I had a difficult time finishing this book but forced myself--hoping that something would finally happen. Sadly, it didn't. The plot went nowhere (pages were devoted to minutiae such as a lost cassette tape and a controversy involving a pencil case ... zzzz). Further, the characters were extremely bland and spent very little time in serious self-examination.I kept hoping for some sort of epiphany that would move the \\"students\\" to rebel and do something to change their fate. Instead, the story just sort of trickled to an end. I can't recommend this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice try, doesn't work","review":"Two stars might be a bit harsh for this novel, but then again Ishiguro isn't some first time author so I penalize him a little more. I agree with the reader who said this should have been a novella unless Ishiguro could have come up with something more substantial for a plot. He creates a nice air of menace hovering in the background, but the day to day lives of the characters simply aren't interesting enough to sustain the first half of the book. I've noticed something interesting about many of the five star reviews--they seem to be reviewing the book's criticism of runaway technology without moral guidelines instead of the book itself.

Again, I am on page 63 and i still do not know what a carer is. I am so disappointed. the slip cover looked so interesting--friends sheltered from the outside world meeting later on in their lives. There was no meat as to what took place in the environment they lived and what was the purpose of a carer or a guardian? Truly a horrible book.

I nearly put down the book after 200 pages but pressed on in hopes there'd be something at the end, nothing. I simply cannot believe the great reviews this book has received.The basic story is very thought provoking. Unfortunately none of my thoughts were even remotely played out in the story. How about this, would there be some little shred of Kathy mind that night think, \\"...hey, you know, this doesn't seem fair...\\" or \\"...what would happen if I chose not to donate...\\". Instead we get all these memories about Tommy's favorite polo shirt; or my personal favorite, Ruth's fleeting memory about the shortcut through the rhubarb patch. Just sad.Interesting topic/terrible read. I seldom pen reviews but had to in this case."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really Depressing","review":"Not worth reading at all!

I didn't want to keep it, and -- ask any visitor -- I don't get rid of many books. I slogged through it on a 7-week business trip when I was so tired at night I could read only a few pages. Painfully slow and dreary (even for a fan of dystopian novels), soporific, with unsympathetic characters and the worst, most maddening schoolmate ever.

The first 4/5 is mindless dribble about a woman reliving her childhood, teen years, and early adulthood. They drop hints about some larger social aspects that you figure out if you are still paying attention and your brain's not numb. So in the last fifth of the book, Ishiguro decides to try and develop a plot and, surprise! it doesn't go anywhere. The only reason I didn't just stop reading was because I was hoping he would throw in some huge twist, this hope was based on the fact that SO many people gave it a good review. Anyone who gave this book a good review probably thought that reading this made them somehow more cerebral even though it was a huge ball of nothing. The premise made me purchase it, but the most interesting thing about the book is the synopsis. I appreciate subtle literature, but this was so subtle he forgot to include a story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"This is an engaging story with great character development.

Turns into a 300 page teenage girl diary with all the nuances and trepidation of those young years - unfortunately it never amounts to anything deeper. Page after page is filled with completely boring useless details - makes me want to scream that I wasted time on this book waiting for some sort of \\"Ahhh! all that nonsense was worth reading in the end\\" moment.

This book follows the story of a group of 3 friends that are raised in a sort of school for clones as told by the main character Kathy. The novel follows them through their transitions into their world. The book is very sad once you understand the way they go through their lives and accept and understand their ultimate fates. The novel really makes you evaluate your views on cloning. It has moments of joy and sadness that really do stir your emotions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haunting","review":"A beautifully written, thought-provoking meditation on the clash between humanity and technology and on a society that is willing to place relative values on individual lives. Ishiguro's world is a science fiction dystopia, of course, but he prompts us to ask ourselves, is our own society really all that different?SPOILER:People have complained about spoilers in reviews, but the spoilers are, unfortunately, right there in the front of the book in the cip data, which includes the categories of \\"Cloning\\" and \\"Organ donors.\\" So before I even began reading, I already knew what it was all about. Am I the only one who actually reads cip data? One of the hazards of working in publishing, I suppose."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my top 5 favorite novels","review":"It's not often that I read a book that reminds me why I like to read so much. Never Let Me Go by Kazuo Ishiguro is one of those books. I can't give you a synopsis without completely ruining it for you, but trust me when I say that it is everything that it seems, but more importantly, it is nothing that you'd expect. It follows the life of the narrator, Kath, through her memories of her friends in boarding school and beyond, yet there is a dark secret that the author only let's you in on gradually. It is a secret that really makes you think about science, morality, and what it means to be human. It is a story that is both heartwarming and heartbreaking at the same.This is officially in my top 5 list of favorite novels!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant exposition","review":"I was genuinely intrigued by Ishiguro's strength of narrative technique insofar as his exposition was masterful. He lets the story unfold like a blossoming rose told from the point-of-view of a caregiver living among human clones created to provide body parts for normal humans. The narrative was so gentle and simple that ultimately there's great power evident here in the story telling. I think it's quite possible that some reviewers have gone a bit overboard in their praise of this writer. But the understatement of the narrative style did definitely impress me as a sign of great maturity and skill by the author of The Remains of the Day. This is a dark and sad and disturbing novel, which is a trademark of Booker Award winners and finalists. But there is no denying the talent of Ishiguro in the quiet prowess of his story-telling."},{"rating":"1","title":"standard sci-fi premise for a standard romance.","review":"This may be Ishiguro's most accessible novel since Remains of The Day, but that's not necessarily a good thing. Where The Unconsoled and When We Were Orphans were surreal masterpieces of disjointed dream-illogic, this novel takes a fairly standard science-fiction premise and uses it as the backdrop to a fairly standard yet oddly dispassionate romance. That's not to say that there is nothing to recommend this book. It has its moments of beautiful prose, thought-provoking characterizations and, of course, it's not a semi-autobiographical portrait of a creative writing professor, as so many novels seem to be these days. But it's funny: I just saw the film Me You And Everybody We Know the other night, and it succeeded at the kind of story Ishiguro has told so well in the past far better than this novel does."},{"rating":"2","title":"a nice book :)","review":"it is a nice book :D if you enjoy fiction and drama, i'm sure you will like it very very much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different","review":"Me and a partner read this book for our syfy final project. The first couple of chapters are a tad bit hard to get through but once it starts to pick up it is hard to put down.

Over all we both greatly enjoyed the book and it was a good choice for it made our project fun and easy."},{"rating":"2","title":"interesting","review":"An interesting idea. Enjoyed the book way more than the movie which disappointed me.Would like to try other books by this author. A good writer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never Let Me Go by Kazuro Ishiguro","review":"This is one of the most emotional, moving stories I have read in some time. A totally original, imaginative work on a subject matter that has been written about before, but never with so much realism and depth. I loved this the same way I loved Margaret Atwoods \\"A Handmaid's Tale,\\" and like Ms. Atwood, Mr. Ishiguro is one of the great writer's of our time. This is a heartbreaking tale."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fine, thought-provoking, and rather creepy novel.","review":"This book tackles an interesting subject -- medical science -- and you can read it as a cautionary tale, a novel describing a dystopia, much like Huxley's Brave New World, or Orwell's 1984. It's certainly observant and instructive on that level, and oddly entertaining.But what makes this a superb novel is the way Ishiguro uses his rather far-out plot to explore issues such as mortality, self-worth, capacity for intimacy, selflessness and so on. Issues that all human beings in the most ordinary of circumstances must face.It is on this level that I found the novel most intriguing.Finally, there are several key plot twists and surprises. I don't want to ruin that aspect of the novel for anybody. Allow me to say only that the narrative itself is mysterious and gripping."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brave New World","review":"Morality versus mortality. It's a timeless struggle and is deeply explored in Ishiguro's latest. Never Let Me Go is a dark, chilling story about a futuristic society in which humans are bred for their organs. True this concept has been done before. Doomsday fiction is all over the place it seems. What put this book above the rest for me, was the character. While she wasn't happy to be one of the donors-to-be, she was strangely frozen when it came to changing her outcome. She didn't fight her destiny. That to me is the brilliance of the book. Are we as humans doomed to destroy our morality in exchange for our selfish desires for immortality?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes you think","review":"This book really made me question a lot of things. Ishiguro is so subtle with everything in the book but hes trying to get you to question how meaningful life can be and how fragile it is. There are probably a couple ways you can interpret this book. You can either look at is a purely entertainment or dig into the deeper meaning of it. Either way a great read! I feel like this will be an important book in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Moving!!!","review":"This is, without a doubt, one of the best books I have ever read. I have never been so emotionally moved by a work of fiction. Kazuo Ishiguro is definitely one of a kind. I was so emotionally entagled with the characters in this book; I was especially fond of Kathy. It's so sad when you realize that human beings could probably be reared to believe almost anything is normal. It's caused me to examine my own beliefs."},{"rating":"2","title":"makes you reflective","review":"Incredible novel. I think the sci-fi angle of this book has been played up too much. Whether you're not a fan of that genre of not, one can't help becoming engrossed this book.This is the kind of book that gives insight into human nature and causes you to reflect on minutia from your childhood. You may find some things take on significance when viewed through adult eyes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ho hum","review":"I thought somehow this would be a searching exploration of a future society, but at best it's an enigmatic half-look at what might happen -- with major expository at the end. Nothing I like less in a book than one character having a major speech at the end that makes everything clear. That's an easy ending. Quite a let-down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful writing but not well researched","review":"This book was a page turner. I enjoyed it very much. I love first person narritve because it brings me right into the story and makes the experience more intimate. This book was moving and thought provoking.The only issue I have to agree upon with the negative reviewers is that the scientific aspects of the story are very poorly researched. It is hard to ignore and that is why I didn't give 5 stars.As far as the fact that the clones accepted their fate without a fight is another problem negative reviewers pointed out. I thought that was the whole point and warning of the story. These people were raised to know what there fate was. They had no other experience. There was now big surprise or shock at the end other than the fact that there gaurdians were trying to protect them and show there humanity and failed.Otherwise I found the story beautiful and I couldn't put it down. I think it took me only 4 days to read. Enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Booker Finalist?","review":"I thought that the simple story of parentless children and their friendships within this institution was touching and the type of thing that Ishiguro writes well, but the story was so unconvincing to me in terms of both the science of cloning and the evil capacity of human nature that I didn't think it was either good science fiction or allegory. In light of this and the page-turning device of unfolding basic information in a much extended, backward sort of way, the novel to me struck only one sustained, tear-jerking note while I waited for the last bits of information to be revealed. It was too removed from reality to be truly important I thought (though many in my book club seemed to heartily believe that harvesting orphan clones organs was certainly in the dark future), and even sappy and self-indulgent in the absence of this real importance. It was a fast enough read that I kept with it to the end, but was left thinking it was quite hack for someone of Ishiguro's reputation."},{"rating":"1","title":"His worst","review":"I've read all his books and have greatly enjoyed them. There were two reasons why I didn't like this book:1) It was boring. I kept waiting for something to happen or some great secret to be revealed, but it didn't. Everyone who picks up the book already knows the main premise.2) He creates a world which is essentially realistic (as opposed to the Unconsolable where anything goes). If it is realistic then why do all the donors accept their fate? I can believe that maybe a certain percentage would be brainwashed and accept their fate, but not all of them. This inconsistency ruined the book for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overwritten, needs to be 200 pages shorter","review":"This book was mediocre. I couldn't wait untill the last page to be rid of this litany. The message was powerful but needed to be delivered in short, pointed prose. To what ends the superficial descriptions of the sex the Hailsham students were having? The novel is peppered with quasi-erotic scenes which do nothing to advance the themes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool Book","review":"This book is very misleading, do not be fooled by the beginning! Read on to find out more, very good book overall. Makes you question your ethics. Also the author is very strange to have written it in a girls perspective,yet his detailed behavior and mannerisms are so accurate it makes you wonder. It's almost like he's a woman trapped in a man's body."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bold and subtle","review":"Never Let Me Go by Ishiguro is thought provoking, romantic, chilling, tragic, simple, subtle...beautifully written.

Comparing to some other well known conspiracy movies this one falls short almost in every respect. The plot lacks focus and is messy. It seems that the director only wanted to take advantage of certain recent events, like the Blackwater inquiry.I have seen movies that are much worse, but the two stars express my disappointment with a movie that looked promising.

Of course there's stuff missing, it's HOURS shorter, it had to be condensed, and for the sake of clarity, things had to be moved around. That's not my problem. My beef is how ungodly BORING the movie is. It's SO SLOW and disjointed, that I felt like I was about to fall asleep. If you want a good thriller, sure, try the original State of Play, which is great, but there are lots of other good thrillers out there, too.

Hard to go wrong, but it did.You would have thought that with all the sophisticated test screening, market research ... etc. to protect their investments, the people who made this film could come up a with a better ending comparable to something like Michael Clayton. But they didn't.Either the research company the producers hired was testing the film at a wrong audience, or the real event this film is based on has still not fully run its course.One way or the other, the producers should fire the market research company that tells them the film will do well.Hope they can correct this if ever there's going to be a director's cut."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trust me and buy the BBC version, not this one","review":"The BBC's mini series, State of Play, on which the American version was, well, sort of, based, is so far superior, it paralyzes the mind. With so many fine actors in the U.S. version, how the director, Kevin MacDonald, managed to get such sorry performances is beyond belief.One thing this 2009 movie (ever wonder why it's already on DVD and Pay TV?) has that's useful: It will put an insomniac to sleep in ten minutes.On the other hand, the BBC version is exciting, taut, suspenseful, and the casting is superb, with Bill Nigh in the original role of newspaper editor (given to Helen Mirren in the American version. For once, she is not perfect).Trust me and spend the extra few bucks to buy the BBC version on Amazon.com."},{"rating":"1","title":"wake me up when the movie is over","review":"I just watched the movie and 30 minutes into the movie I wanted to turn it of to stop my self from falling asleep.

On the Blu-ray disc, the dark recesses of DC and the dark nature of politics appeared as they should- dark and creepy. Good transfer. Great sound.

My simple conclusion - IT IS AWFUL. Beside the first two scenes and the names of the characters, little else is in common between the two versions. In the UK series, you have a professional newspaper team piecing together an set of seemingly unrelated events. In the US version, you have Russel Crowe as a 60s hippie quipping his way through two hours of nonsensical quips. Instead of a professional editor providing guidance, you have Helen Mirren's embarrassing role as a 'Katharine Graham' clone. Even though the movie is 1/3 as long there is 5 times as many shhot-em-up scenes.

It picks up speed and then several times slows down to the point where you want to fast forward all the unnecessary chatter. And there is too much of this chatter. With better direction and editing the movie could be half an hour shorter and double as interesting. Fine acting from all the actors cannot dispel the fog of poor editing and the rambling direction.

I also intend to use it on hard packed dirt bike trails with my kids as they get older. After riding this bike for some time and then comparing it to a traditional chain drive bike with multiple gears it has become obvious that you have to work much harder on this bike to get the same speed. I had a 60+ year old pass me once!

There is a 'warm-up' time with these bulbs of a 20-40 seconds, but the light they give off is comparable to that of your standard light bulb in both color and brightness.

There was nothing on the product page or description that said it would not work with dimmable fixtures. When I received the package, I read the fine print (not readable on amazon.com) and saw that I could not use these with dimmable fixtures.Otherwise, the product is great. And these bulbs are brighter than you might expect for 60 watts. I recommend them, just don't expect to use them in a dimmable fixture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy with Amazon, not with GE","review":"I purchased these over a year ago; received and initially worked as advertised. Since then one or two have prematurely failed so I called in to GE as they invite you to do for replacements.

In general the life on these is better than I have experienced elsewhere but even many of the no name bulbs honor their warranties with better service."},{"rating":"1","title":"The reality","review":"I'm giving up on these things...As many others have noted, they only last a couple of years, not 5 years as stated. The problem is you can't turn these things on and off like you do a normal bulb. So if you put them in a bathroom for example where you do this several times though out the day, it shortens the life.Also, if the bulbs put out a very yellow light and are not the same as a \\"60 watt\\" bulb. You can confirm this with any camera light meter. The \\"Daylight\\" bulb that is rated at 6500K is a nice white bulb, brightness is improved a bit as well... but they cost more.If you have a location where you need to walk in at 9AM, turn the lights on, then turn them off at 9PM, and don't care about how yellow things look, then these may be just the ticket. But the reality is for home use, most bulbs are turned on and off several times a day and these bulbs can't handle it.

Also seem to be slightly dimmer than some others, though admittedly I've only tried one and it hasn't had a chance to break in yet.The upside: They're made by GE, so they should outlast most of the other bulbs on the market. And these are an awesome value, even when they're not on sale. The packaging has also been updated to be a bit more eco-friendly - not nearly as much plastic in the newer packaging.I have a few other GE CFLs that are 5+ years old and still work great, though they're only used a couple of hours a day.I'd give them 5 stars if they were truly instant on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Saving money in more ways than 1","review":"I used this pack to replace the light bulbs in my house.

In a high traffic area the bulb has done this about 4 times in a 3 month period after working solid for 3 months (6 months total). That bulb is still working, in fact all are, the outages have lasted anywhere from 3 minutes to 2 days. So if you are worried about them going out early, I don't think they do.

I discovered that it was only the GE brand bulbs that were burning out in less than 6 months. In fact, the last one I changed lasted 20 days (8 of which I was on vacation). It was in a two bulb fixture with a generic bulb that lasted for several years which proves that under the same conditions the GE bulb lasted 3 weeks and the generic lasted several years. On average I get one or two months from the GE CFLs. I have bought generic unlabeled bulbs that have lasted several years. The 5 year warranty requires you to pay more for shipping than it would cost to buy a new one. Talk about a company selling junk with a fake warranty.

I did notice a slight difference in the electric bill, but these bulbs certainly don't last any longer than the conventional bulbs. In fact, half of them have burned out in less than a year! They weren't on dimmer switches either, just regular light fixtures. I also don't like that they take so long to go to full brightness.

I found Brown's descriptions of the various personality traits to be right on target. He offers some different perspectives from the other books on the subject. And his charts are beautiful.

The positive features of this book don't stop there. The author is able to do something that so many other educators/writers fail to do. She is able to show what it is really like to be a teacher. She does this by hiding nothing. She lets out all of her successes, mistakes, frustrations, and joys. She is also honest about her colleagues and administrators. Most of all her excellence in the classroom will teach any educator good things to add to their classroom."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Great White Hope","review":"As a young(ish) white female teacher in an urban school district, I wanted to like this book. I bought it a few years ago and hurried home to read it. Try as I might, though, I just could not enjoy it. In fact, it is one of only three books I never finished. Imagine my surprise when it was offered as an option for literature circles in my most recent class (graduate level, no less!) Not only do I believe this book to be a work of fiction (or, perhaps like Law & Order, \\"based on actual events\\"), but am disgusted by the white-woman-saves-the-little-poor-minority-children feel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring, to say the least","review":"I am a first year teacher and have found more support and inspiration in this book than any so far. It is a wonderful account of what can be done and should be done. It is a source of strength and motivation for those who teach in a unconventional way.

I only hope I will be half the teacher she is! Read it for a laugh or a cry, you will get both."},{"rating":"1","title":"I guess there's a market for anything","review":"The fact that Esme has very creative ideas for the classroom is just great. However, the majority of pages in this book are devoted to her whining about the administrators, ranting about her colleagues and being alternately scared/disgusted/moved by her students. This is a journal by a young woman who, while very bright, seems to be incredibly vulgar and self-absorbed. She writes as if she is the only teacher on the face of the earth who ever had a creative thought. Since this is a journal and not a \\"how-to\\" book, it provides a glimpse into the thinking behind her actions. Not a pretty sight."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book- fun read","review":"I really liked this book- it is great for those considering going into the teaching profession, and also for those who are already teachers. It is funny and insightful. At times, there seems to be some exaggeration, but overall I thought this book was great. Also, it is a very quick read. I definitely reccomend this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"She said... Didn't hear from him","review":"I was assigned to read this book in an education class. It is an amusing read, but, like many others, I had some problems with it. The first is her smug, \\"I'm wonderful and right and everyone else is a moron\\" attitude. We've all known people like this, and their behaviors result in self-fullfilling prophecies because they just rub us the wrong way... over, and over, and over. What bothered me most, however, is that we only have HER account of what happened. I'd be really, REALLY interested in hearing Mr. Turner's (or any of the other teachers and administrators that the self-proclaimed \\"Madame Esme\\" unrelentingly disses) side of things. Like the country song states, \\"We all live in a two-story house.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Read","review":"This book is a great book for anyone looking at the teaching profession. I used it in an education introduction class and it is very insightful as well as just a great read. This is a real life personal experience in the first year of teaching for Esme, and shows the good and the bad of teaching as well as effective and ineffective teaching strategies. Great for education, thought, or just enjoyment!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Esme addressed emotions in learning, while hers were neglect","review":"Esme's effectiveness lay in her addressing the emotional and social aspects of learning and teaching, which are mostly neglected or ignored as unimportant in most classrooms. Seeing her students as whole people, this \\"Woman with Many Children\\" invested tremendous amounts of emotional energy into her students, and ended up sucessful but emotionally drained and burned out. Colleges of Education and their professors should address the issues of burn-out in teaching, and help students to learn how to deal with it, how to meet their emotional needs before it happens and give them tools to cope with entrenched bureaucrats. Support net works of newer teachers should be set up so that teaching and children don't lose more Madame Esmes. P.S. My child was fortunate enough to have Esme as a teacher. Madame Esme did have a lot of enthusiatic fans among parents."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring, heartfelt, real..a must read for any new teacher!","review":"As a new teacher I look to colleagues for words of wisdom and guidance...I have found that and so much more in this wonderful book! I have a new hero, Madame Esme. I only hope in my new career as a teacher I can impact the lives of my students as Madame Esme has done. She not only delivered to her students an education but also felt their pains and struggles. She showed them that in a world that sometimes can be unforgiving that someone believed in them, that someone cared and that someone was their teacher. A real teacher who was not afraid to use any creative approach to inspire her students. Way to go Madame Esme!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Spunky and irreverent","review":"As a rookie substitute teacher, I was interested in perspectives from \\"new\\" full-time teachers on what I was getting into. Oh my! Esme is a riot - not only are her ideas hyper-creative (and adaptable, even in more 'stodgy' institutions), her story-telling was easy to read and left you wanting a sequel with more tales of her experiences. Not sure I'd want her working FOR me, but what fun she'd be to work WITH! Great read for anyone interested in the politics and progress possible in teaching."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the best and most honest books I have ever read","review":"This is one of the most intensely personal books that I have ever read. Esme hides nothing and instead reveals herself to the audience. How many authors have the courage to do that? In addition, the book is filled with some of the funniest stories that I have ever read and there were many times that I found myself laughing out loud. At the same time, Esme paints a picture of a school system that is deteriorating more every day. Her ability to combine these two aspects into such a dynamic book that is both funny and extremely serious at the same time is a sign of her writing and storytelling genius. Everyone should read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smugness at it's best","review":"As a third year teacher, I am constantly on the look-out for teacher memoirs that can give me some sense of belonging. This book, however, is more of a list of things that \\"Madame Esme\\" did right in her first year of teaching. It's hollow, incredibly smug, and rings untrue for me. I can't believe that this woman actually DID teach for a whole year ... everything she tries as a teacher seems to have worked, and I believe if you were to ask her, nothing would have gone wrong. Hollow, useless ... although funny at times, I suspect that's more because she's a good writer rather than a good teacher.If you are a student teacher or a first year teacher thinking about buying this book, you're much better off reading bellhooks, who, though she is a college professor, knows more about pedagogy in her little finger than Esme Codell (or \\"Cordell\\" as her maligned principal refers to her) knows in her whole body.This is not the realistic world of teaching!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Same old story","review":"Esme is witty and seems to be an exceptionally creative teacher, but the story she tells here is one we've heard before: bright and heroic teacher takes on idiotic and inept system. There is NO ONE in this book who seems to have a lick of sense outside of Esme and a couple of her students. All of the other characters are complete buffoons. I've taught for 16 years in an urban school system, and while I've seen my share of incompetent parents and educators, I have no illusions (as Esme seems to) that I'm the only one out here trying to do the right thing. If you're looking for light reading, this book might satisfy, but if you want a realistic look inside a school classroom, this isn't it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Need to Look At the Big Picture","review":"I am also a Chicago Public School teacher as Esme, and found this book delightful. For those of you who did not like it I don't think she was speaking for you -- she was speaking for herself. To say teaching is not like that is awfully presumptuous in my opinion -- not everyones teaching experience is the same. There were plenty of things I could relate to and plenty I couldn't but the book was honest and heartfelt and gave me a great perspective on her first year of teaching -- not yours and not mine. Get a grip, if you want a book that mirrors your teaching experience -- write your own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anyone who recommends....","review":"Anyone who recommends reading The Hundred Dresses deserves an A+. When I heard what books Esme recommended reading to elementary school age students, I knew I had to read her book, and I was not at all disapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, please.","review":"I never once got the idea that: A. anyone's ideas other than her own (or her somewhat warped mentor's)were interesting or creative or true, or B. she even LIKED teaching these children. And while many of her lessons and techniques were good, they weren't original, and credit might have been given to the books, university programs or educators from whence they came. I found this woman among the most boorish in print. There is much to be said about enthusiasm and the willingness to go the extra mile for your students, but there is also something attractive about a little humility. Esme Codell--at least in this book-- has none."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tasteless","review":"If you REALLY want to read a book about an EXCELLENT teacher (who is refreshingly modest) read MARVA COLLINS' WAY. Marva teaches values that any parent would agree with (Marva would NEVER stoop to rewarding extortion OR offering to s--k a boy's d--k in the boy's restroom no matter WHAT the circumstances). I didn't like this book because it seems as though the author is trying to say that ANY method of teaching or relating to the student is OK as long as the student learns SOMETHING (Learn what?--is the question!). I simply don't agree. I believe teachers should be role-models with high standards and refined character. This just isn't it."},{"rating":"1","title":"*Educating Esme* is vulgar and dismal.","review":"For those who wonder why so many children emerge from the public schools brimming with self-love and eager to express their supposed creativity although they cannot distinguish between a noun and a verb, think the world began when they entered it, and have the morals of street curs, here is an answer. In at least one school, with at least one teacher, they've been swamped with foolishness and vulgarity unimaginable just twenty years ago. Although the episode between the two women teachers and the little boy in the boy's restroom is particularly illustrative, every page tells a story of how corrupt the government schools have become.Although the writer's goal is obviously to glorify herself, she unwittingly exposes the corruption of the system--a system of which she is an award-winning part. While the writer crows about exposing her body, she has unintentionally exposed *much* more than that."},{"rating":"1","title":"A review from a student teacher.","review":"I was told I had to read this book for an education class. Although I am an avid reader and usually enjoy reading, I did not like this book. In all of my training, I have been told to try to get along with my fellow teachers and my administration. I guess she did not learn this lesson."},{"rating":"1","title":"Parents Beware","review":"Parents Beware!!! This book is not for those under age 18. It contains vulgar language, profanity and sexual content.While some of Ms. Cordell's actions are commendable, the vulgar language in the book made it dificult for me to focus on any good. I disliked the book intensely."},{"rating":"2","title":"Real Talk","review":"She thought it, lived it and wasn't afraid to say it and share it! This book gave an honest perspective into the world of teaching, particulary in a high needs community. She said the things that most of us only think about but are afraid to stand up for or even express to others."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great book and an inspiration for any teacher!","review":"This is an awesome book. Anyone who is a teacher knows what it is like to battle with the administration, constantly. To be disrespected and feel hopeless. This is the opposite of that. Also, it is a wonderful portrait of what it is really like teaching in the public schools. I would venture to guess that those that did not like this book are either not teachers, or so stuck in old ideas that this book threatened them completely."},{"rating":"1","title":"A self-celebrating bit of hype","review":"I teach fifth graders. The job takes restraint, patience, constancy, dedication, knowledge of craft, intuition and, yes, creativity. But not the sort of self-celebrating creativity for which Esmé Codell so lavishly congratulates herself in this book.Organizing your classroom around the wonderfulness of the teacher is, at best, a selfish way to teach. At worst you risk some very dangerous boundary issues, drawing your students into your own vortex of ego.From a reader's standpoint, it's clear that, ahem, Madame Esmé has some gifts as a writer. But her fatal self-absorption, her boundless appetite for her own spunky wonderfulness, makes the overall experience nauseating.I'm appalled that this book is so popular. Someone give this woman a cookie and a mirror so she can go absorb herself indefinitely and not pollute teaching."},{"rating":"1","title":"Egotistical rubbish","review":"I also wanted to enjoy this book, but I found it so self-serving and insulting (being a teacher myself) that I actually threw it in the garbage so no one else had to be subjected to it. Read Up the Down Staircase instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Money","review":"I just didn't find this book \\"close to reality\\". It seems a bit too Mary Poppinsish. If you're looking for \\"real life\\", I suggest you go elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self-Absorbed....","review":"A quick read, less than 4 hours. Not much substance or recommendation. Just more a \\"story\\". If you are looking for advice or direction- this book will not help you clarify your goals."},{"rating":"1","title":"Coy, Over-Sweetened, and Self-Serving","review":"Codell's book has a lot of fictional anecdotes. She claims to have told off Principals and other administrators, which no teacher could ever do without getting in massive trouble. I think that what she's done is present an idealised version of the truth, and the truth is that her first year couln't have been as sucessfull as she claims it was.I agree that the Principal had few good qualities, but the book is damaged by her anger, which seeps through. She continues to rail at the Principal, long after she's made her point.On a last note, I don't sympathise with her complaint about the Principal \\"starring\\" at her body. Any teacher who wears a skin-tight leotard to school is probably suffering from dementia."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Read for Education Majors","review":"Being an education major myself, I enjoy learning of the challenges that may await me in the future. This book really portrays the glories and the hardships of the individuals in the education field. I would recommend this book for anyone but its almost a necessity for those who are interested in pursuing a career in the education field."},{"rating":"1","title":"Even Worse than Ally","review":"Codell is a naive, egotistical teacher who happens to be a good story teller. This a book I would only suggest to a reader who wanted a SIMPLE thing to read while drinking on a train. This story is an insult to all new and old educators. She is not at all critical of herself....Isn\`t it ironic that Esme no longer teachers full time? If I didn\`t hate teaching I, too, would have written a book and lived of the proceeds.

I am not \\"old-fashioned\\" because this is only my second year to teach. I saw very little that was redeeming in this book. This is a portrait of schools as dens of iniquity with teachers contributing to the delinquency of minors. If that's the \\"new\\" way to teach, leave me out! I was absolutely turned off by the whole book. This is NOT what it's like teaching in public schools and it is NOT representative of all teachers' feelings or views. I would hate to think that someone that is not a teacher would think that we all behave and/or think this way. We don't! I, personally, cannot figure out why the book was even written and published. This book gives teachers a bad name and I hope that readers will realize that we all aren't this way. Some of us DO have standards and morals.

After waiting 20 years for this concert to be released, Universal has given us an unwatchable Blu-Ray. The concert itself is amazing. The video and audio are, on their own, fantastic. But they're out of sync. It varies, and certain camera shots are OK. But much of the time, you hear a cymbal crash notably earlier than you see Dave hit it. Or you hear Kurt slide from one note to the next a moment before he actually does it. If you're paying any attention at all, it quickly becomes unwatchable.The DVD is apparently fine, and while the quality won't quite measure up to the Blu-Ray, having it in sync is more important than the uncompressed audio and higher resolution we could have on BD. I haven't picked it up yet, but that's the only option. Don't buy the Blu-Ray. Universal denies there is a problem and says it's the fault of our equipment, but nearly every review of the Blu-Ray is negative.

No, it's not due to camera shake, the flash was on so the shutter should be very fast. Please don't EVER spend money on this camera. It's so bad it hurts.

I predict that children raised under his edicts will grow up to rebel, big-time, against their autocratic parents. \\"Because I said so,\\" may sometimes indeed be the end of the discussion, but not before the child is told the reason for the parent's decision.

Mr. Rosemond also can see no reason why preschoolers should watch ANY television. American kids watch way too much TV, I agree, but NO television?

But as my chops grew over the years and I started to be pickier, I tried several handhelds before finally coming across this one. And WOW. All I can say is, in comparison to the SM58, it's like someone threw on the light switch while you never even knew you'd been in the dark.

I wasn't impressed much by the Hardanger fiddle music though, but I think that takes getting used to; it seems so discordant to me. However, it doesn't overwhelm the voices & in many pieces isn't even presented.

Muir wouldn't know passion or soul if it scooped her up at high tide. I was disappointed, because I am a fan of Hot Soup, and this kind of music in general. But the songs are banal and the performances are trendy.

Over the summer I did an exercise every day, and probably spared myself a year of Latin.The exercises are straightforward yet informative, and the examples of Roman literature are well chosen. Even in chapter one you are translating Cicero and learning about Roman culture.Do a chapter every few days, and before you know it you'll be able to read Latin. If you already know some Latin, this is a great refresher course."},{"rating":"2","title":"Latin for Beginners","review":"Wheelock's Latin is an excellent text for first year college students.

I don'thave a computer at the moment. An attempted downloadof the answer keys at the library proved futile.I have spent more time trying to resolve this problemthan it has been worth.

Recently I was using it on a door finishing project, heard a clunk, and after that the motor started to bog down. I took it back in to the workshop to check the problem out, only to see chunks of the motor brush contact pads drop out of the venting. I didn't have another and needed it to at least finish the job before it died, but when I fired it back up the RPMs were way down..then give off that familiar smell...then it began to smoke a bit, then it quit all together. I had to run to the hardware store to buy another just to finish the job.In my opinion a product like this isn't supposed to be like the tools that grandpa used and have a predictably short life. In this case, this tool didn't have enough hours on it to constitute tool puberty. It's not like I'm surprised, just disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maybe Days","review":"I work for and adoption agency with children in the foster care system and I LOVE this book.

We bought this book not long after they moved in with us. The oldest was 9 and the middle child was 5 at the time. They always had so many questions...and I had so few answers. This book was written for the kids. They were able to relate to it and to understand it. I always left the book out in the open and many times one or the other would ask to read it again. One of the best days for us was when we learned surrenders had been done and the adoption was underway. That night our middle daughter brought the book to me and said \\"Mom, now we have no more maybe days!\\". Maybe Days has been with us for almost 2 years and I am mailing it to our DCFS office so they can 'rehome' the book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Book!","review":"We loved this book!

Alternatively, Hizb'llah: Politics and Religion by Amal Saad-Ghorayeb explores the ideology of Hezbollah and the tension between its Shia theology and the practical demands of operating in the Lebanese political scene.

It does nothing but bash Israel for defending itself aganist a Fundamentalist band of murderers. Hezbollah is not fighting some oppresve regime but are simply terrorists who are looking to spread the word of Khomeini. Hezzbollah is willing to spread his techings through any means,even if that means sucide bombings. She sheds no light into the groups inner workings and very little into the groups history. The book is simply a mass of anti israel rehtoric."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst book i ever tried to read","review":"I just couldn't finish this book. It was way to biased. I even felt that the author was glorifying suicide bombers. This author was obviously sympathetic to hezbollah. The work reminded me of other works i read that were distributed by authoritarian regimes to instill government mandated values. On the plus side, you can read this book if you want to know how a terrorist perceives his duties and justifies his actions.

However, after a couple of songs I got the impression that Keren Ann tries to be all cute about her melancholy and how soft her voice is, and how she throws a sitar here and some other stuff there, but I didn't get a glimpse of truly good music. It's like she tries to sell herself or something, but it is not there. So, no mystery, no deep feelings, just another artsy-high maintenace singer chick that cannot give me what I want, and what I want is somethign exciting....peace Keren-Ann, see ya! try to watch some David Lynch movies to live up to your pose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth your time and money","review":"First of all I don't understand about what frenchness everybody is talking about? Keren Ann was born in Israel, grew up in Holland, and lived in France for a relatively short time. Her French and her English are on par i.e. both are weak. Her voice and singing abilities are however even worse. She tries to sound like Jane Birkin, and sounds like a parody on Paradis.

For a reader like me who depends upon the literature to help understand newer statistical approaches, a book like this is a breath of fresh air. The book presents very clearly how to set up a basic LGC model and includes other topics such as dealing with missing data, interaction effects and multilevel approaches to longitudinal data analysis. The appendix contains a number of example LGCM models in the software language of EQS, LISREL and AMOS. I most highly recommend this text for beginners and more advanced modelers alike!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I AGREE WITH THE PERSON BELOW","review":"This collection is a travesty indeed. Great poems no doubt, but abysmally read. Furthermore they should have put all the introductions together separate and apart from the poems. It's nice to hear intros the first time around. But who wants to hear the intros everytime you listen to the poems? Sometimes I want to hear just a stream of poetry without any interuptions and this format makes that impossible. It's incredible that such a great concept could be so terribly executed."},{"rating":"1","title":"good poetry, very poor readers","review":"The idea of this collection is fine, but a disastrous decision was made to have the poetry read by American poets. One of the readers, Anthony Hecht, does a good job, but most read no better than your next door neighbor, and some are dreadful, as for example, Jorie Graham. My advice is : save your money for audio poetry read by actors -- there are wonderful collections read by Richard Burton, Christopher Plummer, Alexander Scourby, et al. The Penguin English Poetry collection is also well read. Another problem with this collection is that there is more introductory material read on the tape than actual poetry. This material may be helpful the first time you listen, but will become increasingly annoying as you re-listen."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Hundred Poems Murdered","review":"What could be an acceptable reading of standards is degraded by sophomoric introductions.Don't buy this, unless for skeet shooting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Readers are AWful not AWEful","review":"Every review here is correct.

We can play it as a family, and my daughter loves losing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful & Easy to Learn","review":"This game is wonderful. My children love this game and it is great for children of different ages to play. The rules are very basic, take turns, don't tip the cactus, that's it. My children have challanged each other to get the entire cactus put together without toppling it or putting the the smaller pieces in before the larger ones which makes balancing very difficult. Highly recommend. The smallest pieces would be choking hazards so not for children who still put toys in their mouth. My nine year old still plays this game, I even enjoy this game. This is also a game that is quickly played!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring............","review":"I loved the concept and bright colors of this toy. I thought it would be educational. My 4 year old played it twice, told me how it works and wandered off in pursuit of more interesting toys."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not such a great game, but a beautiful toy!","review":"My 3 year old got this for Christmas, and the balancing game aspect of it isn't so great. It balances almost too well, and then she didn't really get the concept of trying to keep it balanced...however that's part of the educational aspect of it! Based on how little she has wanted to play with it, I rated it what I did, but I have fun designing with it when she walks away, and it really is a beautiful toy like almost everything Plan Toys makes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very cool concept, but needs more pieces","review":"Both my 2 and 5 year old have enjoyed playing with the Balancing Cactus (I love all of Plan Toys' products--great design paired with eco-mindedness). It's simple, very fast, and easy to clean up, so it's a perfect game for young attentions spans. However, it needs more pieces in order to present an actual balancing challenge to most players--much of the time, my kids have added all the cactus \\"lobes\\" and it still hasn't tipped over. If Plan Toys would add about 10 more lobes to the game, it'd be perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun on so many levels","review":"I bought this for my nephew's 6th birthday based on other Amazon reviews of the product. It could be because he received many other gifts, but initially he did not seem interested in playing the balancing game. My 2 year old niece, however, loved this toy!

The plot was so complicated I doubt whether even Agatha Christie herself could've solved it and I'm completely amazed at the good reviews this book got. There are a lot of problems with the consistency and flow of the writing - a previous reviewer has already mentioned the overwhelming plethora of characters who are introduced in the first 20 pages or so..by my count, almost 20 characters have been named before the second chapter begins. Another for instanceis, AFTER her husband has been in a rehab center for nearly three months with no problems AT ALL, suddenly the main character starts asking around as to whether there are any known problems at the rehab center. HELLO! Any real problems and/or suspicious behaviour would've shown up before three months have gone by. Just a real disappointing read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Satisfying","review":"This is the first China Bayles novel I have ever read and will be reading more.

The book was easy to read and the authors make the concepts as easy as possible to follow.For the entry-level admin you get a good understanding of the platform and lots of ideas and gotchas to watch out for before sinking money into your final solution.For the senior-level admin you get specific configuration requirements and best practices to follow (or confirm that you're on the right track).Excellent book (could use a little more editing, but I was more interested in the content)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Obsolete","review":"The book is a very good resource for obsolete versions of ESX Server.

Orchestra, conductor and other soloistsare perfectly adequate -- I doubt Hija will ever have as beautifula voice as Madre but at least it is firm --also it is obviouslysmaller than Madre's.

Even though you get lots of songs and original jams, most of the video footage looks atrocious, both quality-wise and the handling of the camera. The sound is not great either and Labrie sings very poorly, but at least you do hear Myung on this one. The presentation, menus and extras are all very nice, but the main feature keeps this package down. I really don't see the point of releasing such a DVD.Also, I thought that the old idea of putting little pointless interviews between songs was over. It's truly annoying when you're trying to get into the music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chaos Rocks","review":"This is a great doccumentary of the tour. Seeing different segments in different venues is a cool idea. I was especially pleased to see two tracks from the Toronto show, which was the one I attended, and the footage from the Orpheum Theater in Vancouver is awesome. The concert itself had a harder and darker quality than some previous tours, and I think that Mike Portnoy captured much of that well with the raw footage. If I had to make one minor complaint: It would have been even more satisfying if one complete show from one of the 5-6 venues selected were included in the extras. As stated above: this is essential for any fan.It is every bit as enjoyable as the other more refined production dvds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge Disappointment","review":"I will make this review short and sweet. I am a huge Dream Theater fan and I purchase everything that they do. Dream Theater moved into my number two ranking of all time favorite bands behind only Camel. But with the release of Systematic Chaos and Black Clouds and Silver Linings and Chaos in Motion I must say that Dream Theater is no longer my #2 band. I have only watched this DVD one time. The second time I tried to watch it I could not watch more than 10 minutes. Dream Theater must become more creative or they are going to lose alot of their fan base. And oh yes Mike Portnoy I love you man but whats up with all the swearing on this video?!!! Clean up your act Mike!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Really not THAT bad","review":"I have seen pieces of the last two DVD's although I do not own them yet. I believe Budokan and Score are probably superior in terms of overall presentation and content. However, I think the extras disc on this one is fantastic. I love when a band takes me through an entire day up to showtime, (reminding us all that they have a pretty amazing job but it's still a JOB, with its own level of discipline and responsibility) and the Make-a-Wish segment was killer. Portnoy clearly was having a blast jamming with this kid and you can see the joy on this kid's face, actually playing Mike's kit alongside his idol.This wets my appetite for more, so I'm gonna do the right thing and grab Budokan now. Cheers!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Another DVD?","review":"Is this really necessary? I love Live at Budokan. That is an awesome DVD. When I heard Dream Theater were releasing Score I was turned off to hear of another DVD being released so soon. That one also turned out to be awesome. Then DT released Systematic Chaos with the bonus DVD. At this point I had my fill. Now another one (Chaos in Motion)! C'mon. This is a bit too much. Releasing new music every couple of years is fine but you do not have to release so many DVDs in such a short time period. Hold off on another DVD for a while."},{"rating":"1","title":"Video Quality is Horrible","review":"The live portion looks as if someone shot this with a camcorder from 1985. Compared to the Score and Budokan DVD's this is a bootleg. I have the Dark Side of the Moon and and Live in Bucharest bootleg DVD's and the video quality is similar. The audio on the DVD is good, which is why I can't understand why the video quality is so bad.Buy this for the bonus stuff (videos of the singles off of Systematic Chaos) and the behind the scenes documentary. Not for the live section."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"I bought this book after reading \\"Patty Jane's House of Curl\\" and it just did not work for me. There is not a truly likable character in this book. Everyone is screwing around with people for no good reason I can see or else is completely self-centered. I had a hard time believing that the one affair could ever happen, I mean after all, if you're going to screw up a long term, happy marriage shouldn't you at least be ATTRACTED to the person you have the affair with? also I did not care for the variety of narrators. This book in no way is on a par with \\"house of curl\\". While it is written well, The story never seems to tie together. 264 pages into the book and I'm still wondering \\"what is this book about?\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Witty, humerous and serious","review":"Lorna Landvik has created a wonderful novel full of incredible characters, each unique and touching in their own way. From the tomboy to the anorexic, from the pudgy housewife to the car salesman, Landvik does an excellent job of slipping many small pieces of society into her work, each with its own cliches.I thought her technique in allowning nearly all the characters to narrate was a wonderful idea, and really allowed the reader to get into the book, the minds of the characters and the author.If you love a book that'll make you laugh and cry, than Your Oasis is on Flame Lake."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you liked Patty Jane's House of Curl, you'll love this!","review":"I read Patty Jane's House of Curl about a year ago, then pick up Your Oasis on Flame Lake. Landvik has a different character speaking in each chapter. It is very interesting, because as the story progresses, you are hearing it from a different point of view. Landvik did a great job capturing the characters personalities. I loved it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Refreshing read!","review":"You can find a little of yourself in each of the characters in this book. The book written from the perspective of several characters, is refreshing."},{"rating":"2","title":"An interesting, and realistic view of life in a small town","review":"Ms.Landvik confused the heck out of me at first, as I'd don't remember reading a novel, where the story is narrated by so many characters. However, once I got into the story, I was looking forward, eagerly, to see how Sergio felt, or Franny was coping as the story progresses. My favorite character is Franny, who does not do any of the narrating! This story may not have a \\"fairy-tale-ending\\" for everyone, but what is does have is a typical, brilliantly written, slice of Americana going into the new year 2000. I found this book hard to put down. It's full of sadness, laughter, and life in general."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another funny one from the author of Patty Jane's House of C","review":"If you liked Sandra Dallas' books (Persian Pickle Club and Buster Midnight's Cafe) you are likely to enjoy Landvik's as well. Your Oasis on Flame Lake is a neighborhood gathering spot operated by the husband of one of the two gal pals that the story circles about. Divorce, drunkenness, adultery, hockey playing daughters, thugs, and auto accidents are all treated by Landvik's quirky and insightful pen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Warm, funny with great characters","review":"I gave this a 9 only because Patty Jane's House of Curl was such a superlative 10 and hard to beat. BiDi and Devera are such delightful sparring partners and close friends. Unlike so many novels of women friends, this one explores the depth of the male characters and their feelings, the children and their lives without letting the women either become an afterthought or the only focus of the story. Like life, the meaning behind events have many facets and many impacts on all involved. Landvik captures this with humor, rapier-sharp wit, and yet a seriousness that doesn't overwhelm but keeps the story real. Whatever she writes, I will read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Choppy narrative, too predictable","review":"After reading Patty Jane's House of Curl which was an excellent book, this follow-up effort seems just that - a follow-up. The narrative changes point of view from chapter to chapter, and all the characters seem one dimensional (eg.,BiDi is vain, Sergio is sweet, Franny is tough etc). Unlike Patty Jane, I could easily see where each plot line was headed. Hope the next book is more like the the House of Curl."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Your Oasis On Flame Lake\\" wasn't an oasis!","review":"I had to read this book as an assignment for a class. I picked this book because I thought it would be interesting and I liked the reviews it got. Unfortunately, I was wrong. Overall, I thought the book was boring and lacked reader involvement. I couldn't get very interested in the book mainly because four of the main characters are in their 40's. I really don't have much in common with them. I also sometimes got confused with all the characters. With five people telling the story it got a little confusing. By the time it got the climax I was disinterested already and the climax didn't do anything for me. I really didn't like the fact that two of the main characters cheated on their spouse. Also, the ending bothered me. One kid died, another might be paralyzed, but everything is all good with the main characters so it seems like everything in the world is okay."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Item!","review":"Received item quickly, excellent quality, durable and holds several items under the phone.

The paper tray holds 250 sheets and the unit has a 3 year warranty. This unit is a die hard consistent Copier/printer. It's just a work horse. The cover even lifts up when you have to put books on it. Even though it says copies are only 6 pages a minute, the consistency at which they came out seemed more like 8 or so. It does print at 8 pages per minute, but only copies at 6. To get a laser printer/copier for $349 is a great deal no matter how you look at it. Besides, its a Xerox.

Do not believe the picture that shows the outside screen encased in plastic, there is a HUGE HOLE AROUND THE SCREEN! Naturally, the only reason you would need a case at all for an aluminum phone is to protect the screen, and it doesn't even do that! so what is the point!?? Duh, aluminum is stronger than plastic so why are all these crazy people buying these and giving them great reviews just because it protects the aluminum part?? These cases don't protect the screen or camera lens whatsoever, which are the only friggin things that needs protecting!? bah I hate people.

This music, serene, whale-song-like yet searching, is the emboodiment of a desire to interweave attenuated pitches into a meditative whole. Dempster's trombone, as odd as it might seem at first, makes an outstanding contribution to the agenda.

Originally titled \\"Thursday the 12th\\" (changed before it's release for fear of confusion with other spoof \\"Saturday the 14th\\"), Pandemonium tells the story of Candy, a girl who couldn't be a cheerleader in high school, so she opens a cheerleader camp 20 years later. The only problem, the camp and all of it's inhabitants have been mysteriously killed year after year. But this year might be different, especially when the characters are named Andy, Mandy, Sandy, Randy, Candy, and Glen...Glen Dandy! And with the help of Sgt.

I would have been happy had the glasses produced a larger type image then just watching the ipod alone, but thats not the case. The picture was grainy and small. The earbuds that it comes with are really cheap. I will confess that maybe thats because I own Shure e4c's which are incredible though high priced. After my trial run in the store, I would tell anyone considering buying one to go to a sharper image and test this product first.

The book is more aimed in some ways at quirky questions, so if you want to know about the Talmud then it won't help you with that but if you want to know why Israeli Jews eat donuts on Chanukah then this is the book for you.It's a good little read and you will learn plenty of stuff, and a lot of it is quite surprising."},{"rating":"2","title":"Informative","review":"It was incredibly informative and I learned alot.

The first Dangerous Hunts game was a blast to play. It was just like real hunting, with the added thrill of having to deal with wild animals that attack.But this game is horrendous. It is an adventure style game where you follow around an amazingly annoying one eyed man who tells you what to do and doesnt bother to help you at all. Moreover, his vocabulary is limited to two or three dumb remarks.You cannot hunt in the traditional sense.

It's always been quite an amusement for me to see books claiming to be a History of Art book and only include the WESTERN History of Art. It seems these historians have forgotten just how influential EASTERN art has been in forming these WESTERN artists. The Jansons book is no exception.

It covers all the great eras and great works with beautiful plates, and the accompanying text is detailed enough to satisfy the most curious reader. It is particularly valuable for its sections on sculpture.However, if you are looking for an in depth analysis of an artist or style, this is not the book for you. This is not to say that it skips over the subject matter - this is definitely not the case, but there is not the detail needed for in depth scholarly analysis.But as a general reference book on a complex and fascinating topic, it is a gem.

Some of his numerous works are in various museums across the USA. His prints are in demand and being sold in every place from fine art galleries to stores at local malls. His contribution to the art work has been priceless. \\"History of Art\\" is an absolutely fabulous book/study guide.

Even put into \\"Soldier\\" or \\"normal\\" terms. A little dry but this type of material always is. But the simplicity of his terminology and explanation makes it much easier to read than sitting through an equally presented lecture. Its also not overly indepth. Some authors tend to explain too much and lose the reader. I find that he does no. He gives examples, makes it quick, simple, and gets right to the point. Its also nice how he give first hand anonymous accounts of situations that have occured, to help explain what he's talking about."},{"rating":"1","title":"A painful and awkward book","review":"It is a real grind to read this book.

The acting is weak and it all feels amateurish. However if you make it to the end the overall story is kind of nice. I don't regret seeing it. So I kindly give it two stars.I feel that with better directing the story could have been much more exciting where as it is now it is not gripping at all. The \\"bad guys\\" are played by some very mild manner charterers who come off so no threatening its ridiculous. The music itself is not bad it is just not fitting. Instead of the music being written for each scene a snippet of an existing known score is inserted. So the movie has no overall musical theme. Just giving this movie its own musical score would drastically change the atmosphere and carry it through.If you're looking for a different kind of western with a strong moral message then I recommendThe Big Country [Blu-ray]"},{"rating":"1","title":"dry, slow and boring","review":"I purchased this DVD to have a movie night with some friends. I am so glad I watched the movie before inviting anyone over to see it. I try to find good Christian films with a message. If there was a message in this one I guess I missed it. I was very disappointed in it. This is one of those movies that start out slow and you assume will pick up the pace anytime now- but never does. Even in the fight scenes it was as if the actors were moving in slow motion. I honestly couldn't wait until it was over.

Rent this movie before you consider buying. I was so bored I cannot even tell you the story line, we turned the movie off and through the dvd into the trash. The people that made this movie should pay us to watch it. The really sad part of all is yet another Christian based movie - left to look less than 5th rate.

The cast cannot overcome the unimaginative, unrealistic plot. It is a standard issue 1950's style movie, with a leaden dialogue and a better cast than it deserves.

I say that because I really liked nearly every cut, where on all past recordings I really enjoyed only half at best.He never sounds tired, even at his age, on any cut. Accompanyments are, for the most part, very good. I especially liked Before the Night is Over, That Kind of Fool, Couple More Years, Lost Highway, and The Pilgrim.But, I couldn't give it that fifth star for more than one reason. I've never cared for Lewis' short, verbal \\"end\\" lines to many of his past songs, and they are abundant throughout this CD. Rod Stewart sounds simply awful. And, it was hard for me to visualize Jerry Lee, at his current age, trying to win over a crowd singing Sweet Little Sixteen and/or I Saw Her Standing There.All in all, though, if you like Jerry Lee Lewis, you should love this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Rock and Roll Street Brawl","review":"Make no mistake. The star of this CD is the piano playing of Jerry Lee Lewis. The boozy duets with George Jones, Merle Haggard, Ringo Starr and Keith Richards are as comfortable as your favorite slippers. But the true highlight of this CD is the street brawl between Jerry Lee's piano and the guitar of Jimmy Page, on \\"Rock and Roll\\". The track opens with a typical Page high octane riff, followed by the Killer saying, \\"This IS rock and roll!\\" You sense a battle brewing: the kid gunslinger (OK, middle-aged gunslinger), looking for the legend. And the legend doesn't back down. The battle for supremacy between the piano and the guitar rages at a furious pace, reminiscent of a John Wayne-Richard Widmark fist fight, rolling in a dusty street, both relishing the battle. One gets the sense that Lewis and Page call it a draw at the end, put their arms around each other, and walk back into the bar. This IS a new classic of rock and roll."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jerry Lee Lewis","review":"I think it's wonderful. I've never written a review before, but this CD is really great.

Missing were, Pink Cadilac with the Boss, Rock n Roll with Jimmy Page, Rod Stewart and many others. I cannot understand how the DVD and CD have the same name??? Very disappointed"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jerry Lee Doin' His Very Best","review":"This is a fantastic dvd. Jerry Lee is better than ever and he has brought along several friends. Tom Jones on End of the Road is quite a treat. Mr. Jones clearly has stock in whatever company markets Botox. Also, Kris Kristofferson is great on \\"Once More With Feeling\\". Doin' his very best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jerry Lee Lewis sure can play...","review":"I haven't really listed all that much to Jerry Lee Lewis but when I saw this record in the store and saw the burning piano I just had to look at the tunes.To my surprise I found most of my favourite artists on the back. Love \\"Travelin' Band\\" with Fogerty, I almost dare to say it's better then Fogertys own... ALMOST.I love the fact that he mixes \\"new\\" artists like Kid Rock on the album, and he does \\"Honky Tonk Woman\\" right, Kid Rocks voice is right up there. I can't forget the good ol' artists like B.B King, Jagger, Richards, Young, Starr, Springsteen and Guy just to mension a few... Good mix between country, rock and blues and you have to remember that Jerry Lee Lewis is getting old... BUT you can't tell from his piano playing!I've had this record in my mp3 player now for a while and I always end up listening to it, it's that good! Get the record and play it loud...!"},{"rating":"2","title":"THE KILLER STILL ROCKS","review":"Man, this CD had me in the middle of my living room shadow dancing the jitterbug and playing the air piano.

It is quite a tribute to JLL that so many top stars want to perform with him. Even at 71 years old, he still has that spark even if his body can no longer keep up. I wish that all the duets from the CD had been on the DVD. If you get the DVD, get the CD also."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"This is a wonderful DVD. Jerry's piano playing is great, the song selections are diverse, from rock to blues to gospel. His and Kid Rock's rendition of Honky Tonk Woman is memorable. I have just one complaint. The echo is up way high on his microphone. It doesn't matter on most of the songs but on his duets with Kris Kristopherson and Merle Haggard you can hardly hear them above Jerry. However, if you go to the Bonus Features and catch his echoless microphone you will hear a great, great rendition of Goodnight Irene with Merle. Buy this DVD. You will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"All Killer","review":"I had the pleasure of seeing Jerry Lee Lewis live this year at the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival. Looking aged and not moving too well he was escorted to his piano. Then something great happened: as soon as he started to play the years melted away and he was the famed Killer once again.Last Man Standing tries to show this side of Jerry Lee through a sort of tribute concert/studio recording session for his most recent Duets album.The concert portion filmed in LA on September 29, 2006 has Mr.Lewis rocking with a group of admirers who all seemed awed to be in his presence. There are legendary performances from Tom Jones, Soloman Burke, Norah Jones and others. The band cooks but is a little guitar heavy at times with Ronnie Wood taking his Stone on Loan persona on the road.The studio portion of the disc features performances by John Fogerty, Kris Kristofferson, and Merle Haggard.This is a disc to see if you are a fan of legendary rock and roll."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Killer kills","review":"I loved this DVD.If you're a Jerry Lee Lewis fan I'm pretty sure you will also.There's country, blues, rock and roll, all in the unique Jerry Lee style.We all know Jerry Lee is a little crazy however when it comes to music he's one of a kind and a member of the great pioneers of Rock and Roll.I can't get enough of that music and I will be watching this DVD many many times over."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Killer has done it again","review":"Half a century later and Jerry Lee can hammer the keyboards like there is no tomorrow.

All killer and no filler. What special guests ? , there just sidemen. Great to hear Jerry rock again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Return of a Dinosaur","review":"The Killer is back. Not neccessarily in prime condition, but the entire album is one big excersize in showing them kids who's the King of Rock'n'Roll (after all, Elvis has been dead for ages now!). Jerry Lee rocks with a little help from his friends, and what a joy it is to listen to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dvd last man standinh","review":"Unfortunately, you sent me this DVD with a wrong Region code, 1USA instead of 2 Europe!So it's impossible for me to use it on my Sony Blue Ray player."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great compilation.","review":"This is really a cool pairing of legendary musicians. The recording is superb and the playing is what is to be expected of those who appear on the CD. Great to hear the \\"Killer\\" again. He seems inspired by this project."},{"rating":"2","title":"now that's rocknroll","review":"Except for the following duets: Rod Stewart, Willie Nelson, and George Jones (they all suck bad) this is a righteous roll of the dice into rocknroll heaven...The song by Robbie Robertson is a bit of stretch and the song with Toby Keith is only good for a shot at country radio top 40 which I suppose since I dont listen to it never made it...also I wish Van Morrison did the vocal on Irish Heartbeat instead of that Eagles guy.,...saying all that...the rest blows your jock off...the Killer in rock's finest regalia...never woulda guessed it was possible...raised from the dead of hell fire, redemption steeped in that steaming boogie woogie...you gotta hear this...make you wanta stand up and shake yer money maker...sh.t this dude is 71...try and top that..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Way too much Jerry Lee","review":"I have loved Jerry Lee Lewis since the 50s, and have seen him perform live several times. I was eager to hear his latest because of the great reviews it was getting, not only from publications like Rolling Stone, but from The New Yorker as well. Too, I was impressed by the line-up of musicians involved in this duet album. However, in many cases, it's difficult to hear the other musicians, because Jerry Lee is always up front (Trading lines with Rod Stewart on \\"What made Milwaukee Famous\\" is an exception.). As well, does he have to reference himself in every single number? On other, older albums in my collection, he maybe did this once or twice at the most; hearing Ol' Jerry Lee do this on all 21 numbers gets old after a while. We KNOW who's singing the song, Jerry--you don't have to keep reminding us!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Last Dance for a great rock piano player","review":"Jerry lee Lewis... you can imagine the hyjinks.Well at hitting on 80 years he ain't got the foot on the piano,but he still playes strongly, and his voice is in good form.Classic rock n roll, with a bunch of his fansjoining him for a cut or two each.These fans are mostly household names in the music world,and clearly are happy to be on this.It was originally intended as a solo album, but as time went on,it became a series of duets with other greats joining Jerry Lee in HIS World.and pulling it off well. Put this on at a Thanksgiving party andit just got replayed and never taken off all night.A year back I opened up for Jerry Lee with a band at a festival,I am glad we didn't have to follow him.I was much looking forward to getting this album.And wasn't disapointed.There is also some fine instrumental work including somefine pedal steel players and bluesy guitarists.But centered around Jerry Lee's rolling piano."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wonderful songs ruined by duets....","review":"The Killer is in good form here. His aged voice lends a sandpaper like quality to these songs. I love the killer and he's in fine form on this album. I think it is a bad record though. Why? The duets ruin in for me. They are all terrible and the album would have been much better with Jerry Lee singing alone. The only one that really works is \\"Twilight\\" with Robbie Robertson because he just puts in backround singing and guitar. Shows what this album could have been. I love Jerry Lee, but I would not get this one if I was you. Perhaps download \\"Twilight,\\" but that's it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Last Man Standing","review":"It shows that Jerry Lee has still got it. You can tell that he is sort of frail in health but the man can still sing & play as good as ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super Music Makers","review":"This Music DVD is awesome. I have purchased two extra ones just in case the first one gets scratched. There is such a great variety of singers that join Jerry. They each have a special story or song that relates to him and his music. They are all super musicians, singers, and/or song writers. There is so much energy....you can't sit still. In my opinion you cannot go wrong with the \\"Last Man Standing Live\\" DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"old music","review":"nice to hear jerry lee record with other artists, you must be a jerry lee fan to enjoy this we sure do"},{"rating":"2","title":"Phenomenal","review":"Amazing to hear Jerry rock with Kid Rock, John Fogherty, Jimmy page, and the amazing Buddy Guy!!!

Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Woolie for starters / amateurs only","review":"If you use this thing for your home project only, that's fine. I'm a commercial artist and need something to withstand lots of abuse every day. The plastic handle will eventually break and the glue, which holds the wool pad on the handle, is cheap crap & will separate from the handle within the first few times of use. Can be re glued (gorilla glue or 2 part epoxy works great). Huge plus for this one sold here, it's very light !!

Don't expect to see any battle footage, it mostly covers logistics of how the United States was able to setup bases, etc. Which may sound somewhat interesting, but if your looking for events, battles, etc. do not purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Madacy is milking the Vietnam war footage.","review":"A better set is \\"Vietnam War with Walter Cronkite\\".It is 12 hours long.

Do not buy this!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"ATROCIOUS!!! do NOT buy!","review":"Worst $50 i ever spent! do NOT buy this item!The dress is NOT a pretty yellow as shown, instead it is an ugly, almost neon. The hoop does not form a circle so the entire dress ends up crooked. the white part of the dress is much smaller than shown and longer than the yellow part of the dress. the arms are way too small, i could barely get the dress on and i'm petite! the \\"waist\\" of the dress was right under my bust line and i'm only 5' tall -so if it fit that badly on me, i don't know how it was supposed to fit a woman of average size and height!Also, a $50 costume should not have a Velcro closure like this one! I am normally about a size 6 and it would not even fully close on me!Learn from my mistake and save your money!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A well-crafted excursion into ambience","review":"I listened to the sound samples and was very intrigued by this CD which clocks in around 46 minutes. I was initially disappointed because the end pieces (Prelude, Postlude) amount to 16 minutes of ambience leaving 30 minutes for Alcatraz itself. After several listens though, the two bookends do hold the piece together well. I wish there was more exploration to Alcatraz in the music, longer tunes, more sounds..etc. It did leave me with a feeling that I had been to Alcatraz and in the boat to and fro. A good sonic experience with enjoyable ambient bookends neatly forming a good 4-star album of music."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was disappointed","review":"I got this cd because I liked the song \\"I'm Diggin' it\\" and it was a fun song. When I got the cd it was mostly sad slow songs. Only 2 fast songs, and those are the ones I like. Her newest release it \\"You wanna what?\\" and I liked that song and 'I'm diggin it'. She dosen't have that great of voice either."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great album!","review":"I keep this CD in my car so I can look forward to getting behind the wheel.

(iknowthat'strite)","review":"I bought this CD months ago, and at the time I wasn't sure if it was even a CD that I really wanted to own. \\"Some People Fly...\\" totally convinced me to buy it because I loved it so much. Since I usually listen to Britney Spears, M2M, Dave Mathew's Band,the Beatles, Aretha Franklin, Jessica Simpson, Hoku, Mandy Moore, Backstreet Boys, and BBMak, I have sort of eclectic music tastes. However, I had never tried this kind of music. Alecia Elliot's CD \\"I'm Diggin' It\\" soon became my favorite, and has been played over and over to the point where my sister screeches \\"turn it off, turn it off!\\" whenever she hears it. I have yet to get tired of the CD, though I must say that I think that it could be improved with a greater number of fast(er) songs vs. all of the slow ones, like #s 3,5,7, and 8. This is a wonderful CD! I really think that a lot of different people would love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I aint diggin it","review":"When I first heard I'm diggin it on CMT, I could've sworn it was another Britney Spears. How can this even be classified as country? She sounds like a teeny bopper! There's no doubt she has a great voice, but she needs to actually sing great songs. If you're a fan of Britney Spears or Shania Twain, buy this. But if you're like me, and want real country, by Lee Ann Womack, Sara Evans, or Patty Loveless."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Cd Is Awsome!","review":"I Love every song on this cd! It is Awsome!

The album definitely has a country sound to it, though. My favorites are Ain't No Ordinary Love, and I'm Diggin' It. The rest of the cd is good, too. It's the kind of album that is very enjoyable. I'd recommend this album because it's fun to listen to!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Gee, ANOTHER teeny bopper","review":"I bought this cd because I enjoyed the uplifting song \\"I'm Diggin'It\\".

And in case you haven't already heard, the author is a fervent supporter of the terrorist group, the IRA, responsible for killing thousands - including hundreds of civilians in random bombings in bars and department stores.

But by stating that 85% of mosques have leadership that support extremism is patently ridiculous. How the heck does he know? Did he visit every mosque to find out? Of course not, he's using this statistic that he grabbed out of his you-know-what to dishonestly market and hype his book. He's hoping that by picking on a minority group in the US that has no political/economic means to fight back that he can then make a quick buck. It's disgusting and it should disgust every American that an elected government official would attempt to promote his book by fomenting fear and loathing of American Muslims.

As a house representative, Peter King should be ashamed of how low he has sank in an attempt to get ratings for his book. His actions epitomizes those who have no honor and dignity and would sink as low as possible to attain publicity. I can only begin to imagine how much hate and racism is kindling in his heart. It takes an enormous amount of \\"EVIL\\" in someone's heart to write such a book, and I would strongly request all my fellow American to not waste a dime on this book. His views and attempts to create a division amongst American citizen's is vile and very dangerous, and I urge my fellow Americans to vote against him in future elections, for someone who can bring America together as oppose to divide them."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book on Islamic Terror in America.","review":"This is a great book about Islamic Terrorists living in America and operating out of mosques. Peter King is a great American congressman, who has long supported Irish-America and the Irish Catholics of Northern Ireland (including the great men of Sinn Fein). King is also a seasoned expert on counter-terrorisim, and this book is a must read about how terrorists are infiltrating America through the guise of religion. It also gives great advice on how to deal with these terrorist subversives."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read","review":"Congressman Peter King's third book Vale of Tears tells a tale of future terrorist attacks on Long Island and Brooklyn and one local Congressman's attempt to thwart another attack on the docks of New York City. The novel also flashes back to September 11th and gives the reader an insider's look at the tragic events and America's recovery over the course of the following year through the eyes of a United States Congressman. From the sorrowful funerals to the closed-door congressional meetings with President Bush, Congressman King offers behind the scenes access to what transpired on and after that horrible day. The fictional portion of his novel (odd #'d chapters) is thrilling as well as a scary reminder of how susceptible America is to another attack. I definitely recommend this book!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A powerful book, required to read","review":"The only problem I have with Vale of Tears is that it is classified as fiction.The book is so true.Most people do not understand the threat of militant Islam.

Personally I would now go for the Ryobi LiON or the Ryobi sets which can also be used with LiON batteries.Unlike many cordless drills, the contacts in the drill and saws are easy to get to.

I am not a professional woodworker, but in my do-it-yourself projects I have to change batteries mid job.3) The drill bit is not in line with the axis of the drill itself. This is over-comeable by concentrating on the drill bit and make sure it is straight. If you concentrate on the drill, your hole will be slanted.My previous tool was a DeWalt.

They don't last well at all compared to other makers batteries. The drill is fair, though not really a professional tool, and a bit heavy for what it does. I got this in a set with a recip saw, circular saw, jigsaw, and this drill. Quality of all of the saws is better than the drill, and they are useful tools, but the batteries are terrible.

Microsoft transfers their tech. support calls to Far East country like India and most Level 1 support technicians don't know much beyond simple manual reading knowledge. Worst, their manager used to call me after midnight. Is that a time to call back??? At least they should check which time zone they are calling. And in middle of night asking my e-mail address where he can send solution?? After having their case open more than 10 days he still couldn't find my e-mail address in their database with my ticket.

When you wear it as a shoulder bag and you swing the bag to the front to retrieve your gear, the bag is tilted to the outside because of extra wide shoulder belt on the back side of the bag. Would you like to place your camera in an un-even bag? Plus, I don't see how it could be worn as a backpack.

In that respect, this CD is a real treat, and Roy Whelden certainly has command of the instrument.The compositions by Carl Friedrich Abel (1723-1787) are beautiful; his works are not heard often enough.

This book is funny, satirical and ingenious; as is now expected of the Discworld novels. It is not a let-down. Pratchetts's usual style is again the base of a work of art. The Luggage is extremely amuzing, as is DEATH. I would recommend this book to Discworld fans and newcommers alike. Pratchett is very forgiving to new commers starting in the middle of his series. You will not feel lost or left-out. Definately one to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best Discworld books","review":"It wasn't THE best, but it was definitely worth the read. Like all Rincewind novels, this one was hilarious. Especially when Rincewind has conversations with his conscience and his libido...It's better than The Colour of Magic, and about as good as the Light Fantasttic. It is of course about a 10 year old Sourcerer who leads all the Wizards in what is kind of like a Mage Wars, and Rincewind and Conina the hairdresser travel to Klatch with the Archchancellor's hat. They find themselves with Nijel the Destroyer, a teenager who wants to be a Barbarian hero. The Librarian tells (or rather \\"Ook\\"s) Rincewind that he must save the World and destroy the Sourcerer.

I wonder why, if Coin was so powerful, he couldn't just bottle up the ice giants, too, but I guess then there wouldn't be as much of a story. Rincewind matures in this book, sacrificing himself to save the world and convince Coin of the error of his ways. All in all, well done.

I love the way in which Mr Pratchett can move the imagination of a mind and create a place that you just find spellbinding. Sourcery is a story that seem to appear out of a magic spell gone wrong but ends up so right that you cant put the book down. When asking the question should I buy this book, you will in the future say, Why only now have I read this book. A must for all fans of the discworld. A masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Wonderful Discworld Novel","review":"Terry Pratchett's Discworld Series is definitely one of my favorites. In Sourcery, the entire Disc is threatened by the sudden rise of wizards. The wizards are lead by one of the most feared people on the Disc, a sourcerer. What exactly is a sourcerer? The source of all magic, of course. The eighth son of an eighth son is, of course, a wizard. There was once a wizard that went out and had seven sons. His eighth son was a wizard squared -- a sourcerer. The sourcerer is the most powerful wizard ever, and with his coming, the powers of all the wizards has grown tremendously. With an evil staff urging him forward, the sourcerer and the wizards want to rule the Disc. They are apparently unstoppable. The hope of the Disc rests on the inept shoulder of Rincewind. Terry Pratchett is hilarious, and his stories are always witty and intriguing, and intelligent as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining but not one of Pratchett's best","review":"An interesting read if you're a lover of Discworld, not as inspired as some of Pratchett's earlier Discworld titles but it still stands as one of the better books I've read.

The Kindle format, however, is a hot mess.

Meanwhile I'm stuck with an edition where the italics go on for pages, the typos and misspellings are rife and, worst of all, the footnotes (a very important part of Pratchett's humor) appear at the end of the book instead of at the bottom of the 'page.'

The rope ends have two different kinds of fixtures on them like it should be done a certain way. The swing sits too far upright for little ones, even though it is advertised as being good for ages 0-1.

I would say that this could be used to help someone with other addictions as well. It shows the importance of friendship and seeking help instead of trying to beat addiction on your own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny read but","review":"it seems like the editing was a bit rushed. Not that this takes away from the story or the humour, but it can be annoying such as on page 108, when Sandi's name changes spelling. Okay, that's nit-picking, but the err is a wee more egregious when Ralph's Malibu (which is talked about through a good portion of the book) mysteriously turns into a truck in chapter eleven.Again; none of that should dismiss the book which, though sometimes the descriptive phrases can get a little tired and the slow the action, is funny and enjoyable.

The only reason I'm giving this 2 stars is the writing, I was drawn to caring for Ponty from the first chapter which made the first half of the book readable. However, the plot was weak and somewhat predictable. The characterizations of the two Minnesota celebrities was over the top and slightly annoying. I expected something along the lines of Christopher Moore but instead got a completely unengaging collection of dry humor.

This was a time before Dolby processing and the tape hiss is audible. This is SACD, so if you have equipment to take advantage of that technology, it's probably even more annoying.Professor Parker is an accomplished pianist, however what he's playing here is not what Scott Joplin wrote. Parker adds his own trills, flourishes and arpeggios; very obvious upon first hearing if you know the music. He also skips all of the repeats that Joplin wrote, not only missing a number of pleasant bars, but shortening each composition by nearly half.I was looking for a CD replacement for the decades-old Joshua Rifkin set I have on LP.

I am not a classical music afficionado, so perhaps this is not music for those for whom the grandness of Beethoven's Fifth epitomizes all that is good about music. For those of you remaining, the composition is largely a beautiful counterpoint for strings. It evoked, to my ears, elements of (Asian) Indian classical violin and Phillip Glass at his prettiest, and (struggling to describe the quality of the counterpoint) sounded like what I imagine the music a composer might write to express the experience of an Impressionist painting painted to express the experience of hearing a Bach Invention wafting over a riverbank might sound like.

Internally it shifts the gear position for each mode but instead it basically disconnects the motor from the chuck after a little use. Also there was almost no grease in the gear case.

Rand works at a start-up company trying to create a computer animated bird that responds to other people's emotions. In the process, Rand begins to respond to the emotions of a pre-school teacher, Sarah (Sabrina Lloyd), and discover his own feelings. As directed by Mark Decena, \\"Dopamine\\" captures pretty well the feel of a small, late 1990's San Francisco start-up full of big ideas but short on time and cash. To anyone who has been there, the moment when the characters in \\"Dopamine\\" fail to get their second round of funding from their angel investors will have definite resonance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Such a fascinating Subject","review":"Chemical or Real?

Little details about each character made them so fascinating. Like Sarah's tattoos - I couldn't help but wonder at their meaning. The actors did an amazing job. The film was put together beautifully. It was artistic and I enjoyed every minute of it. There were parts of it that were funny, but also very serious elements that really left you thinking.

A sub-theme, the nature of artificial intelligence and how much it has in common with the human psyche, has been far more developed in films such as \\"A.I.\\" and \\"Bladerunner,\\" but was nevertheless poignant in the character of Koy-Koy. There was some intelligent scripting here, though the material on brain chemistry failed to go much beyond what one could glean from one good newspaper article.

Although not as lively as his other novels, particularly The F**k-up or Dogrun, this is nevertheless an engaging, realistic portrait of living the harrowing 'art life' in the Big City. Entertaining and darkly funny, I recommend it. Also recommended: The Losers' Club by Richard Perez"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nersesian's style is brilliant","review":"Chinese Takeout was twisted in so many ways, but inevitably it makes you want to become a better person. The main character is troubled by a brush with death that leaves him tampering with other pieces of his life to get to the root of his problems. Nersesian is very discriptive and I found myself fully immersed in the story.Nersesian gives a realistic viewpoint of underground NYC, and frankly makes me feel very nostalgic."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for","review":"Gutless wonder.

While it is way better than my old one, it is still a mediocre tool. My worst complaint is the footplate locking knob. It is extremely hard to tighten, and no matter how much I tightened, the base plate can still easily moved, making it very hard to make perfect straight up and down cuts. The vacuum attatchement is also worthless and so is the dust blower. If you need a jig saw that will only get used a few times a year, this is a good buy. If you want something that will cut easliy, stay in alignment, stand up to heavy duty use, and produce great quality cuts do what I did and buy a Bosch."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've Had Lots of Power Tools","review":"Needed a new jig saw to cut some countertops. I did some research into this saw and liked the amps and size. I have never used an orbital saw before, but sounded like a good idea. Imagine my surprise when my cut was all over when freehanding and still horrible when using a straight edge. I tried all three settings but all cut the same. I do like the quick blade release but that is about it. I almost wrecked an expensive countertop and had to pull out my 10 old reliable skill jig saw. Would not recommend it and would return it if I hadn't thrown away the box."},{"rating":"1","title":"Battery life stinks","review":"I've had this tool for about 5 years now, with only occasional use. The batteries don't hold a charge for any appreciable length of time, so unless I think to slap one on the charger a couple of hours before I'm going to use the tool, I end up having to use a hand saw. The charger burned out the second time I used it, so I had to replace it. Bottom line: Chinese batteries are trash, buy something with a Lithium battery and skip the Skil products."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way under powered. Poor representation of U.S. built tools.","review":"I needed a reciprocating saw to cut up some rotted wood from a fence I had taken down and am replacing. I didn't want to buy another tool I wouldn't use that often, so I borrowed a friend's Skil 18 volt saw. I put both batteries on the charger, and let it take a full charge. Went out to cut up ROTTED 2x4s, and the saw simply choked about a quarter way through. I currently own several U.S. built Skil tools, including a circular saw, sander, etc...

Personally, as an introvert \\"forced extrovert\\" as the book says, I like to think I am good at networking, but do not really enjoy it.

I think it is the most over-rated book on ab initio theory out there. I liked Szabo and Ostlund and Helgaker et al's books because they were detailed enough that you could not know Hartree-Fock or MP2, but after reading them, you could write a HF or MP2 program. I didn't know DFT before I read this book and I still couldn't write a DFT program after reading it.

Product feels good in the hand when using. The knife is very sharp and the fact that it locks in position when you use it is great... The screw drivers and file are all things that I use weekly. The Nylon Sheath takes a beating in my job and still holds together well. I would recommend this to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"If You REALLY Need An Authentic Leatherman","review":"This replaced a multitool I had to give up at an airport. (Forgot I had it on my belt.) It functions great. The nylon sheath is practical. The blades are razor sharp. This particular model is small enough to wear or pocket inconspicuously and yet large enough to be practical. The one thing I liked about my other multitool was that the tools/blades were on the outside. I didn't have to open it up every time I needed to trim a zip tie and that for me made it a lot more user friendly. There didn't seem to be a downside to having the blades on the outside."},{"rating":"1","title":"Faulty Leatherman!","review":"This Leatherman arrived in fine shape, but curiously, it was not as promised! It has two identical sides, so I have two sets of knives, saws, and screwdrivers, and no scissors or can opener. Clearly this is a faulty item. I am sure it is otherwise fine, but not what I was hoping for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good value","review":"I think the Blast is probably the best bang-for-your-buck multitool Leatherman makes. It's thicker and heavier than the Kick or Fuse, but it also has more and larger tools. It's almost as capable as the Charge, but for about the third of the cost. If you value having a saw, a file, and a fine-tipped screwdriver, then you won't be dissapointed. The only weak point is that you must open the tool to access implements (none on outside of handle); Hence, no one-handed use is possible. [Know that the Blast will just fit into the leather belt pouch for the Kick/Fuse. The Blast pouch is actually a bit large.]"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bummed.","review":"I was really excited to get my Leatherman. But on the first job, the small standard screw head got chipped.

I honestly have to say I can't compare it to another brand so the blade access thing might be common among them all. Also if you are not a belt person, get one with a sheath that has a clip so you can clasp it on the top of your pants.As for the tool, it works just fine and has fixed many items that I would have had to pay someone else to do (Watch bands, small electronic battery replacement as well as the big jobs). It's favorite job is opening a beer for me just before the game.I find that the internal blades as opposed to those with exposed doesn't make a difference to me and this model has more than enough items for the home handy man. I can't speak for all the trades but I'm sure it handles most of anyones needs for the type of tool it is supposed to be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can go wrong with Steve Martin, Goldie Hawn and Daryl Hannah","review":"I love both of these films they are light and airy great for a rainy day or just to stay in a cuddle too...

It's true, the numbers are kind of hard to read when the light turns off or when in bright sunlight. However, I bought it anyway because I just wanted it for the vibration alarm feature, which works really well.The instructions for programing the phone are easy to follow. I set mine for continuous one minute intervals and wear it while exercising. The vibration alarm is strong enough that I can feel it even while sprinting or doing some other vigorous exercise. It's water resistant so I don't have to worry about damaging it with perspiration. I like that it's a wrist watch because it leaves my hands free and it straps on securely. It also has a slim design, unlike some stopwatches.Overall, I like this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great watch","review":"I wanted a watch that vibrated strongly enough to wake me up without disturbing my husband.

After reading this, I'm shocked!!This book starts with the assumptions that 1. such tasks are rocket science, and 2. there are one-sized fits all answers for all situations. The latter is more problematic. For example, the taxes chapter was the only one that seemed to be more than a list of common sense guidelines with a few (occassionally) funny jokes thrown in. But because the treatment was so short, the advice was superficial and not so useful. They publish guides for many cities, but as far as I can tell don't have staff there - but the Chicago one I have doesn't have any really useful city-specific information.In short, if you have even an ounce of self-sufficiency, ignore this book and research more in-depth resources on the subject you need to learn about."},{"rating":"2","title":"fun and informative","review":"The book got to me in a timely manner, so kudos to the broker.

I bought this camera in March and now I am facing issue with the Flash. The service engineer tells me that the flash tube and coil are damaged. I have moved to New Delhi recently and these guys tells me that it will take them confirm that whether the camera is under warranty or not as the bill from Amazon.com does not contains a serial number of the camera.

Factory sealed refurbished items from Fuji come wwithout many of the standard accessories. Okay, I really didn't expect to find 4 AA alkaline batteries in the box... but I sure expected to find a lens cap, a strap and an adapter ring, that come standard with a new S3000. No such luck. Now I have to spend about $14 for the lens cap so that the lens doesn't get scratched and dusty when I'm not using the camera, plus I don't know how much for the strap, and probably $30+ for the adapter ring if I want to ever get any lens accessories.

Everyone he writes about, including himself, is less than 1/2 dimensional. Bair only manages a rare page or two of interesting writing as he describes some of the more grueling farm tasks, but these few pages are lost in the consistent undercurrent of rancor which evoked in the this reader a sad sense of embarrassment for the author and his unfortunate family.Growing up on a working farm and being expected to work long hard hours at thankless and repetive tasks is typical of many family businesses, especially in that time and place. And the same can be said of growing up under a strap wielding dysfunctional parent in that time and place. But if Bair thinks he should stop what he is doing to write a book about such an untypical life I ask that he at least go a writerly step further by giving us one or two characters with whom we can identify or care for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Personal and Technical Account of Greatest Secret of WWII","review":"The greatest secret of WWII is that the Allied Governments were able to read the German coded transmissions. This was often on a \\"Real Time\\" basis. The history books are being revised due to acknowledgement of this great technical feat.The book is a combination of personal account and technical review of the people intimately involved in the origins of the codebreaking. It is about the Polish mathematicians and students who first \\"cracked\\" the Enigma Code, and how they protected the secret, evolved with the changes for several years before the war started, and how they jump-started the British efforts on the eve of the German Invasion of Poland.Compelling reading, both from the personal and mathematical side. You do NOT need math to appreciate the impact of these unsung warriors."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Polish perspective on Enigma","review":"This book tells the story of the Polish breaking of the German Enigma code before WWII and thru the early part of the war. The famous English Enigma work was based on the earlier work performed by 3 Polish mathematicians. This book tells how the Polish broke the code using mathematics (not a captured machine as is commonly thought) and details the methods used to decrypt messages when settings were changed. There is a lot of (Polish) patriotic pride in this book which occasionally gets in the way of the content, but it is an excellent book nonetheless. It includes an appendix in which the mathematician who originally broke Enigma explains exactly how he did it which is especially interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too late for Christmas","review":"This was supposed to be a Christmas gift.

I'd wondered at some of the continuity, but, on reading the reviews, read that PBS had seriously edited the original. Mr. Wood explains why he picked Kibworth - it's location meant history literally passed over it. I was as excited as many of the villagers as they started digging around - in fields, near the church and other older buildings, and even their own backyards. Momentum and enthusiasm for the project built up and it seemed as if everyone was doing, hoping to find their piece to the area's history. History came alive through the artifacts and the research through documents kept by locals who actually lived through all of it. I can't wait to have it for my own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charming series","review":"This is a charming series that settles into a single English village and uses its history, as viewed through written records and archaeological mini-digs conducted by local townsfolk, to explore the whole sweep of English history from pre-Roman days to the 20th century. The village sits in the middle part of the country, which was influenced by both Anglo-Saxon and Danish linguistic traditions - I suspect this was not accidental - and the explanation of how this affects place names in the area is worth the price of the set by itself. The older history is not nearly as dry as you might expect, in part because the descendants of many people listed in medieval records as working on local estates, dying of plague, etc. still live in the village and put a human face on their ancestors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Michael Woods \\"The Story of England\\" DVD set","review":"This video is an amazing story about England, a gift to an Englishman about his country.

The controller itself is light but strong (resist children punishment) and the interchangeable cards are very good for kids (colourful, strong and easy to use : you simply put them and the game starts).In general terms the toys is very recommendable. Keep the programming chart well saved and you'll have no problems.PD : By the way , the individual DVDs are very interesting (I have all of them) and fun, so don't be afraid of buying this toy.

Yet, there is meaning that goes well beyond the obvious story line; it is angst and the burden of history.I do not know the time frame that Schlink wrote these short stories but \\"Flights of Love\\" is more college level writing than professional. The stories are trite to say the least. There are only a few all to brief glimpses of the Schlink of \\"The Reader.\\"Something is always lost in translation of a foreign tongue, a different culture.

Well... it could've been sexy, had the director not cut back and forth like a jack-rabbit sitting on a shot for no longer than three or four seconds.Well... if there isn't a lot of sex and the scenes aren't all that sexy, then you better have a well written story.

Fine, it had been sitting a while, but now it wont hold a charge. At all.Whats worse, can't change the battery, it's NOT replaceable.so for about 4$ a year, that's not too bad; Still, I hate to throw this thing into a landfill, but what choice do I have?SO~ now I need to either buy another one to throw away later, or throw away all the specialized drill bits I had to buy for this thing.

I only expect the nicads to last a year or two, but these didn't and they aren't easily accessible either. This screwdriver fits in the B&D family as being cheap. If you want a cordless driver that lasts longer I really recommend looking at Milwaukee, Bosch or Dewalt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pivot is useless","review":"It doesn't pivot 90 degrees and the length of the shaft is as long as a standard drill.

Handy little flashlight in the front if you're using it for dark cabinets and such. Changing screw bits takes less than a second. Comes with 1 Phillips, 1 Slotted, and one drill bit (for a starter hole). It has an area where you can keep the bits, but it's a little tricky pushing them in there. I was suprised to find it does not swivel into a 90 degree angle (oh well). I also wish there was a charge indicator. There's no light to show whether it's charging or when it's even done charging. Oh and there's no tape measure (like it describes in the owner's manual). All in all, it's still a good screwdriver for light-duty, day-to-day stuff and beats doing it manually.ETA: Oh and I absolutely hate that you can't operate it while it's charging. If the charge runs out, you have to wait for the thing to charge before you can start working with it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major Disappointment","review":"I have had this for a few months and it has basically stopped working. It will run, but there is no torque. Also there is no ability to LOCK the driver.

One function missing on this version, that is actually described in detail on the instructions, is the measuring tape in the handle. Not a big deal, but if you were looking for that feature you should be aware this version does not have it. Amazon's prices are much lower than retail (Lowes, etc.) sometimes because they are selling an item with one function or so missing. This is the second time it has happened for me (another was on a cordless phone) so just be aware. Finally, love the tool but it is a little heavier and more awkward than the previous models.

So unless he wants to leave the item plugged in with a bright yellow light emitting, it loses its charge long before he gets to use it for projects around the house. We looked all over the B&D website and there was no information regarding the LED which stated he should be able to switch it off. The switch on the bottom doesn't solve the problem.

I have spoken to Black abd Decker, and they were unable to tell me if such an attachment exists.Therefore, any drill bits that you buy with round ends WILL NOT WORK in this product.I even bought a drill bit kit from B&D; which sppeared to have a hex attachment.

Drury's execution of the piece is quite good and filled with emotion and his technical prowess is very present on this recording. It's also great that this recording offers a version of the theme (\\"El Pueblo Unido Jamas Sera Vencido\\") in more or less it's original setting. The only thing I could have asked from from Drury is to have employed the optional improvisation that Rzewski offers to the performer after the 36 variations that really can take the piece to a new level.

As with many live recordings, the home listening experience would have been better if the record company had left off the long applause after a long pause at the end. As to the performance itself, it starts off a little shaky, but quickly finds its feet, and once it's on its way, I love the sheer joy of music-making exuberantly displayed by the 30-something musicians, its crescendos and decrescendos, it themes and variations floating in and out.

They play as they see fit, soft or loud, slow or fast.Ultimately 'In C' becomes an exercise in vanity. (Talk about a player's self-centeredness!) This particular recording takes forever to end, it fills the entire CD; and when thankfully it does end there's a LONG stretch of applause.

I have recently watched a number of Russian made war films and find them totally action packed and very well made, unlike some of the rubbish Hollywood drivel."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Admiral","review":"The film is excellent but the cost of the DVD was $99.00 + postage. For that price, I expected more than one DVD, especially as the film had recently been serialized into 10 parts of about 45 minutes' duration on Russian television. Only one DVD (with scenes cut out) was sent and the sender explained that the high price was due to that particular DVD being out of print. I still think the price is unreasonably high, especially as the one indicated on the package was $3.00. Also, while the sound was consistently good, the picture was sometimes jerky, which would suggest that the DVD could be a pirated version.So, altogether, I am not very happy with this purchase.Annie Kean"},{"rating":"2","title":"Transaction, loving, and work relationships - not equal","review":"Attachment theory that fails to distinguish the fact that each relationship carries with it the potential to be good or bad from the perspective of the participants will always fail. Rarely are the number of interactions or expectations of those interactions classified into the full context of human relations that define futures as well as pasts, but recognition of the importance of the quality of attachments is becoming more common. As myths are dispelled, we may yet enter the simplistic world of the child or the animal to whom such theories are very simple, and who operate upon the wealth of information they comprehend that so many adults make difficult."},{"rating":"2","title":"Becoming Attached","review":"This book not only explains attachment theory in perfect detail using many examples but provides a full history and evidence also. Never before have I read a book that it so thorough and conclusive in it's detail. Many writers just give the results of studies but Karen gives the full details and the outcome with balanced rational views.Thankyou Karen for writing such an outstanding book. It has confirmed my own feelings about damaged early childhood and is helping me to be sensitive and responsive to my new baby boy. If only we could get this information into the media and wider public knowledge."},{"rating":"2","title":"Attachement theory for those who have never heard of it","review":"This is an exceptional book on attachment theory.

How often do you encounter a non-fiction book that reads like an excellent fiction book? When I received it, I thought I would have trouble finishing it because it is such a thick book, but I instantly got hooked to it. The books covers the complete history of attachment theory: the researchers who studied it, their background, story, the tests they did, the different and changing opinions, etc. Gradually the reader gets more and more insight into this fascinating topic. The book is very emotionally touching: at times it is really heart-breaking. It makes you cry and worry, but it also gives you warmer feelings and consolation (mainly towards the end). I highly recomend this book, especially to all young mothers and mothers-in-spe. If you aren't already convinced of the very important job of being a mother, you will be convinced after reading this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Becoming Attached","review":"I am becoming very attached to this book!

If you're a fan of black & white movies, you'll appreciate the job Columbia has done with this one. As for the movie, it's somewhat less fanciful than much of Harryhausen's work. A terrific Italian setting, possibly THE best stop-motion creation from the Master (love those mouth movements!), and a lean script make for 83 fun-filled minutes.Note: If you've got the Sinbad movies or some of the other Harryhausen DVD's, you've already got all the extras here. If not, THE HARRYHAUSEN CHRONICLES, hosted by Leonard Nimoy, will be a real treat for you. In fact, I only held back one star in the rating because of the complete lack of new supplemental materials."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Can't Believe Its Not Color","review":"When I first read this release was going to be colorized, the image in my mind was of a fuzzy green, washed out ymir terrorizing the washed out, fuzzy Italian countryside while being pursued by people with a skin tone that is of unknown origin. Boy, was I wrong! This is great stuff! This movie looks better than a lot of the \\"true\\" color films that were made in the same period. Legend Films has totally reversed my opinion of the colorization process and I eagerly await the next two Harryhausen releases. My only regret is that they're not scheduled to do \\"Beast from 20,000 Fathoms\\". There are still movies that I would not want to see colorized (\\"Psycho\\", the original \\"Frankenstein\\" and \\"Dracula\\", etc.), but these \\"fun\\" movies from the fifties can really benefit from this new process.

Harryhausen is able to wring all sort of emotion from his creation, and you very quickly begin to respond to the YMIR as you would to a living, breathing performer.One of the most interesting aspects of the film is the sympathy it creates for its monster: like King Kong and the Frankenstein Monster, the YMIR never asked to be brought into this world, and although it must be destroyed for the safety of others you can't help but feel sorry for the creature, who clearly wishes that every one would just leave it the heck alone. It's an amazing feat of Harryhausen's art, and a must have for any fan of stop-motion animation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Quite One Of Benjamin's Favorites","review":"This is a very tight, well made movie.

I knew the 18 volt battery would be too heavy. I considered the 12 volt battery but Consumer Reports rated all the 12 v brands/models as average. The 14 volt is just right because I don't sacrifice power to get a project done faster. It is a little heavy and my slender arm did get tired after 1/2 hour of drilling but by then I was completely done anyways! So, model 2587 has accurate drilling, cordless freedom and better priced than competitive brands that rated as GOOD from Consumer Reports. Sweet deal and investment. I'm sure that the battery life will improve a lot after a few recharges, just like the owner manual says. As a woman, I am more confident about doing a great job on \\"assembly required projects\\"!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good drill for the price","review":"After searching for a cordless drill, I decided to rely on Consumer Reports review of the Skil 14.4v drill. Although I was unimpressed by the battery life upon first testing the drill, I found the life to improve after a few charges, which I later read in the manual is typical for the first 3-4 charges to be weak. Apparently this is part of the battery design to extend the battery's life.

I had to fight with five different support reps to get $15 in express shipping and $20 credit to my account for outage and $35 in minutes. $70 compensation for over $200 expenses and the inconvenience of missed appointments due to phone outage.

Afterall, I'm one of those people who thinks cell phones are way over used -- we're not all that important after all. Why would constant email contact be so important? After 4 weeks, I'm hooked. I've connected it to my home email account also so that if I'm at work I don't have to take time to check emails at home and visa versa.

They were very nice about terminating since well within trial period, and then I had to return to Amazon. BUT HEY - they had my home shipping address in order to open the account and ship the phone to me!!!! If T-Mobile has a database that shows specific dead zones, wouldn't it make sense that most people expect their Blackberry to work at home?So, my advice if you know you are in an area that has spotty coverage for some carriers is to call BEFORE you order. I called AT&T to try to verify with them, but they don't have a map that goes below zip level. Maybe that's because they really have full coverage???

Angel is a reluctant hero/gunfighter, who is out of his element dealing with 'decent' women. This book has so many sweet funny scenes in it when the two opposites attract.

Angel is an intriguing character for the male lead, and Cassie is a lady most of us \\"girls next door\\" can sympathize with (we can't all be raving beauties can we?

The insight that comes with such a relationship with the composer shines through on this album. I can scarcely imagine better versions of these wonderful piano pieces. The pieces span a variety of types of pianos (prepared piano, toy piano, regular piano, bowed piano) and moods. From the incredibly beautiful (\\"In a Landscape\\" is one of the most beautiful pieces of music I have ever heard) to the aggressive (\\"Ophelia\\") to the minimalist (\\"Music for Piano #2), this album spans quite a bit of the possibilities for piano music. I highly recommend it, but should caution you that you must have an open mind to enjoy this--this could be unlike you might have heard a piano played before (or imagined it could be played). If you like this, I recommend \\"The Perilous Night/Four Walls,\\" which also has Margaret Leng Tan playing piano."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great","review":"This will be my shortest review because there IS NOT MUCH to say about this product!

Leave the realness to Mary and the ability to Beyonce. Bossy is annoying and faceless; I couldn't pick her sound out of a lineup blindfolded. She sounds the same way talking in a microphone. It astounds me, that she has made it this far on so little......um..........well.....Sales.I read somewhere about the labels re-structuring and the criteria with albums. They won't release albums if they don't have more than one hit single then they turnaround and give another record deal to someone who hasn't even had two singles released off of the same album. Enough said."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique Flavor","review":"Kelis is not your average r&b; singer. As a matter of fact, you can't exactly label her music. It's soulful, funky, and...I don't know, Refreshing. Her music doesn't sound like she's trying to get a cookie cutter radio hit. The girl is doing what she loves, and being creative. It works very well. You feel her personality in every song. It's one of those albums that you can go back and listen to repeatedly. It has great \\"mood\\" songs. The only problem that I have is the direction of the album. They seem to be picking the weaker songs as singles. \\"Bossy\\" is fun and cute, but why follow it up with the harsh, gimmicky \\"Blindfold Me?\\" Kelis has a number of very interesting songs that showcase her talents a lot better:1. Living Proof2. Goodbyes3. Trilogy4. Like You5.

She does not follow rules but rather rewrites them based on what mood she seems to be in. This time around she wanted to take a harder edge. Bossy, What's That Right There, Blindfold Me, Weekend, Trilogy, Aww S**t, Handful, and F**k Them B**ches are all harder than the material on her last CD. She still has some slow songs such as Lil Star and Living Proof. She is very sexual with her lyrics and usually can get a little silly with them. On Circus she raps about how the music business is a messy place that replaces female artists every day and is also about how she lies to her fans by making songs that are mindless and not artistic. Kelis is a amazingly innovative singer with a unique voice and look on life. I can't wait too see what comes next."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Lost Command","review":"This is an excellent war movie.

I was unable to finish it there and so I purchased it when I returned home, so hooked was I on the story of Austin and Abilene.

I definitely recommend this book. You will be interested in it until the end. It is a smart and well-written book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Riveting Read","review":"THE KINDNESS OF STRANGERS by Katrina Kittle is a thoughtful, well-written tale about a distubing subject. The characters are well-defined and the story is told from their varying points of view. The author treats the subject sensitively without giving too many sordid details. While it is horrifying to read about such abuse, the fact is it is a reality every day for untold numbers of children. Ms. Kittle takes a very painful subject and turns it into a beautiful tale of strength and healing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not at all worth recommending for reading","review":"In the first few pages, I couldn't stand reading about the foul language and dirty content that was going on. The characters (two of them) had an extremely bad relationship due to a death in the family, and I didn't like the anger and attitudes of these people. I also didn't like how the young boy, Danny, was exposed to his older brother's Hustler magazine, or the way Nate rudely avoided his mom."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard to believe this happens","review":"I liked the way the book started, and then looked back. The problem I had with the story was what happened in between. We went from one summer to present day. You never learn about the years of the main character Jordon growing up with his new family. I did appreciate that Sarah did not have a romance during the story. I think less should have been made about Sarah's romantic ideas and Nate her son's love life. This book is heart wrenching and makes you wonder about the families living around you. I pray no child suffers from his parents as this child Jordon did. This book is emotional and riveting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chick-Lit Style Writing about Child Abuse--Blech!","review":"The subject of this rather poorly- written novel is the sexual abuse of a child... Which, by the way, is not even hinted at on the book jacket. The descriptions of this abuse were, I thought, overly detailed-- almost too lurid. I had the sense that the author wanted to write a story about a family with a real skeleton in the closet, so she wracked her brain to find the most disturbing possible thing. I'm not averse to reading about terrible things... Many great pieces of literature deal with heart-breaking subjects, of course, but do so in a sensitive, moving way that leaves the reader richer for having experienced it. But in this case, this trite and disturbing book wasn't sensitive or emotionally powerful; it was just chick-lit style writing with a plot centered on child abuse. Blech."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea, terrible writing","review":"Great plot that kept me reading despite the terrible writing. I had to find out what happened, but I do kind of feel it was several hours of my life I'll never get back..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated this book","review":"I hated this book for many reasons but mostly because it intertwined the graphic descriptions of incestuous child molestation and pre-molestation grooming with normal everyday things like a teenager losing his virginity, sexual desire, cooking, going to school, falling in love etc. It's almost as if the writer wants people to normalize grosse monstrosity. How does one enjoy reading these normal things after the smut and yuck?! There is no way to \\"enjoy\\" this book and as others have commented, I would not have bought this had I know an inkling of the graphic nature of this book. A read only a pedophile could appreciate.This is not a book that I will keep in my house, nor will I pass is along to anyone else. I will rip it up and toss it in the recycling."},{"rating":"2","title":"A story you won't easily forget . . .","review":"THE KINDNESS OF STRANGERS is one of the best books I've ever read. Like Jodi Picoult's MY SISTER'S KEEPER, Ms. Kittle's book haunts you for days after you've finished the last page. I started reading THE KINDNESS OF STRANGERS one afternoon and only put it down to sleep and eat, finishing it the next afternoon. The subject matter is tough to read about, yet you cannot stop because you quickly grow to care about all of the characters, especially Jordan. It's horrible that we have such monsters among us--people who prey on innocent children, people who are so sick they make US sick. Bravo, Ms. Kittle. You've written a story every person who cares about children should read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A devastating issue handled with grace and style","review":"Ms. Kittle's latest book shows the signs of a maturing artist reaching her stride. In taking on an issue that none of us wishes to face, she guides us methodically and elegantly through the horror and into the light of redemption. Ultimately filling the reader with the warmth and understanding of the triumph of love and family over horrible circumstance. Regardless of how one defines family.Brisk and unsentimental though, this is a truly great read, never cloying or maudlin, I found \\"Kindness of Strangers\\" (despite its unfortunate title) a surprising journey and well worth taking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read about terrible abuse","review":"I enjoyed this book despite its subject matter. The descriptions of child sexual abuse are horrifying, and it is difficult to forget the images, so sensitive readers should beware. Ironically, when the author presents healthy adult sexuality between consenting adults as a contrast to the horror of child pornography, it seems forced and the vocabulary she uses seems almost silly. I appreciate that the characters return to the practice of their faith as a means of coping with tragedy, and the religious aspects of the novel seem organic rather than belabored. Even though it is about one of the most disturbing topics possible to imagine, the book is worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Realistic and Well Written","review":"Sarah Laden, recently widowed, is horrified to learn that her good friend has been accused of child abuse. The victim of the abuse is her son Danny's good friend Jordan. When Sarah's elder son Nate suggests that they should become Jordan's foster family Sarah agrees.This was a very moving and realistically written story about child abuse. The subject matter was sad and disturbing but the story was moving and well told. The details of daily life were vivid, the characters were very realistic and the relationships felt authentic. I really enjoyed the tender exchanges between Sarah and her teenage son Nate as they navigated through the rough terrain between childhood and adulthood.I was impressed by Katrina Kittle's writing and I will look for her work again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivating","review":"It is hard to explain exactly why, but from the moment I started reading this book, I immediately felt like I had an understanding of the characters and their past histories. Kittle creates characters that are so easy to imagine in your mind that you feel as though you are peering into the Ladens' house from a window, watching the story unfold. I really enjoyed how the author tied up many of the loose ends and provided answers to the questions in readers' minds towards the end of the book so you weren't agonizing over what happened to each character. Kittle is a truly gifted writer with a knack for crafting memorable, rich stories. This is one of my favorite books I have read in quite some time."},{"rating":"2","title":"interesting and educational","review":"I am a teacher, mother, and grandmother who has always had trouble understanding why children don't tell when they are being abused. This book helped me understand their point of view better and has made me more aware of signs of abuse. The book has stayed in my thoughts long after I read it and I had to read it again to see what I missed the first time. Sadly, looking back, I think there are children I have worked with over the years that may have been abused but I didn't recognize the signs. There is no way any adult can justify the sexual activities described in this book. It breaks my heart to think of those poor kids. I had no idea that the book was about child abuse when I picked it up but I am glad I found it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tough subject, well-handled","review":"I find good writing seductive, and Katrina Kittle writes well. Her characters have depth. The story of horrid child abuse unfolds slowly and believably, without being unbearably graphic. I liked Kittle's decision to tell the story from several points of view, although she never used first-person narration. If the novel had been slightly shorter, I would probably give it another star. It seemed repetitive at times. Still a first-rate read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Working as desired","review":"My son used it and he said it is good. i had no complains from him.

As I listen to these works I feel effortlessly transported to a realm where everything makes sense in the way that ancient stories strike something archetypal and evocative in us. The \\"stories\\" are very sparsely arranged tone poems that are like watching a winter dawn slowly progress.There is a very limited palette of thematic and textural variation, but, unlike some minimalist \\"trance music\\", there always seems to be a logic and intelligence behind the flow that invites continued awake listening.I rate this a welcome addition to my music library, a vision that is unique and does not pale on repeated listening."},{"rating":"2","title":"I've bought 3 and never had a problem.","review":"The whole family has LG500 phones and this product works perfectly for us.

His music is deep and he writes everything he records. This is an excellent introduction to his work. He is an artiest from the UK who has been on tour, in hot evangelism, throughout northern Europe and the former Soviet block natioons. This album has an upbeat and progressive and very modern sound. It is a wonderful introduction to this young masterful songwriter's art and ministry. His second work, \\"A Wonderful World\\" is my favorite! I would pay twice this price to find it on CD...

At first, I must admit I was greatly hesistant on buying this DVD. However, now I am seriously happy I did. I have watched Beyonce's DVD concert from Wembley and after seeing Christina I now feel cheated. Christina's performances matched her costumes and her stage presence was amazing and the pyro. She interracted so well with the audience. Her performances were even better than the videos and albums. I'd definitely rate her among the best in concert performances that have the right to be released for sale. Note to Beyonce: Go back to the drawing board and take note of what Christina and her troop has done. Stop giving us repeat performances.

I have to say I was looking forward to this concert on television, but I was really disappointed in Christina. I thought she overdid it vocally throughout the show and didn't make good use of the stage. I like a lot of Christina's music, but I think she has a lot to learn when it comes to being a performer. I hope she learns to tone it down in the vocals department and not be so intent on proving she's \\"the best singer in the world\\" at every opportunity! Also, she shouldn't attempt to dance because she has absolutely no skills in that respect. As long as she sticks to what she's good at , I'll gladly support her in the future, but not with this DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Torture!!","review":"Ugh, I think I've gone deaf after listening to Christina sing for 90 minutes!! I know this girl has talent, but she has no idea how to use it! The major gripe I have with her is that she seems intent on proving she's the 'best singer in the world' every damn second of the day!! I wish she would tone it down for once & stop screaming and overdoing all types of notes! Also, she has no clue as to how to use the stage as she simply jumps and flails around without any kind of style or grace. Until the day comes when she learns how to sing and perform properly, I'm not gonna purchase anything else from her! I advise you not to purchase this DVD as your eardrums may pop from all the excessive screaming!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"She realy disapoints me!","review":"This DVD is a big disapointment!Her concert in it is horrible she does not know how to perform at all and it get's you feeling stupid watching someone trying to perform when they realy don't know how too!I allready put this for sale on Ebay.Too bad I bought this piece of junk!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Push it back to 2025!!","review":"I unfortunately caught this TV special when a friend was watching it and, I have to say, it's truly awful!

Good riddance!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous...totally!","review":"I'm a live DVD concert fanatic, and this has got to be the pick of the lot. And when I say 'lot' , inspite of being a predominantly rock fan, I rate this DVD over RHCP's Live from Castle Slane or U2's live from Castle Slane! And we all know that both those concerts deserve 5 stars!I love the fact that every bit of sound on this DVD is actually live, and the amount of energy she puts to make it THE most fabulous concert I've ever seen on DVD! The funny thing is, I used to hate Christina before seing this DVD accidentally, and now shes like my bibical touchstone. She is magnificient..she really is. Its cute the way she taps the mic with her fingers all the time (like Eminem), and the outfits she wears are gorgeous, especially the coat she wears in Voice Within.There is a magnificient version of Cant Hold Us down, and Fighter...well shes rockin it. I love the T-Shirt she wears towards the end of the concert, while singing Beautiful (Her shirt says 'God sees no color"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good","review":"Overall, very good.

So glad I did - the wacky world of Stars Hollow is truly an excellent find. The show's premiss of a mother/daughter relationship in small-town, Connecticut, doesn't sound all that enthralling, but once I'd watched my first ever episode, I was definitely hooked. The writing for this show is just top-notch, witty, clever, and under-shot with pathos. Lauren Graham as Lorelai is wry and funny but amazingly vulnerable. Rory (Alexis Bledel,) is a great foil for her zany mother, and there are a plethora of wonderful, supporting characters, all strong in their own right. Don't be fooled by The Gilmore Girls - it isn't all candy-coated, comedy. There's a Dali-esque slide to the left about it which can often take you (pleasantly) by surprise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Humor, Drama, and Quirk in a neat little package.","review":"Gilmore Girls is one of the best (if not the best) TV show out there right now. The acting is terrific and makes you fall in love over and over with the girls. Laughing every episode, with some crying mixed in, is expected. But the sheer knowledge of the show bogels many a mind. It is worth buying most definately, as with watching the reruns on abcfamily and, of course, the new episodes on the WB.This show deals with the issues, such as romance, dating, staying out all night with a boy, tests of school and life, and overcoming life's potholes. A must-watch for moms and daughters, or anyone looking for a good laugh."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"I absolutely love it!

The words repeated in every sentence of innumerable lists, an unbelievable number of self-surveys, and LONG SENTENCES AND IMPORTANT IDEAS TYPED WITH ALL CAPITAL LETTERS, plus the fuzzy duplication of pages made this a long slog through the theory.

All of my students have found that \\"Changing Character\\" has been very valuable and immediately useful to their work with clients. In this book, Valliant nicely integrates short-term psychodynamic treatment approaches with both object-relational and cognitive-behavioral research and theory. She also includes an easily understandable application of Sylvan Tomkins affect theory to this type work. Valliant offers practical examples of how to apply these concepts to real-life therapy situations.

Andre Rieu and his orchestra have found a wonderful niche in the music industry, somewhere between serious classical and a \\"pops\\" concert. This looks like an orchestra that would be a lot of fun to play in. The musicians are all very talented. The sound on this disc is very good. Unfortunately, the video quality is the worst in my entire collection of over 200 DVD. The compression is so bad, especially for the background scenes, that the movie looks like a \\"stop-action\\" movie, with the picture renewing itself at only half-second intervals. When the camera pans quickly across the scenes, the picture breaks up into little square digital fragements. What a shame, as this is a great concert. The entry of the bagpipers will give you goosebumps. Get his Tuscany DVD first. That one has excellent video."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"Very good sound effects.

Practical overview of trading realitys, a system that tracks the forward indicators that measure money flow, practical timing devices which are technical in nature but not the run of the mill typical methods that all others use.

I know that I personally have trouble reading through the cases in my contracts book because sometimes the facts can be so uninteresting or very confusing. I like to read the case summary in this book first and then read through the case so that I at least have a general idea of what the case is about. It helps me focus on the main ideas of the case. Of coure the book also helps out if you haven't kept up with your reading and need a quick way to go over a long case. But don't depend on this book for that alone.

Edell displays none of this."},{"rating":"1","title":"very sensible - on the surface","review":"Mr Edell is a strange individual. He sounds intelligent, humerous, and sensible...unless you actually pay attention to what he is writing or saying! Then it becomes manifest that this individual is not quite sane. Why are most Blacks incarcerated? Because of \\"police racism\\", says \\"Doctor\\" Edell. Normal men are secretly \\"turned on\\" by watching homosexual men says Dr E.

People arriving in the USA from Asia and Europe are mystified by the huge backsides of the average Americans. Plans are now underway to widen the seats in theaters and on airplanes. Dr. Dean is a wonderfully interesting man who more often than not stands on solid ground. With respect to \\"Eat, Drink, and Be Merry,\\" he has wondered into the swamp. If anything Americans don't need is coddling and encouragement for gluttony.

They're all good."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you read only one health book, this is it","review":"Edell is known for his radio show and TV news spots, where he gives out honest and straightforward advice on medical questions. This book runs along the same lines. He forthrightly discusses fad diets, alternative medicine, media portrayals, and other health topics. He bases his answers in science, which he calls, \\"that force which has lifted us from the dust and the darkness.\\" He pulls no punches - even at the media, his own bread and butter. If I could recommend that a person read just one health book, this would be it. I think it deserves to be a classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dr. Dean Tells the Truth","review":"I often listen to Dr Dean while commuting, and I'm never disappointed because I always learn something useful. I feel the same way about his \\"Eat Drink and Be Merry\\" book. It's entertaining and contains health information that enables me to filter out media hype. It seems that he is only trying to sell the truth rather than the latest fad diet or miracle pill. If you are interested in a realistic fitness book take a look at my book on Amazon.com. It's called \\"Fitness It's Gotta Be Quick & It's Gotta Be Easy.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific book","review":"I have read and reread this. I listened to his radio show for years.

He knows medicine and health care and pulls back the curtain on how the mainstream medical community pretends to know things that are not really true.This is a great life-changing book. Stop worrying about every bite you eat and enjoy a good variety of food.Stop the drug addiction madness, and look at drugs scientifically.Get real about germs and viruses.Be an informed consumer and stop letting MDs play god with your care.All the evidence, studies, and facts are presented in an even-handed, but clear and compelling way to put the consumer in charge of his own health fate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Biased and unresearched in modern nutrition/naturopathy!","review":"I would not recommend this book.

The answer to every problem is a prescription drug. In addition, he believes people should have the freedom to use non-prescription drugs like marijuana and cocaine. Yet, we shouldn't have the freedom to use supplements like vitamins and herbs. He wants the medical industry and the government to take control of those. He has an inferiority complex because he was never circumcised and was made fun of as a kid because of it. He rails against circumcision despite overwhelming evidence showing its value. Edell is the type of guy that gives doctors a bad reputation. He thinks he knows it all and that people are too ignorant to make decisions about their health."},{"rating":"1","title":"The book is not a total truth","review":"Dr. Dean either didn't learn well his lesson from his youth not to make judgements without being fully informed or intentionally ignores the existing scientific validation of so called alternative medicine.

Roy Lee's vivid memories of growing up with Milton and working as a \\"string-fixer\\" for the Musical Brownies back in the 1930's are priceless. Cary Ginell also performed a great service by interviewing several of the surviving Brownies and preserving their stories as well.

The downside is that the nutritional info applies to HALF the container. Who would eat half? When you read the specs and double the numbers, it just isn't that healthy. When you eat all the product, you are consuming a lot of calories, carbs, sugar and sodium...way too much for one meal. Also, a breakfast high in protein is much more beneficial.As an aside, I have never understood why manufacturers do this serving size deception.

However there are some significant drawbacks. It does NOT fit any stroller. You really need to have a tray there for this to sit on. But that is not enough. The base of the toy is round, so it doesn't sit flat even on a standard stroller tray. It rolls back and forth, making it frustrating to play with. When it rolls toward your child, the caterpillar can't spin. When it rolls away from your child, his short little arms can't reach to bring it back into a useful position.

The arch wouldn't stay on my Graco Quatrotour stroller. I gave this one a shot and was pleased for the most part. My son plays with everything. A couple downfalls is that you have to remove the insert of the snack cup until they're older. Otherwise, they'll either kick it or throw it out onto the floor. It's a nice feature though, because it can be removed to be washed. Another thing I think they need to improve it on is the velcro straps should be placed facing the outside of the stroller. I know when my son is older, he's going to start playing with the velcro and off it will come. Finally, you may not be able to close your stroller all the way without removing it. I've learned to deal with it and tried a couple different ways to see if it would close. I was unsuccessful. If you can look passed these flaws, it's a great choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun But Not Practical","review":"I don't recommend this toy, but we use it, anyway, only because my daughter likes the toys so much and loves being able to grab her Cheerios out of the bug!

Needless to say, it was not a piece my daughter at the time knew how to put in and out. And on top of that, she decided that she'd rather play with the removable plastic piece than the toy itself! Also, my stroller would not fold up with this on (oh yea, my stroller is a name brand stroller too). I would have to remove it everytime i folded it up.

I now leave the internal cup home.Good points: I take this into restraunts and call it my \\"secret weapon\\". When baby acts up in the baby seat at the table, I strap this to it, and surprisingly, it stays put every time. She stays entertained for a while so I can actually eat.

I've also found that, at least so far (7 mos), just sitting in the stroller and riding around is entertainment enough for my little travel companion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the best but it is entertaining","review":"Our daughter got this for Christmas when she was 5 months old and has seemed to enjoy it. She loves opening and closing the lady bug and chewing on the crinkle bug. Like a lot of other people, we do have problems keeping it upright. We have a Combi Soho stroller and the straps won't tighten on it so it slides forwards or backwards (when we bought this we had a Peg Perego stroller and it fit very well). For this reason we won't put any food in the lady bug cup. She also likes to take the cup out of the lady bug and we've come close to losing it a few times. We do have to remove it from the stroller every time we fold it up, so it takes a minute or two to put it back on everytime.It does keep her entertained so we are glad that we have it. If we had to get another one we would make sure that we found one that fit snuggly on the stroller."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun toy","review":"My 7-month old son gravitates toward the lady bug snack tray. He sucks on it's head and likes to open and close the lid. The butterfly on the string is also good for sucking because it can reach his mouth. I wouldn't dare put any snacks in the lady bug because we have the same problem as everyone else in that the bar won't stay upright on the stroller. Although it's billed as a stroller toy, it's also great for playing with on the floor. Maybe my son will eventually learn that there are other toys on this bar besides the ones I already mentioned."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was cute,for a day","review":"THIS TOY LOOKED SO CUTE ,IHAD TO BUY IT FOR MY SON.IHAD ALOT OF TROUBLE ATTACHING IT TO MY STROLLER, WHICH HAS A TRAY.AFTER ALL THE TROUBLE I WENT TO PUT ON MY STROLLER,I NOTICED TWO DAY'S LATER THE FACES HAD RUBBED OFF THE BUG'S.I WAS VERY DISSAPOINTED IN THIS TOY."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute Bar but...","review":"This is a very cute toy, my son loved it but as other reviews stated it does not fit on anything. We travel a lot back and forth from VT to SC (16 hours) with baby in car seat and thought this would be so handy, well as long as I sat in the back and held the bar in place he loved it.

However, I purchased it today and had no problem attaching it to the tray of my Graco Metrolite stroller dispite other people's comments stating that it did not attach. I agree, it would be better if the bottom of the bar was flat. The cup inside the snack container constantly falls out, I will leave it out for good.

We had just bought 2 new strollers (lightweight and jogger)and I was looking forward to putting something fun in front of baby to enjoy while we walk. Especially since the box said fits ALL strollers (in capital letters too). Nope, not ours (either). Granted, I understand why it doesn't fit and I could kind of see that it wouldn't work but I took it home anyway hoping it would have description of how to fit a stroller without a bar. I think I will keep looking. Too bad too, it looked like it was exactly what I was looking for"},{"rating":"2","title":"My kid loves the stroller bar","review":"If you have a cup holder in your stroller in the front, it is a little difficult to strap this toy onto your stroller. Otherwise, it is wonderful. It keeps my son occupied while he sits in the stroller during my long walks. He also bites on the butterfly while teething. It serves a dual purpose. They have a snack holder too, but I don't use it. My son just throws everything out of it:-)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!","review":"This is a horrible product - because the base of the bar is round, it doesn't attach properly to a stroller, and it keeps sliding forward or back, thus losing all the snacks in the cup.

I have a common Combi stroller and no matter how hard my husband and I tried, there was no way to secure the toy to the stroller. Too bad, because our daughter could not stop staring at the toy while we wrestled with it, trying to attach it to the stroller. It's going back to the store."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Stroller Companion Entertainment System","review":"We love the Bug Bar! Our now 6 month old son can't get enough of it. He is mezmerized the moment he sees it. We got this gift pretty early on-4months, we were able to attach it to our Zooper stroller with a little bit of difficulty. But was definitely worth the struggle- for all the kvetch-free (fuss free) shopping trips. He loves to teeth on the butterfly wings and play with the rings on the yellow stalk. He likes the ladybug head to suck on and twirl the catterpiller feet. This has taken first place to Max the Monkey and the Clutch cube which sit and collect dust. He could care less about those toys when he could play with bugs on Board.We haven't used the lady bug food tray yet b/c our son has started solids, so I can't comment on that. But overall love this toy and really reccomend it to parents who use their strollers like a automobile. Also make sure you have a stroller that this bar can attach"},{"rating":"2","title":"fits on combi great!","review":"my daughter loves this for the past four months (she is 9 months now).

Season three is not an exception. But I would like to share one general issue with the show. The dialogue is what makes the series. It never fails to be witty, intelligent, and full of obscure references. The banter is quick, like players on a ping pong table. My issue is this....no one actually speaks this way. I don't know a single soul, let alone two people, who are capable of interchanges like this. The series often borders on being overwritten, even if the writing is what makes it great.

I recommend not ever installing the blade provided to avoid temporarily having a bad impression of the saw. Micro adjustable guides work well and fence is a plus. Fence back-side adjustment is a little hairy to get just right, but worth the time to allow smooth side-to-side movement of the fence. Saw runs smooth and performs as advertised.

Prokofiev's score is, needless to say, amazing, and the dancing is excellent, for the most part. Apart from Angel, though, the male dancers are severely lacking in technique; they have tricks coming out the wazoo, but it would be nice to see someone actually pointing their feet. The girls, on the other hand, are all superb dancers, and of course Angel and Alessandra are simply amazing. The balcony scene pas de deux is absolutely stunning.

I also used it for heavier tasks such as routing 3/4\\" grooves in solid wood.Even if it had not broken this router would still have not earned a higher rating because of the poor design.First and foremost the depth adjustment with either the fixed, or the plunge base is very inaccurate. The design of the router also precludes you from being able to see the section of the work piece you are routing. Another negative is that with the plunge base you do not have an adjustable depth stop turret like what you would see on a higher quality router. This makes it a difficult and time consuming process to route deeply into a work piece.In the end I paid the extra money and purchased a higher quality tool, I would recommend you do the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"Skil 1825 router set","review":"This is a great kit, sure the $200+ routers are no doubt better, but for a DIY-er like me that doesn't use it everyday it's hard to justify that price tag.It's very easy to switch from the fixed to the plunge base.

They flicker on and off. Also, the bases are very poorly-made cast aluminum. The one had a huge grinding in it so the motor could fit on it. Also, the plunge base sticks, meaning that, as you want to come up from your workpiece, you have to lift the whole router off. That doesn't sound like a problem, but when you're 1/16\\" off the wood and the springs decide to work, you mar your workpiece. Also, the plastic body is very flimsy and won't take long to break.

I called Skil and the only options they offered me were (1) to deal with the store where I bought it or (2) to send in the base (at my cost) to their regional service center for them to repair it.Now, I don't know about you, but I expect manufacturers of power tools (particularly Bosch, which owns Skil) to stand behind their products, and this doesn't qualify! After just paying to buy a brand new router, I'm sure not going to shell out even more bucks to get it repaired!

I skate approximately 200 miles a month on my 5 wheel Roces Paris skates and have done so for many years. Using this product sparingly gives the best result and lasts me up to 100 miles between cleanings and re-lube. The drawback is that the Bones Swiss Precision bearings I use are a bit more noisy than if I used heavier gels or grease but the speed gain is worth it.

I soaked the bearings in a degrease to remove dirt, grime, mud, etc, dried them off, and then added the lubricant (about 4 to 5 drops). Now, they are silent and roll smoother. Free wheel spin does not matter; What really matters is that you get the most roll out of your every push. It is much better than WD-40 or Slick 50 because it does not have an oily smell.

I was a bit simpler in concept, but no less fun. The only criticism I have is that the spinner wheel kept falling off the pin it's balanced on. I was the only one who could seem to spin it without it coming apart. Based on the movie, it could easily have been played with dice, but because it's a \\"Life\\" version, I guess that's why they used the spinner."},{"rating":"1","title":"too complicated for the younger ones","review":"We own just about every board game we can get our hands on, and my daughter (9) is a huge fan of Pirates of the Carribean.

The concept of the game is similar to Life the original, which I loved as a kid. However, there are some elements that are WAY more complicated such as battleing with ships and the ending.

The title and cover catch your eye and invite a closer inspection. Then the story catches your attention and you are drawn into the world of Jennifer and her friends who embark on a venture to try and save Kissy, the little monkey she had loved all its life. Kissy was to be used in a dangerous army experiment, and Jennifer was determined to save her at all costs. The rescue efforts involve the girls in some risky adventures and creates some humorous predicaments. The characters are well-drawn; the conversations flow smoothly; the action is exciting; the outcome is very satisfying. There is also a warm relationship between Jennifer and her father that is also very satisfying. The situations are those that young people could well imagine themselves to be involved. I would unhesitatingly recommend \\"Operation Monkeymail\\" to librarians, parents, and students. A good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst of MacKay's Books","review":"Don't get me wrong.

While I did actually finish the book, it was a huge disappointment. Characterization was one of the biggest problems--I didn't care about any of them, most especially the main character, Rosalind Benegal. The way she was portrayed actually CHANGED halfway through the book (where was the editor of this book?). The plot was impossible; and with thin characterization, this \\"thriller\\" was the complete opposite: boring.

However, if you enjoy multi-faceted books that can engage your intellect, humor, feelings, senses and taste for adventure, then this is a must-read. Highly, highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A pretentious, disconnected attempt at an intellectual novel","review":"The British have a long history of writing atrocious books about India, but this one wins the prize as the worst book in 150 or so years of literary attempts by British writers to capture India. The book is confusing. It is boring. It is pretentious. It is condescending. Anyone wanting a literary picture of Bombay should turn to Anita Desai's BAUMGARTNER'S BOMBAY, or Rohinton Mistry's A FINE BALANCE, or even John Irving's SON OF THE CIRCUS. And some Brit reviewer had the audacity to compare this miserable writer to John Irving! The tough girl voice is irritating, and the central character so distasteful that one wishes she had been done in during one of the tiresome attempts on her life. I kept on reading because I wanted to see how bad the novel would get. At the end I was so confused that I didn't know who was guilty, except the writer for writing such pure trash."},{"rating":"2","title":"Forget the story, enjoy the Bombay ride","review":"This was a debut novel for the Canadian journalist, Leslie Forbes. It is a story about Rosalind who comes to Bombay for many reasons. The primary one being in response to her sister Miranda's silent cry for help. However, soon the hijras arrive, the monsoon threatens and Bollywood beckons.The book underplays the main storyline and instead architects a roller coaster ride through Mumbai. The author is so insightful about so many aspects of Indian life. Being from there I was completely able to identify with the sounds and smells evoked by her writing. Her use of allusions, at time confusing, is relevant to the overall plot. The picture she paints is so vivid that I hardly cared for the plot of the story and instead enjoyed the nuggets of information that are so casually inserted."},{"rating":"2","title":"The first book I've *finished* in years.","review":"Oh my.

Actually, I think I brought it to a restaurant once. It's truly an addicting read. Rosalind is such an amazing heroine; compassionate yet strong, she's unyielding in her pursuit for \\"truth\\". Remarkably clever, Bombay Ice manages to portray an Indian atmosphere so real that I actually felt as if I had stepped into the novel. Also, there's enough content in this novel to make it worth reading a second time."},{"rating":"1","title":"So boring I couldn't finish it.","review":"I love anything to do with India, so I thought this book was a sure thing.

The album is filled with great music and lyrics all writen by Gabby except 'In Dreams' which was writen by the great Roy and Barbara Orbison. A few tracts are solos with Gabby playing the sitar or ukulele-\\"In and Out of Dreaming, Little fortune Cookie\\", but all the other tacts contain Claypool on both bass and percussion. The album can seem a little bizzare for some, but for the many Claypool fans it should be right up their ally.

My daughter was physically scared by this album. Gabby is obviously talented, but her voice is somewhat eerie. Les Claypool's arrangements are excellent and the music is really well produced, but I wouldn't classify this as a kids album. Perhaps world? Scary world? Is that a genre? Anyway, my suggestion for Gabby is that she should embark on a dance album AKA Bjork since this is obviously the school she comes from. If you combine the world elements with her weird voice and add some dance beats, I am sure her fan base would expand.Here's my advice to all \\"kids\\" artists...Kids like to listen to great, groovy music. Kids, like other human beings, want to have fun. This album is anything but that, more a muse-o foray into oblivion."},{"rating":"2","title":"GOOD","review":"First off all...

BIG PROBLEM! My garage is wired with a GFI recepticle as are many houses built in the last 10 years. This model JML-1014VS will NOT run with in a GFI wired setting! I called Jet to inquire why the machine would not work, the short answer from JET is that this motor is not compatible with GFI. I am sure this is a great machine, but it will do nothing for me.

It is not meant to cause great emotion. It is a solid family film, and I'm glad I watched it. It is very colorful as a cartoon type film should be, and you can expect the happy ending, which is always important in films like these.I say give it a try. It's not bad at all.Thanks,Joy"},{"rating":"1","title":"bad blu-ray disc","review":"I purchased this item 6 months ago but am just now watching the blu-ray disc for the first and the bottom of the screen is flickering.

If I would have known I would get a bad quality blu-ray from amazon I would have saved my money and just bought the dvd.

If I can't put it on my iPod, it just another Warner Bros. Waste of time. I refuse to pay for it. So I got the regular DVD, and will have to be satisfied with it. For those of you who don't understand the Ultraviolet \\"digital\\" copy, they give you a serial number that you upload and then they store it in a cloud for you, and it is to their discretion how long it lasts. So, you are NOT paying for the digital copy, but merely renting it. To watch it on your android based phone, you must first log on to the internet and then go to your flixster acct to retrieve the movie, if it's still available.

This movie centers around an Easter Bunny named Hop who wants to be a drummer, and so runs away from Eastertown. As a movie, Hop is to Easter what Rudolph is to Christmas - a non-religious, cute holiday-themed movie about misfits who find their way.

Unlike many kids' movies that are entertaining to adults, as well, this movie put my wife right to sleep and drove me for my iPhone for rescue.

Let's be honest here: Alvin and the Chipmunks made over $350 million worldwide at the box office and spawned two sequels, and Hop made over $180 million itself.

Beydts's music is quite lyrical and tonal, reminiscent of the later songs of Reynaldo Hahn - the real jewel is his \\"L'Oiseau Bleu\\" (also the title of the CD). Delage's is slightly more modernistic - I think his subtle French wit is lost a bit on me. The high point of this disk is Zimmer's performance of the Massenet songs. It is no wonder the most singers have ignored these songs, the lyrical melodic lines that soar thru the upper register must be quite a feat, and Zimmer makes them sound effortless.

I cannot believe they do not accept returns! I forgot to add that I purchased (2) different hernia belts on the same order, both flimsy, no support.

Martin's accounts of Boswell's seemingly pathological obsession with sex and death make interesting reading, as accounts of sex and death generally do; but couldn't we have more reflection from the biographer here on these matters, a bit more involvement with the subject than the encomia noted by another reviewer?

It is a good series in that it is realistic, or somewhat so, and is entertaining. This makes it a pleasure to watch. Come to think of it though, this is only the case because there is a number of gifted actors in the series, and without them the writing and filming would not work well at all. So, you can say that this is a show driven by the actors but not harmed by a weak script or weaker production. All in all, a welcome new series that is entertaining.

Besides a great mystery, Lin Carter has populated the book with an amazing diverse cast of characters: Doc Menlo, Ace Harrington, and my favorite: Scorchy Muldon. I wish Scorchy got a little more of the \\"action\\" he is always pining for. The only aspect of the book that is a bit unbelievable is that Lin Carter would have us believe Zarkon is virtually anonymous. What? A handsome bronze hunk like him, a Prince, a vastly wealthy man?

Of course the stars of the album are Gigi and the wonderful musicians. This is truly beautiful music, intriguingly presented , heavy on traditional acoustic instruments. Gigi's voice is truly superb as others have noted; she manages to instill these songs (a collection of traditional and Gigi-composed tunes) with an amazing interplay of inspirational religiosity, atmospheric exoticism, and certainly, sentient eroticism as well. At the same time, it's manifestly Ethiopian and African. What more could you want? Gigi is an amazing performer (I've seen her live) and this album effectively captures her ethereal and cretive artistry and musicianship. Defiinitely a very appealing album for hard core African music fans; the haunting saxophones and accordion are great as are the rhythms and beats. Meaningful lyrics to boot (summaries provided)."},{"rating":"2","title":"More Traditional than Gigi's Previous Release","review":"Anything Gigi touches turns to gold. She could sing the alphabet backwards and it would sound good. As the liner notes will tell you, this is a \\"concept album\\" with a more classical or traditional Ethiopian sound (call and response singing phrases, traditional instruments like the washint [flute], and more acoustics). Four of the 10 songs are traditional, the others were written by Gigi. Like Gigi's last two albums, this one is also in collaboration with Bill Laswell.This is a beautiful album with more great singing from the excellent Gigi Shibabaw, good musicianship from Ethiopian musicians, very relaxing music.

Too much crammed in to one chapter means they lack explanatory language and you learn very little. Also why is a chapter on ontology and epistemology chapter 9? You'd think it would be at the beginning of the book.Secondly - the amount of spelling and grammatical errors is embarrassing.

This CD takes Trace back to the heart of country music and the listener back to the same memorable moments in their lives. There aren't many artists these days who can sing a song with as much emotion as Trace does and that's why many years down the road it will be his songs that people pop in the CD player to take them back to the times they want to remember.Producers Scott Hendricks and Trey Bruce have a talent for knowing exactly what songs Trace can pour his heart into and they've outdone themselves with this CD.

The plot seems to suggest that if your husband abused you, you're entitled to rob a stage and pistol whip any man who abuses women, and if you caused an accident that crippled your brother, you are also entitled to steal money to give your brother what he wants. Linda Florentino plays an abused wife who becomes a gun toting stage robber with a very sarcastic mouth, bad dialog, and a silly looking outfit, and she is the heroine. Craig Sheffer steals money, sleeps with whores, wears a silly looking hat covering a silly haircut, and he is our hero. Sam Elliott looks like he'd rather be somewhere else, and he should have been. All in all, a very poor western."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sam has done much better","review":"Please all this is far from Sam Elliot's better Westerns. See \\"The Sacketts', \\"Conagher\\", \\"The Shadow Riders\\", or \\"The Quick and the Dead\\". This is far less a believable Western.

Very unhappy.Spoke to tech support, but they didn't offer up anything but disconnecting all power and waiting an hour to start it up again. Didn't work.

The feature that really sold me on this camera, aside from its low price, was the image stabilization. With the stabilization on, there is no image bouncing, and you'll be sure to get clear, sharp images every time. I was disappointed in the short charge that the battery holds, so I recommend purchasing another battery or plugging the camera in whenever possible. The tapes the camera uses are very small, and you can easily store several in a camera bag.I highly recommend this camcorder.

The small-town setting in no way diminished the passion and romance that I've come to expect from Ms. Alers. Summer Magic lived up to its title and more than met my expectations.

But all that said, this was a desperately dull film. It simply lurched from one scene to another with hardly a plot to speak of, and unfortunately the overall solid (but unfortunately wasted) cast isn't able to rise above the material. Uninteresting characters plus a complete lack of narrative focus makes for one of the most surprisingly boring Westerns I've ever seen. If you want to see much better examples of Sam Elliott doing Loius L'Amour, check out 'The Sacketts,' 'The Shadow Riders,' and 'The Quick and the Dead.' None of those films rank among the better Westerns ever made either, but they're miles ahead of 'Conagher.'"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I couldn't be more pleased with this seller's service: fast delivery, & a quality product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as exciting as other Sam Elliott fare","review":"I bought Conagher I will admit only because Sam Elliott is in it. I had great expectations of it because I'm such an Elliott enthusiast, but I was disappointed. I found this film too long and boring and not nearly as engaging as The Quick and The Dead. In my opinion, Sam even had more chemistry with Kate Capshaw in The Quick and the Dead than he did with his real wife Kathryn Ross in Conagher. Of course, I enjoyed seeing Sam, but I was bored and restless and was glad when the movie ended. This is not a reflection on Sam, whom I find most appealing and engaging, but the film was just too boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"classic Sam Elliot","review":"The best Sam Elliot movie, bar none.

It's out in DVD now. I wasn't happy with the way the VHS tape cut out some important footage, but the movie is excellent any way you look at it. Roth and Eliot have great chemistry as the lonely widow and the tough drifter (they're husband and wife in real life) and the movie sports supporting actors who are familiar and excellent. The movie catches a lot of the book's appeal and brings it to life. This is a keeper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lonesome poems tied in tumbleweeds","review":"An hombre very tough meets a ready made family while trailing rustlers as a range cowboy. As westerns go this is probably a new classic.It has Indian fights, lonesome death on the trail by accident, stagecoaches and real cowboys, fighting rustlers.To top that off there is a love story..."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best modern cowboy classic","review":"This is without a doubt, the best modern western I have ever seen. Sam Elliot (The epitomy of what a cowboy should be) plays a virtous, rough and ready cowboy who is the kind of man that many men whish they were. Independent, off in the wilderness, and riding the open range. That is of course until he meets a widow named Evey in distress, (Kathreine Ross), and they fall in love; although Conagher can't quite help from being \\"dumb as a post\\" about it all. The elctricity between the two actors is uncanny and just plain beautiful. I couldn't figure out how two actors could bring off such a believable and convincing job of being in love until I realized that they are married in real life. It is a wonderful movie for the whole family, as it exemplifies doing the \\"Right\\" thing no matter how tough the going gets. Barry Corbin turns in a great performance as comic relief. The rest I'll not spoil by saying any more. This is a must for your movie collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Wester in the same vein as the Virginian","review":"This is one of my all time favorite westerns with one of my all-time favorite western actors.

Add that to a good story line and you can't lose.My only criticism is that it is not out on DVD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good made for cable western","review":"Katherine Ross and Sam Elliot both did a great job in this quiet, elegiac western. With Barry Corbin as a stagecoach driver and Ken Curtis (who played Festus on \\"Gunsmoke\\") this has a sort of \\"let's-the-get-the-gang-together-and-make-a-western\\" feel to it, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. It's full of good, wholesome values--an honest day's work for an honest day's pay, don't steal, don't kill unless you absolutely must--and middle-American common sense and courage.There are some drawbacks, however. First, this was a made for TV movie, and the commercial breaks are as obvious as in any TV show (although there are no commercials on the DVD). Also, it was shot full frame, and the print this DVD was mastered from was not pristine. But for what it is, it is very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Western","review":"Sam Elliot was born for the western and this is a beaut. Based on a classic Louis L'Amour novel. The tale of a cowboy who finds the lonely notes of a frontier wife (real life wife Katherine Ross) on the tumbleweeds. A great story and thank God for TNT. John Wayne is gone, Clint Eastwood is old so with TNT (and the tv movies of Elliot and Tom Selleck) they are the only salvation western fans have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent movie!!","review":"If you love author Louis L'amour like I do, you'll love this movie.

Despite the plastic on it, feels way more solid than I was expecting in something so cheap, has some actual heft to it. Appreciate that it has its own little case with it. No instructions, took a little to figure out the little tool that comes with it, for re-zeroing it, apparently, which I then proceeded to do (wasn't much off to begin with, but I wanted to play with it). Action seems smooth enough. Haven't quite mastered the use of the vernier scale- could be the instrument but might be me- looks easy enough to use down to the closest .001 at least- good enough for its intended purpose as a cheap brake rotor measure.

This book has various short stories in it that were based around the lives of Latin American women. These short stories helped me better understand what some of the women in Latin America have to deal with on a day to day basis. Although the stories are fiction, I know that they probably shadow the lives of women in Latin America. These stories have all sort of themes and symbolism in them that help the reader breakdown the true meaning to the story. Some of the themes include; patriarchy, materialism, and motherhood. Out of the six stories that I have read, these themes have come up in just about every story. I found this book very interesting and I would be very interested in reading some of the other works that the authors of the stories have written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Theordore: The man of many talents!","review":"I admire TR!

As the head of the three-person board that oversaw the city's police, Roosevelt changed our notion of a modern police department. Even as he attempted to institute reforms he faced down police corruption, ethnic-group protests, government foot-dragging, and machine politics in the land of Tamany Hall. This firebrand commissioner would even prowl the gaslighted streets of Old New York looking for policemen asleep at their posts.Join Theodore Roosevelt in this crusade to stop crime and corruption in New York. If you enjoyed Caleb Carr's fictional T.R. in The Alienist, you'll probably enjoy the real life crime-buster in Commissioner Roosevelt. (I liked Mr. Jeffers' real one better.)

This is interesting, because Jeffer writes that his was the first book on this subject, despite the fact that he cites Berman in his bibliography and proceeds to cover the same ground. Jeffers book is readable but is shallow and superficial, consisting largely of anecdotes and summaries of newspaper accounts from the New York Times.

I pity the poor singers who had to parade around the stage fondling a Rossini bust, playing with test tubes, riding on scooters, and lots of other nonsense which adds nothing to the genuine comedy in the original story as it is traditionally presented.

The plates are good, and depict the Scytho-Sarmatian warrior-women, the inspiration for the myth of the 'Amazons', in addition to Scythian warriors triumphing over Thracian and Macedonian foes.

It seems you need so many ingredients to do the simplest things. But this book really broke that barrier for me. Each dish is shown in splendid Restaurant Menu color. You are able to find that special dish that has a different name at each restaurant. The book is split into chinese and english sections top/bottom respectively. Very simple ingredient lists organized by order of addition to the pot. Most of the recipes only had 4-5 steps. And even my wife and I were able to come up with some incredible dinners together."},{"rating":"2","title":"It really is easy","review":"I have been looking for a basic Chinese cookbook that I can use everyday and this one is it. It has many stir fry recipes and they are mostly homestyle items I remember from my childhood (e.g. beef and oyster sauce; corn soup). There are also some restaurant dishes (e.g. Peking duck; stir fry meat wrapped in lettuce) that require more time and expertise. The recipe for tofu and egg drop soup is worth the cookbook alone. I love this soup and I did not realize how easy it is to make until now.This is a great reference book that is perfect for beginners. It explains ingredients in the beginning of the book, with small sections on preparation of seasoning sauces and salad dressings.One word of caution: if you do not live near a good Chinatown or an Asian grocery store, some of the ingredients are hard to find and the book does not offer substitutes.This is the best cookbook I own because the dishes are realistic enough that I will actually make them. This book is amazing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful BOOK!","review":"This book is great. Beautifully designed. excellent pictures. simple recipes.

This gun is not only the most attractive gun I've seen, with its fine hardwood stocks, but it is proving to be stone cold reliable and surprisingly accurate as well. With all steel construction the extra weight makes for rapid shot controllability and a pleasing lack of recoil. That, along with a very slick DAO trigger makes this a nice plinking/target gun--promoting the frequent practice a licensed gun carrier should demand of himself or herself!"},{"rating":"2","title":"powerful and artfully written blend of fact and fiction","review":"In \\"Home Movies...\\" Citron uses an interplay of fact and fiction to guide the reader on a journey of secrets. We are never quite sure of who is speaking and yet always sure it is the author's voice we hear. Citron has crafted her written words with the same sense of artistry evident in her films. This book is powerful and artfully written. It is as much about understanding the well-buried and fragmented narratives we each conceal as it is about the story of Citron's individual exploration of her own stories. Communicated through simple language inflected with subtle nuances, the truths among these pages explore the juncture of life and art. Interacting with this text is quite an experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"This movie should have been presented as a 30 minute episode on Goosebumps.

I have to honestly say, I am having a hard time understanding any of the negative reviews from my fellow 80's children (I am 33 years old). You didn't have to be an adult in the 80's to answer any of these questions; while some of them are difficult, they are no harder than ones from any other edition of trivial pursuit. I think many people are disappointed because this is not solely about 80's pop culture, it involves other aspects such as politics/headlines and literature. That being said, reviews are merely a reflection of opinion and the buyer takes a chance when buying any item. You may or may not like it. I enjoyed it and hope you will too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fun if you remember those years.","review":"A real \\"blast from the past.\\" If you remember pop culture from those years it can be quite an entertaining game.

I was a KID!This game is geared towards adults in the 80's. My parents will love it. They are in their 50's.The 3 questions I got right in the whole game had easy answers, too easy. Nothing fun.Oh, and the tv and movie questions are always asking who the actor/actress name is, not their character, who we all remember. I don't know Angela's mom's real name, from Whose The Boss, but it took a minute for me to remember her name on the show is Mona. THAT should have been the question. Not her real name.

I thought Trivial Pursuit was better than this. I love the 80s, but I didn't like this game. First of all, it's cheaply made. The cards dont even fit in thier holders.

It showed Vili as people truly do see him, and it looked at, most importantly, Mary Kay LeTourneau from both sides. Mary Kay is a very sick woman, in my opinion, and that may be because of circumstance or something else... You'll have to read this book to find out and I hope you do because it will bring you closer to the whole life and case of Mary Kay LeTourneau like you never imagined!Especially if you hadn't known every detail about the case before, please read this book...

This is clearly impossible, as that would not be a stable molecule.Other idiotic errors abound, but I provide that as the absolutely worst examples.

Also, there are many errors in the questions and in the answer keys.If you want to buy this book as a general review, it has good information for the Cell and Molecular Biology sections, but the Biochem section goes into way too much detail and the practice exams are pretty terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"An less than adequate test prep","review":"This book provides a very, very basic review of the major concepts of biochem, cell biology, and molecular biology (i.e. genetics). I found this review helpful, but the detailed questions of the actual exam require a much more detailed review. This prep was also chaulk-full of typos, mistakes, improperly tagged vocab words, and incorrectly drawn chemical structures (texas carbons and nitrogens, double bonds to hydrogen atoms, etc.) that required me to look up the actual structure or correct definition. The practice exams were also a bit easier than the actual exam was, so an accurate gauge of how well you are doing cannot be obtained with this test prep. If all you need is a brief review before your subject exam, then this will probably work, otherwise review your old corsework and notes."},{"rating":"2","title":"My first Kipper purchase","review":"This was my first Kipper video that I bought for my daughter who was age 2 1/2 at the time.

I used a similar product on dog nails when I worked at a vet clinic. Here's a tip: If you dog doesn't get use the Dremel and constantly protests when it's pulled out, try giving them peanut butter. Dogs love it, it's inexpensive, and it's super gooey which keeps them busy while you work on their nails.I'd give this a higher rating if the high speed worked and it had a bit more power.

We were very disappointed with the tool for many reasons.1. There is no way it can sand down any type of large breed nails;unless its a puppy large breed.2. The friction from the dremel on the nail takes only 3 seconds before it gets to hot,and that is not long enough to sand down my own nail much less than our labs.3.

We have determined that it is too much grinding to only use the tool on our dog's toe nails. Therefore, we are clipping first and then using the grooming tool to finish the process and smooth the nails. We have to be extremely careful or her hair gets caught in the spinning shaft (even when using the suggestion of covering her foot with a nylon stocking and allowing the nails to protrude). Our dog is small (12 pounds) and her toe nails are small enough that it is difficult to grind from their bottom side without touching hair or the pad of her foot. The dog allows the grinding but is not very happy about it.

It is possible to grind the nail down too far, though, so you do need to still be careful. Also, trim in short turns because the friction can make the heat build up on the nail quickly and is uncomfortable for the dog. Holding the trimmer in the right hand with your dog's paw in your left hand and his back facing you will give you the best angle to trim. If your dog has long hair, be extremely careful to hold the hair away from the trimmer. If hair gets caught in the trimmer it will spin up in a flash, pull your dog's hair, jam the grinder (until the hair is removed), and and frighten your dog. So, be especially careful with long haired dogs. If you're careful, with any dog, this is a wonderful tool that makes nail trimming easier for both you and your dog."},{"rating":"2","title":"The beginning was a little scary","review":"The first time I used the product the dog and I were not to sure about the possibility of grinding down my dogs toenails. Once I tied him up just like at the groomers he flinched a little but no more than with traditional trimmers. The best part is I never once got the quick and he went on with life like nothing had happened afterwards.

It works well although the two different speed controls dont seem to operate optimally. It makes keeping her nails short a breeze, it is quick and painless for us both.

In essence the tool is great."},{"rating":"2","title":"No title review","review":"Howdy folks, I and my dogs like the results of grinding instead of clipped their nails. By doing it every few days the quick has recessed a lot and the nails no longer make noise on the tile floor.

I tried the cheaper Dremel but it barely takes off any nail at all. The Peticure's nail protection cover seemed to be a little bit of a hassle, but it actually worked very well - it helped position the sanding drum and let me apply more pressure to ramove more nail faster.

The VERY best recommendation----buy the dremel but go to the pedicure website!!!! The videos on how to use these nail sanders and especially on how to prepare your pet before using the gadget are GREAT!!! VERY informative and if you buy the dremel but follow pedicure's directions/videos I bet you AND your dog will be much happier.

Nail clippers (even the \\"special\\" ones for cats) seem to splinter their claws. I ordered this after reading all the reviews for it along with the other 2 similar types of tools offered on TV. This is fantastic. However, I would advise you to get the \\"fine\\" 120 grit sand paper rather than the 60 grit that comes standard with the Dremel Pet Tool (I got the 120 grit at the local Ace TrueValue Hardware store). The fine grit works much better on delicate feline claws. My two Russian Blues were not afraid of the tool, even on the first time. I use the low speed and you just have to work with your particular cat and their claws to develop your own technique. I highly recommend this tool - it leaves a smooth end on the claw and takes away all the hassle and struggles involved in clipping a cat's claws when he is not in the mood. THIS IS GREAT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great, if dogs cooperate.","review":"This is really a nice tool. We have two dogs, one will tolerate it and one goes berserk.

Too many pitched the idea that if their site captured just one percent of a [Hundred] billion-dollar market, than the firm would be a success. Only even one percent was a pipe dream, and perhaps a dozen firms had the same idea. And the \\"greater fool\\" theory suggests that even if the originators are wrong, somebody else will be foolish enough to buy them out.Cassidy concludes his good work with a lengthy table of dot.com failures, a sobering story in itself.

Put in batteries and your off. This toy is great group fun. Tossing it around based on the color hand pass you have.Problem is the toy starts shutting off when it is caught. It appears to be random. You are tossing it back and forth and when a person catches it, it turns off. So then you have to go thru the whole sign on process again. We spend more time setting the game up than playing it. I would stay away from this toy until the quality control improves.Update: I called Hasbro after Christmas. I told them it was a gift (no receipt) and that I couldnt take it back to a store.

The replacement works great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun game, when it works","review":"My daughter wanted cosmic catch so much, so we gave it to her yesterday for birthday.

It is very difficult to get the battery compartment to open , as others have stated. The kids loved it at first, but it became very frustrating even for adults. Even when the ball was passed to the correct color band it would not recognize it and just make the error sound.

The kids lost interest pretty fast."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Game I bought so far","review":"My sons Christmas list consisted of games......only games.

People are complaining about the foam, but hey, you toss or throw this ball at other people...of course its going to be padded.

Can't tell you how many times all the friends would come play, having to wait, taking turns (as there are only so many pieces allowing kids to play).

We were getting maybe an hour or two of play on each changeout of 4-AAA's. Then I read that review and tried just removing and replacing the same batteries when it stopped working. Sure enough it started working again. Quite a pain to keep having to do this and I have a feeling the small screws are going to stip very soon and we'll have to chuck it in the trash.

I exchanged it thinking it was a fluke and didn't test the replacement. The boys mom told me later that the second one never shut up either.

I too had a problem with getting the battery compartment open....and I DID use the correct screwdriver! You have to press down really hard as you are turning the screwdriver to get it open. My 6 year loved it and I think we played with it a total of 6 times and by the second day, it completely stopped working....could not get it to turn on. I went out to Target, bought a second one and it worked fine that night.

No problem with slippage that's for sure. Now I have a $29.00 chuck dedicated to one drill bit. I thought buying the Makita brand chuck would pay off, wrong on my part.

I've had this for two years and it never worked right; I could never get the chuck tight enough to hold a bit for even the smallest holes. I'd recommend going with a keyed version. If only some vendor would come out with a high-quality, reasonably priced hex drill bit set...this chuck would be obsolete."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe I'm just a noob?","review":"It seems heavier and bulkier than it needs to be and you have to spin it on a power drill to tighten a bit properly.

This collection of songs was written in a weekend and preceeded the composition of those on Elvis' \\"Brutal Youth\\", possibly his weakest album. Apparantly Elvis had a head cold when he demoed the songs for this album. It must have impaired his judgement because the whole lot from this album to \\"Brutal Youth\\" is almost unlistenable.UPDATE: I gave this album a second chance recently and it was no better than the first.

I would have been much better just getting copies of the previously published work. And the piece on Cyprus was half written by someone else!Caveat emptor. But someone should not be promoting this as his latest work. Too bad - the original pieces on firefighting and especially on Moussaud were compelling. They are just not tied to anything. Other gifted writers who publish works like this are more forthright in telling potential readers what they are."},{"rating":"1","title":"Naive","review":"Having read Perfect Storm, I at least thought this book would be entertaining. Unfortunately, it is neither \\"pleasure reading\\" nor academic/objective. The author takes us on his journeys, financed no doubt from the money he made from Perfect Storm. His analysis is superficial, and one wonders if Junger ever has a solution to any of the world's problems. In this book, all he does is recount and reherse what we already now and have read elsewhere. I agree with other reviewers that you won't find writing like this in the press. It could however be a collection of essays written for National Review or Commentary. Interesting but not altogether satisfying. Spend your money on more serious books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surface reporting - at best","review":"Sebastian Jungar really sold me on a Perfect Storm due to his in-depth and remarkably interesting reporting, therefore I eagerly read Fire. His previously demonstrated ability to move out of the way and let the stories tell themselves is completely lacking in fire. For such a talented writer this book left me very disapointed, but more it left me feeling used and abused by a misleading title (the content is much more than \\"Fire\\") and worse by the way the chapters flow together like short, disjointed articles, rather than building towards a central theme. The books seems distressingly like an atempt to showcase Mr Jungar rather than a writer interacting with the reader on subjects of real interest. Proof that the most interesting subjects can be ruined."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much for my stomach...","review":"What a dissapointment!! I'm not judging FIRE comparing it to THE PERFECT STORM. I think it's not always that a writer can repeat the success of his previous winning book.The trouble is that I never have imagined tha Junger would gor for some easy money, misleading his fans, releasing a book with OLD magazine articles, without EVEN REVISING THEM! THat was what shocked me the most!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Trash!","review":"I thought I purchased a book about fighting forest fires, you can fool me hopefully only once, see you later Junger you'll never see another penny of my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pedestrian","review":"After reading the reviews of this book in the trade press, I was expecting something more than \\"Bill Bryson's Modern Disaster Stories\\". But that's what this book reminds me of: pulp fiction, or should I say non-fiction. The stories are interesting but self-serving. We're all supposed to be impressed by the author's wonderous experiences. But his coverage is superficial and nothing is said that is new, informative or particularly insightful. It's interesting but not worth the money. Wait for the paperback or, better yet, borrow the book from the library. One can only wonder what wonderful things Junger's publicists offered the reviewers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth the Time","review":"I was surprised to see how long it took for Junger and his publishers to capitalize on his Perfect Storm fame. Now I see why. The fact is, he has nothing to publish. In Fire, Junger manages to make fighting forest fires and whale hunting boring. It is clear Junger owed the publisher a book and reached into his file cabinet and recycled old material."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Perfect Storm - Not Compelling or Well Written","review":"Just finished Fire by Sebastian Junger. Thumbsdown. I was hoping it would be as compelling as a Perfect Storm, but the book is deceptively titled. It should be:Fire and Other Short Essays by Sebastian Junger as there's only 2 stories in the whole book about fire, the rest are about badly war torn countries.So there's no real cohesive story in the book like a Perfect Storm, and very few of the stories are a good read.The worst part of the book is how Junger puts the former head of the Afghan Northern Alliance on a pedistool, in several spots he makes reference to the fact that he was widely accused of atrocities, but then dismisses it casually. It's a clear case of a reporter liking his subject too much to be objective. All in all a major disappointment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Taken in","review":"Another example of a publisher (and author) capitalizing on fame. Perfect Storm was great - Fire isn't. Just because Junger had a blockbuster is no reason to republish a bunch of old magazine articles and call it a book. There's a reason no one ever heard of Junger before Perfect Storm: his articles were nothing special, so why make a book out of them. This limp hardcover is the worst case of bait and switch I've ever seen in the publishing business. I got ripped off. Don't get fooled into thinking this is remotely like the Perfect Storm, or for that matter, a real book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Perfect Storm","review":"I confess that I went into this book a tad cynical. I felt that anyone writing about smoke jumpers has to contend with Norman Maclean's unforgettable YOUNG MEN AND FIRE, but I had enjoyed-if that is the right word- PERFECT STORM so much that I assumed that if anyone could match Maclean's mixture of technical detail, energy, and lyricism it would be Junger. Well, he can't, or if he can he hasn't here. One gathers that just about everything in this collection was written for various magazines, and it is perhaps a pity that Junger didn't heavily edit the essays, revise them, focus on one or two topics and really make a book. Not that these pieces are particularly bad, I read 'em, but I doubt if I will remember them much past next month."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Adventure Stories","review":"This book is a collection of Junger's articles. As such, it feels a little disjointed. The topics of the articles range from smoke jumpers who fight wildfires in the western U.S. to the diamond trade in Sierra Leone to the wars in Kosovo and Afghanistan. But if the topics seem unrelated, the book holds together in its sense of urgency and suspense, and the theme of a chaotic world in which the forces of nature and humanity constantly threaten to overwhelm the protagonists. Junger's style is sparse and to the point, but he paints vivid pictures and his page-turning narrative style makes it hard to put this book down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sweepings off the floor","review":"I bought this book, hoping to find a \\"Perfect Storm\\" about smoke jumpers. What I found instead was a collection of feature articles with a tenuous connection to each other at best and of limited interest. The single exception to this is the last article, which is interesting in that it is about Afghanistan and the Taliban. Beyond that, you could pitch the whole book and not feel like you insulted it beyond what it deserved. Junger's publishing company was obviously trying to squeeze some more money out of Junger's name before he disappeared from view."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overall disappointing","review":"Most of the negative reviews are right on. The title is misleading. The short stories are disjointed. And this book doesn't come close to the brilliance of Perfect Storm. Sure, there are a few flashes of this brilliance--but I do stress \\"few\\". Basically, the book consists of a series of short stories which were written by Junger as articles for magazines--mostly during the early 90s. Unfortunately, when you put them in the same book, it then becomes a hodgepodge of unrelated stories. I don't even think as articles, they would stand well on their own--once again, my opinion. The writing lacks the creativity, flow, and energy which Perfect Storm displays throughout. Maybe this book was put out quickly by Junger and publisher to earn some quick bucks--knowing it would sell based on his name only. I don't know. But I don't think this book deserves 1 star. It deserves 2 because there is some interesting reading in there."},{"rating":"2","title":"ParroT Tricks","review":"I have read this book but my Quaker Parrot Bobby is not aold enough to start tricks yet but I am sure it will be a great help"},{"rating":"2","title":"LTJ fan since 1998","review":"I have purchased a good amount of LTJ Bukem/ MC Conrad music in the past, so this purchase was just to add to the collection.

Great song, \\"I won't look back\\", i really like the lyrics on this song, mostly cause i can relate to what is being said: \\"All my boyhood friends told me i'd end up friendless or in jail\\" \\"All the girls at the school dance, wouldn't give me a second chance\\". Damn, i didn't even get a first chance. Also, \\"third generation nation\\" is Rockin'. Great Rolling stone cover of \\"tell me\\", even though i never heard the original. \\"son of sam\\" is a good tune, but a little too slow. \\"flame thrower love\\" is excellent. \\"Aint it fun\\" is a great slow moving, nasty, spitefull, sad song.

It gives no systematic description of various adhesives, what is good for what surfaces, strength, temperature ranges, etc. Most of its info is totally out of date as of 2010 -- minimal discussion of epoxies, polyurethanes, and none about cyanoacrylate, silanes (strong silicone derivatives), newer polyvinyl types (Titebond III).

She includes the up-to date information on glues and adhesives and certainly answered my questions about which to use for what.Many times I am uncertain which one to use, since many projects do not specify what type of glue or adhesive to use.

No real conflict is established until the murder is committed. It's just a bunch of ppl arguing with a bad parallel between the servants and their masters. There is nothing witty or even funny about the writing. There is no real mystery at all when he is killed because of the emphasis on a particular character and half the characters could've been taken out to move the movie along. The entire first hour sets up almost nothing and is just filler. However, Altman saved this wretched script by producing superb shots. That is the only redeeming quality about the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful to sit through","review":"I'm not about to cower in awe of what so-called \\"critics think. As quite an eclectic connosieur of film I found this one lacking in most everything except cinematography. But even that doesn't save this film which literally put me to sleep. My only motivation for staying awake was the gnawing belief that surely at some point a plot would finally emerge to justify enduring the lack thereof heretofore. But it finally dawned on me as the credits rolled that I had been had. What I don't understand is why the critics or Alton think that sitting through hours of watching people, one would barely tolerate in real life, chat about nothing for 2 hours constitutes an important film or even entertainment for that matter. And I happen to like good English film. But if I am to give up 2 hours of my life, I just think there should be a point."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"As a fan of Altman, and with all the critical praise preceding release of Gosford Park, it was with high expectations that I brough this DVD home recently.

I love a good murder mystery, however this was not one. It dwelt more on the upstairs/downstairs way of British life instead of the murder. The murder didnt even occur until more than halfway through the movie which made for a slowgoing plotline. I was very bored with it and except for a very select few good one liners this was a huge disappointment for me.

It is as much the 1932 English society as it is a mystery. The first quarter of the movie is just introductions to the characters as they approach the manor. Then the discussions start as they are settling in and the sub plots show up but do not overwhelm the main story. If you are trying g to guess ahead forget it.Also plan for every English cliché.I suggest that you use the closed caption option the first time through as the mumble a lot and the background music is louder than the speech tract. Don't be surprised to find that it has ended just as you are getting into it.The DVD extras add a dimension to the movie as after watching them you can view the movie with out the sub tittles."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was a disappointment","review":"After reading the write up, I anticipated a witty film with a calculated pace.

I'm sorry, but this is nonsense. Never would Agatha Christie, mistress of her craft, have written such a feeble mystery. For a start, the murder doesn't take place until more than halfway through the film, the detective when he appears is an idiot who couldn't detect his way out of a paper bag, and it's pretty obvious from the start who the murderer is, and why she did it. Pathetic. The film is riddled with cliches, all the upper-class characters are grim and repressed, all the working-class characters are warm, vibrant, life-loving etc. The film is just about worth watching for the performance of Maggie Smith, playing the only interesting character in the film, and the lovely Ivor Novello music. As a mystery, the film is hopeless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst mystery ever!!!","review":"I would have gave this movie no stars but one was as low a choiceas they give you.

And to what purpose - to make fun of Ivor Novello (wonderfully played by Jeremy Northam), one of the few interesting characters in the film. Her part made no sense at all.

You wait for the entire movie for something to happen and when it does, the movie ends a few minutes later.

Seeing it 3 or even 4 times really gives the watcher a full appreciation of this story and the talents of the actors, director, and most of all the story about the statuses above and below stairs.

It is extremely difficult to memorize all the characters-- I watched the movie twice and I'm not sure if I have half the characters names right.But despite the confounding dizziness of it all-- I was in love with the movie. As Director Altman states, it is not a \\"whodunit\\" sort of movie-- no no no. The point of the story was to create a murder mystery, in which everything is seen by the servants' POV. This is a wonderful technique, and it is executed fabulously. The servants' are not drab, and similar. Like real people, they all have different personalities.

After about 30 minutes of the incessant, meaningless chit-chat that comprises the whole of this film, people in the theatre began to openly complain -- out loud. \\"This is boring\\"...\\"They should have called this film 'Who cares?'\\"... Nobody argued with them. I sat fighting off sleep, which kept creeping into my brain during this cinematic sedative. My wife repeated \\"God, what a bore!\\" many times.Several people got up and left -- heading for the next room where they were showing \\"Blackhawk Down\\". One man who was stuck there with his wife, who wanted to stay, went out and got a newspaper from somewhere and returned and spent the rest of the movie in the first row, backed turned partially toward the screen, and READ THE NEWSPAPER until the film, mercifully, ended.

I say \\"homage\\" because it's not a parody.Altman shot the scenes with very many characters talking at once, often with multiple cameras. The result is convincingly realistic, although the sound quality is often maddeningly muffled and the dialog is difficult to pick up through the various British accents.The casting is fabulous, and Maggie Smith as the witheringly sharp-tongued dowager is the best. But close behind is Ryan Philippe's impression of an American doing and impression of a Scottish accent deserves an academy award.You'll need to own this on DVD as you'll watch it 50 times before you catch all the dialog--you'll love it more with each viewing."},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD won't play","review":"I purchased this DVD for a friend. She said it wouldn't play in her two dvd players. I took it to my house and found it would play in my computer but not in either of my TVs. With some research I discovered that DVDs are coded to different regions to help prevent piracy. This particular version was coded for region 2. My friend doesn't have a computer so I guess I'm stuck with it. The movie is probably okay, the fomat isn't. A word of caution ................. check before you purchase a DVD from another country."},{"rating":"1","title":"impossible to follow","review":"I found the movie impossible to follow for a couple of reasons. The characters come in the beginning in such profusion they are difficult to later identify and many of them tend to look much alike. I read the Wikipedia summary but even that didn't much help. One that does stick in mind is the pretty boy butler played by Ryan Phillippe, but only because he has a fake Scots accent and as usual isn't very good. Another problem is that most talk \\"sotto voce\\" so that it is almost impossible to understand what they are saying. If there were subtitles that defect could be overcome but there are only Spanish, not English, subtitles. I contrast this fiasco with another movie about a great English house, Remains of the Day, that is a marvelous movie. I'd give GP a 1 and Remains of the Day a 5. No real comparison."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like Downton Abbey? You will love this movie","review":"I am in love with Downton Abbey because I watched this movie years ago and didn't want it to end.

Very disappointed, costs more to ship back than I paid for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow, with an Unclimatic Plot","review":"While Gosford Park provides an excellent look into 1930s English country life, the movie moves very slowly and does not have much plot to it. Once the murdered occured, I had hoped the plot and the pace would pick up, but neither did. And while there are some great lines in the movie, they are not enough to keep things moving. The costumes are very well done and the set is great; both are done to period. However, the cinematography does not do them, nor the plot, justice. The music is beautiful. Hats off to Patrick Doyle for another job well done. If you're looking for a study of 1930s English aristocrats and their servants, Gosford Park is the movie for you. If you're wanting a period who-done-it that twists and turns and keeps you rivetted to the end...watch Clue. You'll find it much more enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utterly boring...","review":"I am a fan of Julian Fellowes writing and was looking forward to viewing this film. After 30 minutes of tedium, I turned it off and have no plans to try it again. Utterly boring and a total waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste","review":"What a waste of millions of dollars and some of the world's finest actors. This tediously long film is a mixture of Upstairs-Downstairs and Agatha Christie. Altman just doesn't understand either the upstairs or downstairs people. His \\"sexy\\" scenes are embarrassingly dumb. Some of the dialogue is unintelligible, especially when it is delivered by people pretending to be from Scotland. And at the end, when three people \\"rip off their masks,\\" so to speak, and are really other people, the dialogue is so clumsy that if you look the other way for a second you'll miss the plot summation. This is a film that deserves to be listed in the Turkey book, under the title Most Expensive. It fails to be amusing, insightful, or even entertaining. The worst part is the script, and so, predictably, the writer received an Academy Award,"},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the biggest disappointments ever","review":"This movie just ends up being nothing. It's a comedy that isn't funny, a drama that isn't dramatic, and a mystery that isn't that mysterious. I jsut felt like I had wasted 2 hours when I left the theater, and thats never a good sign."},{"rating":"1","title":"ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ","review":"When I read the few negative reviews among all the raves, I figured that some people are simply not sophisticated to appreciate a good movie. I was wrong. Gosford Park is one of the most boring movies I have ever seen. It is incomprehensible when it comes to connecting the characters. Certainly, this movie would be better watched a second time. But why torture yourself to a second viewing of a movie that goes nowhere?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterful","review":"Perusing the reviews for \\"Gosford Park\\" I wasn't surprised to see several complaints of boredom. It might sound stupid, but anyone who found this film boring is not Robert Altman's intended audience. Gosford Park is a masterpiece of subtlety and exquisite attention to detail; it requires patience and focus on the part of the viewer. The entertainment is there on the screen; it's up to the individual to discover it.\\"Gosford Park\\" succeeds in bringing together two completely different worlds that rarely, if ever, collide. The languid upstairs sphere hovers just above the much more crowded and lively below stairs universe. To watch the ballet dance between the two is to watch genius at work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bland at first glance, GOSFORD is actually splendid","review":"When I first watched GOSFORD PARK I didn't realize the hype. But when I put a little thought into it, and learned to appreciate the wonderful ensemble cast, the film was pretty magnificent.With actors chosen for merit and talent instead of name and face, PARK truly produces a wonderful storyline set in a unique and visually beautiful period.The overtones of ... mystery are abound, but the real film lies within the eyes of the actors. Everywhere in the movie you can carefully study the eyes and facial reactions along with the imagination of what each actor is thinking and truly bring a powerful motion picture to heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gosford Park","review":"Excise the murder mystery and there's a really great story here about how people treat one another, regardless of class or station. There's also a nice contrast between British reserve and American directness. Yet, Hollywood needed a hook, and that's where the classic \\"well-dressed dinner guests gathered around a body, wondering who could have done it\\" device comes in. To Altman's credit, he wisely spends as little time as possible on the actual murder and gives the inspectors who show up hardly any screen time. Good thing, since the real treat here comes in keeping track of all the uniformly wonderful performances, bedroom shenanigans, betrayals, alliances and nasty infighting. As a class warfare piece, it pales next to Renoir's classic Rules of the Game. But Gosford Park manages to make its points without overstating them, and while a tad overlong, it holds together nicely at the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"DVD=Dig Very Deeply: It's well worth it.","review":"The DVD of Gosford Park is a terrific value, and really the best way to see, enjoy, and understand the film. First, see the movie straight through, even though you might miss a third of the dialogue. Second, watch the English- subtitled version (allegedly for the hard of hearing, but a real boon to those of us with good ears who couldn't catch all the dialogue the first time). Third, see it again with the screenwriter's comments. Invaluable! Fourth, once more, with Robert Altman's commentary. In between, watch the deleted scenes, and see \\"The Making Of,\\" the \\"Historical Accuracy,\\" and \\"Q&A\\" documentaries. The package is the best use of the DVD format I've encountered. At each viewing, my appreciation of this film increased."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Blu-ray transfer","review":"I just received my blu-ray version of Gosford Park and found its quality to be very lacking. I compared it to my DVD version and there was a very small improvement in the picture quality, but not much. The blu-ray also lacked any extras and the closed caption feature did not work. It's still a great movie, but a terrible blu-ray transfer and I would recommend that you don't buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Altman's Genuine, Farewell Broadcast","review":"\\"A Prairie Home Companion\\" was an entertaining coda, but \\"Gosford Park\\" is truly Robert Altman's last great film, in which he applied his distinctive touch--the roving camera, bountiful casts with tight ensemble performances, overlapping dialogue--to another genre that for him was unexplored territory: the English drawing-room murder mystery. Beyond the movie's cheerful performances, the neat twist here that Altman and screenwriter Julian Fellowes's turn is on class distinctions, internal hierarchies within classes, and how members of those classes cannot keep from intersecting with one another. \\"Gosford Park\\" is Altman's answer to Agatha Christie, even as \\"The Long Goodbye\\" is his take on Raymond Chandler. Not since William Wellman has a single director approached such a range of movie genres and impressed on them such a distinctive stamp."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good mystery and portrait of upper-class English life","review":"There's plenty of suspense and drama without any gratuitous violence.

Another movie that has received a lot of hype, and surprise surprise, fails to live up to it. Trying to keep track of the characters, especially their names...ha!, is so frustrating that I felt like turning off the movie then. But I didn't and continued on.There are a lot of talented English actors...many of whom I have barely heard of nor care to see in another movie. Everything about this movie is like its predecessor, Clue. People are invited to a large house, yada yada yada, someone's killed, yada yada, whodunit??This is the boring, British version of Clue. I cannot recommend it because it is boring, difficult to follow, difficult to give a damn about any of the characters (truthfully, did there only have to be ONE murder?

Yes, the cast is great (hence the 2 star rating) but it's hard to tell who's who, no less than whodunit. Perhaps a smaller cast would be better or better yet...if everyone wore nametags to identify themselves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Altman fumbles.","review":"Altman is, of course, the maker of M.A.S.H., Nashville, Short Cuts, The Long Goodbye, Brewster McCloud and McCabe and Mrs. Miller, some of the best films of their time.This is not work of that caliber.The story can't attain a sense of momentum. We never get to know the people very well. There seems to be no main event, but lots of small, fussy side proceedings. In fact, we 'hang out' for far too long, right at a bunch of strangers' elbows, soaking up rich atmosphere and opaque jollity as though it will all begin to matter soon. There is a bit of fire right at the end. Emotions flash, and we glimpse a new facet of one character for the first time. Then the film ends. We have sat through over 2 hours of what feels like a setting of the stage, a laying of the groundwork for a story. Then the closing credits roll. If you are at all like me, you will be asking what on EARTH was that all about. A major disappointment from a director who has done amazing things. Cannot recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"4 DEFECTIVE VERSIONS OF THIS FILM","review":"I have ordered this film, which I am sure is very good, from Amazon twice...each time ordering two dvds.....ALL FOUR FILMS HAVE BEEN DEFECTIVE...THEY HAVE NO SOUND...I SENT THE FIRST ORDER BACK, RECEIVED ANOTHER ORDER, STILL WITH NO SOUND...BUYER BEWARE"},{"rating":"1","title":"BUYER BEWARE- NOT a studio-pressed version!!!!","review":"BUYER BEWARE- This is NOT a studio-pressed version of \\"Gosford Park\\", which Universal currently owns the rights to.

And American audiences and movie critics who fell all over themselves to extol this film! PLEASE! What was it the accents?...Maggie Smith's character was bitchy and mean-spirited - a part she can play in her sleep. And to what purpose - to make fun of Ivor Novello (wonderfully played by Jeremy Northam), one of the few interesting characters in the film. Her part made no sense at all. When this film is reviewed again - say ten years from now - it will be seen as a shabby, hackneyed film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"My girlfriend and I picked up this movie. We made the decision based on the awards this movie has won. To be honest, I don't see why it won so many awards. It either didn't have much competition or someone paid someone else off. There is no character development and seemingly no plot. Just a bunch of pompus rich people and their servants.I wasn't renting this for car chases or gun fights, I was looking for an intellectually deep movie, and was utterly disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drags on and on and on...","review":"This horridly boring film from Robert Altman doesn't generate enough suspense to be interesting nor humor to be funny. It wades in a cesspool of dullness, never giving us interesting characters or even comelling situations. As if the murder mystery wasn't used enough, this movie doesn't even try to give us fascinating dialogue or characters worth mentioning. The cast is divided into two parts: the rich and the servents. The rich sit around acting pompous and speaking with British accents. Their servents have no particularly unique qualities. Now here's the odd part: the film was up for the best picture award at the Oscars. What for? A weak delivery? Bland characters? This film fails on all counts in turning in something worth watching. It's long-winded and never really gets off the ground."},{"rating":"1","title":"The true mystery here is why all the critical praise?","review":"What a waste of acting talent. Anyone who enjoys a good mystery will be sorely disappointed here. Easily figured out soon after the murder takes place, this script is an abomination. The speech was practically unidentifiable as the English lanaguage when spoken by the household staff. The banter of the guests was understandable but incredibly stultifying. The only positive was the early 1930's setting. The directing was simply annoying. Don't waste your time or money (as I did) on this easily forgotten, overhyped, completely non-entertaining waste of talent and film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Altman does it!","review":"Altman set out to make a pretentious British drawing room drama, and he certainly out-did himself. This movie is excrutiatingly dull. Soporific. Don't be fooled. It's boring. And the sound is bad too. Well, maybe that helps, because the enunciation of the actor's lines are horrible. You can't understand a word their saying. So it's a double whammy. I really wanted this movie to work. But it's bad. Still don't believe?

I was attracted to this title because it was written by Julian Fellowes, the creator and writer of Downton Abby, the sensational Masterpiece Theatre serial shown on PBS. This film disappointed because the dialog was difficult (or impossible) to hear or decipher, throughout the picture. Sub-titles were NOT available either. There is a large cast of characters, many of the men and women looking enough alike so it took 3/4 viewings for me to sort it all out and figure out most of the relationships in the picture. I am still not sure about some of the characters in the subplots? I would quickly buy another version, if it was offered with subtitles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very, very slow -","review":"We love British movies and TV shows, but this movie is very dull and slow paced.
