The journey is gently mediated by shapeshifting godforms which appear to the protagonists in the guise of colors which exemplify their natures, creating a rich tapestry upon which Caroline -- the book's novice priestess/artist -- and her friends weave the tales of their lives, their hopes, their fears and dreams and failures. 'Temple...' speaks to all aspects of life, bright and dark and in-between. 'Temple...' is the first book of a three-part series and can be purchased with a workbook designed to facilitate psycho-spiritual realization and healing in one's own life.

But it was so idiotic I turned it off in the middle of the candle-wax scene (about 20 minutes in). A ten-year-old could write better dialogue than what's here.

Alas, the ending of the film was even worse than what I was anticipating halfway through. (C'mon - Lina on a moped at the end? \\"Yes, I'd like my movie with extra extra cheese, please.\\")The only thing that made this film barable (barely!) was the scenery of the Greek Isles - which I admit was captured beautifully.

The movie is in Santorini and all these actors are turning each other on while on vacation and having really messed up sex. I could not even eat after watching this is was so gross! There is even some gross guy near the end of the movie who is like 18 years old having sex with a 70 year old woman.

Well, the Greek island it is set on is incredibly beautiful. In fact, it is the best part of the movie. Might as well watch it with the sound off, so you don't have to listen to the dreadful dialogue.But even the scenery is ruined on the DVD version of this movie, since it is in 4:3 format, and the video quality is so bad.

It's an o.k. camera, but I would recommend a different one. It's very slow and isn't caught up with the sound. The program that comes with it is confusing, and I still haven't figured it out. When I installed it, it didn't work at first because I forgot to put a floppy disk in it along with the CD. I got pretty ripped off!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny and Sexy!","review":"I received an advanced copy of this book from the publisher and I wanted to share my review. This is the first book by Ms. George I have read, but after reading DEVIL MAY CARE, it certainly will not be my last. Ms. George has a flair for dialogue, characters -- and humor, leaving me laughing at times, crying at others -- and sighing quite contentedly as I read the last page (which has a rather interesting twist, but I can't give it away.) DEVIL MAY CARE is a must read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun read","review":"I read this book about a week ago and fell in love with it. I hadn't tried Melanie before this, but I'm glad I picked it up. Devil May Care is a light, fast paced read that kept me entertained from beginning to end. Wonderful story. Can't wait to get her next."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious, but one thing that disapointed me was...","review":"Though I found 'Devil May Care' very entertaining, I was a little put off by the way Melanie George dealt with Reggie in the end, feeling that it was hasty and completely random. I think that it would have been far more interesting if Reggie HAD been as he seemed, and eventually found the...erm... person of his dreams. Otherwise it was a great book, and I am waiting to see the next book featuring Grey."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Keeper!","review":"Just finished Melanie George's, DEVIL MAY CARE, and now know I must read everything this author has written and intends to write. I had stopped reading historicals for awhile since they had gotten so boringly predictable and the characters like cardboard cutouts. But this book was like a splash of cold water in my face. Completely refreshing! I hope July hurries up and rolls around because I can't wait to see what Ms. George has in store for Damien's brother, Nicholas. I can only imagine!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE THIS SHOW!","review":"Excellent show. As you get to know the characters in this series you can't pull yourself away.

It's a very disappointing show. It has alot of language (in my opinion) and no plot at all. It was very slow, hard to follow and the main actress is trying a bit too hard to be the \\"tough\\" woman character. The characters don't flow well together. It's just a very hard pilot to get through. Maybe I just needed to give it more time, but I didn't really feel like it. I would let this one pass by and find a solid cop show to watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful.","review":"This show was so bad I couldn't be bothered to sit through my free episode.The female protagonist is crabby, impulsive woman who seems to feel that she is above laws or protocol.She and her partner ignore orders from their boss but apparently avoid being fired by holding their cell phones out the window and pretending they can't hear.They take one witness to the site of the murder of another witness.All this within the 1st 10 or so minutes of the show.Maybe it improves, but I doubt it. And I can't be bothered to watch it long enough to find out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tired of the political agenda being pushed.","review":"I'm just tired of these programs trying to pusha political agenda in the form of entertainment.I'm done watching any of them including this one.Although I liked the program I refuse to allowthem to try to convince me that I should adhereto their values or lack of them.I won't watch this one anymore along with WhiteCollar on the other network."},{"rating":"1","title":"plain silly","review":"Offensive, and I am not easily offended--would be O.K. if not a prime time show.

And like most new shows, they seemed to be trying different things to see what worked. Some things did, and some were only so-so. But overall it was a good first season (subsequent seasons had more good episodes).Of course the two best eps were the last two. The next-to-last culminated with the events of the entire season - lots of drama and action. The last episode involved resolving (most of) the personal drama with Mary, her mom and her sister.Certainly worth the very reasonable price to buy the set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ranks up there with NCIS","review":"Great show. I love character driven shows that highlight humor and this show fits the bill. Mary & Marshall are fantastic partners, even though Mary can be quite a \\"B\\" sometimes. Her relationship with Raphael/Chico is complex and intense. The mother & sister can be a bit grating on the nerves, but they are probably what makes Mary the way she is. I even like her boss, although her has played so many weasly characters in other shows that I have a hard time trusting him. I hope that they explore Mary's missing father this season.This show reminds me of NCIS and The Closer, in that it is a drama with significant enough comedy to keep my interest. Once the price comes down I will certainly buy the DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"dvd season one in plain sight","review":"I enjoy this show but am unable to get cable right now so this helps to be able to see the ones I missed"},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING: adds no functionality","review":"This is just a fancy version of the adapter that already comes with your Creative Zen Vision.

It's also ridiculously difficult to find at this point, due to legal snafus. Nevertheless, it'll be worth the hassle.Why? Consider this: what do you do when Alan Moore has pretty much wrecked the world as we know it? Make up a new one. And fortunately, as we've also seen in bestsellers like Neverwhere and Stardust, this is one thing Gaiman can do. From people admiring drug-users because they represent the last known frontier, to the permanence of death, and even the inevitability of evil, Gaiman hits on mythical concepts in a thoroughly plausible and enjoyable way.How would superheroes REALLY affect our world? Read this volume and see. I guarantee you won't see any of it coming."},{"rating":"2","title":"Omnibus Time!","review":"Marvel Comics now owns the rights to this character as of 2009 so expect to see an omnibus edition containing the entire series.

The way this problem is tackled by the women and the different points of view of each of the women is definitely interesting. The loyalty and friendship of this cast is believable the chemistry is great.The movie is full of laughs and great lines. It is definitely refreshing to see an all-female cast, Hollywood should keep this up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not watch this movie!","review":"I was shocked, this movie was beyond bad.

This version pays lip service to every issue contemporary women have to contend with, but the whole thing comes off as disengenuous. What it does portray is that every actress in this movie has had work done and it shows! The only person who distinguishes herself, acting wise and appearance wise (because she looks authentic) is Annette Benning. I can't remember a time when I've seen her in a film when she doesn't do a great job. This might be worth getting just to see her act. Overall, I wanted to like this but I was disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"How bad can bad be.....","review":"There is bad and then there is really bad and the there is the remake of The Women which adds a new low to bad. A great cast wasted on a really bad script. How can one of the funniest plays in B'way History be turned into a dull mess where all the women end up being boring... even Bette Middler ;who can save most anything; couldn't lift this Turkey out the mud! The casting was right, but the ladies had nothing to work with. Leachman who is super funny didn't have a single funny line. Don't waist you money on this ...."},{"rating":"1","title":"People should be punished for this ....","review":"Q: What happens when you take a classic film full of razor-sharp wit, humor, and melodrama and remake it it with none of those ingredients and a group of actresses so bad that your dvd player smells? A: this remake of the Women.Half of them have so little screen time (I'm talking about you Jada and Eva)that they will live this stinker down better than others. It's primarily the Meg and Annette show.Poor Meg seems to have done a bunch of really bizarre surgical things to her face and it is really distracting. She looks like Sally left Harry to go to a Halloween party. Annette, for some really bizarre reason that defies logic, seems to be channeling Kim Cattral throughout! That's like watching Sarah Bernhard pretend to be Karen Valentine!Anyway, other the the title, a couple of stolen lines and character names, purists can rest easy. These two movies have so little in common it's amazing. This is more like The Powderpuff Girls save the world. YUCK!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Meg Ryan - no Norma Shearer","review":"If you are going to watch this movie you should definitely watch the 1939 version starring Norma Shearer (in the role Meg Ryan attempts to play) and Joan Crawford (Eva Mendes's role) first - because, not only is the acting in the 1939 version better, but the plot fits the times better. And although Debra Messing came very close to having that same comedic timing that the '39 cast showed - the 2008 version just doesn't stand up next to the 1939 - nor will it stand the test of time.However if you are a huge fan of Sex and the City and the like you will probably like this film. But... If you like the classics like I Love Lucy and Singin'In The Rain - then the 1939 version is DEFINITELY the one you should watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uninteresting and shallow","review":"This movie has a great cast but there was absolutely no chemistry between the women. It was hard to believe that they would even be friends; a stereotypical lesbian, earth mother, career woman and the \\"happily\\" married working mother. I didn't care about any of these women. This is a good movie to pick up at your local library and watch for free to pass a few hours but that's about all it's worth."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Bad !!!","review":"I actually rented this movie with an open mind, I've watched the orignal many times and thought that it was ahead of it's time. I was right, this remake is pretty awful! Even though it steals so many of the witty lines from the original, which was released in 1939, this movie is so boring and badly acted that I barely could keep myself focused on watching it. Do yourself a big favor, and rent the original and place this one in the \\"Forget\\" pile!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One star is too many!","review":"This movie is neither intelligent nor humorous. While I am unfortunately acquainted with women who are as self-indulgent and insipid as the women in this film, I would certainly never waste two hours with them. Why then waste two hours with \\"The Women\\"?This film may have been tolerable had the characters not been turned into caricatures. Jada Pinkett Smith as the \\"lesbian\\", Eva Mendes as the \\"mistress\\" and Annette Bening as the \\"feminist\\" were cartoonish.Meg Ryan's portrayal of the betrayed wife was completely flat and all I can say about the Debra Messing character is that it defies description.This movie is a complete waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Under-developed","review":"I had high expectations. The cast is brilliant - the director as well. Yet these characters just seemed undeveloped - there wasn't enough going on to tie them closely enough. It was mainly a set of acquaintances thrown together. And maybe just 1 man would've helped keep this movie interesting. I think Diane English had a gazillion-dollar opportunity - but it seemed to fall flat. Predictable - boring - and too much posing.

This 2008 version is to the 1939 version what warm Kool-Aid is to Champagne. Claire Booth Luce wrote a play, \\"THE WOMEN\\", which is sophisticated and razor-sharp funny. Joan Crawford's Crystal Allen alone would blow all these cutesy gooey girls off the screen. No comparison. If you like warm Kool-Aid, then by all means have the re-make.

All of the crowd scenes were women only; even Mary's dog was a female, and all of the children girls.

My boyfriend watched it with me and to my surprise, loved it! He's not one to jump at the chance to watch \\"chic flics\\" so I didn't think he would like this romantic comedy.

The perfect romance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trying to have it both ways","review":"Many here have tried to explain why a film with such a charming and clever set-up should have turned into such a mediocre movie.The filmmaker was obviously terrified of being accused of \\"sentimentality\\" (whatever that is). So, he threw in every kind of quirky unpleasantness he could think of, so that no one could accuse him of making a feel-good movie. He succeeded.Unfortunately, people who hate feel-good movies are not pleased either because of the charming and clever set-up. The characters are not nasty enough, and there is an almost total lack of hostility anywhere in the film.Moral: Decide what audience you're going to aim at. Go for them and write off the others."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must see for the romantic at heart","review":"This movie is one of passion, love, and destiny.

Over the past year I've had two cordless phones burn out in power surges (despite being on surge protectors) due to stormy weather, and I wanted something that would hold up. The first problem I noticed was an odd sound when I spoke into the mouthpiece, but I thought I could live with it. After just a month of using this phone, I am about to send it back and hopefully get a refund. For no apparent reason, the audio just quit -- no sound comes through the receiver of the base or the cordless unit. The answering machine picks up but does not take messages. I've been trying to deal with Uniden's customer service with with no success. I feel gypped and would NOT recommend this phone to anyone. I just hope the company honors their warranty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Joystick button stops working on handsets after several months!","review":"Bought this unit at costco.

I like the phone, however; the description was deceptive. I was looking for a phone that had a message waiting indicator for voice mail. It said that there was a message waiting indicator but after I got the phone I discovered that it is only for the digital answering machine. That was unclear. I have had to install a caller id box to discern whether or not there is a voicemail message (or I have to pick up the phone receiver to here the tone). Redundant service since the uniden has caller id and caller waiting id. I had a similar uniden phone that I purchased 2 years ago that had both digital answering machine and a voicemail indicator, which is what I was looking for. Too much of a hassle to exchange it so I will chalk it up to experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Hate to rain on the parade - bought the TRU9488 largely based on Amazon reviews - but two units I've purchased from two different retailers and returned are big disappointments for the same reasons. No resolution in the user manual, so have to assume it's a manufacturing defect.Sound quality of the corded handset is tinny and pathetic. Stangely, it sounds fine when the AC power was removed to test the unit's power failure capabilities.

How can she judge another as a \\"godless Yankee\\" and determine she was \\"not a church-goer\\" because the woman resented the invasion of her personal spiritual choices (pages 235-236)?Much of the text was nothing but inane prattle and stream-of-consciousness musings with spiritual ideas included as an afterthought.Most tiresome were her writings for Christmas.

He has a very distinct style and seems to enjoy using various items for musical effect -- and example is a good ole handsaw as a beatline for one song. Overall his album is so-so, with highlights including \\"Psychic Bounty Killaz,\\" and \\"U don't know me\\" among others. Of course, most people buy this because of U don't know me. Plain and simple, this song is a true anthem, right up there with Stardust, and it's been really hot up here in Northern cali along with Bounty Killaz for quite some time now.

This album supports that description. The swedish lyrics enhance the description of her voice, as you are listening to what you can find and relate to in the tracks... so of course, there's THAT voice, teamed with some great melodies. 'Aven en Blomma' is a stand out track.... and it's nice to see and enjoy the video clip of the song on the cd as well. There's so much depth to enjoy here on this album. Swedish lyrics?.. no problem!

Shame on you Frida!"},{"rating":"1","title":"HARMONY LADY FAILS AGAIN","review":"Frida made this album in 1996, after twelve years of well enjoyed silence. what a waist of time. This is a woman desperately trying to be cool. Like all her other solo albums, Frida gets boring after the third song. With ABBA she was 'the hamony girl' for Agnetha. She was brilliant as such. On her own she briefly shined on the single 'I know there's something going on', but sadly the single was primarily a Phil Collins song. This Swedish lanquaged album does not serve ABBA's status.

The piece that goes behind your ear is flexible and pretty comfortable. Weight wise it's really light weight.No for the cons... It was marketed as having ~5 hours of talk time, and plenty of standby time to boot. This was my biggest complaint - the battery life was closer to an hour.Another problem which plagues many of the low to mid end boom-less headsets is that there's a horrible echo as in the caller hears their own voice.I used this headset for well over a week before returning it. Having to charge it a few times a day just to handle an hour or two of calls was excessive and unnecessary.

Director Stuart Gordon squanders what had the makings of a truly chilling, atmospheric horror story by letting it degenerate into a typical blood fest. There are many good touches here (good acting, good production values), but the film is done in by Gordon's penchant for gore. Why can't modern filmmakers understand that blood and guts are not frightening, but simply revolting?Poor Lovecraft must be worn out by turning over in his grave with each new attempt at bringing his stories to the screen. It is a shame that film directors don't understand or appreciate Lovecraft well enough to create something that will satisfy his enthusiasts rather than pandering to the bloodthirsty fans of slasher movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"disregard the The guy who directed RE-ANIMATOR and DAGON directed this steamer?! review","review":"This a terrific adaptation of Lovecraft's work.

It's just boring as hell with no real build-up. The direction wasn't bad, you actually enjoy watching the characters---but the script wasn't that polished and the special effects were pretty crappy. But this IS Stuart Gordon we're talking about.Worth watching? Sure. But probably the worst that I've seen from the \\"Masters of Horror\\" line.\\"Dagon\\" was pretty sweet though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome CD From Extremely Underrated Band!!!","review":"I first heard the music of McAuley Schenker Group twenty years ago (1991) on Z ROCK [WZRZ 96.5 FM] here in Cincinnati. Although I had to use Google to find out from the lyrics who exactly sang these songs, I was determined to find out just who could create music this good. McAuley Schenker Group are an extremely underrated band, and this awesome CD deserves to be in anyone's collection. My favorite songs on this CD are \\"Get Out\\", \\"Rock 'Til You're Crazy\\", \\"I Don't Wanna Lose\\", and \\"Follow The Night\\". Michael Schenker and Robin McAuley are both creative geniuses for having composed music this good! Buy this CD if you are interested in hard rock or heavy metal with the perfect combination of heaviness and melody."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brings back memories....","review":"OK,if you can get past the big hair on the cover,inside you will find a little masterpiece of 80's nostalgia. This cd is Solid,if not spectacular.There is no reason to skip thru any of the tunes,just enjoy them all. I can remember buying this cd and cruising the open road while blaring Gimme Your Love,and Love is not a game, thru my speakers....oh man,has it really been 20 years since this thing has been released? MSG released 2 more cd's after this one,but in MY opinion,neither one matched the quality of this one. I guess it was a matter of Perfect Timing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"HAIR METAL.","review":"GOoshh....! Look at the cover art for this one... See MAcAuley and Michael's hair.... That's exactly the kind of sound you'll find here: polished, love lyrics all aorund, total pop metal aiming at the American market, due to record company pressures...This is when Michael tried to \\"go with the times\\" and compete with Bon Jovi, POison, Ratt, Motley Crue, etc....OF course his playing is still sharp, but here they are being used in the wrong way..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Expensive but excellent !!","review":"This is a 1987 remastered album.It has 2 extra tunes I honestly do not find as different from the original ones. The album is quite good. Even if you are not deep into Heavy Metal you will like it. \\"Get Out\\" is a poweful tune it will rock you well and \\" Love is not a game\\" is a heartbreaking song and in my opinion the best song in this album.I wonder why there are no US copies to buy from. I would have buy already \\"Save Yourself\\" and \\"MSG\\" which complete the McAuley Schenker partnership 1987-1991."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still a great LP","review":"As tacky as putting the mullet on the cover and even the multi-layered vocal tracks, this CD still rocks for it's age. The best of the three (of this lineup) in my opinion, but I've been a UFO/MSG fan for as long as I can remember. This goes for a lot of bands from the 80's that were good but have been forgotten. Unfortunately, management back then called for these cheeseball tactics and even still do this to the new bands.

A style of cooking that combines soul and taste, with a nod to \\"economy\\" - waste not want not! I've been told by many along the way that this is truly a counter-intuitive enterprise. In response, I wish only to say that THE WHOLE BEAST is a book that has already given the serious food world (chefs, cookbooks writers, reviewers and discerning eaters) tremendous pleasure.

It's one thing to tell your own story, but she was very passive-aggressive when she spoke of her sister and some of the celebrities that are no longer alive to defend themselves. About half-way through the book, I realized that Ms. Luft didn't come across as a very likeable person. No wonder there was tension between the sisters over the years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely pretentious","review":"I'm so sorry to say this, but Lorna can't write. It was very hard following her scattered thoughts and short sentences. I honestly took way too long reading this book because I was simply bored with it. I felt that she was a little self-centered, and did a lot of tooting of her own horn. She even put a quote of her mother's that read \\"Lorna is more talented then all of us\\" on the back. Is that supposed to persuade us to read her book? She's a very untalented writer so I'm not too sure what she meant by that!It's not a very good book. If you're interested, stick to the books written by actual writers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lorna's got guts!","review":"I found this book amazing in its ability to take screen icon Judy Garland and unflinchingly show her as not just a troubled star with an addiction problem, but as somebody's mother. The fact that Luft brings this off with such warmth and insight is a tribute to her storytelling power. My only complaints are with the HORRIBLE copy editing job on this book; spelling and grammatical errors abound, and sentences are literally repeated mere lines from each other. Miss Luft deserves better. Can't wait for the TV mini-series!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This woman can no longer have any friends in Hollywood!","review":"This is truly a tell-all book about Judy Garland and many others in Hollywood. Even Lauren Bacall doesn't come out well! It is unclear why all those people needed to be bashed to tell the story Ms. Luft intended to tell. The details of Judy Garland's life and Ms. Luft's childhood are tragic to be sure; however, the book takes a turn for the worse after the death of Judy Garland. It is especially disheartening to see how Ms. Luft tears Liza Minelli apart. Its a quick read, thank goodness. Save your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you don't have any talent - write a book.","review":"Lorna Luft's book called me and my shadow is more of a complaint about being in the shadow of Judy and Liza.

She told the audience to look up alcoholism, because it actually is a disease!It makes one wonder whether these two were living under glittery, spangled rocks, or something.The book is an interesting read, but the many, many pages devoted to Ms. Luft's late-in-life revelations about her mother's and her sister's addictions are like patiently watching a child play with color crayons: You know you're doing the polite thing, but Gawd, it's boring.Finally, I wonder who edited this book. \\"Me and Joey,\\" and \\"Me and Mama,\\" and \\"Me and Liza,\\" and so on. After the first few dozen, it's like reading a letter from camp.Is it to remind the reader of the title of the book he already has in his hand, or is it just plain bad grammar?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Brag-A-Thon WATCH OUT FOR FALLING NAMES!!!","review":"May I ask who died and left Ms Lorna Luft queen of A-list socity?

The book starts as a biography of Judy Garland and ends as an autobiography of Lorna Luft. The book seems to present a fair, matter of fact portrayal of Judy Garland's life. It holds your interest from beginning to end. A must read for all Judy and Hollywood fans alike. I also highly recommend the Tv movie on VHS or DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"A tender, loving, fascinating memoir","review":"What a wonderful book.

How sad is it that you have to dish the deepest secrets about your half-sisters highly personal problems to make some money. Pathetic. That this book ever got published, or even more unimaginable, be made into a mini-series is one of the biggest mysteries of all time. Lorna: shame on you."},{"rating":"2","title":"A really great, honest memory from Lorna Luft","review":"I thouroughly enjoyed this book. Ms. Luft confronts her childhood with a courageous honesty that makes you long to take her in your arms. If you are a fan of Judy Garland, you already know about the drug use, but what the addiction did to her family who loved her so desperately is heart wrenching. Lorna takes you through her own struggles with drugs as she was part of the Studio 54 scene and admits to her own battle with cocaine. I could hardly put it down. If you are a fan of Judy, Liza or Lorna, ( I am a fan of all three ) you cannot go wrong with this amazing book. I loved it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh...","review":"First few pages are well-written and engaging, and then it's down hill from there. Luft's tone is slightly self-aggrandizing, the book surprisingly sloppy in its editing, which makes it a less than satisfying read. Not much new material here, though the perspective is different from countless other Garland biographies. To give Luft her due, she was saddled with a crushing legacy, and all things considered, she has weathered it more successfully than her more famous sibling, Liza."},{"rating":"1","title":"I strongly do not reccomend it.","review":"This is indeed only my personal take on the book, but I think the entire thing is ridiculous. I am not going to bash Ms. Lorna luft because it is not my place, but I can say that I have no respect for her after reading it. While I sympathize with the fact that she had to grow up in ways most people could never imagine, I don't think she was very fair in the way she portrayed the entire situation to be. I think she made some very harsh comments, and while some are totally justifiable, some were totally unneccessary. If anyone that is a fan of either Judy Garland or Liza Minnelli wishes to read this book, I personally don't suggest in doing so. I had very good epectations in reading the book when I bought it, and was very sadly disappointed to the point that I had to stop reading. It had one or two cute family stories, but as far as being enjoyable to read, or even informational, I give it less than a zero."},{"rating":"1","title":"Typically poor transfer from Alpha","review":"An interesting Euro epic is given a poor presentation on this poor quality Alpha DVD. The color is faded and the picture is not at all sharp. The Goodtimes VHS tape was even better than this and it wasn't all that good. Too bad we will probably never seen a decent widescreen version of The Old Testament on DVD. These Italian Sword and Sandal movies can really look great if given the proper treatment."},{"rating":"2","title":"So deserved its Grand Jury Prize","review":"Unlike all the \\"live happily ever after\\" romance movies that end at the expectation of marriage, or movies that end with the couple finally making it down that aisle to eternal happines, this one tells it like it is. It contains a deep and universal truth. And so funny and sad and true and insightful. Savoca is a genius."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Bronx I know","review":"I am a transplant from New York to Connecticut. My husband and I wondered what Bronx this movie was about. One time there was a large Italian population around Pelham Parkway, but that was back in the 1960's. Over the years most Italians moved to Queens, Long Island or New Jersey. We couldn't figure out what time period this was supposed to represent. The Bronx changed colors from Italian and Irish to black.So for me this movie did not ring true. I did not see one black person in it. Not in the bars, or on the streets. I also could not understand why the bride didn't see her groom-to-be was a boy-man. He certainly showed that in his many promises to her to come back in an hour or so and then go out and get drunk with his friends.The acting was good. The music was terrific. However, because I felt the movie portrayed a Bronx that no longer exists, I wouldn't recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful Message on Communicating Honestly","review":"As a professional facilitator, I found this book to be a powerful message on communicating honestly with all people in our lives. Steven provides clear, concise insight into many of the issues that impede clear and honest communication. More importantly, he suggets specific techniques to deal with these barriers, as well as the perceptions that get in the way. He suggests thirty-seven strategies to confront difficult situations head-on and resolving issues through open, honest communication. I used several of his techniques with my workplace teams with extraordinary results. His own personal communication style is grounded in speaking honestly, and his writing style resonates with this value. I highly recommend this book to any one or group of people who want to improve their communications - honestly!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great device and a great deal.","review":"I bought this TV for my college dorm room. The HD capabilities of this TV are terrific, my Xbox games just flow off the screen, and dvd's look awesome too. Unfortunately, I don't have a HDTV receiver, so I can't watch TV in HD, but thats ok because the regular cable looks good on the screen. I also have the ability to connect my computer to the screen, but haven't had a chance to do so yet.There are a million input and output connections and the whole device is just really well designed. I've found that the included remote is well designed and easy to use. The only minor gripe about this TV is that the speakers aren't that great, which should be expected from a screen of this type, just the way laptops have notoriously bad speakers. Simple solution to the speaker problem: buy a speaker system or simply a sub-woofer and you should be fine, or connect it to your home theatre system.I'm really satisfied with this product, especially for the price I paid."},{"rating":"1","title":"TV Damaged - Lousy Customer Service","review":"I received a defective Philips TV - when I took it out of the box, I heard what sounded like a piece of metal rattling around inside the TV. I received three 33-page manuals (in 3 different languages)on how to use the remote control, but NOTHING about how to set-up the TV! I was able to attach the TV cable to this hunk of junk, but found that the SOUND wasn't working! After 3 hours on the phone talking with 3 different Philips customer service idiots (each time I called, I asked for a supervisor, and was promptly disconnected!), I was told to return the TV - at MY expense - to ARKANSAS, of all places! After this frustrating experience, my opinion of Philips (and their products) is sub-zero. I rated this item as a '1' because there is no '0'. I rate Philips, and their policy, as a 'minus 100'."},{"rating":"1","title":"firebird &les noces dvd","review":"well performed, great for the lover of CLASSIC ballet. shot on a very obvious childishly simple stage. the ballet is technically correct but dead. no tv effects were used. look at the newest \\"midsummer night's dream\\" dvd to see what can be done with video and a computer. this firebird dvd is well danced but boring. i think it is a terrible dvd of an exciting ballet. this is not the dvd to teach your kids to love ballet. sorry . i am so disappointed with this dvd that i am trying to return it.BORING,BORING,BORING."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outdated","review":"There was no information that the book was published in 1986.

Also, shipping is $2.00 higher when ordered from Amazon. What's going on??I'm sure the product is great. The one star rating is for the price change not the quality of the item. Toowoomba is well known for it's quality, and I've dealt with DownUnder before and know they are a good business with excellent products and customer service.I don't think I'll be automatically ordering from Amazon without close comparison with other sources anymore.

This book gives you some real insights into how an e-commerce web operation could work. There is no CD-ROM with this book but you can download the code for the projects from the WROX website."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent Book to start with","review":"I was new to the web technology and i think that i conquered it with this book in a month. It is an excellent book for starters and a good desktop reference. It is easy to understand and i am sure you will get what u want from this book.More examples and scenarios would have been better, but thats how it works (U don't get what u want !). Cheers--- Read ON......"},{"rating":"1","title":"For dummies and those who want real long and redundant infos","review":"I would suggest this book for folks only who are real beginners. For those who have been programming VB or C++ before or did some MS Access programming, this becomes pretty boring after you read 10%. A lot of information is overhead, too long and useless information. BTW: For those who are useing Win95/98 or NT Workstation can use PWS only, so at least 50% of the book it useless because you would need IIS, and therefore NT Server (e.g. for SMTP)."},{"rating":"2","title":"this is not a bad book for webmaster","review":"If there are more samples come with, I believe this book will become more helpful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"I do not agree with the follow revewer said. This is for the pro, not pre. What he expect? Tell you use the html tag? How to use and save the asp in web server? This book is for advance level. I brough the beginning, then this one. Both are greate book. Expecially the beginning one, cause I have brough the new rider and other publisher. None of those work for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much junk","review":"I bought this book on the recommendations of the reviewers on this site, but I must say I was gravely disappointed. Horrible, unclear presentation, tiny font, and just a lot of junk which I do not find useful. I suggest you read it in a bookstore before considering buying this expensive book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great reference! Highly recommended.","review":"If you only have one ASP reference, this is the one to buy. All the text I have read is clear and concise, with lots of good examples. The appendices themselves are worth most of the purchase price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Perfect, But Pretty Darn Close","review":"I like Wrox. But, then, I am a web developer, with the emphasis, much of the time, on developer. I like this book. It is part of my study collect, along with the Wrox Instant HTML and the Wrox IE4 DHTML.Yes, they have a few problems with some of their examples, etc., as pointed out by other readers, and for this reason, I should dock them a few stars. But, while they are not perfect, they are so much closer than any other book publisher I have come across so far.The Downside: If you are not a programmer/developer, you may find Wrox's books to be a bit difficult to get through. This one is a bit less programmer based, and thus more verbose, but still suffers from being a bit high-brow for the average reader. If you are a programmer, however, Professional ASP 2.0 is the way to go.I give it both thumbs up!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The \\"Bible\\" is back and it's even better","review":"Even if you own the 1st edition of the book, there's plenty to go in the 2nd edition which doubled in size. Like before the ASP/ADO coverage is phenomenal and the IIS4 new info highly useful. I liked the MTS additions. Get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"As good as ASP gets","review":"If you have read the first edition of this book, this second edition may look familiar. However, the book has more pages - about 1000 (edition 1 had about 600). There are several additions, especially topics on MTS and Message Queue, which are very good in themselves. \\"A case study in compatibility\\" is excellent guide for all, to develop for a varied set of browsers. A whole chapter is dedicated to transactions, a prelude to the chapters on E-Commerce case study and MTS.The best part is an extended reference at the end of the book, and this time JScript is also covered.I have a few comments about this book1. The book should have been thinner, with some chapters on CD-ROM2. You must be at intermediate level to use this book, else you could get lost easily. Beginners, don't yet touch this unless you know VBScriptIn short, without a doubt, the best book ever written on ASP."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would not recommend this book","review":"My thoughs are that this book is not well organized and assumes that you know everything about ASP before you even start reading the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitivamente un \\"debes tener\\"","review":"Desde los principios basicos del ASP hasta el desarrollo de todo un sitio de compras, pasando por los componentes y bases de datos. El siguiente paso sera la capa para el comercio electronico.Este libro se paga solo...!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall it's a wonderful book with some raw power behind.","review":"The book focus very much on all properties and objects within ASP wich makes it perfect for using as a reference but it also gives you a good overview of ASP. The only thing that stops me from giving it five stars is the sometimes difficult language wich can be hard to understand if you're not very proficient in english."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good in comparision","review":"The quality of ASP books is generally poor for anything but the simplist books, which makes the Wrox book the best of a bad breed.Book is weak on showing how to debug a component in IIS and MTS. It should go through a debugging session.ASP 3.0 is now available."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy This Book If You Are Working With JavaScript!!!","review":"The examples in this book do not work. The book states that it is for VBScript and JavaScript but most of the important examples are in VBScript. Chapter 4 does NOT have a single line of code in JavaScript!!! The book has errors. On page 154 it states to use the CreateObject for FileSystemObject in JavaScript but it doesn't work. I check the Microsoft help and it should be ActiveXObject instead. The book was not well writen. There probably is a better ASP book out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"ASP? Look No Further! You Found What You Need!","review":"If I could only have one ASP book on my deserted island, this would be it. Very Comprehensive. This book requires that you have at least some programming experience. If you don't have much experience, you'll still want this book handy for when you do. You'll go back to it time and time again! Without this book -> Picture yourself stumbling around blindly in the dark. With this book -> Picture yourself in paradise with The World at your feet!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much VBScript!","review":"Way too much VBScript was used in the examples. If you want to use JavaScript in your ASP code do NOT get this book. There is only enough JavaScript to let the authors get away with saying the book uses it. Also, one or more of these authors has horrendous English because it reads like someone who speaks with broken English. I wasted my money (and time!) on this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great ASP book","review":"I had no ASP experience before I ordered this book and it has been great. The database chapters are good, and there are plenty of code examples to try."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Book for ASP","review":"It's too bad that this technology is starting to get deprecated, because learning from this book was an honor. The book covers just about everything that you need to get up and running with ASP and the associated technologies addressed in the book. Although some of the reviews talk about this book not being for beginners, don't let this scare you. These reviews are true - this book is definitely not for the average guy who just got finished reading ASP for Dummies - but the authors do a great job of explaining things well without talking too high above the readers' head. Great Job WROX!"},{"rating":"2","title":"You won't out grow this book in couple of months.","review":"I purchased this book with one goal: to incorporate a database into a web site. With this book, the example code available on the WROX web site, and the Microsoft Developers web site, I was able to exceed my own expectations.I approached this task with solid HTML and Javascript skills but no background in ASP or VBscript and no other programmer to consult with. The answers are all there in concise, yet detailed explainations. If you would like to see what I was able to achieve, visit AccessDB.net.There is no fluff in this book. I would not recommend this book to a novice or casual web site developer. It is packed with detail that will quickly swamp you in technology that you have no intention of using. However, if you are serious about implementing ASP, Microsoft database technology and more, on an NT4.0 server, this is an excellent book that will remain useful for a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"An enjoyable reference!","review":"This book is clear and direct. No instructions of how to do simple tasks in Windows NT. If you don't know that, you shouldn't read this book. Also it puts ASP into a larger environment. After a while of reading one seems to get a grip of how Microsoft have planned their internet development strategy. And best of all one dosen't feel the need for yet another book about the subject. This one covers it all. At least for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Have You Tried the E-commerce Case Study?","review":"I bought this book and found out there's an E-Commerce case study. It does not work and the techo support was not helpful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good intentions, but not for me!","review":"I found this book pretty much useless in my work as a database programmer who recently adopted ASP. Lots of junk information. Presentation is extremely poor. Lots of errors in the code segments I examined. Don't understand why the other folks like it so much. My advice: read it before you buy this not-cheap book."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of The Worst","review":"I really can't believe people actually like this book!

Do yourself a favor, do not buy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"If your code like in this book you will be fired","review":"Book is poorly written, code samples (see Forum for example) are VERY badly written.

Their latest album is called THE BAND THAT REFUSED TO DIE. This was their third album which came out around 1994 or 95. It was an attempt by them to mature a little as songwriters instead of writing just sophomoric songs about bodily functions. The songs are well-crafted and they even added sax and keyboards on a number of tunes. This is out of print and well worth getting. Take a look at the band's website at www.deritasisters.com. They are still going strong and have improved greatly with age."},{"rating":"1","title":"9\\" skillet by la creuset","review":"I was a little disappointed.

The TV Guide function will not work with a cable box. (Their customer service admitted they were having big problems with this.) This makes it almost useless since you cannot even set it up to record while you are away. My advice, buy a TIVO."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Buy this product!","review":"After finally deciphering the product manual, I found this unit fun to operate, probably 'cause of the excitement over a new toy. I bought this unit mainly to record old VHS tapes to DVD. I had recorded about 12 hours of vhs tapes onto the hard drive and had started to edit by creating titles, erasing commercials, etc. when the unit froze up and wouldn't respond to the commands in the manual. I exchanged the machine for another of the same model. Again, with about 18 hours of material on the hard drive, I began the editting process once again. And once again, the unit froze and wouldn't respond to commands to rectify the situation as stated in the manual. Called Panasonic, they knew from nothing. Returned this product for a full refund. Both units had only been in use for 2 days before shutting down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good","review":"I have been using this recorder for three weeks , and I am very pleased. I like the flexible recording mode. If you have three hours of video, it will record it to a single disc and waste no space.Excellent picture quality.Recorded Discs will play on all dvd players. Panasonic is the leader in DVD recorders. They have more different models than any other brands at this time. This dvd recorder is a good solution for all you DVD recording needs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great advertising, but, short on honesty","review":"Were I to do it again, I would save myself several hundred dollars and insure the unit does not have the TV Guide BS. The hard drive recording sounds good, but what Panasonic does not tell you is: you MUST set up the TV Guide system, even if you do not have this feature, in order to use the manual timer recording; you will be without a television for 24 hours, if all your cable goes through a cable box while the recorder attempts to download the TV Guide; you can manually set up channels (although the set up guide gives poor instructions on doing this) but still not be able to timer record. It plays and records beautifully, but, I think better satisfaction could be had for less money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mine broke down 2 times for less than a year.","review":"The reason I chose Panasonic DVD recorder over other brand is that product is still made in Japan. Most of other DVD recorders now are made in China. I really fell in love with it when I first received it. This is my dream machine I have been yearning a long time ago, so I can retire my vcr. But six months later the machine broke down, I took it to Panasonic to have it service. The machine is still under guaranteed so I don't have to pay anything. Panasonic has good service. And a week ago my machine broke down again. I don't know if I can trust Panasonic DVD recorder anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great in the beginning, but you will end up unhappy","review":"From the minute we setup this unit, we fell in love with it. The progressive scan playback was supurb, the remote was well made and functional and the TV guide worked fine for us after the 24 hr wait time per the manual.After a couple of weeks, we noticed that you could not exit the TV guide as it would be \\"stuck\\" on the screen. As others said, you had to unplug the unit even to get it to work. Well this continued to the point where it was not usable anymore.I tried calling Panasonic, but didn't want to wait the time on the phone. I'm VERY glad I bought it from Amazon because they took it back with no questions asked and are refunding my money.It's really too bad that this unit has issues. Since most of these components are integrated, I would not risk getting one of these and \\"hope\\" it works since repair of the unit isn't really an option. Either it works or it doesn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"A downgrade from the E80H","review":"The good things about this recorder is that it can burn a DVD in up to 8x faster than real speed and that the database can hold 54 and a half hours in the SP mode as compared to 36 and a half the E80H model did. The bad things about this recorder which makes this a terrible purchase is that the TV Guide listings have never worked even after shutting off my recorder for 36 hours, since the TV listings they had were incompatible with my cable service. Also the machine frequently freezes making this machine idle. You can not record two programs back to back since the second program will never record since the machine records the first program for a minute extra which overlaps the second program and cancels the recording. A best bet is to hunt down the E80H and buy that and buy the E85 if you want an expensive time piece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally changed the way I watch TV","review":"I have had this unit for well over a year. It has really changed the way I watch TV. Sometimes I sit down on a Sunday and scan the TV guide for channels I like for the week ahead. The machine records these on the hard drive. At my convenience, I watch the shows. Naturally, I speed through the commercials. Most often, I erase the show after watching. However, it is something I want to save, I either leave it on the huge hard drive or dub it to a disc. I hope the price will come down so that I can buy another one for another room in the house."},{"rating":"1","title":"SELF CHECK ON MY PANEL","review":"This product started out really well, however, I was disappointed because it doesn't download Satellite only \\"cable.A few days ago I was recording and notice that the Self Check is on my panel and I cannot operate machine.I called Panasonic for 3 days and to no avail was just put on hold and hung up on.This machine is only 2 months old so I notice that it started getting bad about 6 weeks after I started using it."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE if you are in Denver/Boulder - no TV Guide listings","review":"I have owned this unit for nearly two years, have called customer support several times (they are friendly and fairly knowledgeable) and have never been able to use TV Guide listings because of an apparent incompatibility with Comcast's signal and this unit. Now, I can \\"rent\\" a DVR unit from Comcast that DOES work with their TV Guide signal (a Panasonic even!) but I dislike the idea of getting rid of this unit after investing a decent amount of $$ into it. If it weren't for this major problem, I'd be very happy with the unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor product","review":"I own the DMR-E85H and have experienced many frustrations with it.1) You can only schedule 8 shows. What is the point of having such a large recording capacity when you can't record all that you want?2) When adding a 9th show to be recorded one of the first 8 is randomly deleted. Be careful or you will miss your favorite shows.3) Sometimes a show is just deleted from your recording schedule for no apparent reason. Forget about setting it and forget it, if you want something recorded you have better check that it actually is.All this really is to me is an overpriced DVD player.Even though it hasn't broken like so many others listed in here, it doesn't even come close to the potential it could of had if Panasonic actually put any thought into it."},{"rating":"1","title":"U99 Error Messages","review":"I, too, have had many problems with this unit since it was purchased in January 2005. I've called Panasonic so many times that I don't even bother any more because the wait is so long and they are absolutely no help and sometimes even rude. They ask the same questions over and over until I actually start feeling intimidated. They assume everything that you report is YOUR error, not the recorder's. Now the U99 message pops up randomly and resetting according to the Owner's Manual does no good - it just happens again, so we never get any listings. Panasonic did refer me to a \\"local\\" dealer for repair, but the \\"local\\" dealer happens to be over 100 miles away. Big help.

Unfortunately, I was disappointed in this offering. Although I only ordered a quantity of one, I was shipped 5 copies of this pamphlet (I believe the 5 copies is a quantity of one). The pamphlet itself is a typical Kreeft-styled dialogue between Sonny (whose Catholic faith is bright) and Dusty (who has drifted from the Church). Although the pamphlet briefly gives excellent reasons to re-examine lost faith, it caters to \\"Mere Christianity\\", not Catholicism. The title might lend one to think that Kreeft was going to explore the Holy Mother Church, but not here. Overall, this is not quite up to par for Kreeft."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb and succinct intro","review":"This is the best book I've read in the CodeNotes series and a superb introduction to ASP.NET. The CodeNote authors have really mastered their craft by now and it shows with this book. All major aspects of ASP.NET are covered including security, caching, web forms, and session storage. What is most impressive about this book is how well written it is, which makes it easy to digest all the new technical topics.

Earlier she was very angry and unhappy.Near the end of the film the girl was allowed to boss the grandfather around,making her look superior and the grandfather look stupid -- too much of this intoday's films and TV shows.Overall, the movie is not worth seeing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Movie typical of Hollywood, U.S.A.","review":"This movie had great actors and a lot of promise. The script writers wrecked the plot about half way through the movie. Belle (Vivien Cardone) is an misguided teenager because she believes her father spoke to the doctors and approved of euthanasia. Later she finds out this is not the case. This is one of your typical Hollywood movies today which show parents and even grandparents aren't too bright and the children are the only ones all-the-brains. By the end of the movie she has pretty much showed everyone their life mistakes and made the world a great place. Not a good movie to show your children sends the wrong message concerning parent-children interactions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as I expected, and I did not expect much!","review":"I just rented and watched this movie, and I was disappointed. The actors are pretty good, but there are very few(if any) endearing characters. There is a whole lot of discussion about Euthanasia(putting animals to sleep) which adds a very dark element to the film. This film will be very confusing for children! Peter Coyote plays a very angry character. The movie drags on and on and on. This is not the worst movie I've see, but I definitely don't suggest you buying it. If you are really interested rent it like I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"I couldn't watch the whole movie...","review":"...it was so awful! Like another reviewer said, it has nothing to do with a girl and her horse. It's a jumble of loosly-related stories, with really bad acting and scenes which seem like they don't belong with the rest.

In the case of this book, mere suspension didn't help. As a poet, the author places importance and meaning on poetry. He attempts to drag you into the pond with him, but offers little in the way of HOW you might do this or WHAT you might receive from it.

I couldn't believe how complicated they made this classic game! There's at least 10 buttons on the gun: trigger, shields, ammo reload, \\"option\\", sound on/off, indoor/outdoor, \\"2nd F\\"?, and like 5 others underneath an LCD screen. All I wanted was to put batteries in this thing and watch my cousins shoot each other. Instead I had to spend 15 minutes reading the instruction manual. And there was no off switch either for me to reset the game and start over (to follow the instructions). The youngest was getting frustrated because he was holding down the the reload button which wouldn't let him fire. He was actually crying saying, \\"This doesn't work!\\".All I wanted was the simple classic Laser Tag from my childhood: turn on and shoot. Not to say that this game isn't fun for older kids. In my opinion, though, Hasbro has gone way overboard and ruined a perfectly good game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terror In The Ashes","review":"Great book and great story with a great action sequence.

Sadly I resorted to just taking drywall screws & hanging my broom & stuff like that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Physics wins the day","review":"I find this product very poor. The anchors that come with it are hardly capable of doing what they are supposed to do; that is, hold up 3 mops, brooms or a combination of the two. I have bought this product twice. Each time, within a week or two, it collapses and everything ends up on the floor. I think, no matter how good your installation, this thing is not designed well.Take the screws for example.. The screw sockets are practically inaccessible by any tool that doesn't have at least 6\\" extension that is at most 5mm wide! So you need a very thin and long Phillips, or an adequate extension for your drill. I have found that it is impossible to get a screwdriver in those holes and still be able to provide the proper torque to get the screws into the anchors.What moron designed this? At least ship the thing with anchors that can do the job and make the screws humanly accessible!!!This thing sucks sucks sucks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Careful on tightening the screws","review":"The first time I tightened the screws they broke through Had to use longer ones and a washer.

Here is the remix that would put Whitney on the map on club America and would introduce the world to Thunderpuss, one of the most sought-after remixers today. The boys give the song the energetic, danceable groove Whitney's voice demands, and the end result will leave you amazed. For 1998 and 1999, it was impossible to go clubbing without hearing this remix. I'd dare say it's more popular than the original version itself! People, this mix is smokin'! Don't miss! Treat yourself to one of the most vital club jams of the 1990s."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whitney's latest single is hopefully the worst on her CD","review":"I don't know but when I think of Whitney I think of the lovely \\"Bodyguard Soundtrack\\", the nice 80's and first half of the 90's songs. But this song is (in my opinion) so unimaginative. Always the same and so boring. And the video is ridiulous, too. She's certainly done much better songs, this one is very modest."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the best single remix CD, that I've heard!","review":"This is the best single remix CD that I've heard in a long time. Since Toni Braxton's \\"Unbreak My Heart\\" dance remix. I think Whitney should market herself more as a singer of dance music tunes. Nobody can beat her! If you heard the Heartbreak Hotel dance mix, then I'm pretty sure you'll feel the same way about the Thunderpuss Mix...Rodney Jerkins gives a more Smooth Beat to \\"It's Not Right But It's Okay\\", but unsurprisingly his remix doesn't bring out the song; but you can relax to it! And nothing, I mean nothing, tops the \\"I will always love you\\" dance remix. I'll tell you now, if you're looking for the radio version, then go and buy the MY LOVE IS YOUR LOVE CD, but if you are looking for more variety, something to dance to, or something to work-out to, please buy this single! Why miss a classic like \\"I will always love you\\"!

This one even has some good dramatic tension near the end between Schroeder and the girls who always pick on Charlie Brown that brings out all the pathos of Peanuts, and the way Charlie Brown cuts through the conflict you can't help but feel sorry for him. I'm docking this DVD release one star because it probably should've included the more recent Peanuts Valentine special that I believe originally aired in 2002, but now it may never be seen on any official release.UPDATE: The second Valentine special does have it's own DVD now: \\"A Charlie Brown Valentine.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"A great classic!

The DVD has heavy Christian overtones. The first words of the first segment, which is supposed to be about the civilization of Mesopotamia, are: \\"The Garden of Eden...\\" It goes on to indicate it is inspired by an investigation into proving the stories of the Bible are true. I watched further and discovered the theme to be sustained enough to make it not useful for my purposes. The narrator, for instance, refers to time periods according to their proximity to, \\"...the time of Jesus...\\"In a Christian school, or for Christians home-schooling, this would probably be good material for a social studies class, but it doesn't work in a secular school with students representing the full array of the world's faiths and cultures."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for History Classes","review":"This DVD set is truly a great treasure a world history class. I really wanted a DVD set which covered all the ancient civilizations and this set does that superbly. The only ancient civilization it doesn't cover is Ancient Japan. Each 50 minute segment covers the culture, history and religion of an area but with a specific investigative perspective. This DVD set is very informative and interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Teachers beware","review":"I purchased these as instructional DVDs for my World History Class. So far, I have not been able to use them. In my opinion, although the information is interesting and I enjoyed them, the information is not presented in a format designed for the modern classroom. In fairness to the videos, they were produced before the National Standards were implemented, and as such don't really follow the curriculum. I've watched Mesopotamia and Egypt since receiving the videos. Mesopotamia dealt primarily with the concept of Eden and relied heavily on the Bible, and Egypt focused almost exclusively on archaeology in the 1800s, mummies, and had a 20 second scene with a topless woman, whose purpose I still haven't deduced. I'm disappointed because I had hoped these would be great visual aids for the classroom, but I won't be able to use them. Teachers beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BUY THIS!","review":"I made the mistake of buying this collection for my middle school based on the favorable reviews here. What a terrible waste of money. The Mesopotamia DVD is not about Mesopotamia, rather it's a feeble attempt to prove the stories of the Christian bible. Not at all suitable for public school, and not a good source of information. The Egyptian DVD has very little to tell the viewer about Ancient Egypt's lost civilization, but instead uses tired stock footage black and white film clips to tell the stories of tomb robbers of the 19th and 20th centuries. The movies sent my students and I to sleep, and I am very sorry that I wasted my money on this junk. I recommend instead the excellent \\"Engineering an Empire\\" from the History Channel, which is very informative, well made and interesting to both students and teachers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lost Civilazations Review","review":"Time Life's Lost Civilizations, 4 DVD's How enlightening!

This completely ignores the fact that the law was given through Moses much much earlier. This is really messed up. If you are thinking of using this to supplement homeschooling, and you believe the bible to be the inspired Word of God, please be aware of this. I'm 30 minutes into it and the overriding theme thus far is that the archeological evidence for the biblical events are showing the historical events to be true, but other than that all the ideas were based on their influence by pagan culture, namely Babylonian."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book Description (from the back cover)","review":"Remembering is an act of imagination. There, reduced to a single sentence, is the principle that underlies this book.For several thousand years people have believed that remembering retrieves information stored somewhere in the mind. The metaphors of memory have always been metaphors of storage: We preserve images in wax; we carve them in stone; we write memories as with a pencil on paper; we file memories away; we have photographic memories; we retain facts so firmly they seem held in a steel trap. Each of these images proposes a memory warehouse where the past lies preserved like childhood souveniers in an attic. This book reports a revolution that has overturned that vision of memory. Remembering is a creative, constructive process. There is no storehouse of information about the past anywhere in our brain ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"what the hell is happening!","review":"Okay I am fifty years old and started to read the destroyer books in high school.These books were defined by the characterizations and social commentary.

It's as though someone asked Quentin Tarentino to guest-pen a book or two. The relationship between Remo and Chiun isn't right; the treatment of the blossoming relationship between Sarah Slate and Mark Howard is trivialized; the plot just plods along in predictable fashion; and the past is glossed over.If you're a die-hard Destroyer fan, you'll want to read it, but if not, buy some of the books pre-110 or so from Amazon's used section."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Tim's best, by far!","review":"Okay, I realize I'm in the vast minority here, but I'm a fan of the Destroyer series since 1985, and I'm not nearly as annoyed by Mr. Somheil's efforts as most. Having said that, this book was not his best work at all.I think if this book had been written as a 180-page Destroyer novel, it might've worked, but there's so much padding and unnecessary side-trips that this reader nearly lost interest. A shame too, as this is a rather pivotal book in the series, with lots of threads getting addressed in this story. I loved Remo and Chiun in this book. I don't even mind the new member of CURE--hell, eventually someone is going to have to show up for Remo to train in Sinanju.

It is somewhat like the photo that is advertised, but it has no finished edges or seams. The photo looks much nicer and of better quality. The mask that came with the costume is not the same as pictured either. The mask also came so mashed that it did not even look like yoda. There are creases in the mask that I don't think will ever come out. I feel this costume is false advertising as the picture advertised and on the package does not match what is inside the package. Another frustration is that the tag on the cloak is on the side of the seam, so it is hard to hide it when the costume is being worn. The tag would have been much better on the back or the side seam.

The film makers took a first class noir film that was up there with Body Heat and House Of Games and came up with a ludicrous sequel that does not have one original cast member. Linda Fiorintino gave a five star performance in The Last Seduction. Putting Joan Severance in the same role is like replacing Meryl Streep in Sophie's Choice with Cindy Crawford. It can be done, but is ANYBODY (well maybe one person, it did get one good review) going to believe it? The dialogue is ridiculous and unbelievable and if possible, the acting is even worse. The original movie had you on the edge of your seat. This one does also, but not for the same reason. In the original you couldn't wait to see what would happen next. In the sequel you can't wait for it to be over. Downright painful. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"More wooden than a lumberyard","review":"Last Seduction/Last Seduction II wins the title of 'Greatest Original/Worst Sequel' hands down. Severence manages to at least look like Bridgett/ Wendy, but thats about a far as it goes. The fact that no one from the original movie participates in the sequel begs the question; Could I decide to make a movie entitled 'Godfater part IV' without the consent of Francis Ford Coppola? It looks like that is what happened here. The only borderline clever part of the whole movie is when one character has a hotel televison on, the original movie is seen on the screen. Be warned, this movie B-L-O-W-S."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie shouldn't have been made...","review":"or at least given the same title as the classic by John Dahl. The first movie was great; at one point it was my favorite movie of all time! But Joan Severance tried to make a, I guess, serious movie and boy was that a bad idea. I knew that when seeing this movie that I wasn't getting the origional, but I at least expected to see Joan Severance in a sex fest. Not even that! I was real excited to see Joan Severance get it on again because I hadn't seen her in a while. So I guess I have to wait some more. This is off the topic, but Joan Severance's best role was in a soft core porn called Almost Pregnant. It was totally funny and totally hot.

It delves into a topic cited widely in management literature, but seldom covered in depth.Frameworks for describing and explaining power in business are suggested, with numerous illustrations.My only disappointments with the book are (a) the lack of empirical generalisations as a basis for the framework (in the HBR style, anecdote counts more than empirical generalision) and (b) the absence of practical advice on what to do with the framework.Nevertheless, this is still a unique contribution to a very important subject and it is highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed!","review":"I'm writing a book review for the first time, because I was quite disappointed with this book even though I had read all of the several reviews posted here before hand. I think the reviews here don't represent the true value of this book.In short, this book is a lot of bits and pieces of episodes that do not really lead to any theory or takeaway. I kept hoping til the end that something worth remembering would come up.I would recommend this book to someone fresh out of college who needs basic understanding of corporate politics, but definitely not to any of my friends with work experience (5+ years?).I decided to buy this book because I had not taken any power and influence related courses during my MBA studies in the US. I had kept all the syllabi of all courses offered at my school and I was catching up on some textbook readings for the courses I hadn't taken.

About three of every four examples and case studies sited in this book are negative. For every point the author wishes to expound upon, he finds an example of some manager/executive using his power to waste company resources, commit outright fraud, pursue personal vendettas or tamp down progress in the name of that holy grail \\"Power\\". This is the type of jackassery and manipulation that causes companies to fail spectacularly, screwing over their stockholders and employees in the process, or at a bare minimum fall behind in R&D because some executive has become obsessed with his own power and has no tolerance for the question of his authority."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Book!","review":"This Book Has Halped Me Travel More Often, And Enjoy The Flight Even Mor Than Ever Before.

They worked o.k., but were a little tight on us (although we're not overweight at all!) so we decided to go for an oversized style made for really cold weather. These bags are so comfortable and warm we sleep in them even when we're not camping! (That's because we live at 7,000 feet altitude in Mexico and don't have central heat.) So, if you're claustrophobic these bags are perfect since you can turn over inside them and the zippers are easy to open so you can get out in a hurry. I don't really know if they'll keep you warm at -30, but I think 0 degrees is a good bet."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best .","review":"Pieces is a pretty good movie even tho' is was a low budget movie.

Eli Roth has it in his top five movies of all time (when interviewed by Rotten Tomatoes). The death scenes are fantastic. The killer is a classic. I could watch this movie over and over again. It won't give you nightmares or make you look under the bed before going to sleep, but this movie is just plain fun to watch. Just give it a try; even better, watch it after Tenebre and Deep Red for the full effect. This is a movie for horror movie fans but can be enjoyed by just about anyone. Extremely high replay value, in fact I am wishing I owned it right now!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Gloriously gory but incurably dumb","review":"Let's face it: If you intend to buy or rent \\"Pieces,\\" you're not looking for the cinematic version of a Dostoevsky novel. However, you might be looking for something that contains just the tiniest bit of gray matter. Lotsa luck. \\"Pieces\\" is a spectacular piece of gross-out cinema (sensitive viewers should keep barf bags handy), but it is also dumber than one might consider to be humanly possible: clumsy plotting, terrible dialogue, universally bad acting. Ed Wood was equivalent to Akira Kurosawa compared to the geniuses who made this masterpiece. You can feel your IQ sinking as you watch. By the second hour, you'll be lucky if you can still pass a first-grade equivalency exam."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great release for a very gory plotless movie","review":"Disgustingly gory horror movie that has no real story/plot or it is just unclear. It is about a kid who killed in the past that grows up to be a person who likes to chop up bodies and make human jigsaw puzzles - at least I think that was the implication. It is not really clear what is going on with the killer and his hacking up bodies. Nothing is really explained clearly why he is a warped killer and enjoys hacking up bodies.There is no body to this story other than our killer chopping up bodies on a college campus with looks of horror as people see the cut of body pieces. Some graphically gory films are done in taste, while stuff like this is really just brutally bad & sickening. Gore lovers will enjoy this, even if the plot is thin & the acting is just 'whatever'. This DVD transfer from Grindhouse as as clean as it gets in the USA. Substandard acting & story, but really just a gross out slasher movie. Not for everyone. Very gory, but also very weak."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie really suck like white on rice!!!","review":"I did not get the whole concept of this movie.I thought it was good, but when I saw the movie I was HORRIFIED!!!

This book purports to be in the second category, but I can tell you, as a beginner, I got nothing out of it.There is very little English describing how to excel; rather the author gives you games to look at as examples and you, the reader, are supposed understand the brilliance behind the moves. For me, this is not enough: I need a tour guide to show me the sights, not just a taxi driver to take me to them. I'm guessing that very good players don't need such hand-holding, hence my title for this review.One reviewer suggested that you will like this book if you like Rowson's \\"The Seven Deadly Chess Sins\\".

What skills would you contribute to the world without a computer and ATM card? I liked the point Stirling made that although the world was thrust back into the pre-gunpowder and electricity days, people were still modern.

If a book makes me think about the situation and characters after I put it down, then it rates 5 starts."},{"rating":"2","title":"A few flaws, but overall a good read","review":"Definitely an interesting spin on the post-apocalypse theme. A little disappointing in that the reason for \\"The Change\\" is never explained, only suggested or implied. Also found it a little far-fetched that the main characters resigned themselves to their fate so quickly. There was also a lot of redundancy with the characters reiterating the same conclusions about the state of the world. Oh, and it definitely made me ponder how truly useless I would be under the same circumstances :) Aside from that, I was fully engrossed and look forward to continuing the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Coulda Been Really Great","review":"Here's a book that has a great premise and interesting characters, but was poorly executed. The author jumps back and forth introducing multiple characters, and skips big chunks of critical action. I actually checked page numbers to see if I had a misprinted copy and missed something.There's also some incredible coincidences that stretch belief even within the realm of a fantasy/science fiction genre. The fact that several groups of random strangers who meet all possess rare and improbable skills such as blacksmithing, swordsmithing, archery, and bowmaking was just too much."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am in the \\"liked half of this book\\" camp.","review":"The parts of the story that involved Havel were probably 250% better than the parts with Juniper.I tried desperately to like this book more; I simply couldn't stomach the wicca parts. I literally start skipping over the chapters that invovled Juniper and her people. It isn't that I have a problem with wicca (anymore than I have a problem with christianity or any other religion); I just didn't like how it was mentioned every other word. It was almost embarrassing reading all the \\"thanks earth mother for the deer that we just shot with a bow\\" stuff.All in all, I don't think I would suggest this book to any of my friends unless they were really desperate for something to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good book, but it could have been SO much better.","review":"Don't get me wrong, I like Stirling, but this was not his best work. The central plot was great, but all too often I had to just ignore the glaring coincidences that happened to the characters (\\"Oh, look we just found an ex-SAS member who just happens to make long-bows in his spare time!\\") I mean, come on! Within a couple chapters the main characters have surrounded themselves with the exact kind of people one would want in such a crisis. Way too convenient.... And don't get me started on that annoying character Juniper! All the wiccan stuff makes you want to laugh. If you want a great end-of-the-world story go read The Stand by King or Swan Song by McGammon. Those books won't disappoint you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huh?","review":"I choose my books carefully because I have a bit of an obsession...I have to finish a book before I start another. The premise and the first 100 pages (or so) was interesting albeit well beyond belief. Things came to a screeching halt about 3/4 of the way through. I painfully pushed myself to read the last couple hundred pages. To whom is this book intended? Dungeons and Dragons fans? Renaissance Faire junkies? It was hard to finish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terribly contrived book","review":"While the idea behind this book was sound, the storyline is laughable.People would frequently find the one person who knew how to construct British longbows, or stumble upon the only guy who knows how to fix a particular type of engine REQUIRED for survival. A few of these coincidences are acceptable, but once they begin stacking up (and they do stack up), the book goes from a good idea to a contrived mess, strung together by life-saving coincidences."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had Potential","review":"This book had so much potential for a story line- what would happen if all technology suddenly failed? Instead, Stirling made it poorly developed, rather ridiculous, and highly predictable. Yes, I realize that science fiction isn't supposed to be like real life, but it's the good writers who have the gift to make you think that this world is real or could really happen. Stirling just doesn't have that gift. If you're considering this book, I'd say spend your money on something better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"Stupid premise. Uninteresting characters. Boring. Bad writing style. Felt utterly contrived. A waste of a couple of hours. Be warned.

Still trying to get the taste out of my mouth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed","review":"This book had a great premise and did not deliver on it at all.There was never any attempt to explain the event that stopped technology (there was even talk about 'aliens' messing around with us). That's OK, skip the details and spend page after page going on and on about wikens and how misunderstood, infallible and noble they are. Oh, and also introduce a few Christians and make them totaly cartoonish and flawed. Throw in some cannibals because that is part of the formula for the end of the world, you know. The further I read, the sillier it got. When the opposing armies were maneuvering on bicycles, I nearly lost it!After about 100 pages, I speed read the rest and then tossed it in the trash can. I don't know who SM Stirling is, but he won't be getting anymore of my hard earned money!The only good thing about this book was that it got me to thinking that I could be an author after all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting story, and thats where it ends.","review":"As all the other negative reviews have stated, this is one absolutely annoying novel to read. Im halfway through, and I will finish it, but I will not be picking up any of the others in the series. Im all for strong female characters, but could you make them more believable? I just dont buy that a random 18 year old girl can go from being an average teen to a master swordfighter in a month. Or that city dwellers can instantly become master farmers. Or that every 3rd person is a blacksmith, a bowyer, or a horse trainer. Also, I encourage you to record how many times the main Wicca character says \\"Oh Goddess\\". You will likely lose count in the hundreds. I dont buy that sandal wearing hippie being able to organize and lead an entire community, and turn a conveniently placed ex-SAS member (who is also a bowyer) into a loyal follower of her band of misfits. Ugh, what a horrible novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't Be Finishing","review":"I can't add much to the extraordinarly humorous and spot-on one-star reviews here, except to say that I agree with them wholeheartedly. I'm only 70 pages into this book, and I am SICK of it. All the Wicca BS, the sudden descent into savagery--yes, it's a RenFaire celebration. Let's all grab the swords we know how to use and for some reason have stocked, and run for the hills.My sister recommended \\"Meeting at Corvallis\\" to me; I found that this novel was the first in the trilogy, so that's why I checked it out and thankfully did not buy it. I may try that last book though, and hope it's better than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful, awful","review":"It's not a bad premise for a \\"What If?\\" book. But Stirling's book becomes really irritating very quickly.Every character (even whole-foods, health-conscious, hoodoo-voodoo females) is a medieval weapons expert!Whenever someone brandishes a blade, we get a paragraph on the shape, the tang, the grip, the historical uses, etc., etc.Sheesh, this guy needed an editor, badly -- someone who could have told him \\"Stirling, leave the knife hobby at home !\\"I only got about 2/3 of the way through this one, then gave the book away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Good","review":"This was a great read ... hard to put down to use a reviewer's cliche but dang it was true.Not without its faults such as the often stiff dialogue that characterizes all of the author's books, or of course the laughably corny wiccans that others have noted. Still, these concerns don't detract from what is a ripping-paced, action-oriented story.Coincidences? Sure, happening upon crates of multivitamins, in addition to all the experts in ancient technology one would want (\\"oh look, there's an injured man in need of our help ...what do you know! He's also is an ex-british special forces type who makes longbows as a hobby! How handy!\\"), strains reality. But come on, am I the only one who noticed that what the author may be using as explanation is a cosmic realignment, where those of certain faiths and practices get what they need? This is alluded to and just one possible explanation.Good book, but not as good as Mitchell Smith's Snowfall trilogy which is in same category, and very different."},{"rating":"1","title":"Talk about biased.","review":"Now lets get something straight first: I am not a conservative person. I am quite liberal and I try to understand everyone's point of view. However, within the first few pages this author compared a cat to a Republican. I know that doesn't sound like much and I personally don't agree with Republicans but still...Do I have to be fed stupid biased comparisons when all I want to do is sit down and read a book for enjoyment? I don't need that even if I do agree with his side. Then you add all the Wiccan's being great and Christians evil and I got mad again. I dont even like Christians. Oh man, don't buy this book if your nit-pick things like I do. If you don't then you might like this book but I don't know because I threw it angrily after a few pages. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful adventure - Suspend Belief","review":"I enjoyed this book for what it is not for what my fellow reviewers seemed to think it should be. This is a story, a tale in the ancient sense of what would happen if the technological crutches we all so depend on were suddenly removed.Read it as a story of heroes and villians and how they survived in a world rolled back to medevil technology. How woul you do?"},{"rating":"2","title":"How did this book get such mediocre reviews?! It was excellent!!!","review":"I absolutely loved this book and this series, or at least the trilogy. I understand there are other books that have side stories off of this one but I couldn't find them because I couldn't remember the name & author of this. ( not because it is not memorable but because I have a problem with my memory.) I was reading another review and the reviewer compaired that book to this (favorably of course) one. This was a wonderful story. I don't get the mixed reviews but I guess the world is full of different people. EXCELLENT READ!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sticks with you","review":"Well, I loved it. Archetypal characters, an arresting premise, and fantastic battle writing. I've recommended this book more often than any other in recent memory, along with the sequels, Protector's War and Meeting at Corvallis. Four and a half stars, certainly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Next time a little less Wiccan","review":"I read a lot of apocalyptic books, and this one had a lot of promise, however whenever it shifted over to Juniper and the Wiccan characters, I was about to scream, \\"ENOUGH!\\" As characters, they weren't bad, but the constant references to Wiccan, Lord, Lady, making signs, blah, blah, blah. It became as irritating as The Lord of the Rings' constant references to the languages of the Elves, and their songs. Just not necessary. On the other hand, the Bearkillers were very interesting. Not a bad read, but I won't check out the rest of the trilogy."},{"rating":"2","title":"readable, if not beleivable","review":"I would much rather Mr. Stirling had occupied his time with writing another sequel in the Island in the Sea of Time series, or a sequel to Conquisador. But the book was still a good read. I suppose it's going to be what you call a collateral series with Island. It was thoroughly enjoyable, just not very credible, and not what I was expecting as his latest offering to the Sci-fi gods."},{"rating":"2","title":"Basic Premise","review":"The premise of suddenly stopping electricity (in wire?) overlooks the fact that static electricity (remember lightning) and magnetism are all part of the same phenomena. The nerves of our bodies also run on electricity (remember Giovanni's frogs legs?) If there is no magnetism, how does the sailing ship in The Protector's War navigate so readily?A more realistic novel following the failure of electricity, as caused by EMP is \\"One Second After\\".A similar concept was shown in James Burke's TV program \\"Connections\\" which started with the electric power failure in the NE States sometime in the sixties. His logic, following the failure of electricity, lead him back to the plough!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dies the Fire","review":"Excellent book.Ended up reading the whole series.Premis was what would happen if some mysterous force shut down all forms of electrical power.The consequences in this book are quite interesting in that what's left of civilization returns to the technology of 1100AD"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Trees","review":"I read the book. Was bored to tears.I also found it strange that there were apparently hundreds of people who were well acquainted with anachronistic forms of medieval combat but there were ABSOLUTELY ZERO martial artists (except for the one that Mike beat up in his reminiscing). This was 1998 America - so this was before MMA became all the rage, but there still should have at least been a few Karate or TKD people, even as \\"red shirts\\".And as for the cannibalism...he lost me when the heroes found a doctor who was about to become dinner. It was clear that he felt that the book needed some black-and-white bad guys and settled on zombie-esque cannibals. I mean, no one would have tried to eat a doctor. They would hold him captive, yes. Force him to treat them, yes. But he would not be killed for food when there are plenty of accountants, salesmen, and data analysts who have no marketable skills in the post-change world mucking about.Just garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dies the Fire","review":"I had just finished reading \\"The Road\\" and wanted to read more books in the genre so I picked up Dies the Fire. I don't think this was the best choice. I could only get through about 120 pages before I realized that this was a waste of my time.It started out with promise, but then quickly went downhill. The character Juniper was just painful!. The whole Wicca aspect got real old real fast. The book could have been shortened by 50 pages if they got rid of half of the Blessed Be aspects.I also found it unbelievable how everyone just happened to accept their fate and jumped back into a medieval state so quickly. I was in NYC for the Blackout of 2003, the way this book made it out I guess we should have been panicking and killing each other with broad swords in the streets. Instead we hung out on the porches and sidewalks and had a beer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have been called \\"Dies the Story\\"","review":"In all my years of reading there have been very few books I've left unfinished, even if they were bad. This one came very close. A mysterious \\"something\\" causes a blinding flash that not only ruins all electronics and electrical items but changes the chemical nature of gunpowder and steam compression. Which means that those who've spent their time at SCA meetings finally have an edge on the rest of society. Lots of hacking and maiming with swords and BS about Wicca. Yay. Dies the Interest is another title I'd have given this novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Beginning of an Overlong Series","review":"I have been a fan of Mr. Stirling's work for a long time, but this...

It would be very helpful to note that in the listing.I bought this to play on in my car during a long road trip, without buying an MP3 player, car-converter, and having my computer handy to reformat these disks, this product was useless to me.It may be a GREAT book, I'm just not happy I have to juggle formats to find out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great concept but poorly executed","review":"This book like all of stirlings books sound like a great read.They would be to if you could cut out all the excess descriptive parts.You need some description but he goes way overboard with it to the point that it detracts from the story.That coupled with the extra small print on the page is intimidating.I started reading this book and after 35 pages was getting eye strain.The book has 483 pages filled with very small print and my eyes were hurting after only 35 pages so I gave it up.I could have understood the 483 pages if the print was larger but with all the excess discription and normal size print this book would have been around 600 to 700 pages.Jose Farmer and several other scifi authors could have written this same story in 350 pages of readable size print and the over all story would have been better for it.I was looking forward to reading all stirlings work but now I think I will let them pass.MY LOSS!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Starts nice, gets boring in middle part, zzz at the end","review":"The book starts really nice and tense at the beginning with the eerie apocalypse feel to it.No one knows what is going on, why things are happening and everyone is scrambling to save themselves.But that is it, after 1/4 of the book, something dies - and its not just a character - the story no longer interests anyone - even the characters are bored of the events that happen.When I reached 3/4 of the book, I just started skipping hoping for something to happen - nope, nothing there... skip this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst sci-fi books I ever read","review":"This book starts with an intrigue concept but the actual execution is a totally different matter.The author's writing style is sloppy and dry. Characters are at best two dimentional and you don't really care much whether they live or die. The technical aspects of the book is borderline hilarious. So You need some technical minded experts in a particular situation? boom, they poped out from middle of nowhere and get it done.After 100 pages or so, I threw it away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Churning out anything to make a living...","review":"Mr Stirling is a talented sf writer. He proved it abundantly with the Draka sequence, very well written.Unfortunately, like all writers, he has to make a living even when his muse keeps silent.Dies the fire is the result: throw together a condition which is difficult to believe [for no reason at all, every machine stops working AND explosives do not explode any more], some half-baked research on Wiccan neo-witches, a dash of \\"good\\" survivalist theories and you'll get this book.It is excruciatingly slow, is not very original in a bleak depiction of a post-apocalypse US, it does not make you think and quite obviously is hijacked to pull you to buy the second volume.Don't even begin with this: you might be very disappointed.ThufirHawat"},{"rating":"1","title":"Left \\"Science\\" Out Of The Science Fiction","review":"I just read this, having purchased it off a remnants table at a local bookstore. I was intrigued with the premise as I, too, enjoy apocalyptic fiction. Of course, the first thing one needs in apocalyptic fiction is an apocalypse. Sadly, the one here is not believable in the slightest: A storm of some sort wipes out the functioning capacity of all things electric AND changes the chemical composition of explosives so that firearms don't work. Thus does everyone in the novel proceed to dress up as Lancelot or in one case William Wallace and do battle.Simply put, the author asks us to believe that the laws of physics have only been partially altered in ways wholly implausible. Further, the characters jump to quickly into playing knights of the round table without any questioning whatsoever or investigation into alternatives.If you like science in your science fiction, stay away from this."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of his novels yet!","review":"Dies the Fire, is an excellent companion piece to the Island in the Sea in the Time Trilogy, but you don't need to read the Island in the Sea of Time books to understand what is going on. Great action sequences that keeps the story moving and the reader hooked (at least I was.) The only drawback is a never ending use of Wiccan terms/phrases that are hardly ever explained or defined. An English to Wiccan dictionary as an appendix would have nice. As least the Celtic phrases that Juniper uses gets translated during the course of a conversation.I look forward to sequel, to see how events pan out. For fans of Stirling's earlier works, Dies the Fire is better than The Peshawar Lancers and as good as Conquistador. If you enjoy novels with the theme of civilization's collapse, and those left behind who try to rebuild it, then you will love Dies the Fire."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be sure to read a sampling before you buy!","review":"I got the first 2 books of the series for Christmas. The first is one of the most poorly written books I have ever picked up. The story might be very good, but I couldn't get past the first chapter because of the writing. I'm guessing the book could have been 200 pages instead of 600 if the author had left out all the useless (and very poorly written) babbling. I would HIGHLY suggest reading a sampling of his writing BEFORE wasting money on buying the books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy Books By Crooks!","review":"This book is a complete ripoff of Steven R. Boyett's 1984 fantasy novel ARIEL, down to the SCA and hang-gliding attacks. Stirling even calls the event that destroys modern technology \\"the Change.\\" Save your money and read the better, *original* version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting","review":"An interesting and unique post-apocalyptic genre book. The writing left something to be desired and it seemed like a teen novel. I would recommend it to anyone interested in the genre though because again - it is unique. I am also very familiar with the area the book takes place which held my interest in the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wiccan fiction gone out of control","review":"S.M. Stirling is a wonderful author, and I have treasured his other books, but he has succeeded in ruining my enjoyment of this one by his heavy-handed treatment of the religious beliefs of the Wiccan character, Lady Juniper. I could have accepted this premise without complaint, but the sheer level of detail with which he obsesses on her flakey beliefs grows more grating as I progress further in the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Concept but Big Disappointment","review":"This book by S.M. Sterling was a big dissapointment to me. It had a very good concept but the new age withcraft spouted by one of Sterling's major characters (Juniper Mckenzie) was both annoying and disgusting. Juniper is constantly praying to this or that \\"goddess\\" and on at least one occasion prayed to the \\"horned one.\\" I quit reading it after only a few chapters because of that kind thing. It could have been a good book if Sterling would have just kept that kind of crap out of his writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super Read","review":"This book is one of the better reads of the last few years. The harsh nature of loosing humanity's tech base permantly is a fasinating subject. One negative is that author seemed to have an agenda in pushing the Wiccan Religion."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my all time favorites!","review":"Read this! It is the first in a series with the first three novels are a complete storyline but this first novel could stand on it's own. Full of action with complex characters and insights into what different people will do when faced with a world where our technology no longer functions and we are thrust back into a period resembling medieval times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thank god I paid used mass market paperbook price","review":"Would have been OK if every character wasn't an attendee of your local Sci Fi Convention. The prose was a 500+ advertisement for the Society for Creative Anachronisms and Wiccans - all whom apparently have a monopoly on the skills needed to survive in a societal breakdown. This sort of naivety comes from someone who's spent too much time at the library and playing D&D and isn't very entertaining after the 50 page rule."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best sci fi novels EVER!","review":"Dies the Fire is so well-written and satisfying it numbers in my top 5 EVER sci fi books. (by the way that 5 includes \\"Island in the Sea of Time\\" by the same SM Stirling). The characters are well drawn, the story is totally believable, the bad guy are REALLY scary. The whole trilogy holds together well and kept my interest throughout. If you haven't read this yet, get it right now. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Roadmap to Preplanning for Disaster","review":"If you have ever worried about how the world may end, here is a really good roadmap to how it could go down. Want to prepare? Read the story, make some decisions and take action! Definately food for thought! Very well written, engaging charecters, and the story left me thristy for the next installment.5 stars, HIGHLY reccomended for those with any self preservation streak at all!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Impressed...","review":"I first became interested in this book because part of it takes place in towns and regions that I grew up in. Second to that, I'm always game for a good post-apocalypse type book. After seeing an interview with the author, I put Dies the Fire on my wishlist and received it for Christmas. I'm 95% of the way through the book and am quite impressed with it. I'll be continuing onto the next books in the series. As an aside, I did notice a few, shall we say, differences in opinion about some terminology and survival issues (from a background in Search and Rescue), but overall I think it's a fine fictional look at survival under such conditions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Someone should apologize to the trees this was printed on.","review":"I'm a fan of the End Of The World genre, but my copy of this is now in the trash after little more than 200 pages. The absolutely endless \\"Blessed be's\\", \\"Oh Goddess!\\", and description after description of rites and rituals, and then the obligatory beaten to death ex-Super Cliche Marine made this the most annoying, irritating 6 hours in memory. How anyone was capable of finishing, let alone enjoy this book is honestly disturbing to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kinda Flaky","review":"I like these sorts of books. What I like about them is imagining how real people would react in a situation that is unimaginable. The problem is that the author uses flaky, unreal characters that are hard to relate to. I would not like a book that preached to me about christianity, and likewise I do not like this book when it so often seems to be preaching the Wiccan religion. I bumped it up from one to two stars only because there are some good action scenes, and the character Mike Havel seems to be somewhat believable, if a little to good at living in the brave new world Stirling creates. Read this if you are a die hard fan of similar books or in to pseudo fantasy novels, otherwise don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dies the Fire","review":"An excellent tale, which Is very well told. Looking forward to the next book in ten tale. I would highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous","review":"I picked up this book because I love post apocalyptic tales, and was very disappointed. It was ridiculous. It started out great, but after the first or second chapter, a big fail. First off, all the characters assumed that Earth will never be the same when something happened to their power with absolutely no way to confirm this. Then everyone grabbed weapons, because they ASSUMED others will try to kill them or something. Let's face it. When a black out happens at my house, I don't go and find my crossbow and assume the entire world was now at a barbaric state, do you? What was Stirling thinking? The scenes are not only so unrealistic that I threw the book against the wall, but they are also peppered with a casual aura that would be in total disagreement had something like this really happened.The entire book was based upon everyone in the nation having the same presumptions about the fate of the Earth without any proof. Realllyyy??????I would never recommend this book to anyone"},{"rating":"2","title":"What a wonderful product","review":"A friend of mine told me several years ago that she stocked up on this product during Passover, when it is available, to use year round..I could not imagine that it could be that good, so I did not purchase it..This past Passover another friend of mine asked me how she could make her chicken breasts without too much fuss. I mentioned this product..She experimented with it for Passover, and was so pleased. She spread duck sauce on the breasts and they were a huge success.

Its plastic open clip design won't stay put unless you have some largish items to keep the tension up. So it doesn't work well on something like a fishing pole. Maybe the one being sold here on Amazon is an older design? Would definitely be better if 4 of the clips on one side had adjustable tensioners. It'll work well enough for many things, and it's too much hassle to send it back to Amazon, so I'll keep it.

Those who have praised this book as a \\"good book for newbies\\" have apparently forgot that the book is entitled \\"Best Kept Secrets\\". These are not secrets. Much of the book goes into painful detail of basic procedures in Visual Studio that you can figure out easily by using the program for a few days. The title of this book is absolutely fraudulent.What's really funny is that, at the end of the book, the author declares that if you said \\"I didn't know that\\" at least once while reading her book, then the book \\"met its objective of revealing the best kept secrets in .NET.\\" That self-congratulatory statement is so illogical and false I don't know whether to laugh or cry.Literally 90% (I made careful marks of the content that was at least slightly informative to me) of the book's \\"secrets\\" are extremely basic, tepid, well-known practices."},{"rating":"1","title":"cheap","review":"This item is fairly thin and inexpensive looking.

The book is a perfect example of what I call unreadable. I am currently a student at Western Washington University, which is where Carol Guess is currently employed, and this book was a requirement for an English class. I would call being forced to read this garbage, cruel and unusual punishment. At no point in time does the text focus on anything relevant to real life, nor does it succeed in properly alluding to real life events. Guess attempts to use metaphor comparing anorexia and homophobia to a generalized idea which she hopes can be used as knowledge in everyday life, and she fails miserably at this attempt. I would encourage her to stop writing \\"books\\" such as this, and perhaps try a different approach for the next time she considers a new text. Such as not doing so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I read the author's last novel, Switch, and loved it. This memoir, or really a mix of memoir and fiction, doesn't measure up. We don't get anything new about anorexia, sexism, homophobia. I enjoyed the Southern family history sections, but the rest seemed too familiar. Carol Guess says she admires Carole Maso and Rebecca Brown, and I'd recommend those writers or Switch over this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than expected","review":"I bought this for my three year old who is getting into animals, and loved her plastic bag set(the little ones with green sheep you get at the pharmacey;))This is those bags' big brother!

I also bought her a Schliech (sp?)horse, and they are about the same size. They are not to scale, the pig is almost as big as the horse, but if they don't care, I don't care!

Wow! Stand by for ignition! These two were absolutely meant for each other, as Nicholas' endearing cousin Jules knew. Dialog aplenty, that will have you on the floor and laughing so hard the tears will come down your face. But that's not all, throw in a deaf butler, an oriental gardner/houseboy, a wacky aunt and a feisty uncle... and Scally - well you're going to have to read the book to find out about him!

Still, that I can forgive.What I can't accept is page after page after boring page of Irish colloquialisms. A tip for new writers--one or two sentences is cute, but after that it's just downright annoying. If this author were a new writer, this book probably would not have been accepted in its current form. Take out the extra space occupied by dialect and the book would have been shorter by at least 50 pages, which would have been a large improvement as well.Take away the reason for my complaints above, and I could have rated this at 4 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"You Got To Love The Title","review":"'Phone Calls from the Dead' doesn't it give you a mental image of a phonebooth standing in the clouds of heaven with a long line of departed waiting to use it?

What you have here is a high quality product at a entry price with everything you need.

I was trying out the broiler on some fish, I had it on for no more than 2 minutes when the glass door exploded, the glass went everywhere, ruined my lunch. I called the customer service number and they are going to send me a new one, but I am not so sure that I want it now b/c I read a similar review. This item needs to be recalled. It could really hurt someone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerous, exploding glass!!!","review":"We had this oven less than two months. Was not too happy with it's ability to toast. I could have turned on my regular oven, and made my toast in it, in the time it \\"barely\\" toasted the bread.But then.....my husband was making toast one night and the glass oven door EXPLODED everywhere, melting the vinyl kitchen floor in one area, from the heat of the glass. Thankfully, no one was hurt, but what a mess to clean up. Black and Decker were very helpful, and offered a new oven, but I told them not to send this type. Waiting to see what comes, but won't stand near it when it's running. I assume there is no recall, although many have had this occur.

I was preheating the oven to broil something and there was literally an explosion with the glass door breaking and bits of glass blown over 12 feet to the other side of the room.Black and Decker sent me a much more expensive model as a replacement but actually it is bigger than I wanted. Unfortunately they didn't have any white models available other than the exploding unit or the one they sent me.I reported the incident to the Consumer Product Safety Commision.

I didn't buy this book for the stories, which can be found in almost any Lovecraft anthology, but for the information about Lovecraft. Somehow I was expecting more, perhaps exerpts from Lovecraft's letters, explaining his frame of mind while writting the stories, or more references to his other works. Instead, the reader gets definitions of eldritch and cyclopean, and a glossed over explanation that Lovecraft was no more racist than anyother New Englander in the 1920's.All in all, it's neat to have on the shelf, if you're a fan, but you can get as much information reading the introductions to other collections."},{"rating":"2","title":"love it","review":"i love the annotation footnotes.

Although I wish it showed examples of how Joshi found text and manuscripts that backed up a certain set of corrections because I like seeing that sort of thing.I like seeing writers/ authorship forensics notes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Annotations add to the enjoyment","review":"I love annotated books. They teach me so much. This book is no exception. I particularly appreciated seeing the complete version of \\"At the Mountains of Madness\\". I'd like to see more of Mr. Lovecraft's work annotated. I am surprised, though, that the section mentioning Lovecraft's work in films or on TV didn't list \\"The Real Ghostbusters'\\" hommage to Lovecraft, \\"The Collect Call of Kathulu\\" [correct episode spelling?]. If that's because the editor never saw that episode, I hope some kind fan will help out."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Forgotten Genius","review":"Lovecraft may have died penniless, but this is not reflected in his work, which at it's best is creative genius. The useful notes included in this edition, will greatly assist the new reader in understanding ideas, themes, and background to many of his tales. Put simply, this is one of the most intriguing and insightful books that delves into the psyche of the author, and will have you investigating the boundaries of the imagination. Excellent!"},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING-Read these tales elsewhere first!","review":"Joshi's annotations ruined \\"At the Mountains of Madness\\" for me. He tells certain things regarding the direction of the story blatently. I assume H.P.L. would rather the reader deduce these things in subtler, more timely fashion. Isn't that the way it was written? Joshi is also just plain wrong once or twice. Maybe I just don't like annotated books."},{"rating":"2","title":"A living book for American History","review":"I read this book to my six-year-old daughter as part of her study of early American history. There are many stories of courageous, hard-working, and quick-thinking colonial children that captured my daughter's attention. We both enjoyed the story of the little girl who made lots of soap that saved her from being kidnapped by an Indian, as well as the boy who escaped death with a young George Washington. This book makes a great addition to a homeschool or family library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insignia IS-PD10135","review":"I have this DVD player, a gift from my family last April, 2005. I haven't played more than 12 movies on it. Around the 5th or 6th movie, the screen would freeze. I had to reboot the player and select the scene in order to get back to where it froze up. Dec. 10, 2005 it froze again and now it won't load the movie. From doing some research on the web, it appears there are many others with exactly the same problem. You get the run around from both Best Buy and Insignia, no customer support. They continue to market this unit with a design flaw. In case you don't know, Insignia is a Best Buy in-house Brand.It looks good in the store but won't last - believe me. Save your money. I recommend that you stay away from this brand as it is junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Serious design flaws","review":"Here's some brilliance in design. You can only adust the the color, hue, etc without a disk in the system and the arrow buttons on the player are for menu navigation only. Can only rewind/FF using the remote.Let's use logic, you may never adjust the color, etc because who wants to keep inserting a disk to see how you did. You'll always use Rew/FF yet those buttons aren't even on the player only the remote.Inexpensive doesn't have to mean lousy design...except in this case. I accept the fact I made a bad decision even though I went down and checked it out with a dvd. Just assumed the arrow buttons on the player were Rew/FF.Nice picture for the price though and I wouldn't have bought anything smaller anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware of Insignia","review":"This player has a 90 day warranty. It quit working on day 99. Probably used less than 50 hours. No option to fix it. No suggestions from customer service to troubleshoot it. Just \\"sorry, I can't help you if you didn't buy the extended warranty.\\" My guess is their only option is to replace it. I wonder 'if' you had the warranty and got another one, would they replace the second one,or would you need 'another warranty'. Or more likely, would it be a one time only option. I would never buy anything else with that name. The Best Buy salesperson strongly recommended it! It was about the highest priced portable dvd they had!"},{"rating":"1","title":"CHEAP!!!","review":"I bought this product about 2 years ago and it has been nothing but trouble. A year ago the buttons on the player and remote (except for skip chapter) stoped working. After multiple requests to Insignia asking for help I was ignored. Now about 2 weeks ago the AC cord started splitting and again asked multiple times where to find a replacement and was ignored. The player is cheaply made and customer service is horrid. I'd of rather e-mail me back saying they can't help then to ignore me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lasting Values","review":"My \\"baby\\" graduated from High School this spring.

The bio on the cover says that \\"after Ausgustine\\" he is one of the most important theologians. I wasn't certain whether this was literally 'after' or 'in the footsteps of...' both standpoints being partly true.Certainly, Calvin's exegetical methodology in writing commentaries is examined later in this book, and having looked at both Augustine's allegorising and Calvin's systematic approach, I would have to say that Calvin doesn't really follow \\"after Augustine\\" in this sense!I recommend, prior to reading this, you get your hands on a copy of \\"Man of Geneva\\" from Banner of Truth. It is most likely out of print. But it is in chronological order, less thematic, and has a slightly less academic approach.Good bibliography, good timeline, but an index would have been handy.Altogether - 5 out of 5.

These nine senators are an inspiration to any woman trying to make it in a male dominated work force."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nine and Counting","review":"Members of our book club recently read this book. One member liked that all the women met without regard for personal or political differences. Another member would love to be invited to one of the dinner meetings (...). The description (p. 144) of the priorities of the women senators impressed another member. \\"Not compelling, but intermittantly inspirational\\", commented yet another member. One member wished that the biographies for each senator were compiled in one chapter rather than the current \\"bits-and-pieces\\" format. In addition, she would have appreciated the cover photos identified so that stories could've been matched to people. The final member was inspired to run for the school board. The afterword (in the latest addition) was a nice addition which showed the current dynamics of the Senate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nine and Counting Review","review":"Nine and Counting is an inspirational book that all young women should read. The struggles and obstacles that each of these women had to overcome show that anything is possible. The stories included in the book are very interesting and show how different each of the female senators are. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants an insight into nine of our current senators."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Inspirational Book For All Of Us !","review":"A very interesting new (8/2000) 288 page book with inspiring stories for males and females alike, of all ages. The lives of women of the Senate are detailed. All coming from different backgrounds with different lifestyles yet able to attain some of the highest positions in the land. The manner in which this book is written makes it most interesting. The lives of women in public life are detailed and the reader is offered guidance for seeking higher positions and fulfillment. The book was written primarily to inspire young girls- these women acting as role models- but young boys can equally benefit. Proceeds of the book are said to go to the Girls Scouts. A fascinating story."},{"rating":"2","title":"good tune","review":"well for starters this song was NOT done for the opening of the hacienda in 1981.it was originally done for a cassette magazine IE a magazine which came with a free cassette called \\"TOUCH\\" which covered the local music scene in manchester at the time.the cassette had such stuff as interviews and music from local bands ect at the cutting edge of music at the time.video 586 was from this tape.it also came in 2 versions as well, the second of which ive been unable to find since.i had this tape when it first came out but unfortunately lost it.AAAAhhhh well.nice to see its still available though.plus this song also appears at the end of the taRRAS chevenko videao filmed in new york with some dodgy home video from stephen morris. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Too much on ecology, too little on geology!","review":"I like the title, no question about that. But, I prefer to see more comprehensive coverage on geology, the true Earth biography, than ecology. For example, there are three types of volcano: Cinder Cone, Composite, and Shield. There is no mentioning of that in the Volcano section. I watched the entire Weather section, didn't see rock cycle or cloud types. The hot spot underneath Yellowstone is the same as the one under Hawaii. A type of its hot spring bacteria helps the explosion of DNA application and human genome project through something called polymerase chain reaction. It would be more exciting to include that. All the 3D computer graphic images and animation are great! I love them!

But as is the case in any film which attempts to travel back in time - it's unreliable. What they teach as truth today will be thrown out of the window tomorrow. The fact is: Nobody was there 4 billion years ago and it's all guesswork on the evidence they have NOW.It will have you believe that ALL scientists agree that this was the way it all happened, but it gives you absolutely no clue that the scientific community is completely split.But again we are asked to worship at the alter of these great scientists who know everything, who are we to argue?

I have a geology degree and so was curious to see what this was about. It is reasonably factual, even though it glossed over a few things I thought should have been covered a bit further - like differing views on \\"Snowball Earth\\". Dr Stewart explained things fairly well, and the shots of the volcanoes, etc., were interesting. I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in Earth History.Cons:Dr Iain Stewart himself. He is no where near the level of a presenter like David Attenborough, and he came across to me as a simpleton at times.Only one view is presented, areas of controversy such as \\"Snowball Earth\\" and first \\"animals\\" (there are much earlier critters than the ones in Australia) are glossed over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love our planet Earth","review":"This is a fantastic portrayal of what drives our planet.

I will not go on my tirade of campus bookstores now, but they are a capitalist trap. On the first day of class, the professor mentioned that the official title is \\"The Sketchbook of Geoffrey Crayon, Gent.\\" and I looked to see if this title was anywhere on the book's amazon page. When I did not see that title, I was worried, but I figured I could just return it if it was not the correct book. I assure you, this is the right book with the exact same page numbers as the edition the professor is using! I paid the same price for a new book that the campus bookstore charges for a used book. The book is in pristine condition. When satisfactory Kindle editions cannot be found, it is nice to know that I can still get a hardcopy in perfect condition for less money.

This is the first story I've read by Washington Irving, and it'll most likely be my last. I grew up watching the Disney cartoon \\"The Legend of Sleep Hollow\\" from 1958, which was narrated by Bing Crosby. It was the only thing that helped me envision this story, as I found the writing very bland and needlessly wordy. It's as if the author just liked seeing his own words on paper. I found the narration to skip, rendering it muddled, and I was at a loss if it was an unseen narrator, the author himself, or whomever. I didn't get a sense of any character, and the horseman was nearly nonexistent. I can see why the 1999 movie \\"Sleepy Hollow\\" with Johnny Depp needed much revamping, as this story is very mind numbing. I do not recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful, and poetic!","review":"This book definately threw me for a loop, but it was very worthwhile.

From the beginning of time, a successful innkeeper has to provide certain services in order to create a successful, growing business.Martha Murphy tells the budding host the essentials of hospitality, starting with your attitude, the house you're using, the beds and their care, bathrooms, meals, how to handle guests, marketing and the importance of record keeping. There are also plenty of stories about good guests and how to keep the \\"bad\\" ones from coming back (tell 'em you're already fully booked the next time they call).What is missing is modern information about marketing through the internet, which was in its infancy in 1994. Other than that, the information is priceless and timeless.The book also makes it pretty clear that hosting a B&B; is WORK.

I read Fat first and it was outstanding! So I think my low number of stars (2) may be because Bones is nowhere near as informative as Fat. We \\"learn\\" that the reason to include bones is to increase flavor. And then there are a number of interesting recipes for meat on-the-bone and for stock. The margins are filled with bone-lore, similar to the fat-lore that was included in Fat. But there was a lack of health information about bones, and there was little about actually consuming bones. Since I know of people who make bone pate (from organic, grassfed animals), this was a notable omission. Had I known it was basically a cookbook, I would not have requested it as a Christmas gift."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I was looking for","review":"This book is simply a cute little cook-book. It's weak on the diversity of edible-preparations. Sure, there are a few play-offs of different ethinic variations. Not very heavy on the history or lore either.

What I heard was heavy-handed skin-deep Folkie posturing and middling musicianship. Advertised as a \\"voice\\" of 20somethings, I was disappointed that Jennings has nothing to say about the events going on around him -- or even those of the past decade. His songs retreat to the safety of tired 1960s coffehouse folk anthems: Vietnam and Martin Luther King. Hard to say anything new on these topics but it gives the illusion of depth, and this album needs all the illusions that such themes can conjure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gooooooooood stuff","review":"One thing that really annoys me is when people constantly write reviews in which they compare one artist to another. I mean, I like Elliott Smith, too, but it would be ridiculous to say that Mason Jennings is \\"like\\" Elliott Smith. Can we, perhaps, rise to the challenge of saying something original about the artist without drawing invidious comparisons? Let me tell you a story about this cd, instead. Just about two and a half years ago, I was living in Minneapolis, moving out of a much-beloved apartment after a not-so-beloved period in my life. \\"Train Leaving Gray\\" came on the radio (a live, studio version prior to the cd's release). I put the broom down in my now-empty apartment and cried. May you be lucky enough to have such an experience. Really pretty songs; really scary songs; really real songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"A departure for Mason that remains intriguing","review":"The first time I listened to this record I was baffled over Mason's choice of subjects and use of loose, reggae- and jazz-flavored rhythms. But after a while, the heartfelt nature with which he paid tribute to Dr. King, the barely-boiling-over anger of Global Empire, the ode to true love in Ballad for My One True Love and the sighing loss of Train Leaving Gray seemed to pinpoint not only the struggles that Mason seemed to be facing as a songwriter but the same struggles that most of humanity faces in one form or another."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing, but get his debut first.","review":"This second album by amazing singer-songwriter Mason Jennings features tight folk songs, much like his first album, but somehow the songs don't seem to be quite as pure because they are more complicated and recorded on better equitment. Part of his charm was the simple pure emotion of a man and his guitar, which is not as true in this album. Still great, just not as good as his first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tough to put down","review":"This book is fun! Frank Lauria has created a clever and cool book that is difficult to put down.

It is interesting, humorous, and an unique approach to telling the life of Benjamin Franklin. The problem, however, is that Amos takes credit for most of Franklin's inventions and sayings, while portraying Franklin as a bumbling, conceited idiot. At the time when I read it, I believed the mouse part to be true, and even after I knew better, the negative portrayal of Franklin stuck in my mind. It took me several years to be able to actually like and respect him, instead of laughing at every positive portrayal of the man."},{"rating":"2","title":"i loved it","review":"This book BEN and ME written by Robert Lawson is about a mouse named Amos who walks up to Ben Franklin's house and meets him.

Thirdly, although the screen is larger the text can be quite difficult to read in certain light. Lastly, the machine uses it's own operating system which will not read pdf files or microsoft reader (lit)files. Most importantly, technical support is really bad.

Parka's have a hood. This coat does not. Who ever heard of a raincoat without a hood?

I think it was like $6.00, but this happened a while ago, I'm just now getting around to reviewing things so I may be a little off on the amount. So, please, make sure that this is really what you want before you order, a coat with no hood, because if you have to return it for any reason, they will keep some of your money for themselves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy This Read The Manual Instead","review":"Cheesey video, bad interface, offers little instruction, tests are too easy to be useful.

Even the Sopranos teaches you that. The whole thing just isn't believable, and the subplot about the \\"secret\\" is overdone and underbaked as well. Mariah's role? To be perfectly honest, the best thing about her presence was how sexy she looked in those short tight dresses. Yes, this is the finest performance she's done on film to date, but considering Glitter, that ain't saying much. She just cannot act. Her accent sounded faked and she was WAY too dramatic.

It is a piece of plastic that serves no more purpose than filling the spot where the volume button was previously.

When they got it they refused to pay it, and then they only refunded me a portion of the purchase price, said they tested the unit and it works fine then charged me a re-stocking fee. I know the unit did'nt work and Im sure they do the same thing to anybody else that returns something. They scammed me out of over $100. I will be filing a complaint with the BBB.

I returned for an exchange with Amazon (which was easier than most store returns) and received the second one pretty quickly. However, that one arrived with a broken volume control. The volume control worked for the first few minutes, but then I suspect as the unit warmed up, it began to set the volume at random levels (high then low, then high again) as the knob was turned. The remote control volume still worked fine.I figured that two tries were enough, especially given the price.

As a university professor, I study the medieval mother, Dhuoda, [who wrote an advice manual for her sons when they were removed from her care]; consequently, I'm especially interested in art featuring literate women in the act of reading and writing. Fortunately, this calendar often shows women and books. Another benefit -- I feel connected to these women and their concerns, and when I visit art museums, I occasionally find one of my medieval friends. I have two criticisms: 1) occasionally a picture is repeated; surely the authors aren't running out of art featuring women, and 2) the art features European women only; are there no potential subjects from, say, medieval Japan or China?"},{"rating":"1","title":"No Battery life","review":"I read about the batteries have a low life but just buy an extra battery try 3 or 4 batteries more like it at $60 bucks a pop.

I suggest that before you shell out ... look through the sample pages here to make sure that this is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Simple and Too Advanced","review":"This book on table manners has charming art and dryly funny text -- for an adult. The manners taught in it are way, way too simple for anyone but a 2 year old (eat with a spoon--not your hands, wipe on the napkin--not your sleeve, Don't put food in your hair), while the pictures and text are far too advanced for a two year old. A Ten year old might be tickled by the elaborate Russian names, but a child young enough for those lessons can barely talk yet. I bought Tiffany's Table Manners instead, and while it describes too many advanced manners for young children, it has a sufficiency of the ones they need, with plenty more to grow into."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defeats its purpose","review":"I can understand wanting to make the subject of manners funny in order to get children interested, but this book is more likely to cause bad manners than good. One does not say \\"Good Lord\\" to be polite and yet its the voice of the \\"teacher\\" in the book saying this (I can just imagine my 4 year old running around the house saying it just because he'll think its funny, not going to happen, this book goes back to the library). Many of the lists of what not to do will become ideas of what to do for naughty little ones and while that IS funny, it doesn't help with manners.Also, each page is so chaotic I couldn't bring myself to completely look at the book. There may be something good in there, but I'm repelled. But I did look at it long enough to know that if you are looking for a book that is more fun and naughtiness than good manners, this is it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting but dated","review":"Interesting book but a little out dated (the Challenger disaster being the big news of the book). The book is divided into themes for chapters. There are chapters on what it's like to be in space, how much better the human eye is than the camera, how basic human needs are taken care of in space (and what is done with the waste), etc. The writing is a little choppy, cutting between eras as needed for the thread of the theme, rather than smoothly segueing through eras or different missions to space.

Think about this: How can a period be regulated in a few weeks? Also, It takes a few months for a period to be normally restored anyway. The product is nothing but a prenatal vitamin with vitex added in. I wish I knew this before I bought it, but it clearly states this on the back of the bottle.

The 1st 2 nights were laughable for us with great stories, because as I lay with her the 1st night to listen a bit, she kept saying things like, \\"I can't do that!\\" when the \\"fairy\\" would tell her to relax her fingers or take a deep breath.

In fact is it not a biography of Paul Klipsch at all. It is a tribute to him by his second wife, ghost written by the authors. Paul's life before his second wife hardly exists. We learn almost nothing of his life with his first wife. Worse, the technical aspects of Paul's life are almost ignored. Paul W. Klipsch was a great engineer, an entrepreneur, and a great man for what he did with his money (an Engineering school is named after him for his extensive support). But what made all this possible were the technical innovations which he brought to the audio industry, and these nontechnical authors don't have a clue what that is all about. So this is not a biography of Paul W. Klipsch. A better title would be \\"My Life with Paul W. Klipsch\\" by his Second Wife."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only a fraction of the story as told by PWK wannabes","review":"The authors of this poorly written biography may have met the man in his twilight years and obviously garnered their information from very limited resources. Therfore only a mere part of the real story has been told and indeed a biased one at that. P. Wilbur, as his closest associates knew him, was robbed of his legacy by a bunch of wannabes and they told their side of the story which is now in print for their own benefit. I gave it one star for the fact that it does document some of his achievements."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I bought this book intending to dislpay it near my vintage stereo system that features a pair of Klipsch La Scala speakers. That will not be happening. This book is amateurishly written and poorly edited. Stories are told and then repeated again at length only pages later. The authors set up each chapter by describing some virtuous attribute of this man they so obviously adore and then proceed to describe someone quite the opposite (for example, they report that the \\"extremely open minded\\" Mr. Klipsch impulsively ripped the radio out of his car to avoid listening to music that was not to his tastes). Remove the \\"filler\\" - pages of patent specifications, pictures, lists of awards - and there remains precious little content, far less than one would expect in summarizing the life of such a legendary personality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Childishly Written","review":"This is the clumsiest, most poorly written hardcover I have ever read. The last chapter, amazingly worst than the others, is totally incoherent. I have no idea how this could have gotten published. From what I know of Paul Klipsch and his personality, having only spent one evening with him, I believe he would find this book an utter embarrassment,That said, if you're interested in some tidbits about the life of Paul Klipsch there are a lot of them here.

If this review were based on the movie alone, I would give it 3 or 4 stars. Unfortunately for movie studios, that isn't how reviews are done anymore. There is no reason why this release on Blu-ray shouldn't include every version of the movie that has been released until now. It seems like just one more future double-dip release waiting to happen... Why, why would they not include both versions? That way those who like the R or UR would both be happy! It certainly wouldn't stop anyone from purchasing this movie, while the choice they made to only include the theatrical release has had the opposite effect.

I just don't understand how he gets to keep writing these books. Just a familiar name, I guess. The section on color management in this book is terrible. It is skimpy (shows the author doesn't really know what he's talking about). And worse, there are serious factual errors about Illustrator's use of profiles and policies.

Hellen Mirren's Karen Stone (in Willaims' \\"The Roman Spring of Mrs. Stone\\") is a much more authentic, and moving, portrayal of the consequences of the ravages of time - for a former stage&screen beauty and, indeed, for any of us.

The attempt to speak the southern drawl was greatly overstated. Elizabeth Taylor is a movie legend and Mark Harmon is one of my favorites, but I just could not get into this film.

Stephen Levy did it better years ago with 'Artificial Life'. The only thing better about 'Virtual Organisms' is that it covers a few things that have happened since Levy.

Bearing in mind the limitations imposed upon the author by the parameters of this work, this text provides an excellent theoretical perpective of the field free from the restrictive and time consuming portrayal of endless lines of coding that some reviewers would prefer to see.

Furthermore, we EXPECTED it to be bad and not the second coming of 2001: A Space Odyssey! Probably the funniest thing about this so-called movie is the fact that the makers of this film probably thought they had a hit on their hands, since it came out around the same time as Star Wars.

Even by 1977 standards, the sets, costumes and special effects look badly dated, the dialogue is often incomprehensible and the performances are uniformly languid.

As my host warned me, it did get dry in places due to the narrator being a scientist rather than an actor. Some information has been presented before in different context. However there is enough new input to make viewing it worthwhile. The point the author appears to be making is the fact that \\"difficult\\" but plausable scientific information is ignored or swept under the rug by many who would find it hard or impossible to explain. He also presents that information in an easy to understand format.

The book really shines because of Stuart Immonen's pencils which are about 10 times better than Mark Bagley's. His art is just so vibrant and dynamic that you'll even be entertained by the more low key parts of the story. There is one scene in particular where Spider-man, Kitty Pryde and the Green Goblin are from falling from a from a building and I was just floored. I may not make it sound exciting but the scene was extraordinarily well structured and then there is the final battle which was my favorite part; the Goblin was just so badass. All in all, this was an amazing read and I'm sure it will hook anyone interested in Spider-Man."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Done","review":"Was expecting a book just like some of the others my son has (Black and White)This one in full color, and quality was amazing.

This book does make some fatal attempts to instruct the reader on how to program with js but the content of the book is in large a programmers reference and muse. This would not be a wise purchase if you are looking to learn js from scratch, although if you have some other scripting language under your belt you may find it an invaluable companion.It covers just about everything that is important and unique to js in regards to what it can do on the web. There is some mention of debugging methods and some browser issues are covered but there are far too many to mention in one book. Unfortunaltely this may be js's eventual undoing but for now enjoy it while it's here.Worth a spot on your shelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great...but assumes a bit of knowledge","review":"You'll need some prior scripting experience to make full use of this book. I don't consider myself a true programmer (to me it's a necessary evil to drive my graphics), and I feel that without my prior understanding of at least a simple object-based language such as Lingo, I may have been lost. It would have been difficult to make the theoretical associations that the author only briefly touches on with few examples. It also assumes prior HTML knowledge. That said, if you have any idea how to speak to a computer already, this book packs Javascript into a tasty bite-sized morsel that won't give you a hernia from carrying it around!Now I must order this book so I can return my partner's copy."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE... don't buy it.","review":"Wish I had read other reviews before buying.

However, this book was not very helpful. Case and point: Flow control was covered in 4 pages! Ouch! It was bland, it didn't have enough examples to cary you through. It didn't do good use of it's space. Let me put it this way, out of the 10 chapters, I could say that it had 3 OK chapters, and 7 that I didn't care much about, and I'm a webdeveloper. The 3 chapters that were OK, could've been much better. I'm not quite sure who was the targeted audience, I thought the book made JavaScript more complicated than it really is. I felt that the author wrote down all the concepts in an outline, and then wrote down what he thought was important about each subject, hence no flow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very lacking on details necessary for simple programming.","review":"I found the book poor because, given an object's(document, window, ...) methods, the book neither listed ALL the methods for the object, nor described the method's parameters especially the parameters their require options and what these options are.

Nothing is explained in detail, the code examples consist of very small fragments that don't fully illustrate the ideas being explained, and basic concepts are overlooked. For instance, the book gives examples of a variety of functions, but never explains or gives an example of how you call them within your HTML code. This is one of the trickier aspects of javascript and its not addressed at all!Very disappointing.

The index in the back was completely useless, and not once did I find what I was looking for in there. I had much better luck just looking on the web.

After 65 agonizing pages, I gave up and went back to my woefully outdated \\"Sams Net JS in a week\\" because it was much easier to follow. The book is poorly written and organised. The examples were vague and without any screen shots to show the expected output, so I tried typing the code in word for word and ran it. This resulted in errors and was a waste of time; You can leave code out in the middle of a book but not on page 15. I have other Wrox books like ASP, and none of them are particularly easy to read but they are usually thorough. This one is neither, avoid it.

They were often too heavy too trivial and too narrow.This was the only book that offered a clear and consice guide of Javascript and how it interacts with HTML, DHTML, Document Object and running server based programs. This is cruicial as Javascript is a language run in conjunction with all of these.The writing style is easy to follow and the auther is very organized presenting the concepts in a through way. In contrast to the other books on the market it is a) to the point b) covers most the technologies used in conjuction with javascript c) great as reference.The drawbacks with the book are: - Shouldn't be used by NON PROGRAMMERS.

The weights are lose in some of the pieces but I just super glue them in if they get lose. It works. The carrying case is very nice and has a good place for the clock, the pieces and the board.This set, board, and carrying case are the most common that I see in chess tournaments in my area. I highly recommend it. If you buy this set, go to Office Depot or Walmart or somewhere and buy a two inch wide shipping tube (like those used to mail blue prints). You can cut the tube to fit the case. Then roll the board with the squares on the outside and slide it into the tube for storing.

Despite the fact that it's so thick, it's still fairly easy to bend and stretch in the way you want to use it (though keep in mind it can never be as flexible as thinner cables). I have not had anyone try to cut it, nor have I tried to cut it, but since it's so thick and it's braided cable, I would imagine that without a torch this would take quite a while to cut even with really big bolt cutters.

The vending machines only had Coke, so he had to bring his own Pepsi in, and was keeping it under his desk.A passer-by hears this and says, 'Mark, why don't you put the Pepsi in the fridge?'Breier looks startled, and then shouts at the top of his lungs 'BIG IDEA! BIG IDEA! PUT THE PEPSI IN THE FRIDGE!!!', runs into his office, gathers up several six packs in his arms, and runs back into the hallway, shouting 'PUT THE PEPSI IN THE FRIDGE!!!BIG IDEA! BIG IDEA!' on his way to the fridge.If you want to take managment advice from someone who can't figure out how to chill a beverage, buy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak","review":"Mark Breier represents everything wrong with the Internet Economy: his disarming enthusiasm masks his lack of intelligence and innovation.

I found many parts of his book to be insightful but lacking in any real tactical approaches. If you need to read a whole chapter on how important e-mail is, you shouldn't be in the Internet business at all. Many examples in the book are ironic given Beyond.com's current state of affairs.

Some pre dot-bomb books have lasted the test of time in the couple years since...this one has not. \\"The Customer Revolution\\" is a good example of a pre dot-bomb tech/business book that is still worth reading or listening to.

Suddenly things get done so much quicker and I have more time to focus on the important things. <strong>I</strong> think this book is full of a lot of great tips.... however... I've noticed that I've given this book a higher rating than a lot of other readers. The bad reviews this book gets usually say \\"all the stuff he says is so simple and obvious\\". So I'd just like to point out that it's very easy to say \\"oh that's easy, everyone knows that\\", but it's not as easy to do the easy things that everyone already knows.EX: Everyone knows excersise is good for you. Everyone knows how to do a push up, and everyone know it will help strengthen your arms. However, how many people do as little as 1 push-up a day?(...)"},{"rating":"1","title":"If he knew so much, why are all of his companies bankrupt?","review":"Reading this book today is like reading a book of jokes. When the author wrote this, he was riding the wave of \\"internet madness\\" that walloped Wall Street with outrageous stock prices for companies that never produced any profit. Mark Breier was simply a man at the right place at the right time and any insights he has on how to effectively run a business is hindered by the facts that both beyond.com and software.net are now nowhere to be found on the internet.However, an enterprising entrepreneur can read this book and learn what not to do. In addition, there is a paragraph or two that talks about venture capital personalities you will encounter.In summary, do not buy this book if you are looking for successful ways to run your business as a manager. Taking much of his advise will undoubtedly bring you to his final demise. (In fact, he is no longer a CEO; he is back to Chief of Marketing)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Loaded with contradictions and irony","review":"This book probably had a little more pop in the early part of 2000, but it's obvious now after the demise of most Dot Com's that much of the author's advice is unproven. Companies he continually references, Amazon.com and Beyond.com, did see tremendous stock gains and gave their managers a false sense of success. I also felt like the author contradicted himself many times throughout the text. For example, he spent a great deal of time preaching the importance of customer feedback and response via email, only to later warn of the great dangers involved with communicating with your customers via on-line forums. They're both just channels of communication and good judgment needs to be used when communicating regardless of the medium."},{"rating":"1","title":"EGO -- all marshmellow fluff","review":"While in traffic, I suffered the torture of listening to the 10-Second Internet Manager on a Book on Tape.

It grips the reader, and leads them on an evocative journey through London, and closer to Marlowe's death. The story is built around historical facts, but in avoiding going up to Marlowe's death, Welsh avoids having to deal with the various theories and contradictory pieces of evidence surrounding Marlowe's murder. As for the man himself, in the book he is a witty, likeable man, and the reader connects to him, and feels for him, making his outcome even more tragic.

For a short piece of fiction, the writing needs to be absolutely concrete with nothing extraneous, but there are scenes (such as an episode with Dr. John Dee) that, while interesting, do nothing to move the story forward - and there are a couple of soft porn sex scenes that are not only unnecessary, but so poorly written as to be almost comical, which certainly breaks the flow of the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"interesting concept, poorly executed","review":"\\"The secret life of Kit Marlow\\" is an interesting concept: intrigue, sex. violence, betrayal, poetry.

Writing in the first-person, from Marlowe's point of view, Welsh posits that Marlowe, having been \\"set up\\" by an envious actor at the behest of \\"powerful men\\", chooses death rather than implicate Raleigh in order, like Achilles, to gain everlasting fame. The plotting is weak and vague, and the motivations of those behind Marlowe's downfall are never terribly clear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time","review":"A very dull, though mercifully short read.

This is after seeing Emo several times in concert (a couple of times in the 80s and a more recent viewing in San Francisco). Emo's LPs, E=MO2 and at the Hasty Pudding, are comedy legends. This CD brings us up to date, kind of presenting the best of Emo's humour since those LPs. Some of the jokes on the CD are old (I heard them live back in the late 80s) while some are new. But, regardless, they are all quite a joy to hear.Now, if someone would just get on the stick and get those two albums releases as CDs, we could all live in peace and harmony.

The fact that he offered no counter-balancing liberal sentiment shows he has a real streak of angry bigot in him. So emo, did all 150 people bush executed as governor of TX deserve it? Did you check each and every one? All 150? Only a real a**hole would say something like that. I bought the CD because I remember the old Emo who was funny, but the new emo is different-the soft lilt is gone, his affect now sounds forced, he was way over-the-top raunchy, and of course the vulgar repug bias. This performance had an undercurrent of anger-yuck what a turnoff. I'm returning mine-check out the number of used CDs available-37 when I looked.

To tell you the truth, I am more into the industrial scene. However, when I read in our local newspaper that some local kids had made their big break, I was sort of curious to see what made it so. I went to the same school as Andrew Langer and Justin Baren, and I believe I was in AP Studio Art with one of them (I was a junior, they were seniors). I always heard Justin talk to our teacher (who is into music and in a band as well) about some gigs they played and stuff like that, but I haven't heard any of their music until Universal Blues came out. I have to say that I was pretty amazed at first. I had a hard time believing that this was what they were capable of doing. Congratulations.

That was odd that I was taking drugs for taking drugs, so I was always on the lookout for a way to get off it.I found this product, ordered it, and tapered off a 2-year stint on that medication. I'm now off prescribed drugs all together. I would talk to your doctor before substituting like this...I did. It stopped working, but I take it anyway because I'm an addict, and that's what I do.

All quotes are attributed, but I wish the author would have infused the book with more quotes and statements by Phil from media interviews of the period. Perhaps, he did not want the subject clouded by his view of himself? A great introduction to Lynott, that would be rounded out by a reading of Philomena Lynott's 'My Boy' book. I thought the most insight on the great and moody side of Lynott was given by Jim Fitzpatrick (who did many of Lizzy's album covers), and on the whole every member of the Lizzy cast was contacted and quoted in the book. Huey Lewis in particular came of in a great light. Also a great resource for those interested in early Irish rock music, and the bands which formed and quickly faded but had a lasting impact as proving grounds for future success. A good read on a great artist."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's Marcus' day job?","review":"I rate it as 1 star, because zero (or less) is not listed as a choice.

Starting with his columns for _Rolling Stone_ in the 1970's, I have followed his writing career as he taken on subjects ranging from punk music to prophecy. He brings all his skills to bear in this lean, thought-provoking analysis of the classic 1962 political thriller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hopeless entrant in fine series","review":"This book contains bad writing and has absolutely no focus, The Manchurian Candidate is an important film and the BFI film classics should be the highpoint of film criticism.

He is one of the best rappers, flows of all time. But the beats he choose aside from a few just don't cut it. I always remeber hearing X on Diamond D's Day in the the life of 3 black men and Tribe's business of low end theory. But the beats on this album are uninteresting, just like experience and education. If you like SaDAT X, don't buy his solos as they aren't good at showcasing a true legend. Get all of the Brand Nubian CD's first. Sadat needs to hook up with producers like Madlib and his brother Oh No. Or maybe get Diamond to quit the 808 bull and dig in the crates. A.G. comes out with a hot new album with producers on it and kills it, and Sadat falls flat again over equally flat production.

I purchased a pair about 3 years ago and loved the 3D, but the heavy flickering gave me headaches and not many games worked. I have since come across the edimensional.com glasses, and read a large number of glowing reviews. I decided to give them a try and was not disappointed. They are official nvidia recommended 3D glasses and nvidia has drivers specifically for their glasses. they have a much more powerful VGA adapter than the little cord the revelators came with and the flickering is greatly reduced. many more games work as well and the look truly stunning. you really get a sense of speed and depth and height in simulators and FPS games have body parts shooting out at you!! try them instead and i'm sure you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"A book with no meaning","review":"The silly story and pictures are clearly influenced by Dr. Seuss, but since there's no meaning or point to the story, it completely fails to copy any of the quality of a Seuss book. When the author couldn't think of a meaningful rhyme, he just picked things out of thin air like talking about an \\"odd sock wood\\" being \\"A place where goblins And ogres meet To talk about socks and Wiffy feet!\\" The book appears to be a miss-mosh of unrelated nonsense poems done by a child and strung together without thought. My 8 year old boy found this whole book meaningless. Maybe a child of 4 or 5 might find the nonsense amusing, but unfortunately there are a sufficient number of complicated words (e.g. vaguely,meringue,absurd) that would surely bore that age group.

Quite happy to see my package arrived until i opened to look at them closely. First thing i recognize right away was the each of the pourers were dirty. They did not look very good at all. Then I noticed from looking through them that the pourers width were inconsistent, so some would pour faster then others. One even had a dent on the very end of it where the metal was splitting. The workmanship on them were flat out poor. The seals are made of stiff plastic. I am disgusted with the quality, expecting metal pourers would be better quality. Within an hour i was in the process of returning them.Warning: Do not buy!My recommendation is to go to the store instead of here.

Messy.","review":"My initial reaction when I opened the package was that these were going to be a great addition to my bar. I was very wrong. I purchased these because I was going to be bartending (first time) at a friends party. I quickly learned that these pourers don't fit very tight, and even if they did, they have to be held at a specific angle in order to keep them from leaking. The little air-relief hole needs to be at the 12 o'clock position in order to prevent leaks.For this beginner, the flow rate is good. Not too fast. Not too slow.I'll probably continue to use them for smaller gatherings where I'm only making a few drinks, and can closely pay attention to their position. But certainly not in a busy environment."},{"rating":"1","title":"not consistent very dissapointed","review":"I ordered this exact product item from the same seller a few months ago and since then the photo and description hasn't changed but the product has.

The most important concepts are briefly mentioned or are not mentioned at all. A good portion of the book is written to describe simple programming methods and layout of a workspace in DevStudio. I spent a few hours reading through the book and am thoroughly disappointed. The code is not organized at all on the CD.

Absolute beginner.Real-time strategy?Some beginner stuff about tiles and pathing, easy to find on the web. I expected to see a fellow game developer share some gems, but found another hard-coded, simplistic, limited, and entirely unrealistic approach to producing a real game.

The author spends way too much time discussing basics of the RTS genre from a players standpoint and is WAY too opinionated in his writing. The opinions he voices seem to have come from a very narrow experience. In addition to the code being full of bugs, he has specific problems like he says you should use a \\"Booch diagram\\" to illustrate the design (that's not the name of the diagram, BTW). The diagram he draws uses the Booch notation, but he uses classes and draws lines between them to indicate functional flow. It's an old-fashioned data-flow diagram--and its not even clear what the flow is.

I enjoyed this book from beginning to end. I think most people are disappointed with this book because it's a bit advanced and they probably didnt understand most of the code (I had some trouble in some areas as well)... But thanks to this book I feel confident that I can (and probably will) be able to design and code a RTS game. I especially liked all the optimizations the author provides. I wish I had more books like this one, it's the book on which Ive probably learned the most. I just finished reading the whole book, so I know what Im talking about (unlike some reviewers who review a book after they read Chapter 1)... Excelent Book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Opinionated, mostly organised, and frequently brilliant.","review":"What this book doesn't tell you, it will tell you where to look up. Within each chapter are at least 3 recommendations of other books that you \\"must read.\\" Overall, the book itself is quite good, too. It's an excellent coder's eye view of how RTS games are and should be turned out, in the here and now. It's obviously strongly influenced by what has already been done with the genre, and takes a narrow view of what that genre is. The author is prone to throwing out declarations of How Things Should Be Done that are sometimes questionable, but it's clear that he has such strong opinions because he's been programming on the front lines for that long, and has seen way, way more than most of what can go wrong. Follow the plan in this book and you will end up with the framework of a respectable starcraft/aoe clone. Creativity must be left up to the reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent phrases","review":"I bought this dictionary to use with Kosovar refugees I am currently teaching english. I thought it would be fun to suprise them by learning a little of their own language as well because they are working so hard. This book has many, many, fabulous phrases in the last section that apply to almost every situation. While the dictionary is small and has only a limited vocabulary, most commonly used words are available. My only problem with this book is that unlike some others, there is no real pronunciation guide so you are left guessing if you are truly pronouncing things correctly. If you are looking for correct pronunciation, I suggest getting tapes or asking a native."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Enough Words","review":"I ordered this book for the Albanian and Macedonian students I teach in my ESL class. The book is quite solid and compact, as bilingual dictionaries go, convenient for carrying. But we have not found it to be of much use. There simply are not enough words in it.

It was heart wrenching to watch the devastation of so many lives. Enjoyed the small window showing the Gulf Coast before Katrina while seeing the after effects of Katrina. This movie really shows the power of a hurricane. One can really get the feel of the lives that were effected by the hurricane and see just how beautiful the gulf coast was before Katrina. It also shows how people do not always take warnings seriously."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unexpected twist of fate","review":"Think Hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans?? Think again. The eye of the storm uprooted the culture-rich coast of Mississippi. A first-hand story of how life is easily taken for granted, these adventure-seeking young men were content with staying home until the storm passed. Escaping life-taking torrent merely moments before the wrath, the only thing these boys saved---was their very own breath.I highly recommend this film for all viewing audiences. Prepare for an awe-inspiring, breathtaking experience... as nature's fury on planet earth becomes uncomfortably personal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"This documentary is a raw, first-hand look at the Katrina disaster from a local's perspective. The pre-storm and other previously unseen footage is what makes this film truly unique. Growing up on the Gulf Coast, I have many memories of the Biloxi area and the beauty it once held. Seeing these images from the storm is a very moving experience for me; the coast is almost unrecognizable. Unfortunately, the level of damage was, and still is, ignored by the media. This film definately makes you appreciate the power of nature and makes you think about the things we take for granted every day; especially for those of us still living on the Gulf Coast. I loved the film and would recomend it to anyone interested in learning more about the hardships caused by Hurricane Katrina."},{"rating":"1","title":"so bad I did NOT watch whole movie","review":"saw 1st half hour. it got worse as movie went on. if you MUST see this wait to see it on cable. remember, you can go outside & stare at the sun but your eyesight will get worse the longer you do so."},{"rating":"2","title":"Puzzle-Out The Big Apple!","review":"This Big Apple themed crossword collection is one of the most intriguing, original, (and fun), on the market.

Also good are explanations of why certain Fr. Vosko leans toward including certain features in his architectual projects.On the minus side, it seems that there is an agenda that Fr. Vosko is promoting. What I have heard referred to as a Vatican III perspective, that the Catholic Church underwent a revolution in 1964 after Vatican II which needs to go even further.From the theological pew I which sit in I wonder if less sacred worship spaces lead to less sacred liturgy leading to less sacred people?

Water somehow gets into the battery (from the top or bottom, who knows), rendering it useless...until it dries, then it becomes schizophrenic and turns on at random times. It finally lost all ability to recharge....waste of money.

I've been using it for a few weeks and my teeth are still yellow, but it definitely feels like I'm washing them much more effectively.

But I had to be convinced. I am an extremely consciences brusher with a strong desire to never have any dental work done. I brushed multiple times a day and brushed for a long time before going to bed ensuring that each tooth was clean. Could an electric toothbrush do that much better?Yes. Amazingly better in a much shorter amount of time. After using the Oral B my teeth feel much cleaner afterward - very smooth like after you visit the dentist. For those who are less careful about brushing I would imagine the difference would be even more dramatic.I haven't used any other electric toothbrush so can't compare this to anything else but I am very happy with it. It was much louder than expected when I first began using it but I am use to that now (definitely need to have the bathroom door closed if your spouse is sleeping)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect In Every Way","review":"I actually look forward to using this toothbrush each time. It leaves your gums and mouth feeling stimulated and fresh. My dentist says my teeth have never been cleaner -- better placque removal than during all the years I used successive Sonicares. The Flexisoft Oral-B brushhead (included in the package) fits well into all crevices and corners, and seems to cup each tooth for a very thorough cleaning. The Polishing brushhead, also included, whitens my teeth as well as any bleaching product I ever tried.

Thank you Oral-B for such a superior and well-made product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whiten teeth w/o chemicals or bleach","review":"This brush work great!

I plan on buying the hummingbird flosser as well. Check out 3rd party clinical information and I think you'll find it all supports oral-b's 3D action vs. sonicare's sonic motion.

They also told me that they don't carry the tongue freshener anymore. Oh well, I have a regular tongue cleaner anyway. The 2 minute timer is pretty nice even though I don't pay attention to it at all. The pressure censor doesn't seem to work because no matter how hard I press, nothing happens.

The brush worked as well on day 7 as on day 1.I've only used the Sensitive brush on the sensitive setting and I feel like I'm doing good things for my teeth. I would recommend this product. My dentist specifically liked the feature that would stop the brushing action if I press too hard.

Short story is I have returned the Oral B to the manufacturer under their great 60 Day Challenge policy. In my experience, the Sonicaire is a much more effective product for the money. Just received my new one from Amazon yesterday.Pros:-Bit less expensive than some Sonicaire models.-60 Day Challenge which enabled me to try and return it.Cons:-My wife and were both unpleasantly surprised at how much the units vibrated our heads while brushing. Certainly not inspiring us to brush more/longer.-Used the unit for about a month and had a dental cleaning.

Once eroded the enamel does not build back. Though I used these brushed around 1 year back, my teeth are still sensitive ever since I used them.

Online safety and awareness of these types of scams are vital in today's tech world we live in.

This book is an easy read to understanding the history of 419 Nigerian Scams, and how these Romance Scams work. The stories are real, personal and truly heartbreaking on how these scams have touched many innocent people.

Instead of pushing more HIT (High Intensity Training) type workouts that are boring and just lead to injuries and burnout.

Although I have not the experience nor credentials that Mr. Smith and many of you have, I recommend taking the themes of this book and expanding in more detail, and ditching the numerous b&w still photos that really tell an exerciser little about the movements. If anything, provide photos of important do's and don'ts of the exercises, but don't half-change the movement with a photo to fill the pages.

He illustrated both the great events of contemporary history, such as the 1848 Revolution in Berlin and the Franco-Prussian War, as well as the mundane events of daily life. This catalogue, which was published to accompany an exhibition of the artist's works (and seen in Paris, Washington, DC, and Berlin) is the most complete English-language account of the artist's life and his art. The essays are written by expert curators and art historians. The volume is profusely illustrated, and include his key works, from his graphic illustrations of Frederick the Great to his Iron Rolling Mill of the mid-1870s. The catalogue will be of interest to historians, art historians, and the general public alike."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much of a difference","review":"I don't feel much of a difference.

I would think this is because the writer is from the US and doesn't know that much about England.

I suppose the topic isn't a suprise, because by the second chapter it almost seems as if the author wore a flowering frock and makeup while writing it.

I hadn't heard them before, but heard the music and had to check it out. Their CD is very nice as well. It grooves but is also very inventive. There's not much electronic music out there that is this high quality, and the fact that they can do it live adds to their appeal.

That said, I was skeptical of how well this product would work for women like me. This blow dryer not only stayed the course until my hair was dry, it also gave me the extension I was looking for in order to braid my hair more easily and made it feel smooth! The sideways design also helps me to dry my hair faster. I only used the wide toothed comb and thus far it has held up. Very satisfied."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard to find this kind of quality dryer","review":"This review is for the guy's who were 1st 'empowered' to use a hair dryer back in the 70's!Do you remember the \\"Dry Guy\\" line? I sure do! How I miss that yellow ( or sometimes red) powerhouse!Over the year's things have improved, and this is a sensational unit.The ion feature makes your hair dry faster, in my case about 50% faster than the non-ion units that have a similar design over 30 years or so.My last unit was one from Sharper Image, and cost 3x more than this one, and did not perform as well.The only reason this is not 5 star is that you are not offered a way to buy an extra brush attachment. I know guy's use this product in an alternate way than most girl's do, we burn them out less often!This is a bargain! Not a bad idea to have one in 'reserve' too! This product is great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good while it lasts","review":"I bought this in October and by the end of December it completely stopped working.

BUT not how to put the things you learn together and use it practically for day to day work. (and even to use in your portfolio)This authors trying to teach you to think AND learn. Something the previous reviewer missed. I found the book at the bookstore, looked it over from stem to stern and came home to order it at Amazon.

The batteries just don't get enough energy from the way-too-small solar panel (and this is in Texas where there aren't that many cloudy days). It helps to turn the lights off in the daytime because although they are supposed to turn off by themselves based on the ambient light level, they still seem to use more electricity than if they are turned off with the switch. Turned off during the day, they almost last a whole night.The \\"rock\\" really needs to be able to be plugged in, or else have a solar panel about four times the current size, or have two \\"rocks\\" which can be swapped out every week or so.Installation is very easy providing you have installed your lawn edging the right way up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unplayable","review":"I can't begin to explain how impossible this game is. The Ubertricks don't work, the regular tricks don't work, and it's just not fun. Don't give up on the Wii because of this game, but developers need to get over the novelty and just make good, playable games, not try things just to try them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Challenging, but in a good way.","review":"This game is hard. I will not beat around the bush. The first 20 minutes were painful, and I was frustrated. But you keep playing. Soon, carving is easier. You get to know your spins and flips, and in no time you can predict accurately how to rotate and land without bailing. Grabs are confusing at first, but with a little bit of effort you can pull them off.Personally, I love this game. I have felt that many games have been dumbing-down thier controls. This game is a welcome fresh breath of air and really showcases why the Wii controls are revolutionary.In closing- Don't listen to people who tell you the controls suck. They are excellent, but as they say, garbage in, garbage out. You get what you put into the game. It takes some time and some serious practice, but aren't you tired of beating a game in 4 hours (cough, cough, WarioWare)? Try it, you'll be pleasantly suprised."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great game series....poor controls","review":"I'm sad to report, as a big fan of the SSX series that the controls for this game ruin this game for me.... the tutorial was frustrating, and I didn't feel that the instructions were clear enough at all. I found the learning curve too steep for my attention span.....though, from reading others reviews - if you have the patience to stick it out - I'm sure it's a very fun game. So, in summary-SSX is a GREAT series of games, yet I wouldn't recommend this game to those without the time, patience, or attention span to invest in mastering the controls..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Multiplayer is unacceptable","review":"If you enjoy the multiplayer aspect of SSX games of the past (before SSX \\"On Tour\\") you will be disappointed to know that SSX Blur has the same fatal design flaw that plagued SSX On Tour. When racing against a friend, if you get more than 300 feet ahead of your competition, the game automatically pulls your competitor forward to your position. This nullifies any value in having a multiplayer aspect to this game.If you are strictly interested in the single-player aspect of this game, you may enjoy what this game has to offer. However, if you enjoy multiplayer, the limitations of this game are frustrating and annoying. Buy SSX 3 instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"A different way to play SSX","review":"If you like the SSX series, as I do, you are going to like this game. it is a totally new way to play SSX.

You have to own it. The music wails, the warrior hits the ring and shakes the ropes and acts like he will explode if he can't get it and fight. That takes me back to to the 90's, sitting on the floor watching these heroes go at it week in and week out. What I didn't know is that the warrior was probably the weirdest individual to ever grace the squared circle. His life was warrior and warrior was life. Everything that you saw in the ring and in interviews were probably accurate portrayals of what you got outside of the ring. This is an interesting look into the life of the warrior, where he is now, and why he's not selling out the garden any more. Buy this. You will not be disappointed, I promise you that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely Book","review":"Another beautiful book, nice text, beautiful artwork, nice story about a child learning about horseshoe crabs and their lives and their place in the natural cycle.

Nevertheless, I found it hard to put down, which is the true test of a book.

Few writers can make you feel what the character feels. Jane Smiley does. Amazing writing and a story that tugs at your heart and your sense of right and wrong. At times the actions of the characters do not make sense, and that makes the story more real. Scenes and actions are glued together with the inertia of life. And, no doubt, these are real people living simple, complex, happy and deeply dark and disturbed lives. Great book and I am glad I read it.

However, the novel proves that human nature is universal, no matter where one lives. Realistic and haunting, A Thousand Acres depicts well-rounded characters in a twisting plot. Smiley's language and style is beautiful; she incorporates the prarie theme well into her prose. She also writes insightfully about families, secrets, and people's dark motivations. I was engrossed from beginning to end and identified well with Ginny, the noble protagonist."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Thousand acres","review":"So this book was OK it didn't have to good of an ending like why did Jess stay with Rose and did even say bye to Ginny there was no closeing ,but I would recommend this book to a friend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow first half, soap opera second half","review":"Smiley's style of writing was not anything worthy of the Pulitzer, in my opinion. The first half of the book was just barely interesting enough to keep me from putting it down. Then the entire world started breaking down around the characters, and despite my frustration with the characters I couldn't stop reading. The characters were well constructed and as complex as real people. However, there seemed to be no redemption for any of the characters after such incredible suffering. In a way, this story of family fragmentation is probably many people's nightmare. I finished the book and felt that my emotions had been manipulated in a rather unsavory way."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite books!","review":"I liked this book so much I ordered the movie. It reads well, however it is a bit contrived so many events would be unlikely to happen. Character development is realistic. Overall this is about as good as it gets for pleasure reading!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why Did I have to read this book?","review":"I had to read this book for school, and it was probably one of the most horrifying books ever. The beginning drags on for so long with seemingly nothing happening, and then everything is just crammed into the end. Their are countless unnecessary scenes, and it made me want to pull my hair out. Also the characters are completely unlikable. All of them. They are all so unbelievably stupid, I can barely stand it. Every time a character seems to be developing some kind of redeeming quality, they do something ridiculously stupid and make me hate them again. I wouldn't reccomend reading this book unless you have to. Like I did. -_-"},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs some serious editing","review":"The premise is good, and the there's nothing wrong with the overall story -- in fact, I rather like the idea of approaching King Lear from Regan and Gonoril's point of view. However, the first half of this 300 page book is INCREDIBLY boring -- about the most exciting thing that happens in the first 150 pages is the purchase of some cabinets. I understand the need to start slowly and build a sense of suspense, but 150 out of 300 pages? Give me a break! And then in the last half everything happens so fast that it's a little disorienting. In short, the action could have been better distributed. The first 150 pages could have been easily reduced to 50 without really damaging the novel's integrity -- in fact, it would have made the book a lot more bearable to read and a lot more engaging. Sometimes, less is more."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Thousand Acres","review":"In a nutshell I describe this read as \\"a long road to a small house\\".

The book, although packed with issues and happenings, spreads the action out. It wouldn't be a good book for a slower reader because it woul take them more time in between each situation and they would get bored. There were so many different situations that weren't included in the movie. I thought they should have put in the part about Howard going blind and Ginny trying to poison Rose. All in all, I thought it was awonderful book and I woul recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Depressing!","review":"I was in a hopeful mood while reading this book. I kept looking for the light at the end of the tunnel but never found it. Nor did any of the characters. You have all the ingredients within this book that make for an interesting page turner - child abuse, incest, adultry, revenge, attempted murder... but no one learns a \\"lesson\\" from their transgressions. No one is \\"remorseful\\" for hurting others. When I finished this book, I felt like taking a shower. Reading this book was like being involved in something that you don't want to be involved in but can't get out of. I had to finish it, couldn't put it down but felt sickend with the ending. At least I can say, it made me realize how lucky I am for the life I have. I'll give it that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Longwinded boredom.","review":"By the time the author got all the characters onstage I no longer cared about them.

The book can stand pretty well on its own, without leading us to expect some sort of patricide in the end.

I got the impression that the author stitched together a fabric of characters and relationships and narrative modeled loosely on those of King Lear and then struggled to stretch and poke that fabric to make it fit over the King Lear framework. The result is a drab, boring story saved - (just barely) - only by excellent writing skills."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Book is Rated R","review":"I was reading A Thousand Acres it was on the recommended reading list for a Sustainable Agriculture program I am interested in. I was eager to read this book and find out how Smiley portrayed life on a farm. I was excited when I started the book and thoroughly enjoyed the author's style. However, as I read, I was shocked that there was a lot of cussing - I could overlook that though. As I read on, the book contained graphic nudity, complete lack of any kind of sexual morals and it all seemed totally shameless. The worst part is that none of these elements seemed at all necessary (especially to that level of graphicness). I did not finish this book - I didn't even make it half way through. I wish I hadn't read as far as I did as what I read was quite disturbing."},{"rating":"2","title":"inside the whitewashed farmhouse","review":"Way-too-human darker side of the many facets of the Midwest farm life, plus some deeply satisfying glimpses into its regional and natural history. A good read. I guess Smiley did create a very well-developed main character, because I still keep worrying about how she's doing. The others, however, were pretty one-dimensional, and more than a few of the plot turns seemed unrealistic, definitely not fleshed out, but I was completely willing to suspend disbelief in order to continue turning the pages to peer into the mind of that main character."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful","review":"It was a travesty when Smiley won the Pulitzer Prize for this dreadful book, an insipid soap opera masquerading as literature. Smiley bastardizes Shakespeare out of recognition when she turns King Lear into a movie of the week set in the plains of Iowa. Smiley decides to give the \\"Oprah\\" treatment to Shakespeare: she relocates the responsibility for Goneril and Regan's odious actions from their own sinister personalities (they are two of the Bard's greatest creations) to the Lear character, in this case a (gasp!) patriarch who (what else?) abused the girls as children. By the time you get to the scene in which the daughters, in a laughable excuse for dialogue, announce to each other, \\"He abused me!\\"--\\"Me too!\\", it's all too embarrassing for words."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good portrayal of \\"unfinished business\\"","review":"I think the book can be enjoyed on its own merits without reference to King Lear. Maybe King Lear inspired Jane Smiley but that does not necessarily meant that she expected readers to know this or relate it all back to her source of inspiration. I think it is a very well-written & masterly book simply because it shows what unfinished business does to people, & also how people can be affected by their relationship to a particular piece of land. I enjoyed it, not just for the pleasure in reading it, also in the thought it has provoked."},{"rating":"2","title":"A powerful story of one family","review":"While this book deals with almost too many issues-incest, infidelity, sibling rivalry, domestic abuse, alcoholism, losing a parent at a young age, just too name a few-the characters are richly drawn against the backdrop of farm life in Iowa from the 1950's to 1970's. The family and ever-present, ever-judgemental townspeople leap to life on the pages of this heartwrenching novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"And this won a Pulitzer Prize?","review":"The only reason I finished this book was because it won a Pulitzer Price. I kept figuring--it's got to get better. As a fellow midwesterner I found the story and characters believable but not very poignant, entertaining, or inspiring. A lackluster book"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull as dishwater","review":"I almost feel guilty criticizing this book since it got the Pulitzer. Almost.I've read other books by Jane Smiley and they bored me too - most of her characters have the bland sameness of university professors and her books have the conception of life's dramas that you get from an introductory level college lit class.I couldn't get through the first fifty pages without suffering narcoleptic fits. I finally gave up and decided that Dorothy Parker could sum up for me - this is not a book to be tossed lightly aside but rather hurled with great force.The Pulitzer committee must've been reading Smiley's press releases about this book, not the actual book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Contrived","review":"Jane Smiley's \\"A Thousand Acres\\" is a clumsy retelling of the old King Lear story set in midwestern USA farm country. The story is too contrived at times; odd things happen that seem were written just to make the story fit in with the King Lear premise. There are no characters that I came away caring about; Smiley plays with our emotions too much by hiding important developments until the last minute, and being too quick to send the plot through chaotic twists and turns. It feels voyeuristic; you watch these people's lives but at the end you haven't really accomplished anything. Smiley is a talented writer (try \\"Moo\\") but this book certainly did not deserve the Pulitzer Prize."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Thousand Acres","review":"This was an interesting novel that I enjoyed. The tragic events that occur throughout the book stunned me. Some things may seem to be unrealistic but that didn't ruin the story for me. The main character narrates her story and as the ending of the book nears, exciting and crazy events occur. I honestly could not put the book down at points it was so engaging. The feministic views of some characters in this book upset me and that is what makes a book emotionally involving. I would recommend this book to anyone as it is a quick and easy read that will make you think."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read","review":"I chose to read this novel as my ISU novel in school, and I did not regret my decision. I feel that Jane Smiley is brilliant because she is able to create a contemporary story on one of Shakespeare's more difficult plays. The characters are well drawn out; Ginny and Rose make readers sympathize with their emotions, whereas in the play they are the evil villains. One thing that was unexpected is the scene when Ginny makes the sausages to kill one of her relatives; I don't think that really worked, but everything else makes up for it. Initially, the story starts out quite slowly, but picks up the pace after Larry hands over his thousand acres of land. Wonderful read."},{"rating":"2","title":"I was in the heart and mind of the main character.","review":"I loved the book and the way the author put in pen the character of Ginny.

Perhaps this book could have been a good cautionary tale about the hazards for young women when they do not develop their abilities and instead hang all their fortunes on well-meaning promises of youth. Or this could have been a good tale of how to develop a quality life after experiencing a father with a fixation on being in control, and who prefers to ignore his sexual abuse of his daughters. It might have been a lot of things. As it is, the only lesson I could precipitate from this story is \\"trust no one\\", which in this case includes the author because the personality profiles drawn in one part of the book conflicts with a later profile of that same personality (authors who uncaringly contradict themselves are themselves abusive, because the time their readers spend in such mush is deemed of no value)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ho-HUMMM","review":"I wouldn't know where to begin.

I also resent the fact that one reviewer mocked another as a \\"silly young girl\\" because he/she didn't agree with her review. I thought her review was incredibly articulate and insightful. She sounded a lot more level-headed and intelligent that many adults whose comments I've read. So the book won a prize--that doesn't necessarily mean it's a good book that people will enjoy reading. The people that give out those awards are usually looking at more esoteric criteria than the average person when choosing what they consider \\"good\\" literature. The same is true of any medium (think of how many \\"critically-acclaimed\\" movies, for example, are bombs at the box office). Many books that have won awards with such accolades as \\"masterful imagery\\" or \\"searing portait of...\\" turn out to have little to offer in terms of just pure enjoyment.Thank you, Poor Parallels, for your great review."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHOAH!","review":"Well, I must say i enjoyed this book, although not from the start, i havent read any others of Smiley's books, but i feel that she took too long to get into the story, i read this book for my literature class, and at the beginning, i regreted my choice, although it did get better as it went on, but as most books, it has its faults."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just okay","review":"As a work of literary fiction, the prose was not particularly well-written and the characters were at best a collection of stereotypes. Most glaringly, I felt as though this was taking place now and not during the Carter era. Perhaps there was a lot of talk of organic farming, the brain chemistry/causes of psychological illnesses and informing children of the dangers molestation among farmers in the late 70s. I personally do not remember any of those issues being popularly discussed until the late 80s.This is the sort of marginally entertaining book that will hold your attention for the 3-4 days that it will take to read. However, there are far more interesting and moving books out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tried my best to enjoy it","review":"A classic example of what is wrong with modern literature. What starts as an interesting premise (King Lear set in Iowa -family turmoil, etc.) ends up being a patchwork of Opra Winfrey and Jerry Springer episodes, combined with extensive descriptions of farming. If Smiley wanted us to hate the male characters, she succeeds brilliantly, from the alchoholic molesting father to the hippie loser boyfriend who is painfully one-dimensional. A depressing waste of time and energy that has been adopted as a college standard. Read Smiley's Greenlanders instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, very difficult to finish!","review":"I was very disapppointed in this book.

I read this in a weekend, and not because I particularly liked this refined midwestern melodrama. There are some absorbing themes - I thought the connection between the pesticides that destroy the fertility of the land and the people and the poisonous legacy of rampaging patriarchy that destroys a family was interesting. My principal problem with this book is that people DO NOT ACT the way these characters do. There are explosive scenes between family members, and then days will pass as though nothing has happened. It's as if all of these characters were pod people imitating the emotional life of humans. This book gave me the creeps."},{"rating":"2","title":"King Lear today","review":"Jane Smiley just really can't write a bad book. The only reason I'm giving it 4 instead of 5 stars is because I think it could have been shorter and been improved by the editing.Thousand Acres starts out as idyllic: a family farm in 1979 in Iowa where everything seems to be humming along lovingly and perfectly. Larry Cook, the father (Lear) of three daughters, abruptly decides to turn the farm over to two of them, cutting the third out of the deal. Dark secrets emerge, recovered memories, the girls divide and unite among themselves and with or against their father. It's a story of love, hate, greed, pathos, and what it means to be 'family.' Painful to read in parts, but ultimately revelatory. Just needed an editor with a sharper pair of scissors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thanks so much!","review":"I received this book in record time.

It covers the movie in extraordinary detail pointing out things I hadn't seen or thought of in the many viewings I've made of Kubrick's finale. It refers frequently to the novella it's based on, Traumnovelle, and draws a lot of comparisons to the fin-de-siecle original and the end-of-the-20th century contemporary setting of the movie. Loved this book. Buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really bad","review":"Maybe it is Kubrick's fault, as Eyes Wide Shut is a very obtuse piece of work. As such, I really wanted to learn more about it themes and narratives and film techniques. The BFI books are generally very good, but this specific one is really bad. It is probably the worst piece of nonfiction I've encountered in a long time. Not to be unkind, but Chion provides endless pointless meandering unfocused crazy observations.I would like to meet the editor who greenlighted this project and ask him or her some questions about that decision.I think the vast majority of people who read this book will be extremely disappointed in it, as was I. sorry!"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"A Not-Unhappy Ending\\"","review":"Stanley Kubrick was quoted in several books as saying, \\"I would never argue with (any) interpretation of (my) films.\\"Smart move.

In the tradition of Sherwood Anderson's Winesburg, Ohio, Leff connects the seemingly disparate lives and stories of a community of residents and staff members in an apartment building in one of New York City's elite neighborhoods. Leff's characters pull us into their world with rich and vivid detail, and their voices come to life as one reads. I'm very glad I discovered this novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good book.","review":"I very much enjoyed Valerie Ann Leff's debut novel centering on the inhabitants of 980 Park Ave, a fictional co-op in Manhattan. Each chapter focused on a different tenant in the building as well as a different year, all the while tying in characters and events from other stories so that the reader is never left wondering what ever happened to so and so. I was rather impressed how Leff managed to keep each characters voice fresh and distinct throughout the book making the reader believe that many different people are indeed telling the story.\`BETTER HOMES &HUSBANDS;' is charismatic, appealing and never dull, a great first effort from an author we should all keep an eye out for. Anyone who loves to relax and curl up with a good book at the end of a long day I highly recommend this delightful novel to you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Delightful, Insightful Read","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed Leff's Better Homes and Husbands and its front-row ticket to the drama that is daily life for New York City's rich and famous. Leff crafted her story with a fine hand and presents neither a satire nor a glamor-shot of this rarefied world. I especially appreciated the diverse ethnicity of the characters and their presentation as real people who behave in unpredictable rather than stereotypical ways. The book offers plenty of political and social subtext as well as a healthy dose of humor. If there are any heroes, they are mostly heroines who make brave and interesting choices that rock the social order just enough to set the walls trembling. The novel is full of surprises all the way through to its optimistic ending. I look forward to more of Leff's work."},{"rating":"2","title":"A quick read.....","review":"Set in a luxurious Manhattan apartment building, this book spans thirty years and divulges the secrets of various residents. But this story is more of an ensemble piece, so the stories don't necessarily interconnect. In my opinion the author did have an ideal opportunity to achieve a sense of cohesion by utilizing the character of Vinnie. In the beginning of the book he is working as a doorman in the building and eventually makes his way into a position of prominence by becoming a major fashion designer. The author could have taken it a step further by having Vinnie eventually purchasing the building's penthouse, thus making the story a rags to riches tale, or the little guy overcoming obstacles. Instead the characters and the story remain in a state of flux.However, I did thoroughly believe that the author had an insight to the often insulated world of Manhattan's Upper East Side and manages to create credible characters and plausible stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok book","review":"If you like reading a bunch of short stories, this is a good book. I will agree some of the \\"discrimination\\" wasn't exactly called for but it didn't play a key part in the book. It's not a novel as it states. More of a combination of different short stories into people's lives. It's a great book if you have nothing else better to do or read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Offensive","review":"First of all, this is not a novel: it's a collection of stories about people who live or work in the same Upper East Side building. It annoys me when publishers try to sell a book as a novel when it's not one.The writing is good and Ms. Leff clearly knows the people she writes about (her bio points out that she grew up in a building on Fifth Avenue). But what I really minded about the book--what I found simply offensive and bigoted--was the fact that of all the characters in the book (poor, rich, happy, miserable, educated, ignorant) the only two who break the law (and, in the case of one of them, end up in jail) are, of course, the Latin Americans. And we are not talking of poor, desperate immigrants, but of two prominent and wealthy South Americans who break immigration laws and launder money for reasons only known to them. I found Ms. Leff's portrait of Latinos totally unacceptable and offensive, which is the reason I won't be reading her next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great novel for summer reading","review":"Wonderful characters, great menus, plenty of drama.

Her boss is a recovering alcoholic but insists that she drinks with the customers. I felt nothing towards many of the characters. There is no developing of them. At the end of the books I felt like I knew what went on in a busy restaurant more than I knew the characters. Adrienne is attracted to Thatcher (her boss) and then they become a couple.

And what type of person would hold him, refusing to marry him or have a relastionship because she is dying, yet keep such a hold on him that he can never have a relationship with anyone else?

I think the author could do a better job differentiating between the dad and love interest in terms of dialogue (they almost seemed identical character-wise).

I picked it up because it looked like a nice, light summer book, but I stopped 80 pages before the end. Although the description of the restaurant business was interesting, I did not like any the characters and there was absolutely no chemistry between Adrienne and Thatcher. Overall, I was incredibly disappointed that I had wasted my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"A dud","review":"I've read several of this author's books. I love being transplanted to Nantucket. This book transplanted me to a restaurant on Nantucket. Didn't get the Island vibe like her other books. I picked this book for an interesting story line not the dishes the Blue Bistro served.

Just the perfect read for a weekend or plane ride. This story amazingly draws you in, the author gives just enough backstory on each character to get you up to speed while she keeps the story moving. The author also cleverly weaves a mystery that keeps you AND the main character guessing right up to the end. I gave this book four stars only because the story's ending would have been better if the main character realized she HAD actually fulfilled all 3 of her rules--and was indeed the better for it, that there was no need for her to keep trying to create a romantic partnership with someone so heavily into melodrama as her former boss.

It is absolutely amazing to me that an author can spend thirty years telling stories and forget more than he learns about storytelling.

I use one for cotton balls (doesn't hold a lot but I don't use them very often) and two for Q-Tips (one in each bathroom - they hold around 150 Q-Tips each easily). Would also be great for ponytail holders, Band-Aids, sample pouches, etc. Lids are air tight so I don't have to worry about spiders or bugs getting in and they look great on the counter. The glass is heavy, like the description states, so know that before you buy. I ran them through the dishwasher right after opening them and they went through fine.

I have done Tai Chi in the past and thought she'd enjoy it. Paul Lam's style involves visual example and verbal description, and the older participants he uses were good for her to identify with. However, even on the first viewing the amount of dialogue made it difficult to deal with, left my mother & I standing and waiting impatiently for him to move on to the next pose. Since with DVD you can't fast-forward past the dialogue, it would have been better to demonstrate the moves without so much discussion before going on to putting the sequences together."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good start for Tai Chi","review":"In reading some of the reviews, I can't help but think some are missing the point. While I am only in my early 30s, the silver-hairs did not distract me from learning Tai Chi from this DVD. While some of them don't move as smoothly as some can, Dr Lam does move quite well and provides an excellent example of the proper form. As for the dialogue, after you listen to it a few times, you should be able to do the moves at your own pace and if you get ahead of the DVD, simply stand and meditate and wait for it to catch up. I use the remote on my DVD player to rewind and fast forward so I can do things at my own pace. If you are starting Tai Chi, this DVD should work for you. If you are more experienced, then this may bore you quickly. All I know is that I have slept better in the last week than I ever have (I do Tai Chi at night, right before bed).

I remembered from other reviews that there is an episode guide tucked under the bottom flap of the box, and sure enough, there it was. I had some trouble getting the hatch on the back of Bender's head to open the first time, but I figured out the trick to it.

It not only makes a ton of noise, and I have sprayed it liberally in all areas using a quality dry lubricant made specifically for exercise equipment, but the motion is stiff and jerky no matter how much you adjust the knob. It also has a tendency to tip backwards if you happen to not have your feet all the way forward on the treads. I wish I had saved the packaging so I could return it. I also wish I had seen these latest negative reviews before I bought and not only that I paid way more just a few weeks ago than what it costs today. Just a totally disappointing experience no matter how I look at it. Shame on companies like Fitness Quest for putting such garbage out on the market and taking people's hard earned money away from them for nothing in return.

Along the way, it depicts elements of the warrior ethic, letting the audience decide what constitutes honor, bravery and the greater good. And it gives us an ending to ponder at length through the questions it raises: When is war justified? What makes a hero? What sacrifices are necessary? Is it possible to achieve peace?It's also very beautiful--beautifully filmed, acted and choreographed.

This story goes beyond a love triangle into a larger polygon. An annoyance is the minor character Murasaki. In Japanese they don't use \\"he\\" or \\"she\\", but the translator refurred to \\"him\\" as a \\"her.\\" But Murasaki is wearing a traditional mens costume & looks nothing like a woman to boot (he actually looks like that guy from Hikaru no Go) Becides, the mangaka stated in an extra that becide the need to draw maids there were no women in book 3."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet and Adorable!","review":"Rarely have I liked & continued to like a series such as this one. Even the best of series will usually get old after a few readings, but no so with this series!The series surrounds Mitsuo & his misadventures as he discovers that he's just psychic enough to see ghosts, as well as to be posessed by them. The first one he finds ends up posessing him to be near her crush Hasunuma, who also attends the same school as Mitsuo. Hasunuma, however, seems to have designs on Mitsuo...I thoroughly liked this volume. The pacing was nice, the characters are all highly likable, & the artwork is gorgeous. I'd definately recommend this for a first-timer in the yaoi/BL genre, as there's nothing truly objectionable in this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"So cute!","review":"Do not believe the back of the book when it says that Hasunuma collapses during rehearsal. There is no rehearsal(he's not even in a play!). But that part of the story does revolve around a former drama club member-turn-ghost. I really love the first story in the book though. This series is very sweet and it's one of my faves! I recommend getting this book, though I shall warn those that are homophobic. If you are, find something your taste. If you're not, then get this series!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A bit too soft for my taste...","review":"While I was overjoyed to find that companies are now publishing boyxboy content, I found that it was a bit too shonen-ai for my taste. Especially since I was hoping it would end up a little bit more on the yaoi side of things. But overall it was a cute comedy, a bit dissapointing in the final volume more due to the seme/uke roles rather than the story itself.I don't regret buying it though, It gives me something fluffy to read every once in awhile. So if you love shonen-ai this probably will be your cup of tea...however, if you like yaoi it most likely will leave you unfulfilled-- \\"You are my love prize in viewfinder\\" anyone?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Eerie Queerie at a glance","review":"At first glance of the cover it looked like Eerie Queerie was just a manga version of the cast from the show \\"Queer Eye For the Straight Guy\\". So of course it all ready seemed intriguing. What?s not to love about yoai boys?! After reading the brief over view of the back the book it is not exactly as it first seemed. It is so much better; it invokes all the curiosities of school life, spirits, love, hope, and much more. Shiozu-san definitely knew she was going to win the readers over.I give this book four stars. It is guaranteed Eerie Queerie cannot be put down. If you like probable yoai, romance, and the misfit finding friends, you'll love Eerie Queerie. The only problem with Eerie Queerie is that it is so captivating that the waiting until the next book comes out seems like forever."},{"rating":"1","title":"No more pain","review":"It was another book of someones personal journey.

He's one of the few Dutchmen on record who doesn't overwhelm, or underwhelm, or whine, or sound geriatric. He has loads of low-resonance foundation to support his ringing top. Like Ferdinand Frantz before him he was a low dark bass who extended his upper register by sheer willpower. Astrid Varnay is haunting too! She gives it, maybe, up to fifty percent of her volume capacity which is about right for the role. Windgassen sounds more gutsy and emotional than his usual cerebral approach to his characters. The least interesting acting comes from Ludwig Weber, but it may not be his fault. It's easy to forget, in the age of Matti Salminen, that Daland is not supposed to be the main character. It's like Masetto, if you distract from the other characters you're not doing your job. Knappertsbusch does just what you would expect: awesome, tender, reverent, natural, slow but not heavy (most of the time)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shakespeare Coloring Book","review":"Great for the classroom or at home.

It reviews everything from epistemology to the logic of contingency, with insights here and there about such topics as the observer biases (about computing probabilities when our existence has been linked to a particular realization of the process).I am not a philosopher but a probabilist; I found that this book just spoke to me. It certainly rid me of my prejudice against modern philosophers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as great as the TV series","review":"Ok.....so my first shot at watching Sordid Lives was the TV series that has been airing on Logo.

The acting wasn't that great which is kind of odd because a lot of the characters in the movie are in the series. I guess over the years they've gotten better.

I'm from Texas - I grew up with hicks and these characters were sub-standard imitations. I always miss that magical mix of the absurd with characters that you empathize with in Del Shores writing.

As humorous as is Leslie Jordan's cross-dresser portrayal, it quickly becomes apparent that most of the fun being poked is aimed at his hillbilliness and not his swishiness. The only character presented as normal is a Texas-born hollywood gay whose acting in nude, homoerotic productions is treated as artistic--while the implication is that the homefolk are low-brow and ill-bred. Yet, half the characters show no sign of sordidness, and some are straight-laced and preachily moralistic. About white trash this movie aint. It's about everyday rural people whose actions and comments are--as in real life--occasionally funny.

Yes, it's low budget, and what the hell is Olivia Newton John doing in it?

The hunky narrator character could have been left on the cutting room floor as the movie almost skids to a stop whenever he is on camera. However, Leslie Jordan (Beverly Leslie on TV's Will & Grace) gives a simply amazing performance that will knock your wig off!

My friends and I thought sure it would be released in the art house theaters..and we waited...and waited...and were quite surprised that it seemed to just disappear (although I did hear it was quite a hit in Palm Springs, CA and a few other theaters around the country ).So I patiently waited for it to come out on DVD and I am happy to say that it is just as funny as I remember. It has many, many laugh-out-loud moments and the entire cast is great. However, Leslie Jordan as Brother Boy and Beth Grant as Sissy are standouts and you will be quoting their lines all the time...they are just that good! And the DVD comes with lots of extras for the truly obsessed Sordid Lives fan!I know that My Big Fat Greek Wedding was a movie that became a hit by word of mouth. I think it is time that Sordid Lives became a DVD hit too! So spread the word..."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a drag....","review":"I expected this movie to be halfway good since it had some familiar celebrities like Beau Bridges, Delta Burke and Olivia Newton-John. However, this movie falls short of its ambition to be a must-have in any gay man's library. The movie starts out somewhat convoluted and you don't know which direction its quite headed. Although there are brilliant acting performances, the plot doesn't seem to capture interest and the dialog misses the target when it is supposed to be funny or moving. The Tammy Wynette impersonator is way over-the-top too. You'd be better off borrowing this DVD from a friend if they happen to have it rather than spending money renting it or buying it."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was strange","review":"I enjoyed the movie however it was strange and had a low budget feel to it. The acting was corny but funny. The movie quality was not great. It appeared to have been taped with a hand held video camera. The piont was to depict white trash and it did that in spades. This is the first time I have ever seen Olivia Newton-John play a trampy type of roll and it was hard to believe since I have always seen her in more angelic types of rolls. Overall it was enjoyable and funny. I think we need more comedy and less drama, in that regard it was a breath of fresh air."},{"rating":"2","title":"loved it","review":"i have watched this movie 5 times and just love it....funny funny funny,,,,i highly recommend when you are feeling down,,,plug this in....it will change your attitude...phil"},{"rating":"2","title":"too funny every time","review":"I have laughed and shared this with everyone I know and they are still laughing with me..

I was expecting something between Mama and Roseanne. Thankfully, there was a lot more. Playful and apt references to other films in the public consciousness (Thelma and Louise, for example) latched onto surrealistic spoofs of southern/country culture (Tammy Wynette in drag) in highly amusing ways. Yet, there is an air of confessional (the gay son, the proud mother, the cheating husband, the redneck boyfriend) that lends an air of authority and truth to the film. While it is something that \\"could never be\\" it is simultaneously something that \\"is every day.\\"In short, the writing is good and the acting is superlative. If you are able to step back and look at yourself and your neighbor and laugh - at least at the deviance - then this is a film for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rough around the edges, but so good!","review":"There's some great acting in this movie. Leslie Jordan fully deserved an award, and Ann Walker and Olivia Newton-John were also stellar. Adding to the movie's plus side is the man playing Ty, the super cute Kirk Geiger. Sadly, the movie is very obviously low budget. Early on, I was a bit bothered by the seeming hand-held camera video quality, but I was soon won over by the power of the performances and the entertaining and ridiculous story, which is well written. This is a movie that is definitely worth seeing. (For those who delight in catching errors, there's at least one flub in the actual cinematography, when a microphone is reflected in a picture hanging on the wall. )"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious, irreverent, poignant ! ! !","review":"My partner and I THOROUGHLY enjoyed Sordid Lives!!!!!

The houses are right, the decor and accents are perfect.Delta Burke seems to fall into her role naturally, being southern herself. I am not sure why Olivia is here, but it is nice to see her.I couldn't get past the fact that the film looks so cheap. I realize it is an independent film. But OY, it looks like a camcorder was used to film it.The scenes with Brother Boy were hilarious, saved the film, and even drew a chuckle out of me. His \\"de-homosexualization\\" therapy was hilarious. That is the only strong point here."},{"rating":"1","title":"A few laughs but a poor man's Steel Magnolias","review":"I watched this with friends the other night having heard wonderful things about it. Maybe I went in with too high of expectations but I thought the characters were a bit too over the top and the dialogue was pretty bad. This movie is stock full of wonderful actors who used to have great careers but you would never know it from here. Oliva, who I have always been a fan of seems stranded in a seperate movie until the last scene and the rest of the actors seemed to have been told to chew up scenery at every turn. Sure there's a few amusing bits but by the time it came to the end, I was just plain bored.If you want a funny movie about a bunch of whacky character, rent Steel Magnolias."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sordid Lives is ONE FUNNY MOVIE!","review":"I have not laughed this hard in I don't know how long. My face hurt! Everyone in the movie was laughing OUT LOUD throughout the entire show. I'm so surprised this was not a HUGE block-buster movie. All of the characters were so unique - and their personalities came through so you felt you knew them. Very clever writing, with so many jokes built in to every word. I'm buying this as soon as it's on DVD - it's one of those movies you can put on at any time and laugh like it's the first time you've seen it."},{"rating":"2","title":"White Trash Texas Melodrama Supreme","review":"I'll keep it short and simple. 1) See this Movie 2) It is about some white trash Texas folks and will make you scream with laughter. The underlying lessons of love and acceptance are great but I defy anyone to say they don't think this movie is screamingly funny! Go see it now."},{"rating":"2","title":"This thing is amazing","review":"The first time I watched this, I would have given it maybe three stars, but it's one of those that the more ya watch, the more ya get out of it. Being from the South, I can appreciate the trailer humor down to the last \\"bless her heart\\" and Bonnie Bedelia wanting to know if he son is \\"the man or woman\\". Delta Burke is superb and does have some Suzanneque moments. This movie is a great opportunity to see some actors in very different roles.... Olivia Newton-John is very amazing as Bitsy, plus it showcases that still great voice she has. Get this and watch it a few times.... you'll get hooked, bless your heart!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Are all southerners really this trashy?","review":"Ok, so I received a glimpse of cheap white trash from Gone with the Wind. But in Sordid Lives, I was treated to 110 minutes of southern homour. Yes, it is very over the top, but that's part of the movie's charm. So if you're in the mood to just laugh at life's absurd situations, this release will suit the moment.Olivia Newton-John's musical talent really adds to the ensemble. Delta Burke is at her best playing high strung southern types. The rest of the cast lend their comic genius to the mix.Sordid Lives surpassed my expectations. It has the makings of becoming a cult classic. I expect I'll watch it again....very soon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sordid Lives... the Movie","review":"The movie was hilarious... and the cast good... but the later TV series was a little better....

One's attention could easily wander past the generic, sometimes meandering themes and orchestrations of Bacalov's design, not helped by the presence of music by Mozart, Beethoven and Chopin that is more attractive and serves to liven things up with musical nobility. The Orchestra of Rome performs, featuring capable piano solos by the composer.

Normally A&E makes a mean costume drama, but /Benedict Arnold/ stank like rotting poultry. The dialogue was stilted and incredibly unrealistic, the battle scenes were rendered in clunky slo-mo to cover up the lack of extras, and the costumes appeared to have been rented from a cheap Halloween shop (with the exception of the military uniforms, especially the Continentals', which were accurate). Aidan Quinn chewed the scenery into pulp and used \\"historical voice\\" (the lame semi-British accent affected by actors in costume drama). Kelsey Grammer was pretty darn good as Washington, but his lines were horrid, horrid stuff ripped from the pages of a grade-school history text. Worst of all were the simpering John Andre and Peggy Arnold, whose rose-garden courtship scene was laughably bad. In short, don't even bother to rent this. It's an hour and a half of your life that would be better spent cleaning the house or napping."},{"rating":"1","title":"As bad as it gets","review":"Bad casting, bad acting etc etc. I could go on but the others giving it one star have pretty much covered it. ~G"},{"rating":"1","title":"Woof","review":"What a dog of a movie.

Didn't harm the look or feel of the carpet in any respect, either.If that changes, I will leave a comment in the section under this review (this is why I gave the product 4 stars, I felt I had to be cautious just in case the cat urine smell comes back.

The art seemed, roughly put, ugly at first, but after getting into the story, I got so used to it that I began to see the beauty of the characters.

Otherwise, it was fairly easy. The instructions are not the best but not bad either - certainly have encountered worse. A nice addition of begining exercise regiment is included.Now for the machine itself. The seat is comfortable and glides smoothly as does the pull mechanism. Resistence is comfortable. The only negative is the foot rest - the strap is a bit high and the heel support narrow. It allows the feet to slide out frequently."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Machine for the Price","review":"I was skeptical about the rowing machine from the start, due to some reviews being quite negative on the machine. However, I have been using the machine daily for about two weeks now and I don't have any major complaints. The resistance is decent. If your looking to row for 5 minutes on high resistance to build quick muscle, don't bother with this rower. I row for endurance purposes and it works just as well as any other rower. Setup took maybe 20 minutes. The only problem I found was the length of the chain. I am 6 foot 1 inch and the chain stops short of a full row. I manually adjusted the chain, but if your tall and not mechanically savvy, I don't recommend the rower. I was on a crew team for some time and the rower isn't a concept 2, but it delivers enough performance for a normal daily workout."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lives up to its reputation","review":"Great rower for the price. If you do not want to spend the money on a water rower, get the Integrity 3000. I found the assembly easy and straight forward. I have used it near daily for a few months, and it is sturdy and solid; even with my weight. The mechanisms are smooth and comfortable. Once you get the fan going, the resistance works well.

This machine has come to my rescue. Aside from being difficult to assemble and having a 250 lbs weight limit, it's great. Great to do in front of the television, rowing combines both aerobic and anaerobic excercise-aerobic to lose weight and anaerobic to build muscle. While at first glance, it may seem to be more upper body than lower, 80% of the work in rowing is the legs.So, if you're looking for solid low impact excerise you can do in front of the TV and you weigh less than 250 lbs, then this is the machine for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk!!

Thank you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gags Galore","review":"These episodes from Mel Brooks' short-lived 1975 television series are good, wacky fun. Brooks and his team present a gag-filled, often hilarious send-up of the Robin Hood legend, some two decades before the feature film, \\"Robin Hood: Men in Tights\\" (which suffers by comparison with this series). Talented Dick Gautier is well cast as the dashing hero, while Dick Van Patten displays admirable comedic skills as the portly and always hungry Friar Tuck. Among the cast (many of whom will be recognizable to fans of 1970's television) are Sid Caesar as a French nobleman and Misty Rowe as a ditzy, sexy, and scheming Maid Marian. Watch for Dudley Moore's guest role, which includes a turn at the piano, as a visiting sheik who plans to wed Marian!Overall, this is fun television -- complete with sight gags, nutty dialogue, over-the-top anachronisms, a silly theme song, and skillful comedic acting. For fans of Brooks, historical parody, and 1970's television, this is highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"great thermos","review":"I love this little thermos.

You can treat yourself out of the depression if only you are sure that it is not a chemical unbalance. If you find that your depression is certainly caused by something that happened to you (loss of a loved one, etc.)you can make a choice where you can be depressed for the rest of your life or choose to accept what cannot be undone and move on. This book should be read with open mind but should not be taken as an absolute solution to this problem. However, one thing is true, mind is a mood controller... how you feel depends on your mind's perception of things."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book titles are chioces","review":"I am concerned that the title of this book implies that those people who suffer from clinical depression are somehow at personal fault for their disease and, perhaps even worse, have somehow \\"failed\\" if they take prescribed medications to remain healthy."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book - great information","review":"Sometimes the author is a little bit overzealous in her views, but looking past this, her writing is entertaining and interesting.

Later I enjoyed choosing major depression and social phobia. All of these choices have turned my life around for the best. I enjoy being misunderstood and living in social isolation. And oh baby, how I love the fear of having to explain my depression/anxiety to potential friends and women. So, for the record, anyone who thinks that a person would choose depression is dillusional.

She doesn't seem to understand that not all depressions are the same. She fails to understand how high-achieving, productive people still get depressed, or that some diseases are biochemical (like manic depression) and that unhappiness can't always be cured by happy thoughts and yelling \\"Green Frog!\\" If you weren't depressed before you read this book, you may be soon afterward."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wading Through This Book Is A Choice","review":"While I remain interested in the topic and I'm in furious agreement with the basic premise that Depression is a \\"kind of choice,\\" I had a very difficult time making sense of this text. I kept thinking, did the author not have editors to correct her machine gun style \\"free association\\" written ramblings. This book's philosophy (though not necessarily the book itself) could be a great contribution to the institutionalized drug industry market hype that pills are the answer for the poor \\"victims\\" who have come down with the dreaded depression disease.

I came away from the book feeling a little inspired but mostly empty. Ms. Curtiss has some good insights but the whole idea of abandoning all drugs in an effort to rid oneself of depression might be dangerous for some. It was for me personally! I went off of my prescription, thinking I could win the war with depression without the aid of drugs. Within days I fell into a deep and desperate (suicidal) depression that refused to budge. I went ahead and got back on the medicine and have not felt that low ever since!

Although I found prozac to be very helpful, it eventually stopped working for me along with other antidepressant medication. If medication is the \\"fix it\\" for depression, and the medication does not work for you, or you are unable to take it, it is frightening to feel that you are a victim to depression.With this incredible life saving book A.B. Curtis reminds us that we do have the power to make changes in our lives. Her exercises that she recommends work! Overcoming depression is not easy. We will never completely be cured, but with this book we learn that we can take responsibility for our lives, and win the battle with depression.

However, other than the protagonist, Rick Beanblossom, none of the characters are very deeply drawn. I did not find the book to be very suspenseful; it bogs down in the middle to the point that you begin to lose interest, and the author never really gives you an alternative to the obvious villain.Having said all that, if you have a few hours to kill on a plane, this is a decent story and the writing is a cut above the usual mass market thriller."},{"rating":"2","title":"On my Top Ten list","review":"What a find in Steven Thayer! The Weatherman has it all; suspense, twists, side stories and a pulse that makes you read late into the night. The back story involves the horrors and aftermath of Vietnam and is told in a voice that makes it so real to the reader, you almost can feel the pain. I'm not waxing poetic on this either, this really is a remarkable piece of work. A modern day serial killer is on the loose and yet everything ties back to Vietnam and the men that fought there. You will remember the characters in this story long after you put it down. The ending's a doozy as well!

The background is also quite good; theinformation about meteorology and life in a TV newsroomwere interesting in their own right, while adding to the story.The writing style is quite brisk, as a rule. The plot movedright along until the very end where, unfortunately, theprocess of a state execution is described in detailreminiscent of \\"The Chamber\\".

The only redeeming value of this book are the statistical citations (i.e. where she was born, where she went to school, etc.). The author is clearly trying to cash in on J.K. Rowling's success by writing a piece of drivel that is reminiscent of the desperation in final essay time in college; lots of padding little substance.Smith makes giant leaps of logic in trying to detect inspiration from Rowling's life in her novels. These leaps are transparent and many of them seem more unlikely than possible.I truly hope that either J.K.

Here's an example from Chapter One: \\"Her father provided her first memory of books when he read her the Wind in the Willows while she was stuck at home with the measles.

So you can document the event and write the details on the page to the right and then include a few sample pictures on the page on the left. The page on the right also does a great job of listing out what moments you should write about, and how.

The hand print/footprint kits are okay, though I wish it came with more cards for mistakes since it took us many tries to get a good print for either baby. I like that there's a place for a picture and hand print/footprint on the cover. I don't like how the pages don't lay down nicely and you have to bed the page to get it to lay flat. This is especially a problem since the places for pictures are on the back sides of the pages and if you're using photo corners to add a picture, you really need the page to lay flat. I also wish there were more prompts for things like baby's first ______.I'm going to get rid of these and use Hallmark's baby book instead. It has more prompts, it's has three ring binding so the pages lay flat, and there are places for pictures on both sides of the pages. This book, unfortunately, made for an expensive hand print/footprint kit since it's going in the trash!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not care for the baby book.

I have 3 kids and work full-time and I just don't have that kind of time. I wanted to return it - the company gave me the run around for a week and then told me it was too late to return it ( had been 29 days and they allow only 30 - including shipping time).

All but one of the segments were over in just four minutes! These were far too short. However, the last segment goes on for twenty minutes! This was far too long.This DVD is too tame and lame.

It provides a basic overview of fundamental helping skills appropriate to a wide variety of situations. Particularly useful is the section on \\"Helping Skills for Understanding,\\" which includes detailed explanations of the various skills which contribute to active listening. The information on problem-solving and other behavior strategies offer some utility as well, but the minimal attention given to more advanced behavioral skills does not do these areas justice. Similarly, the chapter on loss and crisis provides some useful information, but it also oversimplifies an extremely complex area.

At times the author loses track of 9i and speaks as if the book is about Oracle 8i (perhaps missing new 9i enhancements?).

Since the classes are compressed and fast this book has cleared up a lot of information that was only touched upon by my instructor.Since I have not taken the exam I cannot predict how useful this book is for preparation; however, it gives clear information and has more than once allowed me to understand concepts that I was unable to get in class.Note: there are editing flaws and inconsistent writing that do make this book ponderous at times.

The text book and accompaning testing software is loaded with grammer/syntax errors. In addition, the explanations are very brief and inadequate. Most importantly, the questions are not in line with the questions you will encounter on the exam. This latest book from author Couchman is a vast improvement over his previous works on Oracle 8 and 8i which were really simplistic. Although this is the only book at present for Oracle 9i certification, I strongly recommend waiting until the Sybex series are published. If the Sybex 9i books are anything like their predecessors - they will be EXCELLENT for preparing you for the real exam. In addition, the STS testing software is much more suitable than this books BeachFront quizzer.

It's the first time I have read it in about 20 years or more and to be honest it was a little disappointing.By the time you finish the book, you think that it has been edited down from a larger story, there are too many questions left to answer. Who is Odd Fossengan? What did he know? Who was he working for? Who killed Major Ryland? What did they learn from the pyramid? The list of questions goes on!Some of these questions are even asked in the book, but they are never answered, leaving the reader to wonder why they were even asked.All in all, the book appears to be an unfinished work, rushed out for publication and could even have been an episode in the 6 million dollar man series.So I would reccommend Cyborg but neither Operation Nuke or High Crystal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Multilayered film, full of associations, is also very funny","review":"My wife (who spent most of her life in Iran--and much of her adult life under the current Islamic government) and I (who have never visited Iran) saw this film recently and agreed that it was excellent. It is a \\"director-making-a-movie\\" film in the vein of Fellini's \\"8 1/2\\" or Allen's \\"Stardust Memories\\"--hence full of life/art observations--but contains wry political observations I don't recall in either of these other films. Death is a constant presence here; the director, after not making any films for 20 years, due to the censorship of the regime, is making a documentary on funeral practices in Iran. The deaths of several characters--including the director's own--interweave in ways that are both touching and hilarious. It also introduces the non-Irani viewer to a sense of everyday middle-class life in modern Iran.Don't miss this one! A real gem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"Our family recently saw some Iranian movies at a film festivle so I thought it would be fun to see more. However this proved me wrong.

This show could do both serious sci-fi drama or undemanding kids entertainment, but I don't think it managed to get either one right here. Even the high-camp Pertwee era, which was aimed straight at the kids, was usually much better than this. It is entertaining in its way, but despite being full of action and event, I thought it really went nowhere and didn't take an interesting route getting there.I could really pick it apart, but I won't bother. If you're a Doctor Who fan, you're probably familiar with it enough to know whether you want to buy it. But if you're not, I'd definitely reccomend you pick up something else first. \\"Doctor Who\\" was an amazing TV show, but precious little in this story will give you any idea why. Save this one for later."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"I'm sorry to hear about your coccyx, too, Miss Grant...\\"","review":"Before \\"Battlefield\\", there was The time Monster. A mix of sci-fi and Atlantean mythlogy. The Time Monster strarts out decent enough, with the return of the Master working on TOMTIT, sort of a temporal matter transmission machine, while the Doctor hunts him down with clues he had in a dream. there are some interesting ideas, and our friends from UNIT have some humor included. But, like all Pertwe six-parters, The Time Monsters comes to a complete and sudden stop when they reach the mythological Atlantis. A few good lines can't help the last 2 episodes. The scenes betwen the Doctor's and the Master's TARDIS are amusing, but this can hardly salvage one of the worst of Season 9."},{"rating":"2","title":"Groovy, hi-camp fun","review":"Well, it's not the best of the Pertwee era, but it's not the worst, and it's certainly good fun. And Roger Delgado is true to form as the best Master of all Time and Space. Pertwee and Katy Manning have great chemistry as always. Look out for Dave Prowse (aka Darth Vadar's body) - he's the one with the bull's head that charges Jon Pertwee and his cape. The TARDIS console room gets a face lift, complete with Tupperware bowls in the walls. The Chronivore (antagonist #2 - his whites are VERY white!) is laughable, as he swings through the studio on invisible wires... BUT - if you're watching Doctor Who to see great special effects, you're missing the point! Grab some friends, some snack food and some drinks, and treat yourself to some truly groovy, 1970s fantasy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good actually","review":"This is one of those stories that gets knocked in fandom as not being very good but I must disagree with that view. The story is tight and hangs together pretty well for being a six parter. The acting is very good from both the regulars and guest cast. The picture quality is from restored NTSC tapes and, while some problems remain, the picture quality is much better than the old VHS version I had from a PBS broadcast I taped in the early '80's.

Tunes here that did it for me were \\"New Dreamtime\\", \\"Tasmanian Road Song\\", the (no less) than incredible \\"Mullumbimby Mother\\", \\"Hours Gone\\" and the band's seven-minute uplifting namesake \\"Magick Brother\\". Line-up: Daevid Allen - glissando guitar & vocals, Graham Clark - violin & guitar and Mark Robson - keyboards, whistle & vocals.

It influences them too much on the issue. I think someone should just give kids the facts of homosexuality, and not their own opinions. Kids should decide for themselves whether it is right or wrong, and know more about NATURAL things in life (such as hetorosexual relationships), and morals. I also would not reccommend this book for Christian children because Christianity teaches the homosexuality is a sin and this book teaches that it is just fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good intro book","review":"While there are some small errors (ie: spelling , etc), as others noted, I found this overall to be an excelent intro book. The fact that Morelli covers each subject from multiple angles is a GOOD thing , espcially in an intro book. Not all of us learn the same way after all. Now, perhaps I am a tad biased, as I go to Trinity (Professor Morelli is a CS Prof. here). However I must say my initial reaction to using a \\"locally\\" written book, was one of worry. I was, of course, pleasantly suprised to find the book very well written with plenty of examples, lots of neat little \\"tidbits\\" which are clearly marked as non-essential if you're trying to find the key theme.I wholeheartedly recommend this book for classes as well as for reference , heck, this almost puts the teacher out of work !(a star is taken off for the occasional typographical error)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Book I've Ever Bought","review":"This is the worst example of a textbook that I've ever seen.

While I do not dispute the accuracy of the content, I am not swayed one bit by the way the author presented it.The author writes the text like a novel, trying to lead the reader into certain conclusions with the hope that the impatient reader (like myself and the many others who need to pick this language up in a jiffy) will understand it.For those who have the luxury of countless of hours to read 900 pages, then this is an excellent book."},{"rating":"1","title":"dull, unclear, disorganized and vague","review":"This book is printed in a two color scheme that fails to draw attention to relevant points.

Each chapter covers a huge, sometimes unrelated quantity of topics that would make a typical college student with a full time job to pay for school find extremely overwhelming to read. Looking through the slide presentations and reading the text can just take two hours alone to get a loose understanding at what is discussed - and that's a lenient statement! This may be a good book as a reference tool where time to lean concepts really isn't an issue, but as far as classroom studies go, where deadlines for projects are always fast approaching, this book makes it VERY difficult to review tough to understand topics. If you're getting into a class that uses this book - I'd strongly get a much much much better reference that can help explain concepts easier and much quicker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Now that's bad quality!","review":"I bought this book for a Java programming class that I was taking. Upon opening the book to chapter 4, the glue in the binding broke with a loud snap, and the book now sits as if it's two books tethered together with a paper cover. I opened the book to a later chapter (probably around chapter 6?) and the glue in the binding snapped again! Now it's like I have three books tethered together by a paper cover. Later, I flipped to a chapter a few after 6, and the binding broke once again, so now I have an even bigger mess. I highly recommend that you avoid this book if possible.

The content could have been covered in less than half the number of pages, and with greater clarity and organization. As a reference, the book was virtually useless.

Well, not knowing anything about my computers BIOS, I called tech support and they were very friendly and helpful. The card is working great, and has all these cool 1/8 inch input jacks that I never had before on my old soundcard. Line in, Mic, front speakers, rear speakers...

I had friends who were as bloodthirsty, and relatives who were as racist, but I knew no one who was as philosophically sophisticated as Pritchard's protagonist. JR is a latter day Falstaff, Caliban, Aaron the Moor, and Don Quixote combined into one marvellous character. Don't be misled by the setting: Pritchard's planters, bankers, \\"niggas,\\" and \\"white trash\\" are all around us still, and if we look deeply enough, JR is us. Let's hope that Pritchard will delight us again in the near future. In the meantime, Junior Ray will remain a cult classic -- unless of course, the NYTimes has the courage to review it.PS: Junior Ray includes by far the most amusing human copulation scene ever to appear in literature."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't purchase","review":"I bought this item and the bangs.

I couldn't get all the way through the book because his incessantly complacent writing style got on my nerves. I can't accept that love is a necessity, not from someone who says \\"I am the Love Prophet\\" to send his points home. I think he has some thoughtful and worthwhile observations about the difficult situation us singles find ourselves in...as a society we are all finding that love is an increasingly more and more precious commodity that we dimiss as a luxury item.

Of course as with any first novel, this book has a few flaws, but we can overlook that because the overall story is engrossing and mesmerizing. Even this early in her career, Brackett had a fine grasp of her writing and definitely knew how to tell a story even if the plot in places could be a bit weak. Few writers can match her pulsepounding prose or her noteworthy attempts to bring her characters above the pulp archetypes they embody. Although Brackett would go on mostly to write science fiction and fantasy, she nonetheless continued to produce mysteries of even higher quality than this later in her life. Those lucky enough to read and enjoy her writing should definitely seek them out if they have not already done so."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best in Stable","review":"If you are new to Martin Hegwood, this is where to start.

Tavern brawls, parties with Jack's ex-wife's pre face lift crowd, and a next door group of costal undergraduates on weekend binge duty spice up an island inspired plot. This is a quick read, traditional who done what, that moves to a neatly prepared conclusion.

Obviously, your reviewers giving low ratings, never read the preface or introduction to the book. This is especially directed to those who are professionals. Listen to what the 14 year-old wrote. Perhaps this textbook is not intended for students requiring a lot of tutoring, or individuals not wanting a scholarly approach to musical theory.

While there were many reasons for this one of the most important was that Piston's theory of harmony makes no sense. The figuring taught by this book is useless for anything but showing your teacher that you can write the numbers under the chords.If you are lucky enough to be able to choose your own textbook Roger Session's out of print Harmonic Practice is a far better book.I didn't really learn anything about harmony until after doing counterpoint exercises (from Jeppesen's Counterpoint) at the keyboard. Eventually learning to play from a figured bass and training your ear is the only real way to learn diatonic harmony. Short of that try to improvise.

Thus useful reviews will be addressed primarily to college teachers, those who assign textbooks. On the other hand, a prospective student may wish to choose his teacher by what text he assigns or he may wish to supplement his assigned text. There are many freshmen harmony textbooks available. This is not more \\"serious\\" than any other, but its current (fifth) edition and the edition preceding it make a complete botch of teaching harmony.(Self-styled autodidacts beware: The essence of harmony is part-writing, and part-writing skill can not be acquired without objective and independent critical evaluation of part-writing exercises--you can't learn it solely from a book.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Bane of my Existance","review":"I had this text for my second semester for 5 part diatonic harmony.

I did think it was too short.I also noticed that the Ruff Ryder crew was repped heavily in this work, yet their names was consistently spelled wrong as \\"rough\\" clearly the director didnt show the pre production final to the participants...smhIn general I enjoyed this a lot though and told others about it as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great television: writing superb, acting excellent, a joy to watch","review":"We have have seen every season of New Tricks and love them. Great acting, all the actors not only can act, they have timing so that the humor is truly humorous - you don't need a laugh track to tip you off that something was said that is supposed to be funny. The writing is exceptional - I hate that so many U.S. shows (and now more and more U.K. programs corrupted by us) have simply godawful writing - hoping that talented actors can pull something out of a hat - you need both good writing and acting and if you want both, see each and every episode of New Tricks. Unreserved positive reviews for all seasons. Both my husband and I love them and never miss an episode on PBS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame photography","review":"We tried to watch this series and were stopped cold by a film director who switched camera scenes about every 2 or 3 seconds. Count how many times this happens in a single minute. In the 1950s, I read recently, the average single camera shot lasted more than 23 seconds. By 2007, the number was down to 2.7 seconds, apparently to rouse teenies who play computer games and expect fast viewing. This film simply blinded us. It's the worst example of a pernicious fashion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Family Friendly","review":"After carefully reading the reviews and noting that some of them said this series was \\"family friendly\\" I ordered the second season because it cost the least. Today we watched about 15 minutes of the first episode of the 2nd season and not less than 6 times there was foul language, men peeing in the men's room, very unpleasant innuendos that I suppose were suppose to be funny and a man who had a sex change. Fifteen minutes was all we could take and thus we are out the money paid for a \\"family friendly\\" series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great entertainment","review":"A female detective inspector leads a team of retired male detectives to solve cold cases.

First off, they don't fit like the old CK crew necks... they are, in fact, shorter and the waist is wider. The length isn't bad- it's the waist width that is too large and makes the shirt ill-fitting. (I have an average body-type) After just a few washings, some of the stitching started coming undone, and there were loose strands on the inner parts of the shirts. I'm continually trimming these loose ends. Although that didn't affect the way these shirts fit, I would expect better stitching from CK. I do wear the shirts under sweaters or jackets, but I feel awkward wearing them on their own as outerwear due to the fit. I don't recommend these shirts. I'd rather pay more for American Apparel or Banana Republic."},{"rating":"1","title":"They shrink; another attempt to cut costs loses customers","review":"I agree with other posters. These used to be great shirts. Not any more. Five cycles through the washer/dryer and I can't tuck them in.I am so tired of this experience. These were the last, good tshirts that I could find that wouldn't shrink (Jockey let me down a few years ago).

Once it starts working, I can usually take many pictures in a row, but in the beginning it's horrible.

He arrives at the time of communist outbreaks throughout the country and starts his journey for bringing christianity. Being caught by the communists he is forced to walk the long march. During this time he encounters many harsh endearments which determine the rest of his life. The book covers decades of communist uprising and the hardship of this communist belief. It gives the reader a good impression of how life was during the long march, the absolute belief of the communists in their goal and the desillusion of those who gave so much for the revolution. As I said in the beginning I just finished the book, so this is just a first sketch of how the book is. I certainly can recommend it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning!

The idea of discotheque was originally created in France and was taken to America in the early sixties. The first disco DJ in America was Slim Hyatt. DJ Terry Noel, however, took deejaying to another level and eventually, in the late sixties, Francis Grasso introduced the technique of slip-cueing, which orginated modern mixing. Also, very popular discotheques like Studio 54, Loft, etc. are treated here. Besides, Goldman focuses on the disco stars, i.e. figures like Donna Summer, Giorgio Moroder, Cerrone, Alec R. Costandinos and so forth. Highly recommended if you are interested in how disco came about."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have book","review":"After a long period of searching for this book, I was mighty pleased to get a copy albeit without a sleeve but so what?

I really can't stand it when people put 5 stars on sub par albums just because they like the group or because they want people to buy the album.The CD starts off well, but then kind of just puts you to sleep or makes you want to fast forward. Near the end though it picks back up.The other review is pretty dead on about the amount of eclecticness (If that's a word). However I prefer to call it a mish mash since it at times sounds like a compilation of demos. I mean only about %20 of the tracks actually sound polished. Overall the rest sound like bands with potential, but that will be destined for anonymity.It's a good effort, but I'd say that one should only pick this album up if it's cheap and if you one wants to sample some MFR tracks that range in quality just as much as they range in genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"Einstein of Sex, Foundation of the Gay Movement","review":"Magnus Hirschfeld may not be a name well known in the U.S., but his studies and institute in Berlin advanced the gay movement as much as the Stonewall riots - and this was in 1943.This biopic of a great man is very well done by director Rosa Von Praunheim. The DVD offers a documentary in addition to the film and an interview with Von Praunheim.The film is in German, with English subtitles. There is quite a bit of male frontal nudity, but this is far from a pornographic film. It is a very well researched, well done biography of the man who coined the term - transvestite.Definitely recommend this film for anyone's library.

This release lacks session information (no dates or personnel given), which might disappoint some jazz fans--especially with regard to the two live bonus tracks.

While there are some important tales here (such as the resurrection of one character), there are also too many asides as various supporting characters from Superman's world take over. Add the assorted adventures of the Legion of Substitute Heroes and the Legion of Super Pets and the volume goes a little adrift. There is an excellent introduction from Paul Levitz and fans of the team will enjoy it. But, to be candid, this is not a book for everyone and even a good number of comics fans will not like it and it is a little pricey unless you are a die-hard Legion fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap junk!","review":"I am sooo disappointed with Hooker furniture for the $$ spent.

The previous Lou Diamond Philips - Fred Ward treatment, _Dark Wind_ is such an improvement. First off, the film characters are more true the book characters. Second, the film plot resembles the book. And finally, in the close captioning on Dark Wind, it tries hard to render the Dine' into English. In this version, it's \\"Speaking Navajo.\\" (Eyes rolling upward.)

Read the book instead. But the book is tougher on the reader than some other Hillerman books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misinformed Writer","review":"Hillerman does not know Navajo life and culture, and the plot is totally alein to Navajo people and culture. Those actors and actresses in the movie are not Navajos, do not act or look like Navajos, and the scenecry is not like Navajo land. This is a story about a fictive tribe and culture that exists in the minds of Hillerman and Redford. The Navajo Nation totally rejected this movie when it was shown to them, and that is why it was not filmed in Navajoland and does not use Navajo actors."},{"rating":"2","title":"subtitles","review":"This movie has good English subtitles (so useful for non native English speakers, much better than translations, often disappointing). while Coyote waits has none."},{"rating":"2","title":"An american mystery Skinwalkers","review":"The movie An American Mystery Skinwalkers is a great movie I Loved it.The gorgeous and attractive Jon Proudstar was in it.The boy that played his son in the movie seemed to be a nice boy.Even though his dad neglected him and mistreated him he was never bitter but a very handsome sweet boy.The skinwaler was the docter at the hospital on the rez.Even though he made the sick people well he had a dark side and a sick mind killing innocent people and medicine men."},{"rating":"1","title":"What were they thinking?","review":"I'm not a purist, but I object to this movie. Like other reviewers in this list, I was really appalled by two things:(1) The assassination of Joe Leaphorn's character. What were they thinking?(2) The wholesale elimination of the original plot. In this movie the wrong people get murdered by the wrong person for the wrong reasons. In the book the deadly shotgun-toting witch-killer is a deranged young female with a dying baby. You will look for her in vain in the movie. How can an adaptation of a murder mystery casually write the murderer out of the plot?The book has one of the most righteous endings you'll ever see. The movie? Jeez. Let's all stand in the middle of a stream and shoot at each other!Is it a good movie? If you never read the book, the movie is OK. If you are looking for \\"Skinwalkers,\\" it isn't here.(\\"Coyote Waits,\\" however, was pretty well done. Don't give up the ship.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Once again the book is better than the movie","review":"Wes Studi and Adam Beach are excellent Native American actors but fans of Tony Hillerman and the Chee/Leaphorn mysteries will be disappointed. The book is much more entertaining. I read recently that \\" Thief of Time \\" which in my opinion is one of the best of the series is next for PBS. Here's hoping that they'll do a better job than Skinwalkers and stick closer to Hillerman's novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good workout!","review":"I really like this video.

We have a Sony 34\\" HDTV tube set that weighs 193 lbs and it held it without a creak. The thick tempered top glass is incredibly strong. I like the open architecture of the lower component shelving for access to the components and good line-of-sight for the remotes, but even with the hidden cable routing, the cables are still more visible than with a solid stand (especially the ones on the floor, such as the cable coax and the surge suppressor). Still, it's a beautiful piece, very well designed and built. It's a little expensive, but it's solid wood, and anything cheaper is going to be MDF and laminate, which I would not trust with a heavy TV set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great For Beginners","review":"When I purchased this book it was as a seeker relatively new to witchcraft. I wasn't really interested in the religious aspects of the craft and wanted a better understanding of Wicca and its practice. It was difficult for me to find comprehensive reading material accessable to a non-Wiccan. This book met that need. I highly suggest reading it if you are new to Wicca. Michaud is not a romantic writer, as many Wiccan authors seem to be. As such, this book was a great relief to me. She provides you with a very good analysis of witchcraft in this book without an overemphasis on ritual.

It primarily focuses on the field as it has evolved in the US, but he does bring in information about early influences from Europe. It's very enlightening to think that many of the \\"reform\\" movements of the last 30 years are reincarnations of arguments from almost 100 years ago. That being said, the book isn't great.

He suggested getting another unit since it must be a bad card reader but the second one responded the same - floppy works, but no card readers.So far two different explanations have been floated. One is that it doesn't work with XP Pro machines - which seems to jive with my experience and the second is that it is a USB 2 issue.

She didn't like getting them on too much but she got used to them in about 10 min. The only thing about them I don't like is that she paws the top of the litter box (I have a covered one) & it makes this incredibly annoying squeeky sound but I will definitely keep using them again & again.----I hafta update my review becuz u should NOT USE THESE!!!!

It doesn't stink like most self tanners, but it does have a scent. Also, it is great because it has an instant tint so you can see where you are applying it. It really gets darker after a few hours. The color lasts for a couple days before scrubbing off in shower and applying more. Perfect to put on in the afternoon on a friday because then you will be dark by its time to go out at night! Love it! P.S. Make sure to clean skin before use and shave legs!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!!!!!","review":"I have tried so many self tanners and I've heard this was the best and in my opinion this is the WORST self tanner I've ever used!

Now for the color it was not brown at all, I don't have pale skin I have medium skin color and it turn me orange and I had ugly patches of self tanner bc it didn't apply evenly.

I even worked in a tanning salon as my first job. So ive been trying to get that fake-bake color from these self-tanners. I read the reviews and they all seemed good but I am not pleased with this product. I get really dark in the summer and I have olive skin so im not super pale and this stuff made me orangy. I barely got any color either! I apply at night and I shower in the morning and most of it just washes off. I can't apply to my hands because it gets all blotchy and then my arms are tan and my hands are pale. I do not recommend this for anyone! especially if your really pale! Go with the tanning sprays they always go on better and have better color."},{"rating":"2","title":"love it but didn't react well with my eczema","review":"i love the color this product gives me! not orange at all, a perfect natural glow! however the formula is super thick and hard to spread evenly all over your body without getting streaks, so i mix it with my regular lotion, one pump self tanner, one pump lotion, mix together and spread all over my body! however....a few weeks after using this i started to realize how horribly my eczema reacted with this. it made my eczema flare up terribly, i had to stop using it and wait a few weeks for my eczema to clear. it is very drying. if you have eczema i wouldn't recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best self tanner I have used","review":"The title of the review tells it all, it is by far the best self tanner I have ever used.

Tried it again this year did nothing. I bought 3 more bottles, because of the way it worked at first. My skin info pale do not tan burn, so really wanted this to work for me. Gonna try million dollar tan now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sun self VS fake bake!","review":"First let me say I like both products very much. But to compare the two - both smell really good but I like the smell of sun self better! It smells like cherry while the other smells like coconut.. Application- I think fake bake is easier to apply, but I think you have to use more of the fake bake product to get the same deep dark color as sun self. Sun self you definitely don't have to use as much so that means you have to buy it less often! Both of the color results are beautiful, but sun self is sooo deep and so natural looking so as far as color goes they are almost even but sun self just looks so much deeper. It takes longer for me to get sun self on though, I don't like that. Sun self takes me about 25 min to get it all rubbed in and even. Fake bake takes maybe 10 min. Either way you can't go wrong - just be careful with the sun self, could easily be streaky, while fake bake is goof proof ( so easy it's unbelievable )"},{"rating":"1","title":"Orange color and sticky feeling","review":"I have natural olive skin. This product makes my skin orange and with a sticky like feeling the whole day. I apply it during the day (it's smelly and my husband doesnt like it), so it is pretty uncomfortable. It also stains clothes. I don't like it and don't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Streaked and uneven","review":"I was tanning using a bed and sadly, my legs didn't tan as deeply as the rest of me was and so I bought this product based on reviews. This product sucked! It did not go on evenly and dried so fast that as I was applying it that there were streaks. I still have over a half of a bottle of this and it is going in the trash. The color isn't too bad, but I will try another product next time I self tan where I need to. Also, don'y get it near your hands or feet or you will look like an oompah-looompah."},{"rating":"2","title":"great color","review":"Definitely no orange like many tanners. Smells great- kinda fruity-nutty. Only trouble I had was (maybe it's because I live in the desert & its summer time (read: no moisture in the air)) it tends to dry and soak in before I am done rubbing it all in/evenly. My solution is just to apply while skin is still wet from the shower and I haven't had any problems. Don't be a slacker and rush through the application (like any self tanner, if you are sloppy it's not going to look it's best). I love that you can see the color as you are applying it- makes it easy to see if I've missed a spot. Can't beat this value! I will definitely buy again."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice tan hard to apply evenly","review":"This product will give you a nice color but it is very esy to leave streaks. Even when completely dry to the touch will come off on fabric. applying at night before bed use dark sheets. Color washes offin the shower but leaves behind a nice tan. I would purchase again until I find something I like beter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dark tint from color guide but no developed tan","review":"I liked how it looked when I first applied it, but once you wash off the color guide, there really seemed to be very little actual tan there.

Hmmmmm.... Anyway, I loved the smell and application of this product, but the outcome was RIDICULOUSLY orange. I was not able to go out in public the day after applying this. I exfoliate before I self-tan, and I am not a self-tanning novice. I have used much cheaper products that give results heaps and bounds better than this. If only this product had any sort of a natural color, then it would be an amazing product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it, but turned orange","review":"This was my first time putting on tanning lotion. When I first tried it on I thought it was going to be too dark for my skin but it really blended in with my fair skin.

Maybe I did something wrong but other than that I would recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"great","review":"product worked really well, took a little long to dry.

I was so excited to try it because of all the good reviews, but I have to say I'm not impressed. It did give me a lot of color, but the color was more orange than anything. When my family saw me they all asked me what the heck I did to my face...not quite the response you want to hear when you use a tanning lotion. And yes it does smell good (at the beginning), but honestly I'd rather have a self tanner that smells bad and works than one that smells nice and turns me orange. Anyways, I'm going to stick to my Tomas Tanning lotion from Salley's; it smells bad but it works."},{"rating":"2","title":"SunSelfTanningLotion","review":"I have been using Sun Self Tanning Lotion for two years now and I love it.

I absolutly reccomend this to everyone looking for a quicker healthier tan. Worth EVERY penny!

Some leave you looking like a zebra, some like a oompa loompah. This tanning lotion left me with a sun kissed bronze, not orange like others. I really liked it. You can see the color instantly so there is no guessing what areas may turn out darker than others. And it actually smells nice! Every tanning lotion I've ever used smelled like chemicals, but this one had a enjoyable smell to it!The only reason I gave this product 4 out of 5 stars is because it didn't come with gloves. I would have appreciated something to protect my hands.But, all in all I would absolutely purchase this product again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent self tanner","review":"When you want a tanning lotion that does not streak or make you \\"orange\\" then this product is for you.

Holding it takes some getting used to and be warned that the \\"soft\\" bristles are much softer than other brands.My biggest beef with this product (hence the two stars) is they advertise a downloadable postage-paid mailer. When I finished my first toothbrush and went to the website on the box I was dismayed to find that they *no longer provided it*. It apparently cost them too much. You now have to pay for the postage yourself or go to some participating stores that provide recycling (all of which require driving several miles). That's ridiculous!The only reason I bought this product was because they advertised how easy it was to recycle.

For pragmatics, we used Doing Pragmatics by Grundy (which is also a nice book), so I can't say much about that portion, but I would imagine it is similar to the semantics part.The book itself is small and easy to carry to class or the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"implied a variety...only one","review":"haven't used it got it as stocking stuffer...for kids...can't choose which one you get. cute though.

Well, I have had the Isis IQ Uno Complete for two months and I no longer even bother using it. I get faster results and more milk as a whole with the manual. This pump lacks suction, due to what I would consider a design flaw. The mechanical part is incapable of imitating your own pumping because the range of movement it uses is too small. Either that or mine is defective. Either way, I am left with an unusable, unreturnable breast pump which neither Avent nor Babies R Us will do anything about, so I guess I just have to buy another pump. Please, do yourself a favor and don't bother with this pump."},{"rating":"2","title":"Avent ISIS IQ UNO Complete Breast Pump","review":"I purchased this product purely by the rating that it got.

First, the pumping mechanism broke after 15 days. We called AVENT and they asked me to send the pump in to have it fixed. But how was I supposed to express breast milk for a week??? Also, I do not produce tons of milk, and this pump took about 25 minutes to express each breast which makes it very inconvenient with a baby. In the end, through feedback from many friends, I chose to purchase a Medela, and I just want to share that it is amazing. I am done in 15 minutes tops. Yes, it is more expensive, but very much worth the price. I wish someone had shared this information before I bought the AVENT pump."},{"rating":"2","title":"MY ALL TIME FAVORITE BOOK RECOMMENDATION","review":"I once asked an \\"avid\\" reader to recommend the best book she had ever read and she told me to read Guilt By Association. She wasn't wrong. It became my favorite recommendation to give to others who just want a \\"plain great read\\". If you are the type of reader who likes to read the last page first, don't ever do this with a Susan Sloan book. Recently, on a trip to the Carribean, my daughter asked me what book she should read on the beach. Of course I gave her Guilt. I sat next to her as she was finishing it and her first response was, \\"Oh, My God\\". She, along with everyone else who has read this book, read the last page over and over again in disbelief.

Shall I go on?","review":"After reading the amazon reviews and being one who enjoys suspenseful novels, I bought the book.I should have bought lottery tickets. I've read 200 pages and don't think I can finish it. Was the author's brain soaking in syrup while writing this? Spare me the mother's high-horse, crap-don't-stink behavior. And Karen's childish dialogue becomes silly and laughable fast; serious in one breath, joking in the next. Please!The worst part about this story (there were many to choose from)is that the author relates nothing in the dialogue to allow the reader to know when events are taking place. had the beginning not been prefaced with \\"dec. 1962\\", there is no way of knowing that's where this begins. And this flaw does no justice whatsoever to teh conversations amongst the characters.Should I finish this book (doubtful), I may write a sequel to this review.

She became a real person to me and I felt compassion and a kinship with her. However the ending becomes unreal because there is no way ...ever...that a victim of assault would have any of the voluntary contact with her assailant that the author writes of in the last chapters. It seems the author lost the sense of who the character was and therefore led me to abandon any connection with the book and it's ending. It's too bad because I was very involved until then. I cannot recommend this book to anyone because it will feel perhaps like a waste of time and a let down as it did for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Paramount start... swooping end","review":"Albeit the book's first half is an excellent thrilling, as you start the second half the book is long-winded and boring.

The dialogue is consistently irritating, and the pace makes an asthmatic sloth look like Carl Lewis! People, I implore you, do NOT listen to the other reviews of this book. Save yourself some money, and go and buy something really good.

It is, however, a fascinating book. It recounts the intrigues and machinations of a court that plays at petty one up man's ship while the ship of state heads steadily for the rocks of destruction. The book is well written in the first person singular from an original written in the French. We see here a Madame du Barri as probably she was- a lover of pleasure, an easy spirit, jealous of her prerogatives and at constant war with Louis s family.I enjoyed this work- it helps to put a human face on those characters who too often end up on Olympian heights to be truly alive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brief Summary of Guild Wars","review":"Was searching for a secure game; where hackers don't rule, and the administrators are helpful and know what they are doing. Guild Wards is very well thought out. Not too much grinding, leveling is pretty quick. Options abound, no two characters are the same, so many skills and attributes available. Graphics are terrific. Game works flawlessly, no difficulty connecting. Lots of players. Plenty to read and research on the Web. I bought the original version on the cheap to see if I like the game. Guild Wars 2 comes out soon but will no doubt cost more. For a few dollars, you can't go wrong with this game ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!!","review":"This game was my first computer game i ever brought and i love it. I play it for hours upon hours. You can chat with friends, create your own characters, and live a completely different life. It is so fun and easy. I learned in just one day. It has two stages and is so nice to be able to relax and play. I would recommend this product completely especailly because the bonus fire imp helps out so much it made it alot easier for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"ONE OF THE BEST MMORPGs EVER!!!","review":"this game is not as good a WoW. Its graphics pale in comparasin and the clases are so easy to master, you cant even choose your race, Besides all of those bad points it still kicks. it doesnt cost a monthy fee so u dont have to wory about that, and the story line is realy dense."},{"rating":"2","title":"There's a reason it's #1","review":"If you like RPGs -- multiplayer, solo, player vs. player, player vs. environment (monsters) -- you'll love this game. You'll love the fantastic graphics and gameplay, you'll love playing without paying, and you'll love that whether you play or not, you're not pouring a monthly subscription down the drain. If you've never played an online RPG before, this is a great one to start with -- it's very easy to play, especially given the tutorial content in the early training missions.This game is extremely fun to play, and it's huge -- you can easily explore it for hours, or just jump in, kill some stuff, and jump back out again. Basically, whatever your playing style, Guild Wars accomodates it.As of this writing, Guild Wars is #1 pretty much everywhere, and rated 9 and 10 at the top gaming sites. There's a reason for that -- or more accurately, a lot of reasons. If you like a good RPG, or want to try one, check it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"way better than wow","review":"this is the best game ever. it has no monthly fees and it is better than wow. wow gets boring but guild wars does not because there r so many things to do and u can do them forever. like pvp the max lvl is 20 so it is all fair fighting and u cant get robbed like in wow. when i say wow i mean world of warcraft. u people who read this should save alot of money and buy this game instead of wow cuz it is way better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"This game has great graphics, but it's very limited in functionality. A game that makes a fantasy world feel limited. That kind of says you're putting a limit on imagination. I'd say, try it out first from someone who may have it before you buy it because the person who used to live here in my room, a previous tenant, I heard from my roommates played the game a lot, so I guess he liked it."},{"rating":"2","title":"This has gotta be a great game!!!","review":"Guild Wars was recommended to me 2 weeks before launch by a friend. For now, all the Amazon reviews on this game state real highly about the game. RARELY does a game ever attract so many users to give positive feedback. This game is extremely fun, and it is my second day playing. It is absolutely a blast, its free which is even better, but as far as the game goes... leveling takes awhile. Even on level 3 which I am at right now, its very slow but its fun! The graphics are great, I've seen better in a different MMORPG called PristonTale. I believe they have the best graphics ever!! But this is Guild Wars we're talking about, sooo if your looking for a EXCELLENT game, and easy to understand game, I would definetly go for this game! Its a bit high in price, but its extremely fun.Additional info:- You can minimize the game!- NO lag whatsoever...- Broadband Connection recommended- You will have fun !!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"GW is not an MMorpg","review":"If guild wars is an mmorpg then diablo,warcraft,and starcraft are.You are totally wrong.Everything is instanced,only seven players can be in an instance at the same time.Only towns have many players,which is necesarry becasue you may want to form a party for an instance.Even towns are broken down...they are broken into districts.If I am in seaboard district 31,and my friends in district 20,we cant seee each other becasue were in separate instances-annoying.Im not saying this is a bad game,its pretty good.But compared to WoW and other mmos its not too great.7vs7 battles in gw...fun...but what about the 100vs100 batltles of a real mmo?If you dont want to pay a monthly fee get this game.If you have the money,WoW is for you.2 stars because its competeing with MMorpgs,games that are MUCH better than itself.5 in fun...because its fun!you can go on,form a party,and complete instances casually."},{"rating":"2","title":"Guild Wars","review":"The graphics are great.

One thing that I really like is that you do not have to pay for a monthly access."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great bridge into an MMO","review":"If you are a Blizzard fan, you'll love this game.

I like games that are simple to get into, but deep enough not to get bored with. Guild Wars fits the bill for me.My brother is a much more avid gamer and pleaded with me to buy this. I have not spent much time with video games since my child was born. But this game has no monthly fee to play and, like I mentioned, is easy to learn to play.I've been having a lot of fun playing with my brother and other players online. I have not picked up the expansion yet, but I plan on it. A solid, enjoyable game with many layers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another honest review","review":"My views on games are always fair so I say this to be completely firm and honest.Don't buy this game unless you aren't looking for a MMORPG.This clearly isn't one. When I tried it out, I wasn't impressed. It was boring. The limited cities. Only encounting other players IN cities. No feel for real growth in my character. No real endgame or set purpose in leveling. Again, this may be good for a quick log on and play but I wasn't even remotedly impressed overall.Now the graphics are really nice but unless you are seeking a arcade type game. So Id have to say, all the other reviewers are blowing this up more than it is. I found it not fun and rather boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"BUYER BEWARE!!","review":"Do not purchase this game,you will be dissapointed. The manufacturer of this game is CONSTANTLY changeing the abilities of characters and strategy of play. For example,you may aquire an item or skill for your character,after MANY HOURS of play,just to find that skill has been significantly changed,(weakened) the day after you aquired it. Basically,the company is in what appears to be a constant state of \\"UPDATEING\\". Unfortunately,the updates consistantly make your characters weaker,and the game \\"monsters\\" stronger. The company calls it \\"skill Balanceing\\"..LOL..what a joke. NOT FUN. pick up a copy of diablo 2 or any other online game if your lookin for fun. This game is about as much fun as playin chess,and about as exciting as chess.OH,by the way,u \\"must\\" play this game online,there is no other way to play it. no stand alone version. and u must play as part of a group,u will die rather quickly trying to play solo."},{"rating":"1","title":"fun for a while... then CRASH!","review":"I bought the game with great expecations, and it lived up to them.... however, once I got about 1/3 the way into it... My computer crashed and restarted at the exact same point in a level. Drivers are up to date, neither my cpu nor vid card are getting hot. Apparently this is only a problem with some people, and the makers arent doing anything about it.

In ascalon pre searing many people can be found simulating orgies hetero and homosexual activities are visually represented at times people solicityou asking you to take your chars clothes off and Join in. It is decripid. Dark Age of Camelot is a much more developed game and is family friendly. If DAOC isnt your type of game then EVE online or even World of Warcraft is better.

I guess they've decided if they make your work hard to earn your fun, you'll appreciate it more.I would've guessed they could have made so much more out of this game. I mean, they sold over 2 million copies of the game retail when it first came out, I'd bet they sold half that of the following 2 expansions combined"},{"rating":"1","title":"I feel bad for spending $50..","review":"This game is so BORING! The interface just plain sucks. I've only played one other MMORPG, and that's World of Warcraft. It's $15/month to play, and a friend told me to try Guild Wars since it's free. Well, I can honestly say, you get what you pay for. There are very few pluses: Well, obviously, it's free, the graphics are nice, and you don't spend a lot of time travelling. It lacks content and personality though. The characters are completely flat, and it's just not entertaining at all. I guess I've been spoiled by WoW and must be biased towards traditional MMORPG's."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST","review":"Guild wars is the best game i have ever played.The only regret that i have is that i did not get the premier collectors addition!I really think that guild wars is very well put together and playable and the fact that it is free to play is bonus!I only wish that i had more time to play, but i guess it is not feezable to quit my job so i could devote more time to play so will have to play when i can. lolThere are just not enough hours in the day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yippee For No Monthly Fees","review":"This is a really nicely done game for the money. The character creation is better than WOW but not as good as City Of Heroes.I like that I can travel to one of the main cities by pushing the M button and clicking on the city. No cool down times needed. No specific city that you can only travel to. Just click and go.I also like that it will give you hints on where to go for your quests. Just look at your mini map.Overall it is a great product. I am sorry I let others talk me out of buying this because real people pay monthly fees. Well Smart people do not pay monthly fees."},{"rating":"2","title":"Game comparable to World of Warcraft","review":"This game is very good with its graphics. Better, in my opinion, than WOW or DAOC. But a lot of repitition in killing monsters and limited in quests for the beginning part of the game. You have to go into the more dificult second sequence of the game to find any good quests and items to use for your character. Upgrades for your charcter are hard to find and without help from other players, are nearly impossible to find. Other than that, it keeps you on your toes in excitement and fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Caution: Contents may be highly addictive!!!","review":"I am in love with Guild Wars. I began playing it four days ago, and it is already interfering with my life: i don't want to work...sleep...anything except play Guild Wars. My boyfriend and I both play. It gives us good quality nerd bonding time while slaying strange beast. I just bought a new computer today because my old one does not run the game well. I cant wait for Guild Wars: Factions. This game is such a good stress reliever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Guild Wars","review":"Number one....make sure your computer meets the requirements to run this game. This isn't for your old Compaq with Windows98. Tried to run it on a Dell computer(2002) with on board graphics, but constantly got the blue screen of death. We are now running it on a Pentium3 with 512 megs of ram, and a GeForce 4 video card. This met the minimum requirements of the game and it has performed well. The kids like it and that's really what counts. No monthly fee to play. I can't comment on any aspects of the game but like I said....the kids are playing it daily."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Guild Wars!","review":"I have been playing Guild Wars off & on for about 2 weeks. I am still in the early part of the game and learning what character combinations I prefer. Have my money's worth for the game already and look forward to many more hours of fun IF I can get the hang of playing with other live people. This is my first on-line game and I'm learning slowly. I have used Google to get very helpful suggestions on how to play. I'm a stay-at-home empty-nester."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a good game.","review":"And have you noticed that most of the bad reviewers cite WOW as a refrence. Now let's compare Let's compare shall we? A game based entirely about powerlevling and spending time standing there watching your charecter mine. Or a dynamic game with all the MMO cliche. Guild Wars is the new cool guy with the creative ideas, and most of the other MMOs are just the same old same old Elves, Humans, Orcs, and Dark Elves, with the same Clerics, Rouges, Mages, Warriors, Paladins and their Ilk. And the only thing most of the bad reviewers talk about how the PVE sucks. Guild wars has PVP 100s of times better than that in the other games. And the updates. They're to keep the balance. Like if a skill throws things way out of balance, or even throw it off a bit, they fix it."},{"rating":"2","title":"perfect game","review":"This game is perfect fopr those of us that don't have all day to play.It is easy to learn, graphics are great and it is also a lot of fun.

The only thing it's missing is the rendered cut scenes from diablo2. Online connection is reliable and most of all its FREE! Free online play for a game of this quality is a great value. It plays like diablo2 and for those that never played it I will explain. You choose your character profession and customize your look, then you start to play collecting new stronger clothes, better weapons, & upgrading learned skills. Teaming up with others is a nice touch to this game over diablo2 and its very fair how things are distibuted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Graphics are Great, Gameplay is lackluster","review":"For fans of World of Warcraft, this game is pretty similar. The graphics are really pretty impressive, and the world is well developed. I however did not care much for WoW, and found this game to be too similar.On the one hand it is a free online multiplayer game. However the game promised that it would reward skill as opposed to hours spent playing it. I found that to not be the case. Ultimately it boiled down to a Diabloesque click fest. That is okay from time to time if a good story line is layered on top of the game, but I never really got hooked on the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Online Game!!","review":"Very action-oriented game. No sitting around and talking around a campfire or other boring online activities that define the MMO genre. You get in, group up and go on a mission.

Great job."},{"rating":"1","title":"This game is really boring; get World of Warcraft instead","review":"Guild Wars is the worst game that I've ever played. An old Mario game from the NES has better graphics than this; you can't even jump unless you type \\"/jump.\\" You can't see other people outside a town (unless you're in a group). So I advise you not to get this game because you'll be sorry you got this instead of World of Warcraft."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this game","review":"This game does not have good graphics. I really wish I had not wasted my money on this. There is nothing fun about it, and it takes too long to level up; I'm just level five and it says I need 11,000 experience points to level up and you only get about 75 every time you kill a monster. When you're looting a monster, if it drops armor, you can't even use it, you need some kit thing that lets you identify it or something like that before you can wear it. So what I'm trying to say is don't waste your money on this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"waterd down Diablo","review":"This is a poor excuse for a MMORPG.

A few minutes of wonderful new footage of the sun diced into tiny pieces, then wedged in between an endless stream of boring shots of the sun rising or setting over some horizon or mountain range. The most irritating thing about this film is that filmmakers go out of their way to bash the Catholic Church for being unscientific in persecuting Galileo, but then in turn exult in a series of pagan sun-worshiping cults. This made no sense. I wanted scientific information on the sun, not the filmmaker's opinion on religion. And not endless footage of people worshiping the sun. I mean, who cares? This was truly a missed opportunity.

Most of the references cited are from the 1980's or earlier, there is little mention of GSM and I could find no discussion of the North American TDMA-136 or CDMA standards.

The book mainly delievers what it is about and therefore its satisfactory. The book also talks about the author such as dates and the other books in their collection of written material. However, I was hoping there would be more than simply this, like going in depth and explaining the literature.

Judy Garland and Frank Sinatra are my favorite singers so I was thrilled to find out that they worked together on this show. I don't really like Dean Martin, but if you like his kind of lazy, crooning style then he's at his peak I suppose. Frank's voice is in great shape and he gives an incredibly moving performance of \\"I See Your Face Before Me,\\" among others. But it is still Judy's show, and as the New York Times stated when this show aired in 1962, \\"Judy Garland held television in the palm of her hand last night.\\" Indeed she did. Her voice is in great shape and she sings many of the songs that she sang in her 1961 Carnegie Hall album, which was still charting at the time this aired. This is arguably the greatest television show featuring Judy Garland, even her wonderful series never quite matched its excellence, making it a must-have for any fan (or lover of truy great singing!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"very poor video quality !","review":"From the start the video images are fuzzy and the color is awful.

The good points in the book are: it gives detailed and informative commentary on artists, sculptors, and architects, paintings, sculptures and buildings of the late 18th and 19th centuries. There are 215 illustations. The book puts the artists and their works in the context of history. The bad things in the book are: only 21 illustrations are in color. This may not seem that bad but color in Romantic paintings is important. The book has many illustrations of Turner's paintings, but if the viewer never saw them in color it is very difficult to get the whole meaning of the works. If the paintings were meant to be viewed in black and white they wouldn't be painted in color. That is why I gave it 4 stars. I recomend ART IN EUROPE 1700-1830 by Matthew Craske. It is cheaper, more informative, has better illustrations, and covers more material."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly Good for a 2 song single","review":"Well to be honest, there's only two songs and man, that's not cool.

There's no recognizable melody to identify the tune and the playing seems to lack any emotion. Just a bunch of notes written down for great musicians to read.

This stuff is just too busy; a bunch of fast runs and scales that are not compelling at all. Maybe Chick's gotten into a rut and needs to go back and write children's songs for piano. The emotional aspect is missing from this CD. I've listened to samples of all the cuts and there is no soul on any of them. Sorry Chick, this CD doesn't cut it for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame . . . what you wouldn't expect from Mr. Corea","review":"My sympathies to Chick and his family. Evidently Chick was involved in some sort of accident that left him musically incapacitated. As the owner of at least 13 Chick Corea CDs, this one is at the bottom of the list (actually, on the trade off list). Boring & musically uneventful. After reading the reviews I thought \\"I must get this CD (\\"Inside Out\\" was the last one I bought). I was hesitant and I should've gone with my instincts (it stinks). Forget that the music is uninspiring and the melodies forgetful, there's not even enough technical acrobatics to amaze if even for a moment. I suggest giving this one a miss until Chick recovers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspired piece of music","review":"I'm a huge fan of Chick Corea. The previous album \\"To the stars\\" was not as great as this (although I watched the Electric band perform those songs in Toronto and was amazed by the performance). At first you listen to the songs and it somehow sounds the same. Then, as you play it over and over again you start to discover the depth of the compositions. It reminded me of when I first listened to \\"The Leprechaun\\", I was not impressed but kept listening and now that is one of my favorite Chick Corea albums. Sometimes it takes time to really appreciate something. If you love good instrumental music buy this.

The sound greatly improves for the oboe quartet, but the clarinet quintet is plain painful to hear and the horn quintet is just wrong (the horn sounds like if it was in another room).The clarinet quintet sounds like a partially demagnetized tape and the clarinettist seems to think that we enjoy more is clapping and breathing than we do Mozart. Truly unpleasant the only SACD I have not heard in its entirety (I stopped after 2 movements of the clarinet quintet and after one movement of the horn quintet, while I enjoyed the whole oboe quartet; the latter is the reason why I give 2 stars instead of just 1).The release of this product is unacceptable.

The animation and art in this series is good. The Female lead is a pretty lady. That is the only thing that made keep watching it. There is plenty of action, but it wasn't too intense because I didn't care if the main character died and the series ended. All the bad guys are chumps. They are probably related since all of their noses looked like wieners hanging on the middle of their faces. They also have really stupid sounding voices. The series is kinda like James Bond, if he were a cyborg chick with mentally handicapped enemies. I found it impossible to care about this series at all.

The biggest difference between ours and his is our adaptations of the instrumentation, legitimate in a still-evolving work like this one inspired by folk music, performed and recorded before with one tenor soloist. Ours has three, along with the extra excitement their ensemble singing provides, and the traditional and modern instruments are played in our recording, as in the composers, by specialists from Argentina.I love this music, these performances of it and this recording, The more I still listen after having long completed the lengthy process of recording then preparing it for publication, I continue to hear in it new things to savour.Curt Wittig, recordist & mastering engineer for this CD"},{"rating":"1","title":"skip to the original version","review":"Here is an excellent example of how you can smash a beautiful music with a terribly bad performance!Every thing in this CD is bad: the very uninspiring conducting, the pathetic and embarrassing soloists, the amateurish choir, the cheap recording, etc.Most of all, i just don't find the connection between this arid performance and the red-headed passion and the exuberant happiness that are so integral to this fascinating music.If you want THE performance for these lovely pieces of music, buy the original version recorded by Philips in the 60's."},{"rating":"1","title":"burial and dismal style","review":"En esta grabaci?n se ha destruido la obra de Ariel Ram?rez.

Then over a generous twenty pages, the author describes and diagrams the adventure of two Englishwoman in August of 1901, and how after some normal sightseeing on the grounds, seemed to cross-over and perhaps time-travel to the actual Trianon during October of 1789.The same two ladies had another adventure on the grounds in 1908.When they researched and wrote a book (1911)about the incidentsthey were contacted by another family, who had independent, similar experiences in 1908.

Stacie has grown and in her journey she has found a strong sense of self which I think every woman should aspire to have. I also love Dont Make Me Stay and Is it Me, Dream Man, heck I love em all.

Love the ability to open all the windows to air out the tent during the day. Saw other reviewers complain about the thin floor but with a tarp underneath didn't have any issues with the gravel tent pad and just threw down a rug or two for the dogs so their nails wouldn't tear the floor.

It is very roomy and looks great. It is made well. My only concern is that the bottom floor is constructed with the same material as the sides of the tent. I am used to having a tarp bottom. We may purchase a tent pad to lay beneath the tent just to make sure there are no leaks or punctures to the bottom.

It will never hold up to Minnesota camping where it rains and can be 90 degrees. I liked the window style and the roof zip back windows in the roof so lots of good ideas. The poles were great, but the bottom would never work...never. Am sending it back and am sad that I won't have a Eureka tent.

This is not a very good idea but I am a very experienced camper so I wasn't too worried about the set-up or anything. The first thing I noticed (and I still can't believe)was that the floor is same material as the walls -- yes TAFFETA! No polyethelene!!!

The tent is in excellent!!! shape (Always had tarps on the ground and inside on the floor). Recently, the waterproofing has started to break down and the fabric has become sticky. I contacted Eureka and they will not replace or recoat the fabrics as they said it is part of the natural breakdown of the fabric's waterproofing. Their warranty makes reference to not covering wear and tear and exposure type defects but my tent has been \\"stored indoors in the original bag\\". Ahh, says Eureka, the tent has been stored in it's original bag and that accelerates the breakdown hence they are not responsible.Bottom line, great tent but don't expect much from their warranty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very surprising album","review":"They may not be the best known band but this album along with the other 2 just blew my mind away. Before Predominance, the hardest I'd ever listened to was Slayer and I didn't care for black and death metal at all.

(Check out Predominance also)Best tracks: Home Sweet Hell, Chemistry"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't let the album cover fool you...","review":"Yeah, cool album cover, but the actual album is to dissapoint. Actually, the music is good...the musicians are awesome...they blend power metal with death metal kinda like Children Of Bodom. However, the vocalist is terrible!!! The singer sounds like he's the guy from Disturbed, and the lyrics are verry, verry, verry stupid...or should I say \\"stupified\\". This album is a capital NOT for fans of death metal. Maybe if Susperia looses this lame singer they will become something...but for now....yuck!

This wasn't too bad, because it was mostly cosmetic. Just last week, I had to stop using the set alltogether, because wiring in the headset had become so bad that the people on the other line were not able to hear me anymore. It would work, and then if I would move my head....it would not work anymore. I paid almost 60 dollars for this about a year ago. I LOVED it at first....but after this time.......I am very disappointed. I went to Walmart and bought a Sanyo with all the same features for 14.99.

Put the tent together before hand to make sure everything worked. Directions and assembly were a breeze for one person. Design was thoughtful. The tent fit 4 twin air beds and one full with room to spare. The divider was awesome. Kids used their own side and duly trashed it. Wife and I were able to keep our side tidy because of the separation and separate zipper doors.Bad Stuff (Chinese crap factor (not sure if it was made in china but ... you get the idea): Zipper on one of windows was broken off by kids wrestling on the first day (ok fine, they are crazy no biggie). Biggest problem was after camping during take down, a critical tent pole flexi-cord crappy thing or whatever you call the springy cord thingy fell apart - just uncoiled and split rendering new tent useless.

Velcro tabs tore out of the tent and there were several small holes all over the tent. I was not able to get a full refund because by the time I set it up and took it down ad saw the deteroation, Amazon would only refund less than 1/2 of what I paid, plus I had to pay $45. to return it! So, shop around for durability or you will be wasting your money like I did.UPDATE: Amazon did give me a full refund after further explaining the lack of durability.

However, this is a GREAT tent for beginners; went up easily, lots of floor space, and plenty of head room. In fact, all of our expert camping friends were ooohing and ahhhing as we put up our tent.I would have given this AWESOME TENT 5 stars but I'm taking one away because of the awning! What is up with that thing? We could not figure out how to get it up! We had everybody looking at it and it didn't seem to make much sense to anybody. In fact, I noticed in all of the pictures posted, none of them show the awning. The picture on the box shows the awning poles going down to the ground being held up by nothing!

Their reviews lead me to believe that they've never picked up another Finance book to compare.I have taken several finance and accounting classes in my M.B.A. program, and I received an \\"A\\" in all of them. This book confused me after 2 chapters. They take what I belive to be \\"simple\\" concepts and make them extremely difficult to understand. I have had to re-read many pages to figure out how they came to their conclusions because they don't do a very good job of explaining themselves.For me, this book is a waste of time.

But I am no dummy I tell you, I can read almost anything, and this book I cannot read. If you are looking to get a quick grasp on Corporate Finance, this book is not for you. It is incredibly long and verbose. You skip from one topic to the next without seeing how they interconnect. This is one book where one can read fifteen chapters and still not know a single thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Miserable Excuse for a Textbook","review":"Perhaps for finance graduate students this book is appropriate but for the rest of us reasonably intelligent folks this book makes no sense at all.Simple concepts should be explained and then used as building blocks for more complex ones; this book starts complex, the authors then rant about whatever they like or don't like, and then go on to something else even more complex. All the while leaving the reader befuddled about what these guys were talking about in the first place.I suspect they're doing some grandstanding, trying to impress us with their intelligence. All right I'm impressed, now how about teaching me finance?Professors, have mercy on your students. Use a text that offers clarity and supplements classroom lectures; this book does neither."},{"rating":"1","title":"a stuffy sloppy book","review":"The authors explanations on the concept of opportunity cost of capital of an investment, a central concept of standard finance, are so sloppy and confusing, starting from the first pages of their book, that one wonders if they clearly understand themselves the simple probabilistic model underlying standard finance. The fundamental fact of finance, which states that between two securities with the same expected future value investors will pay more for that with lesser variability, is barely mentioned after about 200 pages in the legend to a figure. It is presented as inescapably logical, which it is not. In short this book gives a long and somewhat stuffy presentation of conventional finance but will be very difficult to a reader that really wants to understand finance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Find another book!","review":"I am an MBA student with no financial background (having received my BS in a completely different field), this was the required text for my Corporate Finance class and it left me so confused I had to withdraw from the class so as not to ruin my GPA.

To summarize, dont waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE BOOK","review":"I think the real reason Larry Wall wrote this book was just to brag about his baby creation. 80-90% of this book is just Larry going on and on about how Perl is the greatest language ever because it loosely models human languages. The real content of this book is so watered down it's as if O'Reilly told Wall, \\"Sorry, 200 pages is too short, try to go for 1000 so we can sell the book for [price] rather than $30.\\"Larry should take a note from Dennis Ritchie(the creator of C) and his book \\"The C Programming Language\\". Ritchie DOESN'T go on and on about how he's the greatest genius in the world and how C is the greatest thing since sliced bread. Ritchie's book is 250 pages and documents EVERY TINY DETAIL of the C language. It takes Larry 1000 pages to do the same for Perl, a MUCH simpler language. That's just sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"The author talks too much","review":"I had read only 5 chapters and didn't tolerate it anymore.

That is, a book from another perspective seems to point out the idiosyncracies of a language, etc. The only chapter of this book that I use is the 200 page one on Functions which, as its name implies, lists every Perl function and a basic couple of paragraphs about using that function. I've used Perl for years, but only resort to O'Reilly when I'm desperate. I expected a lot more from a book that is so well know.While not nerely as comprehensive, I prefer the book Cross-Platform Perl. I guess it's more of a tutorial (probably similary to O'Reilly Learning Perl).Only get this book if you're looking for a reference and already know perl.

However, if you get four or five chapters into the book, put it down for a week and try to come back to it, forget it.It has also not been a very good reference for me.If you're working with PERL full time, you should probably have it.

I figured with the awful economy and me having a hard time finding a job, it might be about time for me to learn Perl (among other things). So I saw the glowing reviews of this book and purchased it.I honestly gleaned more about Perl from a dinky little 5 minute online tutorial than I can squeeze out of this. I just CANNOT bite into this book; there's too much garbage for people who don't know the difference betwen Unix and French. There is no decent pace, no steady flow of teaching, no way to simply and utterly learn how to program in Perl. The structure is so frustrating, I've had the urge to rip my hair out several times.Bottom line: If you want to learn ABOUT Perl, this is the book for you. If you want to LEARN Perl, don't bother.

The examples fail badly because he's never bothered to explain pop, shift, or any of the other material he slings at us. And so it goes, in this book about a frightfully haphazard language written by the same mind that created the language. Don't buy this book.

I'm giving it 2 stars because I have managed to tease some capacity to program in Perl out of it, but at great personal effort.The book's tone is largely condescending, and full of awful \\"jokes\\", which get in the way of the actual content. It's most significant failing, though, is the weight given to waffle over actual programming examples. For example, the chapter on Threads spends 4 pages making analogies about threads with cooks in kitchens, and saying what a great effort it was to get threading into Windows, but goes on to give bare examples of threaded code with little to no commentary at all, leaving the reader largely in the dark.

To be fair, this is the second Perl book that has showed me up. Maybe its not the book but the language itself, with its smug \\"theres more than one way to do it\\", patronizing \\"context sensitive, trying to understand what im saying\\", and pretentious \\"religious quality to the Perl community\\". I will learn Perl (Im actually already using it when it cant be avoided). And when I do maybe Ill talk all fancy and wear a smoking jacket and write Perl poetry that parses in Perl, and be able to understand something in this book.

I took the pump with me on my visit to the lactation consultant who said I was doing everything properly but that the pump was just not working with my breasts. It is also very difficult to dissasemble and clean. I would defenitely not recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really Bad Product","review":"I registered for this pump based on reviews, and it was not a good product. First it took about an hour to pump 3oz, second, the battery travel pack seems to overheat and shuts down after 10 minutes, finally the pumping mechanism broke after exactly 19 days of pumping. I was pretty dissapointed since I have been pleased with all of the other Avent products I have purchased. I ended up purchasing a more expensive pump. I recommend any new mom not to waste their money on this product. Just rent a pump at the hospital or go ahead and purchase a higher quality pump from the get go."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice speakers","review":"just installed these in my soundbar in my wrangler. very pleased with the sound quality. one thing I noticed is it takes more power to run them, the jvc stereo I have puts out 50 rms so its fine but lower amp systems could have a problem.I have read reviews on other sires stating that lanzar quality is poor but I think these are a good value for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lowest quality tapes ruin two Welles films noir","review":"About these two motion pictures: THE THIRD MAN is THE definitive British film noir while MR.

However, as soon as I took the pan out of the box, I noticed a huge area that looked defective/unfinished/splotchy. My husband immediately noticed, too. He rarely notices things like that, so for him to notice, the problem has to be very obvious! Tried washing the pan to see if there was just something on the surface. Nope. Defective area was still here. So it must be a defect in the surface itself.The defective area is very large, about the size of my two fists combined. An inspector should have seen this defect. It should never have been sold as a first quality item.I expected better from Nordic Ware. Very disappointed. :("},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok, but warped after a couple of uses.","review":"Very heavy duty aluminum, but the bottom warped - the pan will spin like a top on the bulge that developed in the center of the bottom.

I found this pan and ordered one to try with the silicone baking sheets and I loved it so much I ordered a second pan. I don't think I will ever go without. I have also used for baking rolls and they came out so much better than on the nonstick dark pan. I would highly recommend this pan."},{"rating":"2","title":"This should last a lifetime","review":"This pan is great - it feels very sturdy. I feel equally confident baking or beating someone to death with this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maximum temperature not printed on packaging, not in Amazon description","review":"Overall, these are sturdy baking sheets and better than most of the flimsy nonstick \\"jellyroll\\" pans that you can easily twist in your hands. For most baking purposes, these pans shine. I recommend parchment paper to minimize sticking issues.The Nordicware website states that this pan is rated for use up to 400 degrees. This is not printed anywhere on the label. I looked this up after placing them upside-down on the bottom rack of a 600+ degree oven and permanently warping them. This is a pretty extreme usage scenario, however."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value","review":"I bought two of these, and I'm very happy with the value. These were inexpensive, yet are of similar quality of items I've purchased in home stores for a lot more. They're certainly thin, and one of mine was dented slightly in the box by another product I purchased (Amazon should work on some more padding between these). I've used them with the CIA Masters 12x17 inch cooling rack set inside, and it fits nearly perfectly."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a delight!","review":"Baking pans are something that you leave to the very end to replace - always thinking that they will still 'do'.How uplifting it is to use this product! Makes baking a joy again! Good tools are more than half the battle, believe me.These pans are very heavy and don't buckle up like my old ones did. With the silicone mats or parchment paper, cookies come out perfectly cooked every time and cleanup is really a breeze. I imagine that I could bake right on these sheets, but now that I have 'graduated' to what I consider the cream of the crop at a reasonable price, I have gone whole hog and feel as though I am a chef on one of the cooking shows."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed!","review":"Haven't use this product yet but was disappointed because when I took the cellophane off there were already scratches on the sheet."},{"rating":"1","title":"All that gray stuff?","review":"Was just looking for stainless items and noticed your \\"gray\\" matter.

I just used it to cook cheesecake brownies, and it worked well. I sprayed it with Pam for Baking, and nothing stuck. It cooked pretty evenly.

I anticipate this lasting a good decade or so."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent quality at a low price!","review":"I have really put these to the test, and have found them to be every bit as good as any other sheet pan of any size that I have ever used, whether in culinary school, pastry school, or restaurant work. These are top-notch!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm in love","review":"It's rare that a product meets your expectations and rarer still when it exceeds them. This is one of those rare products. I love to bake but have never spent more than a few dollars for cookie sheets. I needed a larger pan with a rim to make baklava and purchased the Nordic Ware bakers half sheet specifically for that. But, since purchasing the baking sheet, I have used it for everything from roasted vegetables to cookies. It never bends or buckles; the heat distribution is excellent so baked goods don't end up either over- or under-baked; the smooth surfaces make it easy to slide in and out of the oven, and it washes up beautifully.Life is short. Treat yourself to a couple of these wonderful baking sheets and buy a few more as holiday or hostess gifts. Your baker friends will adore you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Heavy Duty for Normal Household Use","review":"Overall I'm highly impressed with these sheets (I bought 2). Much more solid than any sheet you'd find at your local grocery store, and I anticipate these sheets will last a lifetime. The aluminum may be a little soft and lend itself to easier scratching/abrasion, only time will tell."},{"rating":"2","title":"Part of a package","review":"I purchased this sheet pan along with a CIA cooling rack. The combination is used for cooking bacon in the oven. The stove top will never see bacon spatters again. I can cook bacon to any desired doneness, and cleanup is a breeze."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to clean","review":"Although it is not a really bad sheet to cook (we use it for pizza mainly), it is a nightmare to clean and gets scratches just from looking at it.

It has much history and provides an amazing texture. However, $26.00 bucks for 6 bones is neither great, nor amazing. Fun fact; cuttlefish bones are used as a mineral supplement for pet birds. Therefore, they are available at every pet store on earth, even at Walmart. I just picked up two yesterday for a holiday jewelery gift, they cost me 98cents each. I wouldn't even mind paying a premium for quality cuttlefish bones but $26.00 dollars for a half dozen is outright theft."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth Owning!","review":"The filmmakers claim this is based upon the orginal movie, \\"The Exorcist\\" but I cannot see how this can be. I never heard of a priest going to kill himself during an exorcism in order to save the person who has the devil driven from them. I think a lot of things were made up. The acting is poor and even the effects are too. No one ever found the other dead teenage girl who killed herself. The script needed work. Linda Blair has nothing to worry about."},{"rating":"1","title":"One star for some acting","review":"I give this one a single star just because the women playing Gail and her sister are pretty good.As for the rest, it claims to be based on the story that inspired the Exorcist, but that is not necessarily accurate. Also, the production quality is horrible and the exorcism sequences go on and on and on and just become tedious more than frightening."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not horrid, but really bad!","review":"I just finished watching this low budget horror show and let me share with you that it sucks! The movie starts with the priest trying to perform an exorcism on a demon possessed woman. You cannot hear any of the exorcism and after both the possessed and witness die, the priests fails and is permanently blinded. Exit now to the present. You have the typical setup, one religious fanatic, one atheist, and one hormone driven teenage female who can go either way. The sound effects are ridiculous. You never see what actually possessed the star. You never quite understand why the possession occurs anyway. There really is no plot. I must say that watching this movie was even worse than that Blair Witch disaster, and that is saying a lot, people. If you can see it for 99 cents or less--go for it. If not, don't waste your money or time. It really does suck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overpriced movie!!!!","review":"Amazon/CDnow is asking over $20 for this movie? No way! The acting, the effects and even the script is all poorly done. Portions of this movie do not make much sense. I rented it using a freebie coupon at my local video store. Glad it was not a paid rental.

The plot was well done, the graphics wonderfully creepy, and the weapons cool. I was looking to buy this game for the PC since I don't have a 360, and am utterly disappointed that the game is DRM. It has limited activation. If I pay for a game, CD, DVD or what ever, I should be able to install it where I want when I want. You can't play it without the CD, so what's the problem?

The SecureRom debacle punishes the paying consumer while giving the pirates what they've always got, and the software companies are shooting themselves in the feet by employing it. I've been waiting a while after the initial release of most games, and then picking them up on Steam for a fraction of their price.From what I understand, the Securom on the steam version does not rely on disk checks but it still authenticates with the servers and has a 5 activation limit.That said, this game is great fun. The graphics, atmosphere, and controls are top-notch. The plot is compelling, and there was a lot of effort put into detail in making this game successful. I highly recommend playing it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun game but annoying as hell to install properly","review":"The game is fun but only if you are able to get it to install properly. My PC hangs after trying to install and run this. It took me a day to get the activation working after trying to contact 2k/securom. I have heard reports of other gamers with similar problems because of the rootkit/securom affecting their system.

I don't have the most powerful system and graphics card. However, I do have way more than the minimum system requirements that 2K demanded. Even people with totally loaded game boxes are frustrated.To ad insult to the whole miserable experience, 2K support is virtually nonexistent. They have stonewalled every request for a patch status.

I searched for possible reasons on why the game wouldn't run; it turns out that the retail version of this game intentionally installs SecuROM on your computer, a piece of DRM (Digital Rights Management) software that impairs the use of your CD tray. As a result of this, my CD tray now doesn't recognize the Bioshock DVD when I try to run the game, and the game doesn't run at all.Basically, I bought a twenty dollar virus."},{"rating":"1","title":"Graphics good, DRM baaad.","review":"The DRM software this game installs on your hard drive actually disabled another paid-for entirely legal game on my hard drive. (silent storm - sentinels)I contacted securom about the problem, and they actually sent me an updated file (ar.exe) that was supposed to fix the problem. To make a long story short, the game is still broken.I have to say, the graphics and environment they created in Bioshock is good, so if thats what you're into go for it.

It seems that the company has decided to keep the DRM in the game. Why? The game is not current and I'm sure the sales are not too great. Not a wise decision. Sorry, but I am not going to spend my money on a game that may possibly screw up my new computer.

This game is thinking \\"outside the box.\\" The idea is fresh and fun and never gets old, even after playing it several times. I love the open ended story line, and the art deco style of the underwater city of Rapture. Although strange the plot is very thick and fun to follow. The style of FPS is not new but the way it is adapted into use with the plasmid selection fire, ice etc. The storyline and charactors react differently and change the outcome of the game based on decisions made in game. The game is creepy and at times makes you jump from the noises. Bottom line it has everything for the FPS fan and a ton of action!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yes, I own it","review":"This game is sexy.

It's an incredibly atmospheric game. It vividly draws you into the haunting yet alluring city of Rapture. The design defies description, and the screenshots do not do the game full justice. This needs to be seen in motion. It's really quite engaging. I found myself more than once staring out the windows in awe at the underwater city.You're given a good bit of freedom and variety in how to customize the powers you gain on your trip under the sea, which is quite welcome. Also, I really like how the game rewards exploration and improvisation. The weapons and plasmids are tons of fun to play and experiment with. I won't speak of the story as it is better left to the player to discover. Suffice it to say that the story is as engaging as the fascinating environment and visuals. Overall, Bioshock is an excellent game which will take you on an adventure you won't soon forget!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Windows Vista is poison for this game","review":"I got this game and was unable to run it because of Windows Vista.

After that its story gets convoluted and tries to be smarter than it is. And like most things that fall into that hole, it throws in a M Night Shamalayn patented \\"twist\\" into the mix, which fails miserably.This game had promise, it has an interesting mechanic and decent graphics, but the story leaves a lot to be desired and the combat is repetitive and boring.Its a shame as what I read the original story was going to be, involving cult deprogramers and the like, was scrapped for this horrible stuff.Download the demo, it will leave a better taste in your mouth and you won't get to the crap nougat center of this game.

I've been waiting for this game since March of '06 and has blown away my every expectation, even after reading every review and watching every video clip on it, it's just unbelievable.Definately requires a HIGH end PC to thoroughly enjoy its splendid detail, but every last pixel of this game is eye candy.Best gameplay in a first person shooterBest storyline in a first person shooterBest graphics to date in a first person shooterI can't even begin to elucidate how overly impressed I am with this product.If you have the hardware to support it, definately get it for the PC, not 360... it's the only way to to fully grasp all that this game has to offer"},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of money","review":"dont like this game at all wont play it agian either. wish I had my money back game was no fun at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"what a cool game!","review":"lots of fun, i would rate it second after crysis.. but still fun!!! and a very creepy setting!

The graphics while mind numbingly gorgeous and the effects incredible, a game needs more than simply being pretty to be entertaining. The voice acting is also very well done with lines and voice-overs that aren't the typical \\"CUTSCENE! TURN OFF THE SPEAKERS QUICK!\\" type. However, the combat system is terrible, the creatures take tons and tons of ammo to kill, but ammo is very hard to come across. So for the majority of the game you carry a wrench around trying to hit things that are running and shooting at you. The \\"adaptive learning\\" system that was so boasted about showed nothing different in my play experience. The creatures still ducked/bobbed/weaved the same as the beginning. After the 10 hours I just spent, I demand a refund or raincheck for those 10 hours wasted. Bioshock gets nothing more than a 3 out of 10."},{"rating":"1","title":"Atospheric is all it is","review":"I cannot begin to fathom why this game is so highly praised. It's a clunky, slow-moving, boring, albeit extremely atmospheric shooter. The developers had all of Rapture to play with and have interesting relationships with various characters, yet they sidestepped any possibility at making this game what it could have been. The only communication with friendly people in Rapture is via radio.The city has a plethora of tape recordings lying around to discover, containing insight on the history of Rapture. However, there is no point in listening to them.The game is too easy. There's no shortage of ammo and upon death you simply respawn in the area as you left it. You can fight a Big Daddy with your wrench if you so desire and die many times in the process at no penalty.Overall, the game had a huge amount of potential, but neglected it and Bioshock became just another shooter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bioshock Installed successfully but not running","review":"Hi,The product Bioshock game installed successfulyy on my system.

If I purchase a home place: why should I let the seller live in my house and do what ever he/she wants?It was a such good lesson to learn.

Basically, you can't own this game. You either buy the physical copy and have limited installs, or you buy it through Steam and be forced to log in every time you want to play.So after I asked Valve for permission to play the game I just payed for, the real disappointment set in. I've read dozens of articles that describe this game as being like System Shock. It has exactly three things in common with System Shock: The word \\"shock\\" is in the title, there's hacking (or is it plumbing?) and there are multiple types of ammunition for each weapon. The game goes for a retro atmosphere, but it only succeeds at this by looking like it was made in the late 90's with an outdated engine. I gave it two stars for \\"fun\\" because it inspired me to play better games.\\"BS\\" is a fitting abbreviation for this game. It was a HUGE disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't Play","review":"Avoid this game. Not worth the trouble.I bought it and it installed alright. Played a bit and closed the game.

The fun with BS is the ambience created for the undersea city of RATURE. The music, dialogue and sounds (as others have stated) really make this game interesting. The Ayn Rand philosophy of the creator (Ryan) of Rapture (the individual unencumbered by rules, gov't or otherwise) and the 50's music make the mood surreal, but appealing. Others might find it annoying. Thumbs up so far. Not finished yet. I can put it down and come back 2 weeks later.

My biggest complaint was that the cannon fodder type enemies were too difficult on hard (and the Big Daddies too easy on Easy) so that the weapons felt underpowered later in the game even after upgrading them, so I was left using the wrench for most of my kills. Sure it's fun to crack a few skulls with a big chunk of steel, but sometimes I want to blow someone's head off with a shotgun in ONE go. Still a lot of fun though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just say no to the Digital Rights Mafia","review":"I was so close to buying this game: it was in my cart and I was about to check out.

These gaming companies want you to pay $60 to basically rent a game (limited installs, cannot resell the game) I will not purchase any games that install spyware/rootkits on my computer and I recommend you do the same. Be an informed consumer, research what these programs do. There is a reason the companies that publish these games don't offer any information when purchasing these games about securom/steam, they know an informed consumer would never install these malicious and damaging programs.

But, make sure you have all PC requirements, they are so high."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great game!","review":"I got BioShock from the Steam service last year shortly after release and played it through 3 times. Twice on a 5 yr old WinXp machine and once on a new Vista quad core machine. Zero problems with either. Its not a perfect game, but for me to replay a game, it had to be fun and a bit different each time. (Well, the story is the same each time, but you have many(!) ways to do the combat>) Its a bit on the easy side even with the patch which allows you to disable the super easy continue feature. I've heard people in general have had less problems with the Steam version, but that's just anecdotal. If you have any doubts, just buy it from somewhere that will let you return it if it doesn't work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bioshock Disappointment","review":"Have struggled with Bioshock for several weeks now. I am finally throwing in the towel. Amazing art work and scene sets cannot compensate for the frenetic, shadowy and fleeting fps combat situations, all taking place in a dark, poorly lit (albeit artistic) underwater civilization. Give me the light and air of Half Life 2, or Crysis, or FEAR. My sense is that this a game for gamers--especially younger gamers, who might have the endurance and inquisitiveness/inventiveness to traipse through an endless array of beautiful, but ulimately obscure rooms/locales. Bioshock is beautifully crafted, but dreary, uninteresting, and not nearly as engaging as an fps as reviews had led me to believe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could not install","review":"I downloaded this but could not get the game to install on my computer for the life of me.

Do not buy it unless your PC's capabilities can exceed the recommended requirements. Minimum requirements don't matter, it will be so slow and lacking in detail that you will be unsatisfied. There are also hidden graphics requirements (like the shader problem) that could make it impossible even to play the game at all. As someone that has bought over 250 games over the past 20 years, I was sorry to see that 2K software didn't understand understand the basics about shipping software that meets customer needs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Installs hidden ROOTKIT on your computer...","review":"The Bioshock DVD installs a hidden rootkit on your system. There is no way to remove it once the installation is complete. The process will run forever and will cloak itself from your task manager.The game itself only allows you to install the game twice.

Yes, yes, they try to claim it was \\"co developed\\" for both, but those of us with intelligence understand that it's a console game shlocked onto the PC with all the giant kiddy buttons taking up the screen and the lame controls.This game does not feel like System Shock or System Shock 2.

The low rating is my complaint against 2k and the \\"install\\" procedure. I spent fifteen minutes waiting for the game to load itself onto my PC. The game then attempted to auto-update itself. Since the 2k servers are down, and have been for hours, the game failed to update. As a result it totally removed itself completely from my hard drive without notice. What sort of nonsense is this? I buy an expensive game and it can't even install itself? The 2k web sites are down. Fine. That should be irrelevant to the install process.

Who at 2k thought this was a great idea?I looked on the 2k website (at work) hoping there would be a patch that I could download on to a flash drive to install on the home computer but NOOOO...they didn't even think of that.Now, we have two options...to take apart the home computer and install our board in my mom's computer, which has an internet connection - who thankfully lives across the street.

That is why I refuse to purchase a game that limits the number of times I can install the game, let alone a DRM program (like SecuRom) that could be considered a trojen horse.As a side note, this DRM method does nothing to stop piracy. All of these games were pirated within hours of their release and in the case of some, like spore, even before their release (with the exceptions of Sacred 2 and Red Alert 3 which have not been released yet, however the developers confirmed that they would use the SecuRom activation DRM scheme).

Then a made a mistake and went to hit the backspace key on the number pad and said wait a second there isn't one.So if you are using a laptop and you make a mistake punching in numbers you have to go over to the laptop keyboard and hit the backspace. Is this not totally ridiculous? I do appreciate them giving us a bigger addition symbol, but to take away the backspace button in favor of it is crazy.Yes i do like it, but I cannot use it because of the backspace issue.

The screws are much too small for this product.Once the new screws were in, my pencils sharpened beautifully. No snags."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally!!!","review":"I feel confident that I have purchased my last pencil sharpener! I homeschool my 3 children and have gone through countless electric pencil sharpeners. I knew I wanted the old fashioned manual type and I'm completely satisfied with this one. If you are type A, you may find that mounting it is not as smooth as it could be, but I wasn't bothered by it. I would recommend putting in the screw nearest the handle/crank first, and then the other two. It was just a bit tricky screwing that outer one in. Finally...sharp pencils! It may seem silly, but somehow my day goes better knowing that I won't be searching all over the house for a useable pencil."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK initially, but falling apart after 6 months","review":"Update: After fighting this stupid thing for 6 months, it just went in the trash. Every time someone tried to use it, the entire unit either comes off the base, or the top metal bar pops off (generally flies about 2 feet, and I'm immediately imagining it hitting one of the kids in the eye). Why oh why did I waste nearly $20 on this piece of junk?!?!Original review: Oh how I miss the old-school, basic pencil sharpener. Our family has tried a couple different models, and I had high hopes for this one. Unfortunately, it's hard to get the body properly snapped on the base, the rotating size selector won't lock in, and there's only one blade so sometimes the sharpening is a bit uneven. IF you can get it assembled and hold everything in place, then it does a sufficient job, but I can't really offer a glowing recommendation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Close, but no cigar.....","review":"This is an okay pencil sharpener, but it sharpens only one side of the pencil. It takes effort to sharpen a pencil with this thing so don't think children will be using it with any success. You will be the primary pencil sharpener here, and it is no easy task with this MISS of a thing. We have had it one year, it still 'works', but good luck finding a pencil sharpener that actually does. Let me know if you do find one that works properly and last longer than three months, I would be interested."},{"rating":"1","title":"average","review":"Pencil sharpener is not that well built.

The only steel was the cutters. The outer case that enclosed the cutters is made of cheap aluminum that is flimsy and comes apart easily.The complete outer shell came apart while installing.This is the absolute worst product that I have purchased in a long time.This is the risk of buying sight unseen.A plastic 75 cent sharpener is better than this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not sharpen large pencils","review":"The sharpener sharpens pencils to a very long taper to where when you write the point breaks off. You almost have to hold the pencil perpendicular to the paper to prevent breakage. It would not even sharpen large diameter pencils. I tried inserting the pencil while I had the cover removed and I could see that the blades do not even touch the pencil no matter how hard I pushed it into the sharpener. Another piece of trash made in China."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"This pencil sharpener is awful. The part that collects the shavings does not even fit onto the sharpener. It will only sharpen one side of the pencil. Really disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pencil Sharpener Struggle","review":"This may not be a fair review. I'm looking for a sharpener for my pastel pencils. What I found with this sharpener is the tips of the pastel pencils break easily (as in most sharpeners) and I have to take the case off to dislodge the point in the mechanism. What I found with this model is it's difficult to put the case back on once removed. I tried many angles and rotations to get it to snap back in. When I think I've figured out how to get it to snap back in, it doesn't work the next time. I struggle with this regularly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great!","review":"Pencil sharpener works well. Some pencils sharpen unevenly but not sure if it because they are cheap pencils.

It doesn't sharpen endlessly as most do, some kind of stop mechanism. And the point is truely amazing. I hope it's durable to last a long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed.","review":"Very flimsy pencil hole guide, only ONE cutter inside instead of two, and both the handle and hole guide wobble. It works okay on regular sized pencils, but fat pencils for kids will not go deep enough to sharpen. Also, when pencils are sharpened, the taper of the cut is really long. Much longer than the taper of a traditional sharpened pencil you would get from an 'old school' style sharpener. Overall, I would not buy this again and will look for another sharpener. This isn't the one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it.","review":"We've tried several pencil sharpeners from major brands that were so disappointing.This one is highly rated on Amazon and the price is right so we said, \\"Let's give it a go.\\"Now you can add another 5 star review to the list.

They are a little on the thin side (I do not have high arches) but I may have only noticed because I do not wear them with shoes.Four or five times a week, I wear just the right arch support - no shoes - to train (combat sport), which includes activities like jumping rope, jogging, kicking, twisting, etc., and the support decreases the discomfort in my foot. The arch support has a tendency to work its way to the top of my foot on occasion, moreso after the velcro starts to wear out.I recommend this product, but if you're using it when you exercise, you'll need to replace two or three times per year.

I will have to maybe sew some additional material or something on here to make it supportive. Not only was it hardly what I would call supportive, but I wear a women's size 8.5 shoe and these were slightly too big, but they did fit with a lot of material left over on the top once I wrapped them around.. Overall, I definitely don't think they're worth $19, maybe $6 for a pair if they had more \\"support\\". I should have just made something for myself.. I think I'll continue to use these, but with a lot more added material that I will put on for myself for support."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does nothing","review":"This product is cheaply made and provided little to no support.

I played golf every other day and felt pretty decent the entire time.These supports have to be worn with a lace up shoe because they slip othewise. Pay attention to the right/left labels. They won't be too restrictive because you set how tightly you want to wrap them.

I tried them on and they seemed to fit fine, although the stitching is cheap - if you were to attempt to remove the tags from the product, you would easily rip the threading out along with it, which would result in the entire product coming apart. The padding in the product itself is too thin and offers little if any support at all. I am thinking now, that instead of buying these, I could have just cut an oval shape out of one of my wife's thin panty liners and stuck them in my shoes - with the same end result. Which now gives me the idea that perhaps I could attempt cutting and sticking a maxi-pad in my shoes. A box of Kotex maxi-pads would be cheaper than this product, plus they would keep my feet dry.

It has more twists and turns than a dancing anaconda. It gives us a view of one of our best allies, the Philippines, and humanizes the Filipinos he meets. It's an exciting action story, but at its heart, it's probably the most truthful account, from a man's point of view, of what it's like for two powerful adults to be in love with each other I've ever read.I'd like to know a little more about what makes the two main characters tick, but I enjoyed it, even though it's not kind of novel I normally read. I give it four and half stars, highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Piece Of Fiction","review":"This is the most entertaining book I have ever read.

I give it five stars! Hosanna"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastically Funky","review":"I absolutely love this album. More than a year after its release, I am still bumping to 3121. It is a splendid mix of funk and soul with enough rock to satiate the diverse musical palates that Prince's music attracts. There are so many standout songs on this album - some hit you like Bernard Hopkins jab right out the gate and others grow on you over time. My favorite tracks are the slinky Black Sweat, the romantic Te Amo Corazon with its beautiful string accompaniment, The Word - this song is just awesome, Get On the Boat - the bass and drums just do it for me on this one, the lovely ballad The Dance and the sexy ballad Incense and Candles, and Fury the solid rocker that I love to blast. All in all, you cannot go wrong with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Great Prince Album","review":"My favorites on 3121 are 3121, Love, Fury, B,L&B, Incense & Candles, and Black Sweat.. I liked the version of The Dance from the Chocolate Invasion album better though.. My only problem with Prince is that he doesnt keep me supplied with enough new material.. Like all Prince albums, it takes a couple listens to truly appreciate his artistry. I cant see how anyone with a love of quality music wouldn't enjoy this collection of songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"This album grows on you","review":"For years the only Prince album I owned, like a lot of people, was \\"Purple Rain\\". Within the past few years though I've been exploring his back catalog. Was curious to hear what he was doing now and picked up \\"3121\\" based on his performance of \\"Fury\\" on SNL this past winter. That song is certainly a highlight. Other highlights for me would be \\"Black Sweat\\", \\"Lolita\\", \\"Beautiful, Loved & Blessed\\", and of course \\"Fury\\". The rest of the album is growing on me too. For fans of \\"Purple Rain\\" era Prince, this isn't really that sound. The sound today is very funky, very R&B and for some of you it may not be your thing. But if you do venture into this disc, you will find yourself getting into it."},{"rating":"1","title":"god awful!","review":"this album is totaly unforgivable, the only saving grace is \\"black sweat\\" which is classic prince, it seems that he has disapeared up his own rear end, either that or he's run out of inspiration.

I've had enough of your songs! But then again, I've paid the price just to see if I could discover another of his \\"pearls\\". And that's the case with \\"The Dance\\", the only one where apparently he's followed his instincts. As for the rest... Well, another composer trying to please the majority with his \\"easy hits\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beg for it, borrow it, BUY IT!!!","review":"Of course I'm a fam, and yes I am giving it two very enthusiastic thumbs up! The Man has definitely gone through it all and back again. I especially like the bluesy Satisified. If you are looking for typical Prince, then this is it. He has never disappointed his loyal friends. If you are a TRUE fam, then you know that Prince is ALWAYS ahead of the curve when it comes to music. Think about it, 1999 was 15 years ahead of its time-all of Prince's music is. So those of you who think this album is boring, buy it in about 20 years and see if it isn't right for the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"3121 Is Prince in his best outing since Purple Rain","review":"Having been a Prince fan since early high school this album is a welcome relief.It has dance music slow music and songs that stand out.The first being 3121 a kinda of a mix of different styles then jumps into Lolita.This has a nice variety from fast to slow and it goes back in forth.My personal favorite was the Dance Imean with a lyric such as don't wanna give u my love cause i don't wanna lose my mind,don't wannagive you my love cause it will be a waste of time.The hippiest song Get on the Boat is a nice way to end this album.It has 12 tracks but its almost like Prince could of continued but chose to end.That to me is ok because it makes me wanna hear his next effort.I also heard that he signed albums and performed in California.That is cool not too many artist will do that....Thank God he cares about his fans!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rebuttal to a review","review":"I just want to explain the difference between the Birds and the Bees to the \\"kid\\" down there who tried to compare Michael Jackson and Prince.Those two artists are both musical geniuses, both unrivaled in their talent, both American Royalty, but both so completely different from each other on total opposite ends of the spectrum in every single way imaginable that you can not possibly compare the two in any way, on any level, for any reason, ever. It's like comparing Elton John and Jimi Hendrix. There is no similarity or even any hint of a need to even think of a reason to compare the two.So \\"once-purple\\" this and go ask your parents to sit you down and explain the birds and bees to you if you still don't understand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tammy La Gorce: Does Not Know What She's Talking About","review":"I normally do not comment to other reviews, but Tammy La Grace's review was so bad and misguided that I was compelled. First. the fact that she calls prince a \\"black Beck.\\" How insulting is that! Prince created several genre's of music before Beck was even out of grade school. Your comment that \\"All-out weirdness for one. Edginess for another. And a fine-tuned sense of how to combine the two to create some of the decade's most vital music for a third.\\" Frankly, those statements are plain dumb and meaningless. Think about, \\"combining\\" weirdness and edginess makes prince a black beck. That's like saying Jimi Hendrix is the Black Jimmy Page because both where great guitarists and both pushed the boundaries of music--that's dumb. Again, your statement is insulting to the artist and fan base and you should reconsider your comparison."},{"rating":"2","title":"As Good as it Gets","review":"Prince is my all time favorite musician.

I wanted to emphasize what the previous reviewer said because I too found the amazon.com reviewer's a bit out of line.My one comment is how can Prince be the 'black Beck' if he was an artist before Beck was? Not only that, but Prince is a legendary artist and no offense but I don't think when we look back on pop culture in hundreds of years people will be holding Beck to the same level as Prince."},{"rating":"1","title":"corny","review":"Prince can't do nothing hardly anything worth hearing from a studio again. the writing has been on the wall for a long,long time that he needs a outside Producer,writer&a good editor. digging through the vaults just re-piece up tracks ain't cool. this record sounds like alot of things he did in the 90's&part 80's which while good musicianship shows somebody clearly out of ideas&still trying to be hip,but sounding very tired&dated. He is best suited to the stage.His albums have been corny for nearly 20 years straight to me&How He keeps getting deals is beyond me.re-cycle grooves&under-written songs with genric production is tired."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre","review":"I only liked 2 songs on this CD.

Its elegant, fresh and classic Prince. I wouldn't be without it."},{"rating":"1","title":"skip this one","review":"i am a huge Prince fan. while i realize he has not really had any big hits his last few albums, i nonetheless wanted to give his more recent cd's a try. and i am also a completist- if i like an artist, i try to get everything they have done. i listened to this one twice after getting it, and i gave it away the next day. there was really no songs on this that had any spark. nothing was all that memorable to me. based on some people who gave this really good reviews, i had expected much better. i'd say a much better more recent release by him would be \\"rave Unto The Joy Fantastic\\". Prince seems to have lost his edge, but i still love him and am waiting for him to re-invent himself. this one is for purists only."},{"rating":"2","title":"Off the hook!","review":"I dig this CD sooo much! I hear vibrations of James Brown, Jimi Hendrex, Brother's Johnson all the while Prince is beign his wild-child funky self. My four favorites are Incense and Candles, Love, The Word, and Beautiful, Loved & Blessed. I am wearing the CD out! It's funky, fun, has bounce but also reveals a more mature, spiritual Prince."},{"rating":"2","title":"Old school Prince","review":"This album kicks some serious ass. Everyone always complains about Prince and why doesn't do stuff like his old stuff anymore...well, you got your wish. This CD is totally old school Prince but fresh enough to be current. I'm telling you, there's not one track I wanna skip. I can listen to it all the way through. I can't even think about the last CD I said that about. Much better than \\"Musicology.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"GOOD OLD LOUCHE POP","review":"After lemons like Musicology and that quirky instrumental endeavor with 14 minute jams, it is good to see Prince treading back to his classic roots of funky pop. About time.As an album, 3121 has its eccentric feet planted in the past. From the sizzling trippy-hop funk of 'Lolita' or 'Black Sweat', to the raggedy punk rock of '3121' or 'Fury', to the silken jazzy undertones of 'Te Ame Corazon' or 'The Dance', to the ballad goodness of 'Satisfied', this should satisfy the most devout of Prince aficionados.A new-fangled sound experience it may be not, but it is the most versatile riff to come out of this troupe in years. You won't be disappointed if you dig your funk and have been known to like Prince in the past."},{"rating":"1","title":"honestly....","review":"prince is not back just yet. musicology was a mess. it was the first prince album that i couldn't sit and listen to all the way thru. 3121 is an improvement but it feels flat and a little uninspired. i've always been excited when prince had a new album coming out but since his conversion...that \\"spark\\" of genius...that raw, sometimes erotic influence is not seen anywhere in his music. it is like he has a chastity belt on his brain. i'm not saying he has to say every filthy thing that comes to his mind but come on, sex is always on the brain if you're a guy...even if you are 4' 10\\" and built like a woman. i rather he be an unpronounceable symbol than a convert. but like another reviewer said he's gotta be happy, that's what's important.but for those of you who are calling this better than anything he did in the 80's or 90's....WHAT?!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It really is dated","review":"[...] \\"3121\\" is dated, and the people who praise it are really praising Prince and NOT this actual record. Prince hasn't done a great album in 16 years (\\"Graffiti Bridge\\"). \\"Diamonds and Pearls\\" was fluffy; \\"Come\\" was boring; the \\"symbol\\" album was tired, \\"the Gold Experience\\" sounded like RUST; \\"Musicology\\" was OVERRATED. \\"3121\\" bored me to tears and it's true that he will NEVER do anything as great as \\"1999\\" or \\"Sign O the Times.\\" Face it, the Short One's days are done!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Prince goes pop, what a fraud! 3 good songs out of 12!","review":"Prince has become what he once hated, a pop star puppet just like Elton John!

So, to correct the amazon.com review, Prince isn't the black Beck.. Beck is the white Prince. Here on 3121, you get what you always get with prince, insighful songwriting and excellent musicianship. Not for the closeminded, he's gonna rock you, then slow it down for some nice slow jams, crank it back up to hiphop, maybe some country flavor.. You just never know with prince. Whether we like him or not, we have a admit that the guy is a musical genius. There's just nobody who does what this guy does. Maybe the \\"black beck\\" comment was meant to start some things. I had to be.. I don't think anybody with enough brain to pick up a pen would think Prince wasn't the original. Congratulations to Prince for his musical freedom, he deserves it. Peace."},{"rating":"2","title":"Prince the Genius","review":"I have loved Prince from his very first album, (when I was in my twenties,)until now. THE MAN CAN DO NO WRONG.

Black Sweat, The Dance ,Get on the Boat, are overwhelming,they take your breath away.The 3121 Album is just astounding..He and Stevie Wonder are the two most AWESOME artist I can think of.

I got this as a present and now I don't know what to do with it (I can't burn it for fear of releasing dangerous chemicals into the atmosphere). New Age piano music is making some amateur pianists complacent of their abilities. Boswell, like Tesh and Yanni, exploits the sustain pedal like a romance author with foreplay, resulting in pretentious melodies without parallels.

One of the end hooks is fixed, the other can be positioned anywhere along the stretch cord to effectively change the cord length. The cam-like design works beautifully and it allows rapid adjustments so the cord always provides just the right amount of tension.July 25, 2009 update:I've used this cord to strap boxes and painting supplies to a rolling cart. At first I didn't fully trust the mechanism, so I'd use an extra, traditional bungee cord, as well. Lately, after almost a year of use, I fully trust the Master Lock Adjustable cord and have stopped using the other, redundant, cord. The cam design does not slip, even with the vibration of rolling the cart for miles over bumpy streets! After a year of very heavy use, the stretch cord is showing some signs of wear, but the plastic hooks and cam mechanism are fine. It still works perfectly and I've just ordered another two because I like this product so much."},{"rating":"2","title":"You must STRETCH it some to work it","review":"The third hardware store guy figured out for me how to use it. No MasterLock instruction or good picture as to how to work it. It seems that the tension of the cord \\"in use\\" creates the pressure on the other end of the cam upside down semi-circle to hold the cord in place. My confusion arose because this cord is not an \\"at rest\\" clamp method: No tension means cord just slides through all the way to end. Several hardware store people and me could not figure out how to work it since it was not stretched. Thus, know that you have to have it STRETCHED some to generate the pressure needed to keep the cord jammed \\"shorter\\" by the Cam Lock."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent adjustable cord!","review":"What can I say? really do the job in combination with a MAGNA CART PERSONAL HANDTRUCK, the cord is strong and elastic, you can adjust the long of the cord to get more preasure and lock the objects that you were assuring, really good purchase for few bucks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great","review":"I purchased this to attach to my cart.

Working on the film has also given me the unique ability to attest to the fact that Victor Varnado is indeed a douche bag who despite having made millions off of the film's sale to Comedy Central, still owes me $500.Where's my money Victor??!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy This Lock!","review":"This lock worked for a week, but then it abruptly stopped working.

We wanted him to be able to feel comfortable with a combination lock, as they are installed on all the lockers at the school. This lock felt very cheap - you could hear the parts rattling around inside. My husband and I both tried it over a 3 day period before showing our son how to use it. Sometimes the combination would unlock it, and sometimes it wouldn't. My husband and I are both very adept at using combination locks.. I personally have used them nightly at work.. so it was not due to user error. It is just a very cheap lock. We sent it back for a refund, and are trying to figure out what step to take next to help our son."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good!","review":"I hated this lock!

This book has the little critter acting up and mis-behaving. This is very different from our other Mercer Mayer books where misfortune befalls our hero becuase he is a little boy being clumsy or because he is being 'helpful'.

Uncle Bill, Mr. French, Cissy, Buffy, Jody, and Mrs. Beasley are all there in the 5 season series. What's marvelous is that most of it was filmed on Sound Stage 10 at CSB Studio City. The trick was that some of the insert shots are on-location stock footage to set the place they're supposed to be. Studio backlots provided the settings of Spain and Tahiti. What's also most fascinating are some of the extras on the last disc of each season. Oddly only Part 1 of Johnny Whitaker's interview is part of Season 4. There is no Part 2 on Season 5 disc. Some of the information in the interviews is inaccurate. Sebastian Cabot was born in England and later moved to Canada. Some of the cast seems to think he was actually a Canadian playing a Brit. But these are all minor compared to the heartwarming lessons displayed in the series. You certainly won't be disappointed in owning this set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful DVD Set","review":"I am glad I sent for this DVD Set.

From begining to end....every song is just great. Bands like My Chemical Romance have nothing on these guys.....they're just posuers. The Rosedales (and groups like them of the horror-punk genre) are the REAL DEAL.

Though, this film is about getting out on your own, living life to its potential, and understanding a means to the world, all carries a weight, but the film doesn't carry it all the way. Baby Boy brings Snoop Dogg to his first motion picture supporting role. Him and Omar Gooding make a great team. Baby Boy is a walk through letting go of innnosence, a walk some of us have taken, a walk some are taking, and a walk people will take someday in their lives. It's too bad the film doesn't have enough grasp to give the film five stars. Check out Baby Boy."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of its' kind in years!!","review":"This is just about the best movie I've seen so far this year and really amazed me since I didn't really want to see it in the first place. The only reason I saw it was because I live in a small town, I had an afternoon to [pass], and it was this or Scary Movie 2 and the choice seemed pretty abvious but it turned out to be really good. I was really surprised by that guy Tyrese's performance since I really don't like his music but he was very convincing in his roal. If you don't like the beginning of the movie don't give up because it gets better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprise, Suprise","review":"Suprise is the word for this film. I was not really looking forward to seeing this film, me and my partner just happened to go see it cuz there was nothing else really playing in the theater. One thing that will shock everyone in this movie is how good Tyrese was in this role. Watching buffoons like Usher try to act initially made me cringe at the thought of Tyrese playing the lead role, but his performance was exceptional. Ving Rhames was excellent as always, and even Snoop played his role convincingly. Omar Gooding overacted in some parts, but i guess he learned from the master of overacting, his brother Cuba. All in all...this was an excellent film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be careful what you buy!!!!!","review":"I purchased the product a few weeks ago for a coworker.

The situation with Jody and his baby's momma has happened many times. All a girl wants is her man to be true. This is a story of a brotha who needed to grow up and realize what he was about to lose. It took alot for him to realize it, but he finally did and I personally thought the movie was GREAT. I highly recommend this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Baby Boy - Garbage in your Diaper","review":"Singleton's infantile critique of African American men's Peter Pan syndrome is laughable, uncreative, and unartistic with little to go on beyond stock, racist caricatures. While we are hungry for real stories about our own lives that help to explore our soulwounds and the complexities of urban life, this movie does nothing more than contribute to our exploitation. Singleton treats women as nothing more than directionless victims, shallow, and one dimensional. Our men, on the other hand, are nothing more than sex drive and fists. This is an unfortunate addition to the pile of crap that the film industry is calling \\"cutting edge.\\" The film is without artistry or decent story-telling. And it does nothing to extend a revolutionary view that is true HIP HOP."},{"rating":"1","title":"In the words of Charlie Brown..:GOOD GRIEF!","review":"Horribly embarrassing to black people. A disgusting story of a ghetto young man with no real goals or plans. Humping every girl he meets and sliding by through life.

PURE B.S"},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE MOVIE","review":"I just saw this movie and I can't tell you just how disapointed I am with it. It was so bad, I feel asleep during part of it(and I saw it in the early afternoon!). The first hour of this movie was pointless and it had no plot. The writers never fully developed the story and never made us care about the characters. I couldn't care less if they all got killed. It wasn't sad, scary or romantic. Tyrese, Snoop and Ving Rhames did a great job considering what they had to work with, I don't blame them. This movie has nothing to do with the crtically acclaimed \\"Boys in the Hood\\", which it is often compared. This was a waste of [$] and of my precious time. I am writing this to save you the time, money and boredom associated with this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie","review":"The real star of this movie is Cuba Gooding Jnr's (unknown) brother who totally steals the show with a brilliant performance. Check it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long, slow, dull","review":"Probably the worst movie this year, this drivel makes the long, tedious scenes from Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon look positively action-packed.What starts out with an interesting premise, that society shapes young black men to refuse maturity and responsibility, turns into the worst gangsta' crap produced in a long time, including the rite of passage when one of the baby boys kills a character and becomes a MAN. Shameless. Especially the hilarious scene when one baby boy accepts his pseudo step daddy's love when the boy hands over the pistol used to cut down the character. Apparently, the daddy, a one-time hoodlum himself, knows what to do with dirty pistols. It's a touching tampon moment... It's a complete waste of talent: Snoop Dog and Tyrese Gibson.Avoid the stench of this pile of crap at all costs. It should be sent directly to landfill..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Baby Boy breakout","review":"Baby Boy, written directed and produced by John Singleton told the story of Jody, a boy who needs to become a man.

However, it sort of gives off the all too familiar feel of boyz in the hood (and other Singleton films)"},{"rating":"2","title":"nice film","review":"Not as preachy or sappy as some of John Singletons other pics. Little too much sex for my taste (When I want sex I'll rent porn, thanks). But this movie is funny and true to life. Its about a man who has two babys mammas and doesnt want to settle down, hes a mommy's boy and things get ugly when mom gets a new man. The main characters are interesting and you get some laughs out of this movie. I dont believe it is just a \\"black\\" movie its a really good watch.

Yeah,you can find folks in the hood who talk and act like what you saw in the movie,but even they don't finish EVERY sentence with nigga. I never knew there were that many niggaz around. It's like Singleton just told everybody to just act \\"ghetto\\" when the cameras start rolling."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best","review":"great condition i got it early and everything went good there was nothing wrong with the movie no scratches or nothing it was a brand new psp movie i look foward of buying from here again you guys did a very good job and thanks keep up the good work so guys that are looking and reading this thanks for the time have a nice day goodbybe folks"},{"rating":"2","title":"much better than expected","review":"I must admit, I pre-judged this movie in a negative way.

You don't have to be from the hood to feel this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad, Sad, Sad","review":"This movie is a sad illustration of many black brothers in America: lazy, displacing blame, and unable to love properly. Two children by two different women is drama. Why would you even want that? This movie is also a sad illustration of many of our sisters today. \\"He beats on me, he cheats on me, he talks down to me, but he loves me.\\" \\"He just going through some things.\\" Personally, Baby Boy was a little too ignorant for me. Ignorance was bliss throughout the entirety of the movie. I do think that Tyrese is a good actor though. I do appluad John Singleton for wanting to address this particular issue in society. I still think Boyz N' Tha Hood was his best movie. If you want to see every single negative stereotype a black person ever heard, then watch this movie. If you are tired of the typical African-American movie with it's stereotypes and unnecessary curse words in the place of the English language, then you probably need to watch something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"What reviews I'm reading","review":"I read some of the reviews seem hostile towards the movie. I saw it on HBO and happens to like it. It's about an unemployed twenty-year old with two children living under his mother's roof. The movie is about growing up and learning from experience and what it means to be a real man. There are still some men over twenty, even thirty still trying to figure out what being a man is. Not to mention, there are brothas who just don't get what child support is (that also doesn't excuse sistas who think child support is supposed to be for their petty personal expense). John Singleton deserves to be praised for this movie he directed and wrote rather than be criticized. Nuff said!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Willie Lynch Revised","review":"What point was John Singleton attempting to make in his movie Baby Boy?As an African American, I was appalled by the extremely foul language that was spoken as commonplace in the movie. It seemed that the funding must have come from White America because the negative stereotypical depiction of African Americans was overwhelmingly represented in the movie. If John wanted to do a porn movie then he should have used another avenue. What was the purpose for all of the sex scenes. What about the complexity of single parenthood and the chain reaction of out-of-wedlock marriages. John, please don't continue to insult us as a people or don't you realize that all African Americans don't live like thug lovin, underemployed or unemployed,drinking,smoking, sex-only driven, ex-convicts who lack effective parenting skills."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too brief, unexplanatory.

As a student, I've used it for several graduate courses, and have found a need to reference other books such as Siegman's \\"Lasers\\" in order to understand the material. This is a common reaction, based upon classmates. Derivations leave out numerous steps for brevity, sometimes crucial ones. Often states results from other works, without any explanation. It often seems a collection of material drawn from numerous sources, with little thought to connecting the ideas and notation into a teaching tool.

I wish it would be a singularity here and there but unfortunately (for beginners) thats the order of the entire book.The book certainly might be useful to learned readers for reference or those who have Quantum Electronics the only course with lots of time to dig out archives of research journals to follow the ideas in the book.

Makes for interesting reading if treated as fiction. As fact, it is a bit hard to swallow in light of hundreds of accounts showing the Godman to be a charlaton. One is, even though disbelieving, amazed at the guru, Sai Baba's, ability to fool thousands for a lucrative existence in a poverty stricken area of India."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty boring, try a different Sai Baba intro book instead","review":"Well I've read the first half of this book now, and I've got to say that it isn't as good as the Amazon reviews made it out to be. Or it just isn't what I was looking for. I'm interested in Sai Baba and I wanted a basic beginner's book explaining what he's all about. Instead, this is a book about an American psychiatrist in the 70s who was drawn toward Sai Baba, but resisted him at the same time because Sai Baba's teachings go against the basic principles of psychiatry. So it's a long-winded, at times psycho-babble filled, story of how the psychiatrist's fears were slowly put to rest. If I were a hyped-up 1970s American psychiatrist, this book would be perfect.

It de-mystifies life on the island, the fantasies of paradise of many outsiders looking in and the myths about the offspring of the mutineers from the Bounty. At the same time and of equal interest, it enables the reader to have insight into the people who search for happiness or validation or escape on the island (author Dea from UK, Kari from Norway, Perry from Germany). The book comes across as the very personal experience of the author, so it is often quite subjective, and this subjectivity both adds to and detracts from the book. As an aside, it is surprising that the book does not protect the privacy of the islanders; it mentions their real names, putting them in a real-life literary episode a la Big Brother/Survivor. All in all, an enjoyable read and a rare glimpse into life on Pitcairn Island."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perhaps she should live on an uninhabited island","review":"Rarely have I started a book with so much anticipation and been so disappointed. Ms. Birkett seems to understand very little about the Pitcairn Islanders, and about human foibles. Her paranoia, pettiness and lack of character destroy almost any credibility she tried to give this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I am a Pitcairn Island enthusiast, so when I found this book, I couldn't wait to start reading it. The book started out okay, but soon I got bogged down by the author's constant negative descriptions of everyone she met and everything she saw. The final straw came when she whined about her \\"mistreatment\\" after she seduced a married man. Get a clue, woman! What did you expect? I am giving this book two stars instead of just one for the following reasons: 1) The subject matter is so fascinating that any book about Pitcairn Island is worth reading. 2) Dea Birkett could be a good writer if she would stop being so negative"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea that is executed surprisingly poorly","review":"What a tremendous tragedy that such a wonderful opportunity was wasted on a selfish, back-stabbing, childish writer.I was really looking forward to reading this book. In fact, after reading the first chapter, which is essentially a synopsis of the history of the Mutiny on the Bounty, I thought it was shaping up to be one of the finer books of the year. Unfortunately, after finishing it, I was absolutely disgusted with the author's self indulgence and lack of insight. Particularly appalling was her \\"surprise\\" that others on the island of 38 knew about her affair with one of the island's married men - this is after she had observed several times that there were no secrets on the tiny island."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"I was primed and ready when I started--What a great idea for a book, what a fascinating place, what gripping history. Little did I realize, however, that all this would become lost in the hands of one of the least insightful authors I've ever read. Having the emotional maturity of a newborn, she regards Pitcairn's inhabitants with little respect and seems to have arrived on the island with the sole purpose of indulging herself (and the expectation that everyone will likewise cater to her). What a shame that the unique opportunity granted Ms. Birkett was not put to better use. This really could have been a great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent south pacifc fantasy read","review":"a great read for anyone who dreams of sailing off to the south pacific and not returning"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't read this book","review":"This book was sorely deceiving. I kept reading and waiting for the \\"danger\\" to appear. By the last page of the book, no danger other than gossiping old ladies had appeared. I also agree with a previous reviewer that the author was narcisstic. There is little characterization of the inhabitants of the island or follow-through on events or characters introduced. I had no prior feelings toward the Pitcairn Islanders, but I feel they were grossly misrepresented and maligned in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anthropology in the tell-all format of a Hollywood Biography","review":"This book is worth reading, not so much for a view of life on Pictcairn Island or for a history of The Bounty, but rather because of the fascinating and powerfully disturbing portrait of a completely self absorbed author. She lacks the most basic respect for the subject she rights about. The gall of this woman. She lies about he reason for visiting the island and is welcomed as a guest into these peoples homes and community, and then had the nerve to criticize the intimate details of their lives. At the same time she behaves like a spoiled adolescent who expects to be universally accepted and the center of attention. It's no wonder they didn't like her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tabloid book reflects British Press very well","review":"I love first person experiences but this one is silly and a waste of time. I finished with few of my basic questions answered and found better information on the net....free!I recommend you look there and forget this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A total waste of what could have been a fascinating subject.","review":"When I first saw this book on the shelf my thoughts were, \\"Oh, this has got to be a good one!\\". My first thought after reading it was that the title was most appropriate. I can only say that I was amazed by her lack of insight into & empathy for the islanders. The fact that she thought she could have an affair with a married man & not get found out shows her naivete & insensitivity toward such a small community. The saddest part of all is that she's probably ruined it for anyone else that may have wanted to spend some time on the island. They'll probably never trust another outsider & I wouldn't blame them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missed opportunity","review":"Sadly, a wonderful opportunity for a vivid description of this remote island and its inhabitants was missed. The reader received an unwanted play-by-play description of a visiting captain's \\"pass\\" at Ms. Birkett, but is left with many unanswered questions about what life is really like on Pitcairn. The school is mentioned, but what is it like? What do the children do there? In fact, little is said at all about the Pitcairn children--what do they do, how do they play? There was mention of a birthday party, but all that is described is the food and the hearty appetites with which the Pitcairners ate it. Simple but interesting things are omitted--do they bring presents? Where do the islanders bathe? As another reader asked, what do they do with their garbage? The writer was unfair and harsh in her descriptions of the hospitable islanders. This book is a big disappointment and not what the reader expects."},{"rating":"1","title":"A surprising lack of insight.","review":"What's most remarkable about this book is its complete lack of insight into the minds of the islanders. What did they think of the outside world, viewed only through a VCR? Did they long to travel? What were the thoughts of the isladers who did go elsewhere (some traveled to the US and New Zealand)upon their return? How did they view the future, as their population dwindles?None of these questions are answered, or even brought up. What we're left with are the complaints of the author and some overly harsh portrayals of the islanders (Ms. Birkett recounts her initial meeting with her host, a kindly old woman named Irma Christian, by describing here as \\"insectile\\")This book represents a fascinating opportunity wasted."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Interesting Excursion to the \\"End of the Earth\\"","review":"I found this book neither as good nor as bad as the positive and negative reviews would suggest. It is, rather, a mildly interesting travelogue of the author's journey to what is one of the remotest islands on earth. Unlike many of the reviewers whose opinions are included here, I did not find the author to be an unscrupulous and condescending visitor to Pitcairn. But I did find the author to be a little insensitive to the wants and needs of others, and far too sensitive to what the Pitcairn islanders said and did in relation to her. Please don't allow the anti-author nonsense in some of the other reviews to dissuade you from reading this book --- if the subject matter is of interest to you. My 2-star rating is not meant in a negative fashion. This book was mildy interesting -- no more, no less."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid, stupid, stupid","review":"What a rip off this book was!!! I can't believe the effort this author went through just to deceive these islanders and make a quick buck. My advice ... don't bother reading this book. Shame on her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Serpent in Paradise","review":"A nice look over the fence, where the grass seems to be greener.A very nice read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book on Remote Viewing","review":"I have read several books on remote viewing now. This one is a bit dated now, but the information in the book still matches the material in the newer books. The authors of this book are the \\"fathers\\" of remote viewing. You do not have to spend a fortune learning remote viewing. You can pick this book up for next to nothing and have a very good grasp on what remote viewing is and how to practice it. It will tell you what remote viewing is and more importantly what remote viewing is NOT. They give very easy to follow instructions on how to begin to learn this skill. So far this was one of my favorite books on this topic. I would definitely recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gripping, Readable Tale","review":"Author C.E. Lucas Phillips provides a concise, gripping account of the surprise commando raid on the port at St. Nazaire in German-occupied France. In March of 1942, this was the largest dry-dock port in the world, capable of housing both large German warships and Nazi submarines then ravaging Britain's ocean lifelines. As the author shows, the British planned to put the dock out of commission by ramming it with an over-aged destroyer (the HMS Campbeltown) packed with a large cache of explosives concealed below decks. Readers see that the diversionary bombing alerted the German defenders, and many attacking British commandos were killed or captured. But the Campbeltown silent approach worked, it rammed the deck, and the huge explosion came as planned the next morning. As a result, the Allies gained a boost in the crucial Battle of the Atlantic. This is a readable, gripping account for military history buffs, or anybody wanting to read a suspenseful true tale."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy open","review":"This hook like devise works great for me.
