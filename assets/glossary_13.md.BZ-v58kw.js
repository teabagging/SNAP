Packaging several rather poor films with one a lot of fans really want, and at this price, is not very good. M & L films started going downhill and that trajectory is made up of the films in this collection. 'Hollywood' remains popular with their fans because it was their last one.

They started out with abrasive punk-funk and added instrumental depth that made their music perfect urban dancefloor funk/rock. And they did this all BEFORE the so-called \\"Minneapolis-Sound\\" tag was coined. Minneapolis was later to become known for Prince and The Replacements, among others, which is funny because the Suburbs really created part of the template that Prince used for his 'Purple Rain'-era sound, and before that, on their 'In Combo' album they mix up distorted guitar punk with crazy hard funk/rock fusion.

Bossy, the first single from her upcoming record Kelis Was Here is a very weak song that doesn't deliver very well.

I get quivers when I think about the pain staking scholarship that went into this book. This book travels into domains unventured. It inaugurates a new 4th phase of Egyptology. It left the authority of Egyptology saying we have alot to learn from traditional African cultures, signing the praises of Karenga. Ironically Karenga is like the teacher and Assmann the authority who is made to look like the student as his works are corrected. So many people need this book.

He is having a hard time understanding why his little brother gets all of the attention. I was hoping this book would shed some light for him. Sadly, I am not sure that presenting this book will help. The author appears to have been more concerned with adhering to the rhyme scheme than to effectively conveying any well-meaning ideas. I felt the \\"Yoda-esque\\" writing style was distracting and could likely confuse less than stellar readers or those with reading comprehension difficulties. Well meaning as the work is, I would not recommend this for young readers who want to learn more about autism.

The aerial persepective uniquely shows why lighthouses are built in the locations selected by the government. The stories of trying to fly an airplane and use a camera simultaneously are a delight. After my short aerial journey over the Straits of Mackinaw, I can appreciate the diffuculty the author had. The large format of the book allows one to study the details of each color photograph.

On Sigma using OS I could shoot about 100 pictures on a 10 Mp Nikon, now on the same Nikon D80 I shoot not less than 300 pictures always using VR.Better finishing than the Sigma.A bit heavy and maybe not up to the state-of-art. Focus could be faster and more precise comparing to other lenses.I use it mostly with an f8 and that gives very sharp pictures.I owe also a 400mm fixed f 3.5 but that's a completly differnt price class.

That was my mistake. I wanted a fantasy, but ended up with Mabel's non-erotic sense of humor writing style. Don't get me wrong - she's a wonderful author!

Unfortunately, the book didn't live up to my expectations. Partly this is because I love spy movies, and so while I wanted humor and parody, I also wanted Jane Bond to be at least somewhat competent and interesting (she was not). I wanted some cleverness to the storyline. I wanted the characters to speak with different voices, not all sound like an aspect of the same person. It comes off as rather smug humor after a while. I sort of felt as though Maney was doing her imitation of Armistead Maupin (author of Tales of the City).Check out the Nancy Clue books before picking up Kiss the Girls and Make Them Spy -- because I want you to see that Maney does have a fun sense of humor.

I always hated the racing games, because \\"It never handles like the real thing\\". Well, now I love the racing games, because I can \\"feel\\" the road, and the car reacts like it should.

Best of all you don't have to wait for the official Gran Turismo3 model to be in stock, because this one works just like it, for your Playstation2."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Product overall","review":"Comes with a USB connector. I don't know about compatibility with PS2 and all since I don't have one. Easy to install once you go through the included software/driver. Does come with an extra racing game that doesn't support this wheel, so I am a little mystified by that.The red part you see on the wheel is rubbery for better grip. I have relatively big hands and have no complaints about the size of this wheel. Set up is easy with the clamps, you can get it down pretty tight with just your fingers. The force feedback feature is definitely cool, makes you (at least your hands and arms) feel the bumping and sliding. The gas/brake station is not held down by any extra device, so it slides a little more than I'd like, but maybe you have better luck with different flooring. Requires power supply and three different wires to hook up, can get messy.Very good product overall, I think you will enjoy it as much as I do, certainly beat the heck out of gamepads, joysticks, or keypad."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad game controller","review":"I sell this today because is better my thrustmaster wheel (nascar racing but the old without forcefeedback ) I can hit the stop with a low amount of acceeleration, for me the bad wheel I have in my computer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clearly the worst wheel I've ever bought.","review":"There are many bad things about this wheel. For 1, whenever you turn it, it turns way to far to the side, and the car you are driving goes off the track. Another thing is, the pedals don't work very well. When you push even a millimeter dow on the gas pedal, the car speeds way up. Also, the brake/reverse pedal doesn't work at all. You have to reset the car if you want to reverse. On some games, the gas apedal and thebrake/reverse pedal don't work at all. When this happens, the car just speeds ahead, and there is no way to slow it down. Never the less, the wheel doesn't break easily, and it has rumbel built in. If you want a good wheel, then I advise you to by one without pedals."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!!","review":"If you are in the market for a high-quality wheel that won't break your wallet, get this wheel!

This follows the story of storks as they migrate from their nesting grounds in Europe to their winter grounds in Africa. Long after my son had outgrown it I would still look at it myself just to enjoy the illustrations. Now that my son is about to make me a grandma this year this is one book I'd love to start my grandbaby's library with.

It says water resistent to 99 ft. This is inaccurate. Water gets into it when showering. Bulova also has terrible customer service. They charge you a $ handling fee to have them fix it. When my watch was returned it was not fixed. Now Bulova says water resistence does not mean protection from water and they are not sure if my watch will be covered under warranty.

Be particular about the quality, otherwise, you're wasting your money if the lens has fungus or scratches on the glass. When you get a good one (like I did), it's a fantastic lens. Little tricky to learn to use if you're accustomed to the newer \\"twist\\" focusing lenses - this one pulls in and out manually, although it will autofocus. Really sharp, excellent macro (crazy shallow depth of field) and not too heavy.

This book grabbed me from the first page and held fast until the end. This is the first book that I have read by Ms. Laurey, but I hope it will not be the last! This story screams SEQUEL. The story takes place in a quaint little english village Bringham, where everyone knows everyone, and their business. We have our heroine Dixie Lepage from the states who inherits a home from her aunts, we have a handsome 400 year old vampire Kit. There is romance, love, murder,witches, and sexy vampires. What more can you ask for? I SAY SEQUELS!! :-) READ THIS BOOK I am still trying to unwind from this book, I WILL read it again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"First, let me say that I purchased this book on a recommendation and went in with no preconceived notions. But unlike the rest of the reviews, I didn't like the book. I found its plot too sweet, too contrived and the characters hollow. I can say that Laurey's powers of description are wonderful. You feel like you're in the small, quaint English village or in the B and B or in Orchard House. But even with the 'quaint' feeling, I couldn't finish the book for the reasons stated previously. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone unless you enjoy sweet, sappy, gushy love stories, which I don't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Vampire love story","review":"Dixie has just been dumped by her fiance when she receives news that she has inherited a house and fortune in an English village named Bringham. She quits her job and goes to see her inheritance. She knows little about the two eccentric aunts who left her the property. Her grandmother spoke of them rarely. According to local lore, they were witches. Dixies seems to have a series of mishaps, each one more serious than the last. She has also made a new friend. He is a strange character named Christopher Marlowe and she is attracted and frightened by him. She doesn't believe in witches or vampires....yet.Walk in Moonlight is an excellent example of vampire fiction. The characters are very real, it almost makes you believe in vampires!!! The storyline is riveting, I couldn't put this one down."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"The script or story is really boring one, plus many pretentious or boring acting from almost all charactors in there.

Who cares..."},{"rating":"1","title":"SKIP IT --This Movie is Boring and predictable","review":"This romantic comedy has a few funny moments, particluarly the scenes with Robert Downey, Jr. Unfortunately, he is not the only one starring in this movie. Claudia Schiffer offers a weak perfomance, and the story-line is just not that interesting. It is a typical romantic comedy produced by Hollywood filmmakers --guy meets girl, guy competing with another guy for girls' attention, etc. (you get the idea.) If you really enjoy romantic comedies, and can't get enough, then you will probably like this light-hearted movie. For those of you who want more depth to the story-line, and quality in acting then you should pass on \\"Friends & Lovers.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"what the?","review":"Well I thought that this would be a decent film since it has some semi-known actors and actresses in it. About a hour and a half into the film I was still waiting for something interesting to happen. Well I couldn't wait any longer and had to turn this off. (Robert Downey does have 1 or 2 moments of half-way interesting dialogue but that is where this movie ends). They all went on a skiing trip in this movie and the only way that this movie would have redeemed itself is if a giant avalanche came crashing down on everyone and they mercilessly perished . No such luck - I guess I will have to wait for the sequel for this, god help us!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent romantic comedy","review":"In the style of <i>The Big Chill</i>, this wonderful romantic comedy offers good character development, exceptional one liners, and a surprisingly good performance from Robert Downey, Jr. as he attempts to support the boring performance painfully offered by Claudia Schiffer.

It's simply pretentious, semi-academia hip chatter which is kept so politically and legally correct that you learn absolutely nothing! Your aunt in Omaha probably knows far more interesting stories of the old Hollywood stars than the author relates here.

A really lousy book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Much Ado about Nothing","review":"It seems odd that this book, with its good intentions, would just be so unsatisfying as a read. You almost get the feeling that the author is on the outside of Hollywood looking in. He seems to be obsessed with Ellen. The book has a certain bitterness to it that doesn't play well.I couldn't in all honesty recommend purchasing this book. Though if you find it at a public library, might be worth flipping through- but not checking out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time","review":"This book is written like a very boring text book that at times takes all your strenght to read.

A veritable snooze fest."},{"rating":"2","title":"A serious look at gay Hollywood","review":"Ehrenstein's book is a fine overview of Hollywood's treatment of gay and lesbian actors/actresses. There was a lot in the book that I was not aware of, and I've been a dedicated movie fan for five decades. He surprised even me with anecdotes about people I never \\"suspected\\". I'll be sure to seek out his earlier works, and am waiting for the next book.Dish on, David!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull, Dull and Dreadful","review":"This book has no life to it---I mean the writing--it is redundant, heavy, lackluster. Reads like a boring college research textbook. The author repeats and repeats and is consumed and obsessed with Ellen Degeneres over and over again. It is not like a book, but an overblown article. There is nothing new in the book--it is a historical account of gay and lesbians in Hollywood and boring as can be. Sorry I bought it but am thankful I got a used copy and did not pay much.

Second, the optics are perfect. Classic Nikon before they had QC issues. There is also no AF motor built in (so you need a mid-level Nikon with an AF motor to auto focus) but then that means there is one less thing to break over the years. It also means focusing is a tiny fraction slower than AF-S lenses. For portraits, weddings, live performances, etc, it's a non-issue but for sports, I think you'd need to step up to the VR II version or an older VR I if you can find one and can deal with vignetting in FX.I also do miss VR at times, but anything above 1/200 has no problems stopping camera shake and a monopod comes in handy."},{"rating":"2","title":"I bought this lens in 1997","review":"I still have the receipt for it and back then I paid $1150.00, so this is a super deal. Love the lens. It takes fantastic photos. I really enjoy using it. Have not had one bit of trouble with it and have used it going on 13 years. Mine was made in Japan. Don't know about now-a-days. Went from film to digital camera a couple of years ago and still works like a charm.

Even the distortion in Leeb's lyrics has that feel that reminds you of gashed Senses and Crossfire. And if I remember FLA by anything, it would be that they have the most amazing instrumental pieces. When you hear \\"the Passage,\\" you'll be reminded on how fantastic their instrumentals are. Although this is a Noise Unit side project, I'm reminded much of FLA when I hear this cd.

The quality of faxes sent & received is fine for a home office machine and the array of features is also fine. My problem is with the poor build quality of this unit. Unlike most Panasonic products which are generally durable, the construction quality of this machine is below par.

If you've ever wondered what Phil Spector might produce while suffering from a monstrous hangover, try this one out.Tops on the \\"what were they thinking\\" list are inexplicable covers of \\"Baby I Love You\\" and \\"Da Doo Ron Ron\\". \\"Let It Be Me\\" and \\"Maybe\\" provide solid evidence that being a balladeer was not one of Edmunds' strengths.

Great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life On the Razor's Edge","review":"I think the secret to the compelling nature of the plotline in J.A. Jance's PARADISE LOST is the awful frightfulness of the danger that lurks in the simplest things of everyday life, and the difficulty of negotiating the twists and turns of being a mother, a daughter, a wife, and a female sheriff caught in the limelight while running a murder investigation, and how all those roles play into the potential for disaster looming in the rear-view mirror, as well as the desperate hope for renewal that appears for brief moments around every turn in the road.Jance creates her effects by letting the reader find his or her way inside the minds and hearts of her characters, and by creating a world that is at once malicious and domestic in ways that can sometimes make it difficult to distinguish one from the other.It seems a simple story, simply told, but it keeps you on the razor's edge."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the. . .?","review":"I bought this book expecting to immerse myself in an epic struggle of Good vs. Evil.

This is the only prime lens I have ever gotten my hands on and I can see why they demand such high prices.It is rather antiquated technologically which is why I almost gave it a 4 star but the glass is what you pay for.

Fortunately, there's also an abundance of wit.A love story, told well and from the heart, about 20 years of sailing on the Great Lakes, primarily on Lake Michigan, the Mackinaw area, the North Channel of Lake Huron and Georgian Bay.There is much more in the book than the title suggests. While it does contain a lot of good cruising tips and data, Ron also rewards us with a substantial amount of historical research, not easily found in summary form elsewhere.For someone who likes to read (sometimes thought to be a lost art) and cruises or hangs around the Great Lakes, this is a hard book to pass up.Have some fun. Try it, you'll like it--maybe. I did"},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent sailing book","review":"Yesterday UPS delivered my copy of *Summer Studies*. This is a terrific read and I recommend it for your winter reading. You will appreciate Ron's insights into his cruising world and his love of the Great Lakes especially Lake Michigan and his home port of Muskegon. While I'm not as contemptuous of the industrial/military complex as I feel Ron is, nor of the Coast Guard, I am enjoying his book immensely. Unless you are truly cerebral in your command of English, you might also wish to have a dictionary close aboard your reading desk or night table. I love Ron's command of the language.If you love the Great Lakes as do most of us, you will enjoy *Summer Studies*.Robert Manning Marquette, MI"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT a cruising guide to the Great Lakes","review":"I have cruised the Great Lakes for years in most of the same places as Mr. Dwelle, so I was eager to read his book \\"Summer Studies.\\" And much of the work will be of interest to Great Lake sailors, but this is NOT a cruising guide. Rather it is a rambling retrospective that suffers from a few too many political comments and rants that have nothing to do with cruising, and only serve as an insight into Mr. Dwelle's politics. He even includes a 40 page history on the treatment of the local natives by white settlers, which - however interesting - seemed to belong more in a beginning anthropology textbook than a book on cruising.If your politics lean towards the Green Party, and you have ever anchored out in the North Channel of Lake Huron, you will certainly enjoy the work.

I actually was in the middle of reading another book and I thought I would just skim the first two or three pages of On Blue Falls Pond to get some idea what it was like. Well, I left my other book alone and finished reading this Crandall book because she had me hooked in the first couple of pages and I couldn't put it down until I had finished it. Others have told the story so I will just say that I thoroughly enjoyed this book and it is definitely in my pile of \\"keepers\\". I am now busily looking for other books by Ms. Crandall."},{"rating":"2","title":"nasty fun","review":"This book is a nasty, in a sophistiacated 1930s sort of way. Think, Clare Booth Luce's \\"The Women\\". This book is the story of an unrelenting social climber who had genuine talent and ability on her side but little grace, humility or kindness. And it caught up with her. The book does a good job of showing why Ms. Brown has so many enemies and why she rose to such starry heights in the first place. It's great for people who love NYC, or who love journalism, or anyone who just wants a juicy piece of shameless gossip."},{"rating":"1","title":"not so great!","review":"This dictionary WAS good up until my child was in 1st grade.

It is bright and colorful but, it contains quite a bit of information as well. It helps them not only when they are writing something (to look up the spelling of a word) but also to understand the meaning of words. It gives parts of speech, different tenses, and pronunciation of the word as well. I highly recommend it for anyone looking to buy a dictionary for children.

The Children's Dictionary is my pick, for sure."},{"rating":"2","title":"It opened my eyes","review":"I was lucky enough to take Dr. Mazrui's course at Binghamton University this semester entitled Cultural Forces in World Politics and it was an eye opener. I had never even considered such things as the significance that the Protetant ethic played in the development of European imperalism during the 17th and 18th centuries. I must confess that I did take a nap once or twice during his lecture and I did not read the entire book, but Dr. Mazrui is a genius. This book should be a must read for anybody who wants to take a broader perspective on the world."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are better","review":"The readers thus far listed have high praise for Dr. Mazrui's book. I too took his class on Cultural Forces at SUNY Bing, but I came away with a far different perception about the man and his ideas. He has done some pioneering work, to be sure, and his \\"lenses of perceptions\\" arguments seemed on the surface to have some merit.But reading mroe of his work after having taken that class as a dopey college sophomore, I see that his views are less scholarship and more polemic. There are other writers who have done much better work, for example, Harrison and Huntington's Culture Matters. Or anything by Kaplan. This one should remain on the library shelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the car, and especially for twins!","review":"I also purchased at Sam's for $179, and have been very happy with the performance and ease-of-use in the car.

The box clearly shows the contents and nowhere was I misled into believing one was included. I think earlier comments are due to lack of research and knowledge of what is standard on these units.This is still a recent purchase but so far the picture quality and sound are excellent. I paid $179.99 at Sams Club. I have one child and one of the benefits with this is you can use the screens in separate vehicles. It has two remotes, ear buds and power adapters. It has only one cigarette lighter adapter which can be picked up pretty cheap.

I just found one of these Book Owl lights in my desk drawer so somebody must have gave me one, at one time. The (2) CR2016 batteries were dead, but luckily (and with help from an online battery conversion chart)I had, and was able to put in, (1) CR2032 battery to replace them. But unfortunately the bad reviews are true because I quickly found out this is a poorly designed book light. It indeed DOES NOT light the full page..the upper left and right hand corners as well as the bottom of the page are not lit well or at all, no matter how I tried to angle the light neck. The light neck might also be a problem for larger books and because the top part of the light's len cover is clear, the light bulb shines in your eyes and is pretty distracting.

Compared to older book lights with 4-AA batteries and incandescent bulbs, this one looks and feels much lighter, more modern, and cooler. As noted, however, the LED burns with a blue light that is less friendly than the old-time yellowish light. More importantly, even when the batteries are at their peak, relatively little light reaches the page. Worse, because there is transparent plastic *above* the lamp, some of the light winds up directly in your eyes. Who knows what the designers were thinking!

It's small but the LED bulb gives off quite a bright light considering the size. Plus, it's a clean 'white' light (as opposed to the yellow light you get from fluorescent bulbs). This is great for the eyes. What's more, this is so lightweight, it works with small paperbacks! My only complaint, and the reason I didn't give it '5' stars, is that I'm worried the batteries won't last as long (these lithium batteries can be costly to replace).

If you can imagine a strange hyrid of Hawkwind, the Cramps and the Cure, then you've got a pretty good idea of what ASF is all about. Not surprisingly, this CD features the group's spaced-out reversion of Hawkwind's classic single \\"Silver Machine\\" as well as a few classic ASF originals such as \\"R.I.P.\\" and \\"Coma.\\" Space Goth-Rock at its best."},{"rating":"2","title":"No sophomore jinx","review":"Mariza has done it again, presenting a second compelling CD in which she shows a more jazzy side to her vocals. The traditional Fados are still the best, sung in her beautifully resonant voice. She has firmly placed herself on the international stage and I imagine will be receiving a lot of attention in the years to come.The Fado has a rich heritage. A CD that is well worth buying is Biografia do Fado which charts the origins of this unique form of music back to the early 20th century. For years, Amalia Rodrigues was the reigning queen of Fado, but after her death in the late 1990's, it seems that Mariza has now assumed the mantel. She seems to be pushing the Fado in new directions on this CD. It is a more richly orchestrated set which includes horns and additional strings. For purists, this may be a little too much sound, but for those new to Fado I think it only adds to the experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"beautiful!!!!!","review":"\\"Fado Curvo\\" was a beautiful surprize. I loved Mariza's first album \\"Em Mim\\" and I love this one. There is a sensitive poetry in her songs. \\"Cavaleiro Monge\\" is my favorite. Her Fado is sweet, romantic, sexy, and powerful.What a brake from the emptiness in our modern american songs!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fado Curvo","review":"Mariza's voice is beautiful like always. It's a good cd. Some songs I like and others I didn't, but for anyone who likes fados I would pick any of her CD's!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Resounding performance","review":"Having seen Mariza perform twice from her first album Fado em Mim, this album hasn't skipped a bit from her last. The voice remains stunning, resonant and controlled and the music evocative. Almost all the songs are original and Primavera stands tall in an elegant collection. If you can, try see her in her N. America tour this year. . .that will blow you away"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Fado!","review":"Mariza hits again with her deep and colorful voice the classic popular fado. Perharps the nearest future Rainha do Fado. After Fado em mim; (still her best album) Fado Curvo hits new roads. Once you listen her voice you just become fan and addict to fado. Portugal has probably the best female singers in the world, Misia, Dulce Pontes, Mafalda, etc. real divas that make me think I'm very affortunate in speake portuguese and share not only their voices, and melodies, but the feeling that embrace each of this beatiful songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing after Fado em Mim","review":"I found this disappointing after Mariza's debut album, Fado em Mim, which has much better material. It is also disappointing when set beside some recent albums by other fadistas like Misia, Camane, Mafalda Arnauth, etc. Of course, her remarkable voice is still there, and there's no doubt it is the nearest voice in modern fado to that of the late Amalia Rodrigues (with the possible exception of Misia, who chooses her material much much more carefully). Mariza needs a little more maturity, and perhaps better guidance in what fados to sing. If she gets it right, she will truly become the new Queen of Fado, but for the moment my money's on Misia."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing Exciting Here","review":"Spahn Ranch is an early 1990s guitar based industrial act from the Los Angeles area that has a sound a bit like KMFDM or Ministry. Before purchasing this EP, I'd recommend listening to the tracks amazon sampled as well as checking out a few other Spahn Ranch albums.The only track I really liked was \\"Breath and Taxes\\", which has a fast and regular beat accompanied by catchy guitar riffs. I thought the second track \\"Antibody\\", which had a slower darkwave sound, was interesting.If physical space wasn't an issue, used copies of this album are cheap enough that the album might be worth purchasing for this track. But sadly space isn't free, and the other tracks (and album art) didn't really interest me. I rarely listen to this EP at home and I wouldn't recommend this album to anybody. You might be able to find the track \\"Breath and Taxes\\" elsewhere. If you are still interested in Spahn Ranch, I'd point you to their \\"Coiled One\\" instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Functional","review":"The Slate I received actually has 6 Lines x 20 Cells, and measures 6-1/2 x 2-5/8.Slate is \\"Made in India\\".

Not only was it entertaining, it was educational and eye-opening. The story surrounds the Modoc Indian war of the 1870s. The main characters, a Native American women and and white man, struggle to hold on to their love for each other, while each of their own cultures are determined to destroy the other. I liked the book as it is historical fiction and based on the author's family. The details of the war are outlined in a gripping and fast paced manner. I also liked the details of Indian life and the use of Modoc words in the story. (The author provides a glossary of the words and the characters.) Additionally, the use of factual, historical records in the book was helpful. I plan to keep this book for my children to read when they are older as it will provide a view of the story of white man's western expansion that is not often found in textbooks. Well done, Paxton Riddle!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The tears never stopped","review":"It's one thing to write a review of Lost River, I'd rather write a lament.

I thought that it might not actually be an inferior product, after watching my cousin act like an angry monkey and beat the brand new wireless mouse he had bought to replace this one.So when it came time for me to buy a new mouse I remembered this one and decided to give it a shot. First problem I noticed was that the batteries wouldn't last more then 24 hours of use. Second problem was that after a week I couldn't left click on anything.I do not abuse my computer equipment, nor accesories, atleast not physically, verbal abuse is another matter altogether however. Heh, so I expect them to function properly for longer then a week after I buy them, and returning products is kind of a hassle.Unless your not intending to use this mouse more then, ten minutes a day, I would suggest you pass it over and buy something more reliable."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disaster","review":"The Micro Innovations wireless mouse did little more than eat batteries at a blazing fast rate. After a much too long wait, I got an RMA number from Ritz Camera from whom it was shipped.

I placed the RMA number at two locations on the package, also covered with clear shipping tape."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely disappointed","review":"I should have read the reviews before plunking 20$ on this mouse... The battery compartment and the small cover look so cheap...but that's not the problem. The mouse is all jumpy and erratic, and doesn't respond well. I'm back with my old corded Targus travel mouse, which works like a charm, and is smoothly responsive to my hand movements."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good luck installing batteries!","review":"I can't say much about the mouse, since I was stuck in Step 1 of the User's Manual--battery installation. No kidding! \\"Remove the battery compartment cover located on top of your mouse by pressing the release button...\\" I looked at every square inch of the mouse and I can testify under oath that there is NO RELEASE BUTTON.

It would have been better to spend the money on practically any other mouse out there, even if it were a trackball mouse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not work. Manufacturer does not have customer support","review":"As soon as I have purchased it from one of the electronic stores, little did I realize that I have to take into consideration of the fact that the product may not work. So I ripped the box apart and plug the mouse into three different PC and laptops and found out the USB receiver did not work. I have gone through the live support from [...] and the person on the chat asked me to ship the whole thing back with shipping cost on my expense. I explained that the only mistake I have made was purchasing the product and I do not want to pay anything additional out of my pocket for the defective product. The person insisted on their satisfaction warranty statement. If I couldn't even get the product work, how can I even measure the level of satisfaction of the product? I asked.

The author mixes quotes from reputable scholars with mostly unfounded surmise. The main topic of the book is not medieval music but New Age philosophy.The author's lack of knowledge of the basic conditions of medieval life is immense. For instance, she refers to a \\"schoolyard\\" with children playing in it in medieval Germany."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great fun book!","review":"Molly O'Keefe has created a cast of really fun, believable characters.

Those familiar with Harold Lamb will no doubt offer a positive review. This book, like several of Lamb's other paperbacks, is a condensed version of an important part of the history of the Western world, mostly ignored by Americans. Josef Stalin's atrocities have typically been blamed on that universal scapegoat of the Joe McCarthy/Ronald Reagan era of America, communism, but nothing could be further from the truth. Stalin's behavior was thoroughly consistent with historic Russian rulers going back to Genghis Khan himself. This book clarifies that, and more importantly the notable similarities between the histories of Russia and of the United States. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong Mouse!","review":"FYI - It does not specifically state it here, but this mouse is for the PS2.

It was my beach book, and it was the best! Most of the info in it was new to me (since \\"The Day Diana Died\\")because I don't really seek out gossip from tabloids and TV, etc. But I think the author attributes his info to fairly reliable sources, witnesses to the events. I disagree with the \\"reviewer\\" from Harrison: the portrayal of Charles was very touching, I thought. It was evident that he could not have acted more warmly, given his up-bringing, until after the accident, when he really began displaying his affection to his sons. Of course, I read \\"The Day Diana Died\\", so I already had this impression of Charles. And call me simple, but I appreciated all the photos: a thoughtful touch that reminds us that these are real people!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Untangles rumors and myths","review":"This is a dramatic story of our time, and Christopher Andersen helps make sense of it. Perhaps those who read everything ever printed about Diana may find similar accounts, but for those of us who want one good, straightforward perspective of this history and of Diana's place in it, this is an excellent read.I've read some of C. Andersen's other books about international celebrities, and find them usually to contain lots of the juicy bits we crave, but with a non-judgemental, often sympathetic, point of view."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"I loved this book!

I would recommend this book to anyone who loves the royal family as much as i do!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Aimless and tacky","review":"Christopher Andersen's book is aimless in structure. He spends over 300 pages careening around anecdotes about William and Harry, but the book doesn't seem to have much point beside that. He takes quite a few potshots at Camilla, and after only a few years, some of his theories about Diana already seem dated.If you are a nut for info on Diana, the book might be worthwhile. Otherwise, it's just a messy attempt to cash in on the Diana craze."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Most of the material in this book was in \\"The Day Diana Died\\". There is little new except William's supposed escapades with various females and I don't find that very interesting. He is much too young to even think of marriage and settling down. Do we need to know every twit he is dating now?Borrow this book from your library. Please don't waste your money buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing new here","review":"This is a sad little volume by an author who likes to exploit celebrities and tragedies. The information in the book has all been said before, so why is there a need for this book? Diana died in 1997 and here we have a book that few, if any, people should really care about.As I thumbed through the pages, I thought to myself that this book is more gossip and tale-tales than good, factual reporting!"},{"rating":"2","title":"can't put it down...","review":"I've read many royal family books and I just can't put this one down. It's so interesting to read about the relationships between Diana and Charles and their sons. Gives great insight into the wonderful person Prince William is... how he goes out of his way to help people, just like his mother. This surprised me, along with many other things, such as how William would not speak to Diana for days after the famous Panorama interview. Interesting read for anyone who enjoys the guilty pleasure of reading about the Windsor Soap Opera."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent quality, very sharp, heavy and very expensive","review":"I have owned this lens for about four years now, and it is my favorite lens. It is built like a tank, very solid construction and very heavy. For maximum sharpness, I recommend using the lens at F/8 for most situations however; at constant f/2.8 the pictures are very sharp also. It does excellent at weddings and studio portrait photography. Distortion is not a great concern however, you may have to use a little distortion correction in Photoshop, or what ever software application you use to edit your pictures, when shooting at 28mm. Distortion at very close range, especially when shooting tall buildings is noticeable. The lens has a tendency to flare very easily including at night. Nothing that can't be fixed in Photoshop but, flare can be avoided by paying a little more attention. I rate this lens 9 out of 10. I will love to see this lens in a VR version in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Used 28-70 Nikon Lens","review":"Love this lens, however after a short time, it started malfunctioning.

We're talking oh, maybe, ten single-spaced typed pages of garbled inspirational material. There is some explanation of the Law of Attraction, but a lot of unrelated concepts. Yoga? Buddhism? Very little practical advice on how to apply the theory to your everyday life.This book seems to me like a quickly thrown-together attempt to cash in on a current spiritual fad. If you are interested in pursuing the Law of Attraction -- which I have found to be a very useful and compelling concept -- try The Secret, or Ask and It Is Given."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacking substance","review":"This book is full of quotes from different authors and lacks authenticity.

Don't waste your money on this CD - buy 'Rise' instead - it's much, much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glam cheese","review":"I owned this album some years back and it is horrible.Some of the songs used to make me laugh. Especially \\"Farwell My Little Earth\\".I would play it for people just to make fun of it.It is like listening to some really cheesy glam rock band,but worse.If you listen to Nosferatu you really have to be picky about what you buy from them.The only thing I still own from Nosferatu is Legend ( a collection of early recordings) it has some pretty ok songs, although I don't listen to it much any more.I have to be in the mood and that mood does'nt happen much at all.I keep it just to remmember my earlier goth days."},{"rating":"2","title":"Getting to the Heart of Art","review":"This is a great book for artists and non artists alike. It is a useful tool for any age group in understanding visual imagery. The poetry is done in response to art that ranges in style and media, giving the reader/viewer a wide exposure to the arts.The poerty is crisp, interesting and meaningful to contemporary culture without being trite or overly stylized.This book is a great educational resource, coffee table book, or good cure for the common boredom!"},{"rating":"2","title":"modern art included with poetry","review":"Bought this book because it was part of the Sonlight 300 curriculum. Because it reflects poetry from the 20th century it rarely rhymes which can be hard to get used to. But, it does have a picture for every poem, most of which are color and relate to the poem. The pictures are all from the 20th century so your study of Modern American History can be that much more complete."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Fit","review":"I put these on our Buick Century to make it look a little sportier than a grandma's car.

It's far too over-generalised and the result is insipid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weakness exposing attempt","review":"I'm afraid Jane Eaglen doesn't quite know of her own capabilities and limitations. Opera singing is not just a matter of beautiful sound. There has to be emotion, drama and charisma, none of these Eaglen has. Her Mozart is at least competent, though far from outstanding. But her Strauss definitely doesn't work! Just pull down any (yes, any) recording of Strauss by any (yes, any) soprano and you'll at once note how deficient Eaglen's interpretations are. No, she definitely is not for such repertoire. Besides, her top register isn't glorious at all - a liability in Strauss.

Like Bryan Adams and Loverboy, Trooper music didn't add anything new to the music industry but that was not the idea. With songs like We're Here for a good time and Raise a little hell, Trooper have demonstrated that rock music should be about fun and this album very much epitomizes that old time rock n roll sound. No pretentiousness, no BS, just good music. Highly recommended. Other Trooper albums worth listening to are: Flying Colours & The Last of the Gypsies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Classic Canuck pop rockers deserve better than this","review":"Trooper was one of Canada's best 1970s pop rock bands. Influenced by Guess Who/BTO founder Randy Bachman (he produced the Vancouver quintet's first four albums), Trooper had a dozen top 20 hits north of the border between 1975 and '80. The band is still together, with lead vocalist Ra McGuire and guitarist Brian Smith touring around the country.The question is, why has MCA (the label that released 7 of Trooper's 9 studio albums) not given the band its due with a decent compilation? Hot Shots was released right after the fourth album, so it's missing a huge part of the the group's history. Not only that, Hot Shots contains only 12 songs and 45 minutes -- far less than an average CD can hold. Finally, this cd has *terrible* sound quality, as if it was mastered from a beat-up 8-track tape.Shame on MCA for spitting on Trooper's catalogue! Then again, I shouldn't be surprised. The label still hasn't released all the studio albums on CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really Bad Sound Quality","review":"I bought this expensive CD for the same reason you are looking at it, to get Raise a Little Hell on CD.

It's a good history of WiFi and was probably very good information back in 2002-2003 but it's out of date in today's WiFi world. It only mentions 802.11g protocols and doesn't touch on the new 802.11n protocol. Instead it concentrates on the 802.11a and 11b protocols which are being phased out for the faster and longer range 11g and 11n protocols.

At 2.8, the lens is as fast as you could expect from a prosumer wide zoom. The optics are sharp, the build is solid - the only complaint I have with this is the infinity spin on the focus ring. It doesn't offer hard stops on the min and max focus points which can be a tricky thing when dealing with a follow focus. Aside from that, I'd prefer to get as wide as 12 or even 14, but this was as close as I could get with a manual aperture ring, and at the price I could afford."},{"rating":"1","title":"worked well for a while","review":"Bought it 2 years and 2 months ago.

I think it's highly telling that those who criticize Wilson call in an Anglophile colonial apologist to compare her unfavorably to. Apparently, some will never get over the sunset of the British empire, or accept the very real negative affects of British imperialism. Wilson's book is deeply reliant on archives and real historical research.

This is just the same rehash of every other Sword and Sorcery plot, only not as well done, without any depth or colors of real characterization.

No new story line and a complete rehash of Queen of the Demons. I admit that some of the characters were imaginative and added to the story (Dalar, for instance), but overall this book was disappointing. Each of the characters went off again on their own and fought through a series of minor, but life-threatening battles, to end up together and facing the arch-enemy just like in the last book. It would've been much more enjoyable if the author developed the relationships between the original characters a little more and provided more cooperation between the Barca's Hamlet people before and during the final conflict."},{"rating":"1","title":"How do you spell \\"trite\\"?","review":"Put bluntly, David Drake has produced a rather bland and poorly wrought piece of fantasy here. As a fan of the first book, I read with enthusiasm, but still no serious expectations. The book was full of childish sentiments (e.g., 'We *must* stop Evil and help the Good!' or 'No one wants what I want! Peace for all the Isles!'). All of the characters have become parodies of themselves. The long descriptions of trite details were difficult to read. At least make the details interesting. They are usually what adds depth to the world-building. Instead, in this case, they drew me away.In short, forget this series.

This lent a different feel to the book than the other Dragonlance books that I have read. Parkinson's descriptions of place were very detailed and interesting to read.

'The Gates of Thorbardin' kept me interested until the very end; I truly enjoyed this book.It is a very interesting story that combines a dwark, a kender, a gnome, and a human. Although the kender in Volume 2 was irritating, this one was funny. I am pleased that I bought this book, and I enjoy occasionally rereading this book. The characters are well-place and well-written. The storyline seems to actually have a purpose.I reccomend this book to all, but it doesn't make a good book with which to start the Dragonlance series.

I am a fairly technical person (so is my roommate) and since set up is not complicated at all, I'm quite certain that the reason for the mouse's failure was not a result of something I and my roommate did.And there is no customer service number.I would wait until this technology develops a little more.

The best songs, such as the shimmering Sir Shaheen, mysterious Please Mr. B. and Howl A Little, have a serpentine shape; writer Ben Escher keeps leading us to bends where there's a musical surprise around the corner. The faster songs are more derivative, wearing XTC and the Talking Heads on their sleeves, but still fun and catchy.

It is pure IDM, matching chunky, harsh beats with lighter synth melodies. They problem is the both the melodies and the beats are dull. It is like IDM by numbers. The beats sound garage oriented, never quite doing anything inparticular and some sounding very uninspired and sloppy. The melodies are quite tame and uninteresting... barely maintaining any depth or catchiness, while most IDM has one or the other. What interests me in IDM is the depth of production, which unusually involves either sparse, emotionally driven melodies or harsh, crafty beats. Marion has vague hints of this, but in general it has neither."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT USE","review":"Although I personally do not use this product, I am currently sitting in a lecture hall where my UCLA professor just warned us that this type of brush is extremely detrimental to the patient.

Rather than the genuinely helpful and entertaining advice given by Trinny and Susannah, our American version is sniggering, condescending, and out to \\"entertain\\" us by embarrassing those whom it purports to help. To be sure, the English version also had the style counselors throwing up their hands in despair at the frumpy dress of their constituents, but then they put their hands down and set out to gently and firmly raise the confidence of \\"ordinary\\" women and men, regarding dress.

He writes in an easily, understandable but profound way about one of the most significant struggles for nationhood in the XX century. He covers many centuries of history but convinces me that Eritrea is indeed a special place. An enduring sense of nationhood developed during the liberation struggle a sense which has deepened during the cowardly Ethiopian attacks of the last few months. Pateman has helped me understand why the Eritreans have survived and why thay may become very important actors in Africa in the next century."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pro-Eritrean Propaganda","review":"Pateman says in his intro that Eritreans almost universally like his book, and it's easy to see why. This is a highly uncritical, almost cartoonish look at the Ethiopian-Eritrean conflict, in which the Eritreans are always brave and enlightened, the Ethiopians cowardly and villainous. Eritrea is \\"an oasis of peace and energy... a place of hope for all fair-minded men and women.\\" Why, it's practically the Switzerland of east Africa. It's particularly irritating that Pateman chides Western academics for uncritically supporting Ethiopia throughout the conflict, then describes Eritrea in the same propagandistic terms. Pateman is clearly too close to his subject to evaluate it objectively.

There is little motivation of the concepts-- and the motivation given is usually very vague. Some definitions of concepts are repeated many times over, while others are only informally described in passing (and these are usually the most important concepts, e.g. \\"conjugacy class\\" in the chapters on group theory.)In short, this book is terrible.

Of course, examples are very important. However, the explanations are often muddled and not clear (e.g. see tensor products). They frequently relegate important theorems or definitions to the exercises, and the organization is poor. Consequently, it can be very hard to find things later when you might need them.

I never thought a book about paratroopers could be so evocative and romantic--I knew it might be funny. This book just sucked me right in, I couldn't bear to finish it. It offers a reader like me (female) a rare opportunity to feel what it feels like to be a lost young man (you think this happens all the time in books, but it doesn't). The characters are vivid, the settings brilliant (a passage about jumping while high on mescaline no more so than one about sitting on a barstool watching Saturday night take place) and the whole thing is suffused with the mystery and hopefulness that make life so hard to get on the right side of when you're twenty--no matter what sex you are."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Novel !","review":"This book tell's a story of young men away from homefor the first time , coming of age in a peace timemilitary.

The only one draw back is...it'll take almost 10-12 hrs to charge a fully drained battery. I don't worry about this. I'm using this for my Electronic Toothbrush. Before this I was using some branded cells, where and which I used to charge them once in every 7 days. But now, with this Battery I'm charging once in every 20-22 days, i.e., the life of this battery is almost 3 times than the 'Branded' ones. I'm also using for my Camera (35mm), and for Radio, and haven't faced any problems with this.

Since my digital camera only use AAs this little charger is adequate. After using it for about a month I very satisfied with it's performance and ease of use.This product is rugged(kid tested), inexpensive and very functional as it allows you to charge both NiCd and NiMH. The batteries that come with it are NiMH so they do not have the \\"memory\\" problems of the NiCd. The only flaw I could find is that the instructions said that the light would turn green when the batteries were fully charged. In fact the light just went out. Otherwise it is a good solid product with a great price."},{"rating":"1","title":"The charger is not bad, the battery is really poor...","review":"The charger is not bad although charging time is very long. Well, the price is low and it is said that slow charge is better for the battery. But the battery is really poor... From the words on the battery, I guess it is 1700mah, however, someone told me that it is 1600 mah. I compared the battery with the panasonic 1600mah ni-MH battery I got...panasonic worked 5 hours and 45 minutes, while Millenium worked only 4 hours and 30 minutes. Poor battery!

Get rid of Paul Tompkins. He is not funny and basically ruins the whole program whenever he opens his mouth trying to be funny. Note to Paul, you ARE NOT FUNNY! You are the only one who is laughing at your little jokes. Do the world a favor and OD or something and take yourself out of the human race.Now about the episode. It basically only follows Matt Smith, Karen Gillan, Rory and Alex Kingston. Those are the only companions it talks about.

The only good song on the album is Nothing, and it is horrible compared to any of their old stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened???","review":"I can't believe that I actually spent money on this before listening to it. If I had, I'd be $8 richer and believe me, I wouldn't mind, money's so tight right now! This is by far, one of the worst cds I've bought this year-its' actually painful to my ears. The lyrics suck and the music, well, I wish I could say something positive. I guess the only thing going for this cd is the first 2 tracks, but you can find \\"Friends & Executioners\\" on Wired Injections (Cleopatra Records) and that cd is a much better investment than this, dare I say, album.

The author cleverly guides her reader on a Mexican adventure through the eyes of a young girl as she discovers the truth about her amulet and the trials and tribulations of living in a mobile family. The story brought back a few memories for me of the feelings associated with moving to different schools. I recommend this book for anyone who loves a good mystery or wants to know what it's like to move many times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Several things wrong","review":"1) Stiff, clicky, small, inset buttons. Nothing like a PS2/PSX pad's nice buttons.2) Badly placed throttle. The shoulder buttons (which are the clickiest of them all) are big, but if you're like me your pointer fingers tend to travel up while using the shoulder buttons. And that makes for a badly placed throttle above the right shoulder button.3) Sticks will eventually break off. I got a free replacement LWMRP, but I'm afraid to use it because I know that one will break as well. I suggested to them that they use sturdy metal sticks if they're going to insist on the skinny necks of the sticks, but they haven't modified it yet.4) Stiff D-Pad/POV pad. And it's hard to navigate with it as well since you can't feel the direction without looking down to see if you're pressing it right.5) Inset Mode and Rumble buttons hard to press in sometimes.Two great things? The handles and rumble feature. Very comfortable grips and very solid rumble features."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Layout - Shoddy Quality","review":"I got two of these as gift. One controller went bad, and then the other. The problem is that the 6 buttons on the right spring back up after pushing them down partially because they are attached to some medicore plastic chassis inside the controller. Anyone who pushes these buttons repeatedly(I do this for speed bursts and checks in EA NHL games) will ultimately break the button away from the plastic. As a result, the buttons will start to stick. To put it another way, you push down, but the button doesn't come back up. I took one apart and cleaned the buttons out a little, and seems to be functional again, but the responsiveness of the buttons is not what it used to be and it's only a matter of time before the buttons go bad again. And another thing, there's too much space between the buttons and the controller, and it allows grit to get into the controller and affects the buttons, too. I'm probably going to get a gravis next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very unimpressive controller","review":"Overall, I rate the Logitech Wingman Rumble Pad as a very poor controller. My largest complaint is that the buttons are stiff, with very poor feel. Also, the analog joystick doesn't seem to go naturally in the direction you are attempting to go, which is very aggravating. The controller has a nice, solid feel to it, but overall it is very disappointing to use."},{"rating":"1","title":"calibration problems","review":"As one of the other reviewers mentioned, there seems to be a calibration problem with the left joystick, at least in the batch that Amazon is selling (and Logitech doesn't make this model anymore, so you can't get a fresh one). I've tried two of them and in both cases, the left joystick won't stay centered."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enter the Thumb-killer Extreme","review":"This control pad has tiny widdle buttons that are for tiny widdle fingers. If you have large hands, don't buy this junk, go for the cordless version. The buttons wear out fast. My buton 1 is already starting to make snapping sounds. It is for kids, not adults or teens. The unit itself is big, but the buttons are tiny. I now have carpel tunnel of the right thumb(aka stiffness and soreness) because of this stinker. I played Big Mutha Truckers and blew the horn, brakes, and gearshift toggle enough to break the buttons and my thumb. I will probably go for Belkin's controller instead now.(of course six months rest is in order 1st + a Dr. visit.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent, but wouldn't recommend it","review":"My beef with this controller is that the calibration is continuously getting out of whack on the left joystick. The company has no fix for it, and it is not game specific. This can be temporarily fixed by resetting the calibration, but it's still a pain in the rear end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had two RumblePads, neither of them worked.","review":"This is a problem with Logitech controllers that I've seen posted on other web sites. I'm running Windows 2000. My trouble was the same on both of the RumblePad controllers that I owned (I exchanged the first one for another one): the analog controls (dual sticks and throttle) worked fine, while the digital controls (directional pad and buttons) all registered only after being depressed for about half a second. Obviously, this is entirely unacceptable, and although I quite like my Logitech cordless mouse, I won't be buying any more of their game controllers.I'll stick with my Gravis Pad. It works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not So Flying","review":"I believe this is not as good as compared to the Sidewinder that Microsoft makes. It is a very clumsy controller.

To start with, 2 out of the 7 push buttons have intermittent faults while pressing down continuously. The 8 way directional hat, has a hard time detecting presses to the right. The left Joystick looses it's calibration after about twenty to forty five minutes of game play. After that, it simply will not go to the right. Since it was decided that this stick was above mere calibration, none was included. The only way to resolve the problem is to reboot the computer when this happens. A real mood killer while playing any game. I'm a avid gamer and have other game pads, wheels and sticks, so no it's not the computer or USB port. They all work fine, I just thought this one would be better. Next time I'll think a little harder if it say's Logitech on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad quality.","review":"This gamepad, like other Logitech gamepads, have horrible problems. The analog stick is incredibly inaccurate and never calibrates correctly. I'm a game programmer, and I needed some game pads a while back for a game I made. I purchased 5 Logitech pads at one time. Every single one has given me hardware problems, either with the z slider breaking off, the controller losing connection when the wire is held at certain angles, the analog stick plastic piece falling off, the D pad not sending the correct directions, or the analog stick not calibrating correctly.In short, stay away from Logitech gamepads. They're of horrible quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY!!!","review":"Don't buy this book. It is so out of date. If you intend on passing the exam, you need more recent study materials. One of the reviewers complained about the price for Wiley, but if you remember how much textbooks cost in college, then you will think that maybe the Wiley books aren't that expensive anymore.

It's one of the most poorly written book i've ever read. The author likes to use long winded sentenses to explain simple concepts and he does a piss poor job at it. In addition, this book lack quality example problems to help you learn the concepts. When there are examples, they are deeply burried in text rather than clearly shown in a designated area. Imagine an algebra or calculus book with examples explained in text rather than numbers. (.i.e two plus two equals four ... as opposed to 2+2=4) This is how bad this book is. This book is not worth the money. The only way that it's worth the price I paid is if I get a chance to throw it that the author.If anyone out there know of a well written risk management book, please let me know. I'd greatly appreciate it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Borderline waste of time","review":"This book was assigned reading for an MBA course I took in risk management. It is horrible. As mentioned in an earlier review, the author explains the fundamental equations and ensuing examples all in words, almost as if it were meant to be an audio book. I have a PhD in one of the physical sciences and usually tear through and get a lot out of finance books. Not this one.The table of contents makes this text look wonderful. In reality, this book is sad - although every chapter is about something important, it wastes 50 pages to ramble about something that could be covered succintly in half that. The organization of relevant maths is also extremely disappointing. I suspect one of the glowing reviews was by someone who hasn't actually read it - it sounds more like publisher's marketing.I expected far more."},{"rating":"1","title":"the worst","review":"The book has almost no straight forward examples.

I certainly don't recommend this book for someone new to this field"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yikes","review":"Yikes. With a few exceptions -- Blanca and Ariellah come first to mind -- this DVD is neither truly Gothic nor is it specifically Bellydance. It is kind of a cheesy 80's rock video homage (if it's intended to be tongue in cheek I have totally missed the boat here), in an overblown Alice Cooper style rather than anything that calls to mind the Victorian romance that is supposed to underlie Goth culture. Additionally, some of the pieces I would not even put in the genre of Bellydance, they belong in the softcore porn aisle. Can we please move on from this kind of thing? Gothic bellydance has so much more potential than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring with some exceptions...","review":"I'm not a professional belly dancer and my judgements are mostly based on \\"I like it / I don't like it\\" impression. Although content of this DVD was quite disappointing as a whole there still were few tracks worth watching.Ariellah is stunning with her every move so refined and perfectionned. Her Siren is my absolutely favorite track - a gorgeous example of American Tribal style. Asharah is also OK but not as controlled and her moves seem to be not sharp enough. Neon's dances are beautiful. A friend of mine also liked Jeniviva's second performance. The rest was simply boring. Jehan's video was disturbing if not even disgusting. Brrr.Bottomline: with the exception of two or three tracks this DVD is not worth wasting your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly, not what I expected...","review":"Maybe my expectations were too high for this DVD. I was so excited when it came in the mail, but very dissappointed after I watched it. With the exception of Ariellah, Asharah, and Jeniviva, it was a big let down. Quite a few of the numbers were barely classifiable as bellydance, and one number in patricular bothered me because all the 'dancer' did was roll around on the ground. I'm all about fusion in bellydance, but when there is no recongnizable bellydancing in a number, it shouldn't be on a bellydancing video. The concept of combining bellydance with gothic subculture is an ideal fit, both of which I adore, but this video was mostly a poor representation in my opinion. I wouldn't reccomend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gothic? Yes. Bellydance? Heck, no.","review":"If you must buy this DVD, do it for its Goth, not its dancing. With only one or two exceptions, the dancers featured are only at an elementary skill level and seem to think writhing around with yards of gauzy fabric is interesting. Give me a week and a sewing machine and I could accurately replicate most of these routines, but with more class. They try so hard to impress you, but most end up just being funny. This DVD also lacks a clear-cut scene selection menu, so it's difficult to tell which dancers are which. The one dancer I do know, Jeneviva, who looks so pretty in her pictures, just reminds me of a spoiled club kid circa 1986 when she starts her jerky, self-centered dancing. Take it from someone who wasted her money: this DVD isn't worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ghastly Gothic!!","review":"Ghastly gothic and I don't mean that in a horrific, slasher-type murderous way!!! This is just plain AWFUL--can't try to \\"try out\\" or \\"take on\\" goth--it's innate! Goth is much more than donning black clothing, kohl makeup and APPEARING eerie! Now onto the bellydance review. I do not dispute that all the featured bellydancers are skilled and talented, but (outside of Ariellah--who is an interwoven gothic energy) should continue to master and mix their true passion and stay within these realms as opposed to trying to be gothic. Graphics--oh--the graphics?? The graphics were just as horrible. I was expecting the bellydancer to be on stage with props as opposed to some ill-laden graphics as an after effect. This production did not hold my interest and I am actually typing this review while the DVD is playing. I would NOT recommend this DVD. It was much more entertaining to watch the 4 minute 55 second clip of Espana Gothla 2010 than 85 minutes of......"},{"rating":"1","title":"icky bad","review":"Probably one of the worst DVD's IMHO... I love Ariellah and Tempest but this DVD is NOT a good example of what great dancers they are. I thought it was overall cheesy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bellydance???!!!","review":"I bought this DVD out of curiosity. Boy was I surprised that so much of it did not seem to be bellydance at all. Jahad's video (yes most of these were videos...not routines)was only there to push her singing career...it was just her doing lip sync and spreading her legs while a couple of chicks were making out. Let's see...any of us could do that! I thought Neon's performances were lacking but interesting enough to watch once. There were a few girls that were truly horrendous! There was one dancer that shone...I think it was Ariellah. On her first dance she did a robot type bellydance moves within the routine. It was so cool looking! To me she is what gothic bellydancing should be. She alone was worth getting the DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too little bellydance; not really Gothic","review":"Like many people have noted, Ariellah and Asharah did a phenomenal job overall. Unfortunately for them though, the other performers make it impossible to recommend this DVD. It's hard to find bellydance moves, and in some instances ANY dance moves in... whatever they are trying to do. In those rare cases that they do bellydance, it comes out rather mediocre.It's also unclear why this is claimed to be Gothic. The duets by Raven and Ya Meena may be considered to be in medieval style, if you keep in mind that not all the dances were sophisticated and romantic even at that time. Other than that, the performers could only rely on costuming and music to convey the vintage atmosphere. What's more, they don't even manage to stick to the good music and costumes, and for some bizarre reason include numbers that are nothing more than average MTV-like videos."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a waste","review":"I'm no goth; however, I am a very experienced belly dancer. I was under the impression that this was a darker, sexy approach to belly dance. I wish I had read reviews and spent more time researching this product because as I watch it now, I discovered that it's a cheesy celebration of the gothic pop culture insulting the art of belly dance. The effects were cheesy and the choreography took no thought nor talent; total waste of my time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"horible and almost comical","review":"Maybe I was expecting too much, as a huge fan of belly dance and tribal belly dance. This video was awful with only one or two high points that were eclipsed by the overall cheesey Alice Cooper look of most of the performances."},{"rating":"2","title":"A new dimension of bellydance - mystery & intrigue","review":"I was interested in the DVD because I'm a bellydancer. My main style is \\"Egyptian cabaret\\" but I have an appreciation and interest in ALL types of bellydancing. I enjoyed this DVD. The imagery, costumes, and the dancing were, to me, interesting and different. I was feeling the whole \\"welcome to our dark realm\\" vibe. I would have given it five stars except for that S&M piece. Believe me, I am no prude. However, as a bellydancer, I am constantly working on educating the public that this dance is a respectful art form, appropriate as family style entertainment. Respectful bellydancers can perform their art at summer festivals and parades, not dark smokey rooms with a stage with a pole in the middle of it. Shame on whoever thought the S&M piece was a great idea! Other than that, I really, really liked it. Too bad I couldn't give it five stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"for bellydancers with an open mind to creativity","review":"I could not wait to get this dvd. I am a big fan of Jehan's. She is an amazing dancer and singer. So when I saw this coming out,I put in my order and waited. I even held a get together for a few friends to watch it. When we watched it, there were alot of different views on each artist. But the point of this dvd is to be able to see creative dancers. If you get tired of seeing the same old thing, then this is for you. Although, it was a different performance from Jehan. I always admire her for pushing the envelope on her artistic freedom. I love all kinds of Belly dance, but it is great to see something different. So open your mind and ENJOY!! this is a great dvd..."},{"rating":"1","title":"More like snippits from 80's rock videos than bellydance","review":"Good try but this entire video is less bellydance and more like open stage at a local goth club.

What's Middle Eastern about any of these dances? It's so fusion, it's not belly dance anymore! A couple of these dancers are very good, but not at their best in this video.

An unfortunate production."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most of them are NOT dancers","review":"I don't mind experimental dance.

Their performances are exquisite examples of fascinating Tribal style.In striking contrast to them, the rest of the contents of this DVD are not much different from what you can see on TV music channels every day. I don't know what kind of style they were trying to represent or create, but they ended up looking just pathetic. Jeniviva and Neon know how to bellydance, but don't always want to. Some others don't really know how to dance. And still others don't even try."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gothic Flop","review":"I am very disappointed in this video. With the exception of Asharah and Ariella's stunning performances on this DVD, most of the rest should not even be able to call themselves belly dancers. Even stretching it and saying they were performing FUSION does not help. As a belly dancer myself, I was shocked at the lack of belly dance core elements and movements incorperated into most of the dancers performances.I saw alot of twirling, spinning, squirming and head thrashing and even some ballet moves, but very little isolations and actual bellydance combinations. Some of the costuming was interesting and I liked the backdrops, but overall this DVD is a HUGE FLOP."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some Really Bizzare Stuff - Some Good, Though Most Not","review":"If you've heard others in our dance community currently debating the many alternative interpretations of \\"bellydance\\" and want a taste of \\"what all the fuss is about\\" then buy this DVD. There are a few interesting perfomances by some talented dancers/artists that are worth watching. On the other hand there are some totally forgettable performances on this DVD and some with the entertainment value equivalent to driving by a bad a car wreck, a horrible sight but you can't help but look, from the totally absurd(S&M/bondage/dominatrix piece) to the down right stupid(worm-woman thing). Don't buy this expecting ATS/FatChanceBellydance style dance cause it's not on here. I'd call this stuff \\"experimental\\" bellydance."},{"rating":"2","title":"gothic bellydance dvd","review":"all i can say is this, they were on the right path... i noticed few of the dancers were actually \\"goth\\" in their normal everyday lives. I know what they were trying to achive and i have to give neon and company credit for putting something out there to put my beloved dance form on the map. i did have some problems.... i didnt like the music video aspects... they were nice and would have been a nice extra for the dvd but to put them as actual performances i didnt agree with that. i did like the camera work.. it was awesome!!! nicely shot and crisp and clean... the floating images were getting tiersome... i wasnt too fond of those... all in all not a bad first attempt! i know some better dancers out there than the ones featured on this DVD. Ariellah is AMAZING! i love ashara, and jeniviva... the rest were ok but i think it was because they didnt strike me as really \\"feeling\\" the gothic vibe.. just my 2 cents"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"Ahhh, I was so disappointed when I watched this DVD! The idea was good and I was looking forward to seeing it. However, making the idea a reality was not successful, and, in my opinion, lacked professionalism. Having said that, I should note that Ariella's performance is beautiful. She is a great dancer, despite the overall unclear and confusing atmosphere of this DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"its Gothic... but hardly BellyDancing -- false advertisment","review":"I'm a fan of BellyDancing, and I know many Bellydancers and one of them is actually in this DVD. But here is the problem. I think they should have called it 'Gothic Interpiative Dancing\\" or \\"Gothic Fusion-Dancing\\" ..Litterally only 2 out of all the dancers on this DVD actually BellyDanced..all the others were not. I was very disapionted, because I was expecting Bellydancing, not a half hour of a woman trapped in human sized peice of cloth trying to get out 'Cacoon / transformation' that is not Bellydancing, that is interpative dancing..completely different.Also, there is a very sleezy S&M; music video that has NOTHING to do with BellyDancing what so ever...what's up with that?I suggest find a friend who has it & watch it just for kicks (and maybe laughs), but don't waist your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gothic Bellydance - Darker Side of Fusion","review":"Darker Side of Fusion was again, like I said for Revelations, not bad but not great. There were some dances that were entertaining, and the dancers did well, but the feel of the Dvd was lacking somehow. It just didn't give off that Gothic feel and some of the music didn't flow with the scenes. I'd say, if you could, rent this instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"bummed about this DVD","review":"I am bummed, and honestly offended at this video. I am no prude. But the knife scene....ugh... What's next actual animal or human sacrifces??I really like Jehan, and her other 2 DVD's, The Temple of Jehan, and Sacred Bellydance, but this was too much. The Lesbian S& M scene? Porno or Bellydance.....mmmmm, gonna go with Porno. Hey if that's what you're into, it's your business, but I'm bummed this is listed under Bellydance DVD.....It is misleading. I also love Neon's stuff usually, so i was just surprised all around. yikes! Ladies, i love you all, but what were you thinking??The blood on the lip scene, eeewww, gross.I have been dancing 9 years, and I have never danced with blood on my lip.I am hoping for another Jehan video though....just not one like this!...Agree with the other reviewer, do NOT watch with your kids around!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"HATED this one...","review":"This dvd has been watched once, and I am literally trying to GIVE it away it's so bad.Neon isn't normally a tribal or gothic dancer-she is really out of her element on this one. Jehan doesn't dance in this, but does a big S&M; sideshow where she is using whips, chains, exposing her buttocks, and having lesbian scenes with another woman. How is this belly dancing?????The dance with the daggars/knives was silly...all in all I hated this dvd. I have no problem with fusion, gothic, or anything like that-but you can't put black lipstick on anyone and market it as goth. Also, just because something is goth in style, doesn't mean that it is okay for the dance routines to be subpar. The choreographies were uninteresting, and the Jehan S&M; piece was absurd. (Don't view this dvd with your children around.)VERY disappointed..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointment","review":"I was so excited to get this dvd. What a let down. The dancing, for the most part, was just not up to par. The S&M bit involved very little dance, mostly just wondering around the \\"dungeon\\" caressing various items, WHATEVER! My 2 stars go to some of the interesting costuming and concepts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gothic Bellydance lacks appeal","review":"This performance DVD left a lot to be desired for me. Most of the performances were poorly choreographed and displayed little actual bellydancing. They were more like odd dream sequences which consisted primarily of individuals writhing around in place. It seems that more attention was paid to the sets, props and effects than to the choreography itself. The only saving grace was that there were a couple of actual *good* performances. Dancers who were truly talented and had decent choreography. I wish they had listed which dancers did which performances so I would know which dancers to follow and which to avoid in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"So disappointed","review":"I've seen Neon before, and I know she can be an amazing dancer, but this time I wasn't very impressed with her music videos. I've seen Tanna before as well, and she hasn't improved, still very weak. There were other weak dancers. Also there were other music videos, but unlike Neon, they didnt dance at all. Jeneviva is a fine dancer, but uninteresting. The only good numbers were by Tribal dancers, Asharha and Ariella. So overall I was extremely disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"No coments","review":"The author is very rude in the way he express about the people from Europe, He talk about irrelevant things like \\"in Europe you can't find Cherry Twislers, but you can find Kit Kat, M&M;'s etc\\" I think you don't need this info to ride across Europe.He critices almos every thing, the places, the way other cyclist wearing their clothes, but he still loved the trip he made ??¿¿¿The routes are good for my point of view but some comenments are out of the context.Also he repeat very often, \\"you only need THIS book for your trip don't buy an other one\\" ???¿¿¿¿¿"},{"rating":"1","title":"Humor?","review":"Well the humuor is American humor, very \\"dry\\", and poor humor.Cycle paths are like this:When you reach the a white house, turn right;Follow the signs to XYXYXYXY; then turn left.Etc...Ridicoulous.No maps.If you want real cycling tourism in europe, \\"Bikeline\\" from Esterbauer collections is the answer.

It was perfect--theroutes, suggestions, etc., etc. But what reallystruck me was the humorous voice that Soverinsky usesand the liberal amount of really hilarious stories.For instance, there's a photo of a bunch of people insleeping bags at a campground. And the caption reads:\\"If you ask me, nothing beats camping in Europe.Except, of course, a nice hotel room.\\" Really greatstuff.

Excellent. 5 stars. NOW, however, NEC has been out of this business for many years and no longer creates drivers for modern operating systems NOR do they sell ink cartridges for this model. I tried one third party ink cartridge replacement and it did not work. SO ALAS, I need to change 5 stars to one star. This is just not the right time to buy this printer unless you print only occasionally and don't plan to upgrade your operating system. Sigh. Nice product!ORIGINAL REVIEW 5 STAR: Works great, high quality output: Well, for a basic laser printer, this is a really nice piece. Quiet, reliable, very professional business-quality print. I wish it offered double sided printing and did copying, etc, but that cost a lot more in laser printer. You can get it for not a lot of money in ink-jet, and I'll probably buy that as a draft printer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredibly Great Printer!","review":"After reading several reviews of the NEC 1400, I decided toshop around for the best buy.

After three hours waiting and talking with tech support at NEC, my computer manufacturer, and again at NEC, I learned that NEC does not have a driver to make the printer work with Microsoft Windows Millennium.NEC and Amazon.com should disclose that NEC SS 1400 PRINTER WILL NOT OPERATE WITH COMPUTERS THAT USE THE WINDOWS MILLENNIUM OPERATING SYSTEM.

It allows a very limited range of resolution, 1152 x 864 to 1280 x 1024 only. This is a factor for my tired old eyes. Anything less, 800 x 600 or 1024 x 768 only brings up a built in error message / screen saver. A call to tech support yielded no help at all, I think it was 'out sourced' in as much as it was very difficult to make the technician understand what I was calling about. The adjustments buttons are learned only by trial an error and will give mixed results, the vertical lines that cause text to appear in and out of focus could never be totally eliminated. Between poor performance, lack of documentation, and questionable support I would rate this monitor only fair to poor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor image","review":"I bought this product 2 days ago from Circuit City.

When I lowered the screen resolution with 70 hertz (with 60hertz, you can see lines running across), everything got bigger but it wasnt the way i wanted. Then I lowered the screen resolution to the lowest, it was way too big.So overall i would say this is a poor product.

These same men were American heros too, and this celebration of disrespect towards them is a but boorish.

Even though the reader was warned in advance that it was told in McNiece's own words, complete with misspellings and grammatical errors, it was still read like a 6th grade essay. Too much time was spent on McNiece's near brushes with military authority, his indifference to the military structure, and his various antics (i.e. stealing a train).

It is relevent to both northern and southern hemispheres as it has a season converter and is in metric and imperial.The photos are sharp and clear and cover everything from petal shapes to full heads.This is a great general reference book."},{"rating":"2","title":"I grew my nicest dahlias by following advice from this book!","review":"This book taught me everything I needed to know to battle bugs and fight fungus. I couldn't put them in the ground due to ground squirrels in southern CA that love to eat bulbs. I grow all mine in clay pots and now they're much healthier and beautiful. I'm always taking pictures of them! This is a great book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good stuff.","review":"Sonically this is a cross between How Hollow Heart and Shap. That is to say, the ambience is sort of bizarre and abrasive, but the tracks are long and there is an engrossing epic quality to the album as a whole. A good disc to pick up if you're interested in ambience that's a little more complex and inventive than your typical droney synth fare."},{"rating":"2","title":"Polish Pottery","review":"My daughter-in-law loved this and has already used it a few times. It arrived on time as promised and I love Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst DVD image quality ever!!","review":"I can't imagine what DVDs the previous reviewers were looking at. Sadly this is an instance where I made a purchase based on the comments of others. I own hundreds of DVDs and there is nothing I have that comes close to the abysmal quality of this disk. It looks like a fifth or sixth generation transfer from a VHS, like looking at a movie through a fish bowl. I am a huge admirer of director Jacques Tourneur and hope I'll be able to see this film someday."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you love cheesey sword and sandals...","review":"I'm a huge fan of those fine line films that straddle between fun and bad. Gods of War manages to hit just the right note. Don't expect stellar acting, sets or dubbing, but for a sward and sandal romp this two-disc set fills the bill."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Gods Of War","review":"Before Sylvester Stallone, There was Steve Reeves, and any film that he was involved in: strangely used to work. A lot of these films were tongue in cheek but there is still something magical about The Giant Of Marathon, and the story of the Trojan migration to found Rome. A lot of these films are completely innocent in their story line and their over dubbing, but they still bring a warmth of nostalgia whenever I view them.If you are of a particular age, then all I can say to you is \\"purchase and enjoy.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excelent Book","review":"I've got this book from a friend of mine.Actually I was looking for CMOS reference/introductory levelbook. I found everything I needed and more, from the fundamentals thru Digital design and Analog design.It has good explanations and SPICE examples to helpunderstanding and a lot of excercises. The book includesweb addresses where free software - used in the book - can be downloaded from.Highly recommnended and definitely a \\"must have\\" in your library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good reference book on CMOS circuit design","review":"This book presents a good overview of CMOS circuits from fundamentals to current design techniques. This book is perfect for a senior-level or graduate-level course as well as for the practicing engineer who wants to come up-to-date quickly with current CMOS circuit design techniques. Some areas where the book could be improved include layout issues, but this does not diminish in any way its usefulness."},{"rating":"1","title":"below expectation","review":"the book contains good overall material , but the design part is totally confusing, the analog design is worst material i have ever studied. the chapters are in hapazard manner, the equations for the circuits appear from nowhere sometimes. this book is good for only a overall view. DO NOT USE THIS BOOK FOR ANY DESIGN REFERENCE . for analog design and CMOS fundamentals use Razavi , which is the best book ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Organizer flys!!","review":"Having used Organizer since 95 I consider myself hooked. I keep everything and my file is 50MB but opens in a couple of seconds. Outlook doesn't come close and only people who know Organizer can see why I consider Outlook primative. I have a Nokia 6600 and it syncs my various Contacts (both personal and business), my Diary, Planner and To-Do list. A bit of a shame Nokia doesnt deliver the same interface. Users will be aware of the benefits of links to both Organizer contacts/notes/appointments but also external files. Great to keep all your research data in a structured note with links. Easyclip makes fast work of the double handling issues with Corporate Outlook email. The import facility works well with lists (I arrange in excel and export to CSV).I keep looking for the next update of the program but top of my wish list would be - dont stuff up an excellent product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better Buy Bacon (Mavis), Too","review":"Organizer lies. It will not transfer DayTimer data.What's more, the third party CSR phone number(listed in the software itself) will know not that Lotus claims their support.And what's even more, Lotus' own CSR will be unapologetic and baffled that you do not wish to re-key several hundred names to enjoy the dubious benefits of their wonderful product.So buyer be very ware. This software will likely demand that you re-type all your data. And your calls to Lotus will contact you with unsympathic imbeciles.That's because they were hired by even more callous cutthroats, whose business plan is to sell you expensive software with nary a thought of offering you help should you require it.So if you think you may ever, ever need support, stay with DayTimer. With Lotus, as with MicroSoft, hey, you're out there alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Serious Security Flaw","review":"It is easy to overwrite a password protected file with another file of the same name. All you need to do is \\"Save As\\" under the name of the password protected file. It is easy to lose information either by accidently or through malicious activity. If security is a concern consider other programs on the market. I voiced my concerns on Lotus' website several weeks ago and no one has been able to find a solution to this problem. I wish Lotus would take a more proactive position to customer concerns.I am extremely disappointed in Lotus Organizer 6 lack of security. I am even more disappointed in how nonresponsive Lotus is to security concerns."},{"rating":"1","title":"most uncomfortable boot ever","review":"these are the most uncomfortable boots I have ever owned. the tongue is so wide it wraps around your ankle and digs into your ankle bone. no way to fold it to keep it away. but they should never wear out. after an hour a day for six months trying to break them in they are still stiff and hard to wear. I would not recomend these to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unadulterated Babble...","review":"I can't believe anyone would even consider buying this trash...UFOs, Satan, God, Angels. I think the author needs to take off the tin foil hat and get back on the lithium."},{"rating":"1","title":"Want to pay $10 for a religious pamphlet?","review":"I bought this because I am a UFO nut and paid about $10. and it turned out to be practically a religious pamphlet trying to steer you away from the UFO's to God & religion instead! I felt ripped off. It's not even a book. This could be something a guy dressed in robes at a Florida turnpike would hand to you and then ask you for a donation to help support the cost of the printing of it and then invite you to a vegitarian feast later..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Now I Understand","review":"I always thought science and the Bible were at odds with each other, but now I find out that they are in perfect agreement. What a wonder! The pyramids and Sphinx and how they were built still remain a mystery, but B. Fox has an explanation that makes sense, finally. I know a story about a man named Scallion who built huge monuments in stone all by himself, probably by the same method as the pyramids were built. The book is kept as simple as possible so everyone can understand from child to college level. What good is a book if only intellectuals can understand it? I can see where some people think God disappeared just because they replaced him with UFOs and space brothers. Those things have become as much an idol as any made of wood or stone. I recommend this book to anyone who has an open mind. Not everyone will accept the answers therein, but that's their responsiblity and their problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupidity in 66 pages","review":"If I were to use two words to describe this book, they would be \\"religious pamphlet.\\" This book is a waste of your money. In this book, B. Fox, writes that UFOs are a weapon of \\"Satan\\" and that these UFOs are trying to take over \\"God's\\" people. If you are a religious fanatic or a Christian fundamentalist, you will except this book without any thought. If you are a thinking person, this is nothing but stupidity in 66 pages. Look elsewhere for a decent UFO book, such as William Bramley's \\"The Gods of Eden.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Unadulterated Rubbish","review":"This is one of the most ridiculous books I have ever come across. It is academically inaccurate beyond belief, badly researched, and serves only two purposes: to provide a safe haven for insecure religious fanatics (in this case, Christians), and to keep Fox's bank account well and truly topped up with the money provided by the gullible people who buy this book.One example of Fox's intentionally misleading inaccuracies is her use of the word 'Satan'. She claims that Satan was the name of the so-called biblical fallen angel. In reality, however, it derives from the Hebrew word 'sAtAn' and simply means 'adversary'. It is not the name of any particular person or entity.I rest my case!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Bad","review":"I took the corresponding class with Ms. Collette. So I am of course speaking of the book/class combination. It was quite valuable. Rather than just writing 'bindly', we learned to consider the effects of turns of phrase, metaphors etc. on the reader. It made us more aware of the way we write."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't fire my remote flashes","review":"After mounting them on my flashes and plugging them in, I was not getting any flash. In trouble shooting the issue, I discovered no juice was getting to my flashes. I then purchased hotshoes from FlashZebra...p/n 0065. They worked perfectly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of pink, but poor message for kids","review":"My daughter loves pink so I thought this would be a nice book for her. Well, she loves the book but I cringe each time I read it as it basically encourages kids to whine and their parents will give in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy something different.","review":"I was excited to get this book after the Pricsilla and the Pink Planet and Fancy Nancy, etc. This book is really annoying. First the artwork - it uses a shade of pink so horrifying it's hard to read about 5 pages of the book. Second, the writer over uses the girls name Madison and a few other words - it's abnoxious. I understand what she was shooting for, but she really misses. The writing lacks maturity - there are so many better books out there, I recommend passing on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing Good Can Come of this Book","review":"I don't want to repeat other reviewers here who agree this book is not worthwhile because they've already summed up the important (negative) points about this book.The book might as well just be a list of things the girl asks for and then gets, no questions asked.I hid this book from my kids after we read it once."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good writing","review":"I'm a children's picture book writer and I have to say that this book was not well written. I agree with the other reviewer who said that the writing was immature and I felt like it didn't flow well either. I suppose the message here is that if you write a book with \\"pink\\" in the title, you can just about sell anything to little girls who love pink. I'm thinking of my next title right now..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great quality but not enough sizing info.","review":"I bought three of these jerseys and they're great, but they are a litle bit large in the waist part and that is something that I don't like, basically because i can't choose that in the size info. I'm 6.1\\" and I still feel that it's too large.But it's a nice product and the quality is great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unusual activities for nuns, a delight for children","review":"Although it is a very unusual story, this book will delight children. It involves a group of seven fun-loving nuns who ride an elephant out into the American west. On their trip, they meet a piano playing Eskimo, foil a gang of thieves, dance with the patrons of a saloon, ride a train, and encounter a tribe of Indians and dance around a totem pole. At the end, they are riding the elephant off the reservation and are pondering their next adventure.To adults who have been raised with the idea that nuns are a stern, conservative group this story seems absurd. However, to the child, their adventures will be interesting reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Math Class K-8","review":"My son really enjoyed this keyboard. We are still learning about the different functions of it, especially the part where it is suppose to help beginners learn to play the keyboard. This fuctions moves kind of fast for those who are completely illiterate about the keyboard. Overall, I give this product a 4 because of the different functions it is able to do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was NOT what I expected","review":"I was hoping for something to help my kids learn more math basics. It was not user friendly and it really wasn't games either. It was NOT at all what I was looking for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not compatable","review":"Be careful when ordering thesses types of items. The product is sold to replace camcorder batteries. I ordered it, even though it said it was good for my camcorder, it did not fit. Speak with customer service before purchasing this type of an item. Save time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Teacher friendly","review":"I will be using this cart to transport my teaching materials to and from school. It helps to keep me organized and saves on carrying heavy bags. I bought this particular cart because it will hold up to 50lbs. I recived it quickly and in good condition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grate sounding CD!","review":"This review is on the plane old ordinary Paranoid CD,not any fancy remixed, repackaged releases..No I have not heard the remixed CD versions of Paranoid,if they really sound that much better then that is grate.Thing is for the price this CD more then does the job!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not so great","review":"i liked their first one much better! now they made almost gospel! it cannot be right! you cannot play gospel metal! it doesn't exist!"},{"rating":"1","title":"GREAT ALBUM, CRAPPY EXTRA TRACKS","review":"ThE ALBUM ITSELF IS CLASSIC SABBATH, FIVE STARS FOR IT, BUT THE EXTRA SONGS REALLY SUCK , WAY BELOW THE RELEASED VERSIONS, SO KEEP YOUR CASTLE REMASTERS OR THE RECENT BLACK BOX. NOTHING NEW IN SOUND QUALITY and an extra price not worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"zepplin vs. ozzy and gang","review":"Warpigs, Iron Man, and Parinoid are all great songs, but everything else ...!! With Zepplin everything brings down the houses of the holy. Fool in The Rain, Stairway to Heaven, and The Rain Song, and other greats take the cake!!!!!!! Too bad Sabbath. :(J&B; rEVEIWS"},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"Will everyone stop acting like they started metal and that the're a bunch of geniuses. LED ZEPPELIN IS THE KING OF IT ALL. The only reason people act like Sabbath is so good is because they hear other people say so and hop on the bandwagon instead of judging for themselves. I'm not saying that they're the worst band in the world but can we please stop worshipping them. DAMN YOU MTV!!!As for the album, it's kinda decent but certainly not the work of geniuses."},{"rating":"1","title":"A tad evil...and scary!!","review":"The heavy riffs on this album are sludge-filled and dreary - and I guess that's how Black Sabbath wanted them, right? I'm perplexed by the lack of energy and innovation by this supposed historic band, on this their debut record.What's most strange, however, are the lyrics and demeanor of lead singer Ozzie Osbourne. What's his deal, anyway? I've come to know him as the fun-loving, very well-meaning dad on the hit t.v. show, \\"The Osbournes.\\" Yet, on this record, his vocal delivery and tone is angry, depressing, and just plain strange, so different from his normal cheery self. Perhaps he was having a bad week in England when this \\"monumental\\" hard rock dross was being created.If you want true satanistic metal, get \\"Unleash the Beast\\" by Dokken, a much more revolutionary band.Check ya' later!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"SEMI GOOD","review":"Before I go on i'll tell you im not a big fan of black sabbath.

Yes.Althought this album is over 30 years old, that doesn't mean its good does it? Led Zeppelin and Deep Purple are about the same age as Sabbath and they were just as bad.While the 60s did bring us all this \\"shock rock\\", atleast the classics have given us good artists from the disco era who are still remembered til today unlike those forgotten classic rock bands Led Zeppelin, Kiss, and The Doors.Plus, most classic metal sucked, with the exception of Rap-metal of the late 80s/early 90s.For good and truly inspritational metal, just listen to any of these modern MTV bands, because they are very groundbreaking."},{"rating":"2","title":"HEAVY METAL GODS","review":"I LUV THIS ALBUM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! THIS ALBUM HAS 3 REALLY REALLY REALLY FAMOUS HITS. War Pigs, Paranoid, and last but not least Iron man. People may not pay attention so i'll tell you THERE ARE OTHER GOOD SONGS ON THIS ALBUM OTHER THAN THE FAMOUS 3!!! There is Planet Caravan which is slow and beautiful, Electric Funeral which sounds like a head banging good time, Hand of doom which probably makes anybody with a syringe scared for his/her life, and Fairies wear boots a classic tale about taking a \\"little drink\\" and swearing that he saw fairies with dwarves. That silly ozzy. lol Anyway actually forget that their are 3 famous songs on this album. MAKE IT 4 FAMOUS SONGS BECAUSE FAIRIES WEAR BOOTS IS ONE OF THEM TOO. okay you've hear enough from me. just buy this album and don't be sorry. Actually if you could borrow it from a friend, listen to it, and if you like it than you should just buy the whole best of collection. but thats just me"},{"rating":"2","title":"Paranoid Deluxe Ed. yes & no","review":"Two channel content nicely done but surround version could have benefited from a good re-master or at least a digital clean-up (lots of hiss) maybe done on purpose to preserve the original 'feel' of the recording but to me it seems like they stopped short of what could have been 'the' definitive collector set...Still worth the money though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Cd","review":"The cd was very good provided I could listen to it. I had to return this item twice because of skips."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential Sabbath","review":"This is the penultimate Sabbath album. These are the songs that made the band famous. If you think songs like \\"Iron Man\\" and \\"War Pigs\\" are a bit overplayed, there are a few other gems here too. \\"Hand of Doom\\" is a track which shows Sabbath's heavy blues influence, while \\"Electric Funeral\\" is an oft forgotten classic.The instumentation here is excellent. I love Bill Ward's shuffling, understated style of drumming. It is a very welcome change from the heavy, elaborate style which dominated today in bands such as Metallica and Korn. Ozzy's vocals really shine throughout. Who would have thought an English guy could sing blues like this?If you want classic rock, this album is a must-have."},{"rating":"2","title":"SABBATH'S BREAKTHROUGH ALBUM!!","review":"Although Master of Reality enjoyed more commercial success, this is the album that first made Black Sabbath's ominous presence felt in the US, thanks largely to the Top 40 hit title track. Other tracks, like War Pigs, Iron Man, Fairies Wear Boots, and Planet Caravan (the band's first ballad), are also great examples of Sabbath's nearly three decade long reign as one of the greatest heavy metal bands of all time. --Brian J. Albert"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful, A must have!!!","review":"To hear the Music that started Heavy Metal is so psycho I feel weird writing about it. To hear Sabbath when they're not all drugged up is actually better show then when they're all hung over like on this album.

Not so great packaging No lyrics come on! priced 3x the warner bros. versions. I was really forced to buy this set because i have vol. 4 and all by Santuary - so the run of 8 albums match but have no idea if these re-masters are any better than Warner.

Oh my gawd...I can see why now rock fans don't like BSB...in order to be a rock fan one must not have a brain cell.

Lead Guitarrist Tony Iommi was made one of the best Guitarrists in the world with the song Iron Man. A definite must!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best early Sabbath album","review":"Paranoid is the 2nd Sabbath album, and it captures the band as youthful, relatively sober, and very talented. Ozzy's young voice is earnest, strong, and clear, unlike later albums. There are 4 metal classics on this album--War Pigs, Paranoid, Ironman, and Fairies Wear Boots, making it a must-have for all fans of metal. I think the only Sabbath album that's better may be Sabotage, but you never hear that album's songs on the radio. Paranoid was perhaps THE album that brought an end to idealistic 60's music and ushered in the age of dark, heavy rock that inspired thousands of rock groups for the next 30 years."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the greatest Rock albums of all time","review":"If you are into classic rock, then this is a must own. With Ozzy Osbourne, Black Sabath stirred the diversity of the 60's like so many groups did. I was suprised that many of my sons (16)friends are listening to it today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album","review":"Arguably the most well known sabbath album having 3 of their biggest hits Ironman, Warpigs, and Paranoid. Other intresing songs on the album are Planet caravan more well known by Pantera's version. And a very strong drum solo on rat salad. Also of intrest is the lyrical message in hand of doom."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great music, but NOT the beginning","review":"Great classic metal/hard rock album, and somehow Sabbath has convinced everyone they invented metal. They didn't. I was 17 years old when this album came out (I'm 52 now) and remember buying this album and loving it. But I was already listening to Blue Cheer (the band that REALLY started metal), Hendrix, Steppenwolf, Led Zeppelin, Mountain, Deep Purple, Ten Years After, Foghat, Jeff Beck Group, Crazy World of Arthur Brown (he started satanic music, not Sabbath), and Humble Pie (nobody was heavier than them!) So don't tell me Sabbath invented metal!! There were a lot of heavy AND satanic music around then -- don't believe everything you read. Plus, Iron Maiden just ripped off Uriah Heep who did it 10 years earlier. I got that off my chest -- but I still love \\"Paranoid\\" and early Sabbath -- classic metal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sabbath Essentials","review":"What to say about a record that most everyone knows? I'm sure it's the best-selling Sabbath record ever made and pretty much everyone I know has it - even if it's the only Sabbath album they own.First off, it's not their best work. Super classic \`War Pigs' is amazing, as is \`Paranoid', \`Planet Caravan' and \`Hand of Doom'. The rest of the songs work well except for \`Iron Man'. Sure the riff is the stuff of legends but I have always hated the song. It is just too goofy - and the story or lyrics are weak.The cover art is laughable - couldnt they have something better??Bottom line - you need to own this album. It will change your life for the better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Review of Paranoid Vinyl (Rhino edition)","review":"If you are looking to pick up Sabbath on vinyl do NOT buy the Rhino editions. Spend the few extra bucks and get the NEMS versions. Rhino did nothing but take the terrible original US pressings of the CD and put that on vinyl - complete with the inexplicable lift in volume about 2 minutes in to War Pigs. Stay as far away from all the Rhino editions as you can."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this!","review":"One of my favorite heavy metal albums. THE original metal band! Can't get enough of this album or Black Sabbath!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Two words, Iron Man-","review":"This is an absolute classic release. Heavy Metal was born with this album- way back in the late 60's and early 70's. Metal was NOT born in the 1990's, it was only rehashed by a plague of poseurs.Now, I have a question for the one star idiot. You said in another music review that you are open minded, yet you clearly contradict yourself in your review of this album. Because someone mentioned Black Sabbath and you had never heard of them, you go to Amazon and give them a bad review- without even listening to their music. You admit this, yet you call yourself open minded. How silly- you must be a 12 year old since you have never even heard of Black Sabbath.So, YOU must be the poseur. Oh, the irony is killing me."},{"rating":"2","title":"A vintage record from the original lineup","review":"It's a very confident band that greets us on this landmark album. By this time, Black Sabbath had well and truly decided that heavy metal, gloom and doom was the way to go! Even so, the listener can still hear vestiges of the band's blues roots on tracks such as 'Hand of Doom' and 'Fairies Wear Boots'.This album contains so many heavy-metal classics that almost every track is instantly recognisable to even the most clueless of rock listeners.From the opening crunch of 'War Pigs', to the last notes of 'Fairies Wear Boots', this album remains a testament to the godfathers of heavy metal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major disappointment - bad Quad transfer","review":"WARNING -The transfer of the quad mix was/ is just awful. As much as you want to hear this in surround it is painful. The mix is sad. I thought my surround speakers were blown.

But now at 50+ years old I'm learning to play guitar and this music is really fun and easy to play. These songs are easy for a beginner to play and people know them.

I know, I know this album is considered a mark in the hystory of metal, etc, etc. But I just can't prefer it to Sabbath's debut or MASTER OF REALITY. The production here sounds without life, I don't know, something is not right here, even containing the classics. Of all Sabbath stuff with Ozzy, this is the second I listen less ( after Technical Ecstasy)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Dinosaur Rock","review":"Hard to believe, but more people now know Ozzy Osbourne as a sitcom star than as the lead singer for Black Sabbath. Even harder to believe, it has now been 32 years since Oz and Sabbath released their best album, the lumbering \\"Paranoid.\\" The first half of the album features Sabbath at their best. The eight minute \\"War Pigs/Luke's Wall,\\" starts things off with a slow moving bang before giving way to the snappy classic \\"Paranoid,\\" the band's signature song. The accoustic \\"Planet Caravan\\" will never be mistaken for Led Zeppelin, but it leads into the ultimate dinosaur rock anthem \\"Iron Man.\\" Side two contains mostly lengthy jams with lyrics as ridiculous as titles like \\"Jack the Stripper\\" and \\"Rat Salad\\" would indicate.Overall, \\"Paranoid\\" is remarkable period piece awaiting discovery by a generation who only know Ozzy as a TV dad."},{"rating":"1","title":"One channel Paranoid","review":"Black Sabbaths Paranoid cd is a great old time heavy metal selection.

PARANOID is really a bad album! It is \\"sandwiched\\" between BLACK SABBATH and MASTER OF REALITY, both of them wiht MUCH BETTER PRODUCTION. THat's right! PARANOID's sound is obnoxious, boring, a real pain to listen. Only the famous tracks are killers, the rest is some of the worst Sabbath (with Ozzy) ever wrote, obvioulsy due to the sheer speed this album was written and recorded, soon after their homonimous great (thi is really a a great album!) debut.PARANOID has so much fame due to it's title track. Nothing more than that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty good record","review":"Not bad for the old sabbath.

All the metal bands that followed took some influences from Sabbath, and this album is no exception. Danzig, for example, does a cover of Hand of Doom. The songs themselves are great. The only drawback is that the CD is really short, barely 45 minutes I think. No, the songs aren't intense, but they are fun to listen to.

You can also include a few bonus tracks and extensive liner notes to further entice consumers. It's benefitial for you, because you can get people to buy a CD that they already own, and it's benefitial to music fans because they get much better sound quality and some extras.Please take a look at Columbia/Legacy's remasters of The Byrds' catalog to see how it should be done.

Not sure that it quite holds up after all these years, but it shows where AC/DC, Priest and others got their inspiration."},{"rating":"2","title":"Suprisingly imaginative even after 30 years","review":"This is a classic recording that was an influence on many Rock bands of the later 1970's and 1980's.

A must have to any R&R fan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is one of the GREATEST CDs ever!","review":"This is one of the best albums ever made. The music is instantly enjoyable and will stay with you forever. The writing is very provocative and lyrically intelligent.

For real.","review":"The whole point of 70s hard rock / metal was to revel in stupidity. So the lyrics ain't Dylan. That's OK. Iommi/Butler/Ward crank out major riffage. It's a textbook of riffs. In fact, Geezer is a hell of a bass player. Ozzy? Meh. I burst out laughing at his chant of 'electric funeral!\\" Is this intentionally funny?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Played at many a party in the 70's","review":"This album was played at almost all (of a certain kind of) parties when I was in high-school. The shear power is what is noteworthy on this album. Legend has it that it was made by a bunch of working class kids from Birmingham that didn't know any better. It isn't sophisticated, but is powerful, with a drummer that was rumored to strike through the skins of the drums he hit them so hard, and some great guitar solo's as well as the Oz himself. Included is the Heavy Metal song so good it even made it to AM pop radio when it came out, \\"Iron Man\\", but it is just one of a whole album full of great songs. If I was still of that age and culture, I would rate this a full five stars, but I am kind of old to listen to much BS these days.So here's the deal, if you want a great example of Hard Rock of the 70's this is a great place to look."},{"rating":"1","title":"Review of Paranoid (Limited Edition)","review":"Fans who are already familiar with Black Sabbath's work are probably wondering if it is worthwhile to shell out the extra money for the limited edition of this album. The limited edition is the same as the Castle Remasters, except an attempt is made to replicate look and feel of the original album. Unfortunately, that is all there is. There are no extra liner notes, lyrics, artwork, etc. which come with the circa '96 Castle remasters. Also, the packaging is not very sturdy and there is an annoying amount of adhesive on the flap of the plastic dust cover. If you are collector, you are not going to want to play this album often in light of the wear and tear that will inevitably come. This is truly for the diehard completist, but a casual fan should stick with the normal Castle import catalog."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD","review":"I bought this CD just to have it in my collection.

I think those two songs show the real talent of Black Sabbath. This is my least favorite of the first six Black Sabbath albums, simply because the songs are to radio friendly. If you wan't the best of Black Sabbath check out there debut or Sabbath Bloody Sabbath, those two records show there brilliance.

This is not one of them.Overall, the series tries too hard to evoke emotions out of viewers. I do not recommend the series if you're looking for a good love story.

I recommend to buy the 10 or 30 pack after trying it out.I love it because it doesn't feel sticky, and when you sweat it's not slippery. But if you prefer a sticky/tacky feel, good choices would be Tourna Tac or the Wilson Pro overgrip.The XL means wider and longer than the regular version.

She never felt her voice was special, and constantly downplayed her abilities. In the realm of the great jazz ladies, there was nobody who could touch her, nor will there ever be.

It has been previously stated (in the liner notes of another album) that when in the studio, Julie had to be tipsy or stoned to overcome her fear before the microphone. Listening to this album, it's like she's performing in a deserted club and singing just for you, the only patron!

What I hate the most is the tiny, hard-to-read captions about each picture. For Christ' sake, for all the blank space in the book, the editor could not choose a bigger and more readable font? I was expecting more detailed description about each hotel listed in the book.

There's also a strong sense of melancholy on tracks like \\"Come a Day\\" and \\"Gabrielle.\\" This album is certainly more acoustic than her work with Bang Bang or Air, but it showcases a different sensibility, one that isn't necessarily linked to electricity.

I'd definately recommend this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Dragonlance Book I've Read!","review":"As an avid Dragonlance fan, I was severely disappointed with this novel. It had absolutely no bearing on any of Tanis' further adventures and didn't even begin to answer Tanis' questions about his father. ( BTW, for an EXCELLENT view of that tale, read \\"The Inheritance.) Tanis had stated in the Chronicles that he'd been in lands not friendly to elves, but this was set in an Elven village; the Red Robed mage was part human, part elf, and the only acceptable mages to elves are White Robes; and to add insult to injury we get bogged down in a sappy love story and end up in the place of Death, where apparently silver dragons get to breathe fire instead of the breath weapon of cold that they're born with! Makes you wonder if the authors read the original works at all. I'd love to see a well-written book about what happened to Tanis in the five years prior to the Chronicles, but this wasn't it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been better","review":"As with quite a few of the Preludes and Meetings books, this seemed out of tune with the Chronicles view of Tanis. There is a certain way the Tanis talks and acts, but these authors couldn't quite seem to grasp it.The plot was slightly ridiculous. I find it difficult to believe Tanis would even consider starting on this adventure just to find news about his father.I don't usually object to a bit of love mixed into a story, but when it becomes the story to the exclusion of all else, I start to worry.The whole thing about Death was stupid. This, along with the rest of the happenings in the book, is never mentioned by Tanis in the Chronicles series. A lot of the Preludes are a bad conclusion to a good idea.In saying all this, I still enjoyed the first half of the book. The rest really set my teeth on edge."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate this BOOK","review":"Ok This book really really made me MAD. 10 pages before the end I realized what the whole plot was; and it left much to be desired. ....What was the whole purpose of Tanis going back in time?

Ohh, where to start? I am a fan of the DragonLance series, and found this book disappointing. Not because it was poorly written, which it wasn't, but because the plot of this book did not tie in well with the main plot of the entire series. It seems to me like the authors were more interested in expressing the characters' love for each other than adding to the world of Krynn. So, basically, it all boils down to wheather or not you're into all that mushy, goey love stuff. I think there are other books you should read first, but that's just me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why Are All These People Razzing On Such A Good Book?","review":"This book is by far the best book I have read next to Soulforge of course.

I find Tanis to be one of the great characters of Dragonlance. Next To Raistlin Of Course. This book is one of the greatest books of the Dragonlace series. So, if you want a very good book, read Tanis, The Shadow Years. I promise you it will not be a mistake. Read Soulforge too while you're at it, trust me again this book took me a day to read. It's 408 pages of nerve shaking excitement. Read Tanis, The Shadow Years, and if you don't like it, then write me a e-mail of complaint. Please send me feedback.. I WANT TO BE NOTICED!

Even Sturms untimely demise was within limits. The latest incarnation, considering how strong the group was, is just simply ludicrous. They have slain all that we have hoped for all these years as followers. A classic never dies it just keeps moving on and on and....

Unfortunately, the book delivers nothing: no memorable characters, no epic atmosphere, and a plot that is made all the worse by the fact that it has so much potential and they do nothing with it! I expected a lot more from the authors who had written such memorable short stories. Oh well, I guess that's what happens when you try and turn two classic trilogies into a huge, over-marketed series, thus losing everything that made them so good in the first place."},{"rating":"1","title":"What ?","review":"Tribute to who?

I only use the conductive gel when the pads are older, or when I am waiting on a new shipment of pre-gelled pads to come in, because I much prefer the pre-gelled pads over using the conductive gel.

There is no transition, no preparation for the abrupt reversal. Nobody can outdo Judy when she turns on the scorn and vituperation, and she just overdoes it to an irrevocable degree.Also the music doesn't amount to much.

The author jumps from one topic to another, from one stage of development to another, without tying the loose ends together to form a coherent thought. Basically, the book reads like somebody trying to get out all of his/her knowledge of children's language development with no concern for organization. The reader is left with the unsavory task of having to reorganize the text into something comprehensible, and this is a very difficult endeavor that takes too much time.

An example is on page 132, the last paragraph on the page: The author refers to the \\"Asian style\\" of communicating as \\"more reticent and respectful\\". He does not even provide data for these generalizations!

Zack's dad asks her what she wants for her birthday and Grandma Leah says in a baby voice that she wants a pony. Zack says that they can't fit a pony in the house.

Sometimes, maybe once or twice a week, the trackball just goes crazy and starts scrolling and clicking all over. This can be ... dangerous. I don't know if this is related to (1) or not.3. There is a lack of precision in movement of the ball for fine motion, and the ball doesn't always move smoothly but sticks sometimes. Previous trackballs I have owned have not had this problem.The size and shape are nice, but these problems make it a real pain. If I were to buy this again, I would definitely buy the corded version.

Either the battery wasn't good enough, or the sun coming through the window will mess with the signal. The thing will start sticking and the pointer won't move or something hindering the operation. I even had the receiver about two feet from my chair (cords on the floor) and still the same. I love the logitech corded mouse, but the cordless is not worth the heartache.

Classic Carpal Tunnel symptoms!- While the trackball is quick in movements, it is difficult to work with when you need to be very precise. So clicking on small buttons requires multiple attempts.- Click 'n drag / Drag 'n drop actions are quite tricky. Not as intuitive as with traditional mouse devices.- The device comes with a sensor that is huge. Almost the size of a mouse itself. As I said, I wanted to reduce the space required on my desk, and I ended up having gained very little!Pros:- It's a large device. Good for people with large hands.

My opinion is finger ones are a little easier to control, but thumb ones tend to be more comfortable in the hand. And I love not having the extra cord on my desk.If anyone has gotten annoyed at the pointer not tracking well during sudden movements, just download the most recent driver from the logitech website. The enclosed version can't handle sudden movements when the acceleration feature is used, causing the pointer to stutter. This is why it gets 4 stars instead of 5.

It is constantly getting tangled with the laptop power cord and the cat 5 cable.Since every ad hides the fact this product has a corded receiver like this - I'm not sure how you can shop for one that doesn't have a long cord and big receiver online.

I had thought the mouse was a bit large, but I thought the trade off was worthwhile. And the receiver looked tiny on the box. I imagined it would be similar to the usb sticks the other cordless mice have.But to my surprise the receiver is HUGE! It's half the size of the mouse itself and is arguably larger than most cordless mice by themselves.So I give it a 1/5 rating. Mostly for false advertisement. There isn't even a picture of the receiver on this page, and on the box it's about 3/4 of an inch long, not it's true 3X3 inches.

Great little product."},{"rating":"2","title":"good mouse easy to use","review":"I have trouble with my tendonitis elbow and shoulder so this mouse is excellent because I don't have to move my arm like with a regular mouse. I can put this cordless mouse in my lap, on the arm of the chair, or anywhere that is comfortable and only have to move my thumb to control the direction of the pointer. The only problem I have had is that sometimes the pointer doesn't show up on screen and moving the ball doesn't move the pointer so I have to turn the mouse upside down and tap it to get the mouse to work again. Not a big problem just inconvenient sometimes."},{"rating":"2","title":"cordless mouse","review":"Still have to have a wire coming out of the transmitter or what ever it is, but it is nice have a cordless trackball itself, I have used a corded one for many years and it is much easier to use than a standard mouse"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Trackball","review":"This is the second Logitech wireless trackball I have owned, and along with the three wired versions of the same thing, they all rate as top-notch items with me. The wireless versions are used with my laptop when I travel (I actually left one at a field office where I spend a lot of time, to save a few cubic inches of packing space, hence the second wireless trackball). The wired versions are in my office on other machines I use. Both of the wireless models are still on their first battery after more than a year of use. They are great. Unlike some of the reviewers, I don't see the corded \\"hub\\" included as a problem. I just don't take it with me. It stays in the office attached to my docking station. It isn't necessary, and is just a convenience if your USB plug is hard to reach (on my docking station, it is on the back against the wall. So don't worry about the hub, just carry the dongle by itself on trips. First-class product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Danny","review":"This is the second one I own.

No cord and no mouse pad. I don't like holding my arm in the position a traditional mouse requires.

I have used several other style trackballs over the years and this one feels best in my hand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best mouse I ever owned","review":"I bought one of these because I wanted a mouse that I didn't need to scoot around a mousepad. I bought it with my first computer 10 years ago, and the left click just gave out about a week ago. I have an avid gamer, and I was in the military when I bought this mouse, so it's seen hard times and it has worked like a champ all these years. If you like trackballs, I highly recommend getting this one. Yes, the receiver is of decent size, but I've never found it to interfere with portability. I've owned 3 laptops and have used this mouse on each one. I'm only replacing it now because I've worn left-click completely out. The receiver range is actually quite long, I've used the mouse from across a 25ft room before with no slowdown or loss of accuracy.10 years of hard use.

The batteries last a very, very long time, which is great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Get Corded Version","review":"I much prefer the corded version of this trackball. It is otherwise identical in use and you never have to worry about the battery going out when you most need it. Because a trackball mouse remains stationary during use, there is no real reason that a cordless version is better. For heavy graphic applications, i.e., those for which trackballs are ideally suited, batteries can wear out rather often and always when you are on a tight schedule."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very practical!","review":"I've been using it for 3 months now and can not be happier!

Using it with MS Office takes some minor skills, but you'll learn eventually. Ergonomic, fits ideally in your palm. You won't get tired. Highly recommend this product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cordless? I don't think so :-(","review":"I purchased this TrackMan with expectations of getting a small USB receiver and the TracMan without any wires. It turns out that the receiver has a cord as long as a typical mouse cord. That isn't what is advertised. I'm sure it is a good quality device if you can deal with the extra wired component. I was looking for wireless to use with my laptop. This is worse than buying a wired device if you are using it with a laptop. You still have the fairly large receiver tethered to your USB port on a long wire plus you have the TrackMan device. That makes less sense than just getting a wired TrackMan and have one less component to have to manage.It would be better if Logitech gave a good picture of the receiver with the long wire on the outside of the package. I didn't learn a wire was included until I got it opened up.RickL"},{"rating":"2","title":"perfect for limited space","review":"I love this trackball mouse. I have been using Trackman Marble Wheel version for the past few years. It was great also, but with limited desk space at work, the Cordless version is better. With a keyboard, calculator and books/binders/papers needed on my desk, it is easy to get the mouse out of the way and still use it. My next goal is a cordless keyboard!The only complaint that I have is that the \\"wheel\\" button from the Cord to Cordless has been reduced in space. It used to occupy a almost full size button space, and now only the wheel itself is placed in between the R and L buttons. Your hand used to be able to rest with index, middle and ring finger on L, Wheel, and R buttons. Now, you really can only use your index and middle fingers on the R and L and move one of them to the wheel when you need it. I do not find it as comfortable. But, I can live with that inconvenience in comparison with the benefits."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this trackball","review":"Four years ago I changed from the standard mouse to the wired version of this trackball. Yes, it took 2 days or so to get used to it, but then it became second nature. I love not having to pick up the mouse to get the cord out of the way, or running out of room or off of the mouse pad. With this wireless trackball and my wireless keyboard, I set my laptop on my coffee table and kick back on my couch doing all of my work and internet surfing. I've never had any problems with this model, in fact, I own three at home and one at work. The three at home, one for my laptop, my wife's laptop, and my kids' computer. I hope they never discontinue this style, for it is the most comfortale to use. If you're still using a regular mouse, it's time to try out a trackball. Again, it takes a day or two to get used to, but you will not be sorry.

It doesn't focus on carefully chopping the logic of time travel (although it doesn't commit any egregious errors), but on what it would feel like to trade in the century you live in.Twelve-year-old Ada wants to live in the Utopian world of tomorrow. Twelve-year-old Amber wants to live in the good old days of the past. Each girl gets her wish.Each girl discovers that things are not as straightforward as she'd like to imagine where she has gone. Each girl makes silly mistakes, adapts to her surroundings, learns to maneuver in a strange time, performs a major good deed that she is uniquely positioned to provide.Oh, and in addition to being one of the best time-travel stories I've ever read, it's also one of the best YA novels I've ever read, and I'd recommend it to anyone who is a twelve-year-old girl, and to a whole lot of people who are younger / older / dudelier."},{"rating":"2","title":"A thoroughly enjoyable book!","review":"I thought that the Switching Well was fun and entertaining book about two girls who switch places in time 100 years apart. It had small idiosyncracies that made it interesting. Any young teenager would enjoy this story of time travel. The best parts were the small problems that the two girls ran into while in eachothers times. Such problems as not being able to use thier own money or talking about people who had not been born yet. I recomend this book as for a fun person who likes fantasy and subtle humor. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice basic keyboard","review":"When I ordered ths keyboard, I wasn't expecting much. However, Logitech delivered a nice product, with a modern, streamlined design. The keys are tactile, yet quiet while typing.

Sad, I had only owned it for 6 hours when it happened."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent keyboard","review":"This keyboard is great. It came with a computer I bought and I haven't had a single problem with it at all. I do multiple things on my computer, such as typing papers, designing websites, and gaming where you need to react quickly, and this keyboard fits every need perfectly. It is very comfortable and includes a wrist rest, although I don't use it. The keyboard itself also includes three customizable button that you can set to open your home page, e-mail program/website, and search engine. You can set these to just about any program or website you want, however, so you could have the search engine button open your AOL Instant Messager if you would prefer, for example. Although it doesn't come with all the bells and whistles of more expensive products, I recommend this keyboard due to its excellent performance, comfort, and low price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best current generation keyboard on the market.","review":"This Logitech keyboard is truly the best feeling keyboard I've come across for a while. I love everything about, especially these days when manufacturers keep adding more and more buttons that just clutter the designs and get in the way of it's main function: typing!I am a serious computer user, and I was sad to find out that logitech discontinued the design for a new more ergonomic model. The problem I have with the newer model is that the spacebar is way too narrow. I'm sure they did this to lesson the throw for the keys, but I don't think that I'll ever get used to it. However this model is perfect and I highly recommend that you purchase a new one on ebay. It should run you about $15 shipped on ebay, and it's worth more than double that in my opinion.

Even so, the first portion's view of Type and its history is very limited. Only focusing on one particular town in all the country struggling to keep their local typesetting museum alive. The main point of the film is to create an appreciation of the history and the lost craft through technology. The issue is the film never expands beyond this small minor town except for a trip to Chicago where the documentary turns into a self promotion for the creator's local designers/friends and Chicago's Renegade Craft Fair.Films I would recommend before this is Helvetica, and Art & Copy among others. Those films are focused on the subject matter they are titled after and reveal a full view of the subjects and their contemprary standings.

This gives little insight (although it claims to give much) into the real Vietnam. It is dull with a horable plot and characters that are simple, uncouth, not dignified in any way, and devoid of any real depth. Why I was required to read this in a college course I will never know. It seems to be liken to the thickness and depth of Judy Blume but with a tone that indicates that it (and the author) takes itself (her work) way too seriously."},{"rating":"1","title":"In Country Review","review":"This book was way too slow for my liking I'll tell you that right away. It also annoyed me how much detail she got into about the stupidest little things. Sam was so pariniod about everything in this book. It seemed as if every page she was worried Emmett had a new disease. That just basically ruined it and the book was in my opinion kinda of perverted. I don't think Tom's \\"problem\\" really had any signifigance in the story. No one cared how Lonnie and Tom played with Sam's breasts. I think it was perverted and just not nessary to put in."},{"rating":"2","title":"For a teenager, the book was great!","review":"I enjoyed the book very much. Though, it was not one of my favorite books, I did enjoy it. I could relate very much to Sam and her life. Although her life takes place many years back, and she lives a different life than I do, her reactions seem to be very much like mine would. I liked how the book began with the end and then continued from the beginning in the next chapter. I thought it to be very different. I would recomend the book to any teenager, but if you are younger or older, I would say that you may not enjoy it as much and get out of it what I did. It is a book that I will never forget."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful book from start to finish!","review":"I thought that In Country was very well written. I especially loved that fact that Mason told the story through Sam's point of view.

It was so repetitive. I couldn't help but get bored by it. And the characters. Every character was well developed exept the most important ones. I still to this day have no idea what this sam looks like. I almost stopped reading it part way through. If you into books that are extreamly melodramatic and \\"boring\\", than this is your book. Trust me, it's not worth 10 cents more or less 10 dollars!"},{"rating":"1","title":"In Country - Good Subject, half-baked novel","review":"This novel took a good subject, good plotline, and good characters, and turned it into a lukewarm novel. Long, drawn out sequences strayed from the core of the novel, and made the reading tedious. The way the main character, Sam, acted made it hard to like her at all, which detracted from any enjoyment this novel may have provided at all. All in all, this novel could have been much better, had it been treated differently."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY BORING","review":"This book is pointless. The main character, Sam, is very childish. She is too busy worrying about everyone else's life around her and about the Vietman War to look ahead into the future. She wastes all her time trying to figure out what happened in the war and how her fater died. The whole book is about her quest to find out the gory details about Vietman. She even sleeps in a forest, pretending to be at war to reenact Vietnam. This book is very slow. I kept asking myself: Will Mason finally make some point? However, if you are fascinated by wars and lost someone close in a war then this book might be worth something to you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keep away from this book!!!","review":"If I could I would have given this book zero stars. It was a terrible burden put upon me to finish this book which truly has no point. Most of it is just mindless rambling and the rest was the idiotic main character worrying about Agent Orange in every other sentence. I had to read this book for school and my advice to anyone that has to do the same is to just take a zero on the assignment because it is not worth reading this book. Its basically about this hippie girl who gets drunk and stoned and tries to seduce someone who is at least 14 years older than her. The guy was at war before she was even born. The plot in this book is terrible if there even was one. I realize not every book has a plot it might just have a point to get across but this book had neither.

In four words crappy piece of garbage; am so unfortunably forced to read this literature for school, and i've got too say, to give it two thumbs up you'll have to read it 8 times. I agree this book could be a very good book if they stood with the plot in part 1, but Tom,Sam, and Lonnies life story just isn't interesting. Look at their names, there too basic. Too tell you the truth Kentucky is boring, the books boring, and the author is boring. You have to drink coffee to read this book; the real downside is that the coffee will end up costing more than the book. My advise to all you readers is to jack the book from Barnes and Noble,Borders or photo copy it, save the money for the coffee because your gonna need it."},{"rating":"2","title":"interesting themes, first-rate teenage voice","review":"I'm surprised by other readers' reviews. Of course Sam is \\"childish\\" -- she's a child! You have to judge a book on its own terms. \\"In Country\\" doesn't set out to describe Vietnam, but rather the aftermaths of the war for those who stayed home -- focusing on Sam, a seventeen-year-old whose father was killed before she was born. Mason creates a completely convincing teenage voice. She also does a nice job of touching on lots of aspects of the debates surrounding Vietnam, without straying from storytelling mode. I was interested in the story, moved by the ending, and tickled at remembering what it's like to be 17 and hot for Bruce Springsteen."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's Okay","review":"I thought this book was okay. It wasn't bad in the sense that you couldn't even read it, but I found it hard to get into. The main character, Sam, starts to spend all of her time obsessing over the Vietnam War, which her father was killed in. She hangs out with her uncle and all of his friends who are veterans and tries to connect with all of them and she struggles to understand the experiences that they had in Vietnam.

She gives us an interpretation of Handel's Serse; a selection from Puccini's La Rondine; another selection from Verdi's La Traviata; an aria from Handel's Rinaldo; another nice selection from Puccini's Madame Butterfly; and a final selection from Monteverdi's L'Incoronazione.The CD also has 6 instrumental works, arranged by Paul Schwartz. There is a very nice interpretation of Handel's tragic Sarabande, with vocals by the Joyful Company of Singers and words from Psalm 7. This piece reminds me of the tragic majesty of Carmina Burana.Paul Schwartz consistently delivers powerful reinterpretations of classical music for modern ears."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alvin Fans","review":"My Kids love Alvin and the Chipmunks, so they just loved this movie.

He was a stray that we took in and he's a ruff-neck that kicks this toy up. It holds up very well to the beating and the aroma lasts a long time also. He entertains himself for an hour with this and he's one that gets bored easily. IMO, it is definitely worth the money. The bananas are good also but not quite as long, the cigars work but because of the color, we're constantly stepping on them and freaking ourselves out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cats Love the Pollock Fish!","review":"Okay, well I have to say my cats do REALLY LOVE the Pollock Fish. So much that each has their OWN Pollock Fish. I agree with some of the other reviews that our cats LOVE the Pollock Fish MORE than the Cigar, the Yellow Banana, and yes, even the Rainbow. I do not know why..... the Pollock Fish wins every time. However..... when I bought this little sucker it was so expensive (for a cat toy), that plus the shipping charge, I was like - OMG - WHY does this little sucker cost so much? I also had a very hard time finding it at the time. However, now when I look for it, there are quite a few for sale and the price has come down a lot - so that's a good thing. I guess I'll just have to stock up when the price is more reasonable. This Fish is durable, my cats rabbit-kick it mercilessly, bite it, lick it, drag it around - it holds up and doesn't fall apart. My cats would give it 5 stars, but I'm only giving it 4 stars because I paid way too much when I bought it the last time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kitty gone wild...","review":"My cat received this as a gift-when I put it in the floor, still wrapped, he went into full attack mode.

No latency ever on my MacBook. The software is easy to use and the amp models and effects are not only really accurate, they have taught me a lot about Marshall and Fender amp settings as well as a half dozen historic stomp pedals. I bought one for my son to use and he loves it to. With a guitar (I have a Strat), gig bag and a small computer bag, you are ready to plug into a house system or external speakers and play. An advantage to physical amps and pedals is that you can store the settings you like or use the many presets that come with the product. Also, it has a great tuner and the ability to play along with MP3s that you drag into the software and allow you to change the tempo without changing the tone. The Garageband plug-in also works very well. This is a tremendous bargain for the price, especially for traveling musicians, parents who don't want big amp sounds in their house etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"doesn't quite deliver","review":"I planned on using this equipment instead of carrying around an amp while traveling. The stealthplug itself works fine. Has a little hiss to it. But the software that comes with it does not work. I have tried several whys to fix it including tech support.

Nothing really hangs together or jells into a cohesive story, and its inconsistencies and dropped threads make for a confusing and unfulfilling read. The ending is far too tidy, and appears to be an effort to wrap it all up, but is hopelessly unsuccessful. Overall, the writing is harsh and the plot weak."},{"rating":"2","title":"Waxwings? Why waxwings?","review":"I see that most of Waxwing's reviewers were Seattleites. As an ex-Seattleite, I loved the nostalgia the book presented.But that ending? The (bird) waxwings devour all the berries off the bush outside the main character's window. No previous mention of waxwings in the book (except, of course, for that title!) So what was the significance? I realize it's symbolic, but symbolic of what? The main character's life had dipped into shambles, but by the ending he is recovering very nicely, thank you very much. Those other reviews seemed to gloss over the ending, but I have to confess, I do not understand it.

I never read the books this author wrote earlier and found myself trying to understand what was going on here. It was obvious that the plot referred to a plot of a past book The many, many characters who swirled all around this story but were never fully developed were all protagonists in other books.

Top book in my opinion to better your bass fishing ability."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"Keith Jones' book, \\"Knowing Bass\\" is a great book and serves an important niche. Jones' book is not so much a book about fishing tips and techniques. Although, through careful reading of the tests and the experiments you will learn great things about bass. If you purchase this book expecting tips and techniques you will be disappointed. If you purchase this book wanting to know details previously unknown to the general public then you will be greatly satisfied.However, this book does a great job of explaining the physical intracacies of the bass. I highly regard this book and would urge all serious bass fisherman to read it a few times.--Chad Battles"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Very Useful for an Angler","review":"This book's title sounds good. Who wouldn't want to know the results of controlled studies on how fish react to different techniques. Well that makes up about 10 pages of this book. In case you want to know: putting a flavor on a lure seems to work, scent not really, and bass will hold on to soft baits much longer than hard baits. Most of the book reads like a biology lesson charting out various organs in the fish and describing their functions. The problem is that there is no real connection made between this and fishing techniques. Does it help me to know how different sense organs attach to the Bass' brain? for me not really. If you are really interested in Bass physiology perhaps this would be worth reading, otherwise I would not recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a SCIENTIFIC Book","review":"I'm a bio-chemist by training, so I suppose I am geared toward this type of information. This book is like taking a college course in bass biology. If I taught such a course, I would use this as the classroom text! It contains the most comprehensive collection of scientific bass information I've ever seen, and I own hundreds of fishing books.As others have noted, the author does not always tell you EXACTLY what lure to use and when to use it, but that is not the intent of this book. Frankly, the studies in this book are so comprehensive that if you piece the testing data together you will find yourself starting to get an idea of what lures to use based on the results of the studies of bass sight, hearing, feeding behavior, etc... as reported in this book.I find myself looking at new lures and thinking back to the different studies to determine whether or not the new \\"magic\\" bait is special (in most cases it is not)."},{"rating":"1","title":"ALERT - the website that this hardware needs is DEAD","review":"HI - I wrote a review of this earlier this year - and I am still impressed by the fact you can send computer audio or any audio throughout your house...However, it looks like as of about May 1, 2004 the website that the hardware works with is no longer active.

Not even in the same room with the transmitter was it able to work properly.Being an electronics gizmo addict, I had no problems understanding the easy to follow instructions, or the layout of the remote tuner. Still, it's a great idea, but with poor exectution.If your looking for remote access to your MP3 files, go with the Dell Remote Tuner instead. It uses the telephone lines, has a traditional remote control, performs flawlessly, and may someday be able to tune in Internet Radio.RTD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great concept...poor product","review":"The concept of this product is great, however what the manufacturer does not tell you is that there are many devices in your home (cordless phones, baby monitors, even your PC) that could interfere with the reception of the remote receiver. I spent many hours trying to tune the receiver with the transmitter with no success, even when the transmitter and receiver were within feet of each other.I found the documentation and technical support for the product left a lot to be desired also.I have chose to ditch the idea of using the tuner remotely, but I am going to use the device as a wired device to my home stareo.

The answer is basically NOTHING. The difference between Gardner's and this book is that this book is a wonderful introduction to anybody appreciative of art but lacks the basic skills at analyzing and appreciating art to the fullest. 1500pg Art History books serve as a wonderful reference but as a poor introduction. Enter \\"Annotated Mona Lisa\\" , giving readers an introduction to art combined with attention-grabbing description and prose with the history and background of several thousands of years of art from pre-historic to modern.

Apparently no one did in this case. The available evidence makes it almost certain that modern humans did NOT evolve from Neaderthals. That much is fact.

While the earlier edition provided extensive word lists organized around the consonants, this book was organized around vowels. The only word lists that were based on consonants were much shorter in comparison. Although I sent the book back and can't reference it, I seem to remember that they were around 15 to 20 words long.

When it was turned all the way up, it would leave a film of water on the floor around it. Can you say water damage? I eventually moved the unit on top of a dresser so that the mist would evaporate before it hit the ground.All in all, not a very good design and obviously poor construction.

For those individuals who go on long trips (ie. military) this is perfect. All your music is sitting into your pocket and easily accessible. You can even take thousand's of picture's of your family and friends with you and it so convenient. I recommend this drive to anyone technicians, mechanics, lawyers, programmers, etc. Why pay so much for a 2GB-4GB thumbdrive when you can have a 100GB for the same price? And the cost is just the same!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well, very small and light, gets very hot during use","review":"I bought this to be a portable backup for my work computer. It has served the purpose well. I like its firewire capability, as it can now serve as bootable drive in an emergency. It has enough storage space (for me, at least) to partition into two drives and to use one as backup and one as a general shuttle drive. The only complaint I have is that it gets extremely hot - so hot, in fact, that at one point during a long backup (~60 GB), I thought it was going to burn the table. It can definitely get too hot to hold when in use. However, that's the tradeoff for such a small drive... it weights significantly less than a pound and can easily slip into a side pocket in a backpack or even fanny pack. All in all, I highly recommend this drive."},{"rating":"2","title":"easy and safe","review":"excelent external hard drive.

Skip it and pick another Larry book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful Novel","review":"Scorched Earth is a powerful novel. Robbins's lean, sometimes poetic writing style propels the story forward at a page-turning pace. The book's theme is important -- the degree to which racism spreads its poison from birth to death in a contemporary working-class community in the American south. Once I began reading this book, I was totally absorbed and couldn't put it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"worth waiting for the ending","review":"while at times a bit overwrought, this is a superbly written novel that climaxes nicely. the characters are well developed and you find yourself caring for their outcomes. while I guessed the ending early on, I often thought I had guessed wrongly and only in the end did I find that I had guessed correctly.a good read, although sometimes it takes awhile to get to the dialogue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Writing, Bad Theology","review":"A flawed book by David L. Robbins is still a good read. The author is a master of his craft, and Scorched Earth is absorbing. I was led to this book because I so appreciated his WWII novels.But a warning to readers with religious sensibilities: the book panders to our secular world's desire to make pastors look like colossal hypocrites and fools. Scorched Earth's preacher Thomas Derby makes the Scarlet Letter's Reverend Dimsdale look like a saint. In contrast Robbins portrays the book's mill workers as earthy, noble, fulfilled simple-folk. Derby is not a credible, believable character. He's just a caricature, betraying a lack of respect for organized religion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bit of a disappointment","review":"I was disappointed with this book; it started out as a good read but then bogged down. The author tends to be repetitive, going over and over about how great a soldier Remy Schrijnen was without really saying much about what was going on or what he did. I finally got tired of it and started skimming through sections, then just put the book down. While I was disappointed overall, there are some sections and pictures of interest that may prove useful to dedicated students of lesser known German (SS) units and combat on the Eastern Front. At some point, I will probably pick it up again, gloss over certain sections and finish the book, but for now it will gather dust on the shelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comprehensive study","review":"This book is a comprehensive study of the Flemish volunteers in the German army. Most parts are very readable , but the personal reflections on the battle at Narva become a bit repetitive. Improvements would have been the use of maps. The action accounts are somewhat brief and lacking in detail (as often is the case with such war memoirs). But a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Last Knight of Flanders: Remy Schrijnen and His Ss-Legio","review":"Excellent book, highly advisable for all those interested ones in knowing more envelope the European volunteers that combatted against the Bolshevism in the Oriental Front.

First, if you are not extremely fluent in French, you will find the language in this book very difficult. The story is a bit strange to begin with, but visualizing what is happening or even what this mysterious talisman looks like is all but impossible. As you trudge through the pages and pages and pages of this book, you're always hoping it will get better, that you will be stimulated in the way that Balzac had done before, but to no avail. Reading should be fun, but this is drudgery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Design Masturbation ?","review":"Each page of this book is beautiful. Aside from that it's basically meaningless, the 'illustrations' have either a very obvious or no connection to the peace ideas.

I feel that a book like this could be a great asset to enlightening people to darker aspects of our society. However... it is so poorly written that I would lose focus on what I was reading. The author is too close to whom he interviews and so it appeared to me to be more of a showcase of his friends rather than what they had to really say about things. There were actual misspellings within the text, which I also found disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fantastic and accurate overview of many dark lifestyles!","review":"\\"With passion and honesty, author Corvis Nocturnum delves into topics that most of us know little or nothing about.

Not quite as hard hitting as KMFDM and NIN, they have a distinct sound which I have yet to hear another band duplicate. Unfortunately, Corroded Disorder does not reflect this. The Album is horribly repetative...it lacks the distorted vocals and ingenious use of clashing harmony which made Tactical Neural Implant and Hard Wired so fantastic. If you listen to the first 20 seconds of Corroded Disorder, you've just listened to the entire album. I was very disappointed in this release."},{"rating":"1","title":"what's up with No Limit now.","review":"I bought Mysticals last album and thought it was tight and I heard the first one which was good.

Mystiakal's debut album was rocking, and it stayed TRU to the basis on which No Limit started, mad beats with a lyrical assault to back it up.

He brings it like no other rapper can or will. It's a style completely unique, you can't knock it. I love No Limit Records, i think they're the best, but sometimes i wonder why Mystikal is even with him, that's how good he is. He out shines every rapper he's ever rapped with, until he finally got to spit lyrics with Busta Rhymes, somewhat of his equal. With Ghetto Fabulous, it's impossible for Mystikal not to go multi-platinum. There isn't a track on there that isn't tight.

It's not. When it arrived, the cap (on top of the ice strainer) was stuck on it. And the cap that fits in the shaker cup wont even fit in completely - I could probably use a hammer to get it to fit securely, but then I would definitely never get it off.

Although she sometimes has her heroines taking sexual risks that would have been unusual at the time (Slightly Wicked, Simply Unforgettable), her grasp of the history and tone of the period is outstanding. I can't imagine what happened here. Characters worry about psychological trauma eight decades before Freud invented the term. And carry on about each other's emotional baggage -- 175 years before Seinfeld! This appears to be a hastily-written, poorly thought-out novel, which is too bad, given other reviewers' clearly demonstrated strong interest in Alleyne's story. The rest of MB's work is terrific; I guess this is just a stumble in her waltz with the era."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of this series by far!","review":"The first book I ever read by Mary Balogh was Slightly Tempted followed by Slightly Married. It's a miracle after reading those two duds that I ever read anything by her again. But I did and thoroughly enjoyed Slightly Wicked, A Summer to Remember, One Night for Love and her latest, Slightly Sinful. Sinful is probably my second favorite book of hers, first being One Night for Love. It's romantic, silly, sweet and in the end, very satisfying (unlike the incredibly boring Slightly Tempted and the incredibly unromantic Slightly Married). I'll keep reading Mary Balogh, even though she is very hit and miss, and I can't wait for Wulfric's story, I hope it's as lovely a story as Slighty Sinful was."},{"rating":"1","title":"bayoubabe","review":"I loved the other books in this series!

Once again, this was a charming, humerous story with all the excitement of the other Bedwyn novels. I thorougly enjoy Mary Balogh's writing and will continue to purchase her books. I highly recommend it as once you discover this the Bedwyns, you thirst to know about the other brothers and sisters and you will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth a read","review":"While not the best of the series, it was a good read. I read it through in one sitting, and enjoyed the whole book (which is becoming a rare thing these days). I'm a little bored by the amnesia victim story line (tired; very, very tired), but she handled it well. I especially liked the way she handled the wrap-up at the end.

Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buffalo Commons","review":"As a homesick former Montanan, I loved this book. Wheeler does such a great job of an even-handed presentation of the pros and cons of ranchers versus restorers. I sort of resented the \\"feds' being cast as the villains, since I know many of them and they are sincere, caring people who want the best for the land and its inhabitants, but I am also aware that the individuals who work for the agencies are often the victims themselves of political agendas. Kind of an old-fashioned novel--heros were flawed, but good-villains were BAD--made it fun to read.Wheeler obviously had done his homework--lots of fascinating information presented in a readable, entertaining manner. Well worth the read,"},{"rating":"1","title":"Of a different vein than Wheeler's historical novels","review":"I can say now that I vastly prefer the author's historical works.

I'd had the CD for years before one day I was reading the back of the CD case and suddenly noticed that the album was produced by the late Georg Brunner Schwer, who produced all the classic Oscar Peterson albums in the late 60's and early 70's (such as \\"Tracks\\").The recordings were made in 1983, and overall this a fine album of Ellington tunes.

Most of the time I use it for cutting down trim and 2 Xs to rough length for easier handling. The cut depth and bevel adjustments are easy to use and accurate. There's plenty of power and the blade is razor sharp! There's a dust port for using with a vac or dust collection system. Overall this is a great saw but a bit pricey, so I suggest that you buy the combo kit with the jig saw, sawzall, and drill. I have the set and use all 4 tools all the time, they are all great!

This show had a lot of insight, even while some of the plots were way out, some of the other shows were right down perfect for the time period. It showed the first car-phone in Straker's car (Remember this was done in the 70's) And even some of the cars designs were depicting future developments. I sometimes use the background elements of this show to influence my novels. (See Battlecruiser: Prototype on Amazon.) and I hoped that they would bring the show back on (Almost happened in 1996). You can visit the UFO website which shows artwork and scripts from the actual show. In the meantime, I look forward to getting set 1 and set 2 as a must have for any DVD collection. (PS-- I already have the show on video, but I would replace those immediately with a DVD... it's that good!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Only the case is cheap","review":"What can I say. This show has never looked or sounded better, even when it was new. I enjoyed UFO when I was really young, but it never left my mind. I have borrowed VHS tapes from friends, but it always lacked that charm of a good DVD. I bought it at a very good price and it came so fast it was a total surprise. I have been watching it since and enjoying a little of my childhood. Don't think twice about it if you remember the show. Like the title of this review, the worse thing is the case it comes in. If you have the Star Trek TNG DVD sets or the X-Files, you will be disappointed in the case, but not the DVDs."},{"rating":"2","title":"American Audiences can now enjoy uncut and clear UFO","review":"Previously available in the UK and Europe, this remastered edition of UFO contains a few niceties to complement the episodes. Purchasers of this set are probably already fans of the show which has re-emerged occasionally in the 30+ years since the original run. The bulk of the episodic content is well known for its speculation of future life in a '60's vein.The biggest plus for this set is the clean video and the inclusion of scenes which have been \\"chopped\\" by broadcasters.The outtakes are reasonable but lack an explanation of why they are important. The \\"Exposed\\" scenes could have benefited greatly by written explanations of the differences versus the final episode.The physical product is packaged oddly. Little is provided in text form(No booklet), relying primarily on the sleeve for such info.Excepting minor details, this DVD offering is an excellent revisit of the SHADO world. Definately worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Order, order, order","review":"OK, maybe I'm missing something, or maybe my episode guide is incorrect, but it seems to me, these fantastic DVDs are not in episode order. Was \\"exposed\\" really the 5th episode, as the DVD lineup would indicate, or in fact the second, as noted in the Gerry Anderson episode guide. This is my only gripe with this set; but a significant one as wanting a season of episodes in broadcast order is important. (OK, maybe not so much with UFO but just try watching that new Babylon 5 set in November out of order).As noted in other reviews, the quality is excellent and it the first time since I've been a fan of this series that I could actually make out the wires holding up Derek Meddings excellent work. Such is the sharp picture quality. Lets hope set 2 gets the lineup correct."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS SHOW IS STILL COOL","review":"This show is a taste of the 60's fantasy TV. I love it. My 10 year old daughter watches some of this shows with me. Great special efects, for 1969, if you consider they didn't use any CG scenes at all. It even looks good on my 51\\" wide screen TV; on \\"wide zoom\\" it gets a little distorted but that is how I watch it now. When I saw it as a kid I must have been really stupid because I don't remember all the hotties, just the doom, doom, doom, doom, toorurum...theme.

Why? I'm a whinybutt, THAT'S why. \\"Serpentine Gallery\\" is a great \\"how to\\" darkwave rock album. The opening track, \\"Bad Trash\\" is a goth dancefloor classic. The songs are a good balance of guitar, 80's synth and spooky vocals. They don't all sound the same, but it sounds like the band's having fun all the way through. The lyrics are better-than-average goth poetry. \\"Bad Trash,\\" \\"Dissolve\\" (dramatic tune, I must say) and \\"Wrecking Yard\\" cover a lot of ground and Tina Root's faux-operatic vocal style is cool. Sorry for using \\"faux.\\" They moved into more Miranda Sex Garden-type music with the next two albums, but the lyrics stayed pretty close to the mood of \\"Serpentine Gallery.\\" Switchblade Symphony is more about beguiling songs than Fitting Into Goth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eerily Beautiful","review":"Of all the new school goth bands coming out, I don't think any are as creative or just downright beautiful as Switchblade Symphony. The songs on Serpentine Gallery are varied anough to keep you guessing what's going to happen next. Most of this is very danceable, but unlike alot of goth dance music, it stays interesting when you're listening to it by yourself.

This live cd appeared to be more of a reunion of the old band, and memories of better days gone by. The performance is weak, with changed phrasing on the songs, and altered melodies to accommodate a singers who no longer have the range they used to. Still, there are some shining moments, such as a couple enjoyable guitar solos. As for production value, it unfortunately has very little. It was neither well recorded, well mixed, or well produced.I DO, however, recommend the original Freddy Jones Band cd, or North Avenue Wakeup Call, when the band was at their height of ambition and creativity. There was an energy in those studio recordings that is way beyond the live cd described above. I only wish I could go back to 1998 or so, and see them live when they were truly ALIVE."},{"rating":"1","title":"You're better off find a good bootleg.","review":"This is without a doubt the Freddy Jones Band's worst release. Not even a year after the band had lost two of the original five members, they tour with a replacement bass player, who just could not fill the shoes of their original. This left a huge whole in the backbeat that lead guitarist Wayne Healy tries to hard to fill with his lead guitar, and just can't pull it off.Barring a couple of exceptions, the live versions of their songs on this album lack emotion, creativity, or a powerful drive. It isn't even mixed very well.If you were impressed with the live tracks on the FJB original release (as I very much was) prepare to be sorely dissapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"the album is great mix of songs that show the talent of FJB","review":"This album definitely showcases one the best bands around. The jamming songs of \\"Take the Time\\", \\"Waitress\\", and \\"Wonder\\" mix well with mellow songs such as \\"Into the Wind\\" and \\"Texas Skies\\". The guitar work and lyrics make this CD a great one to listen too over and over again. There are a few songs that could have been added to this CD but overall it is worth every dollar!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely the best Freddy Jones album yet!","review":"As an owner of only 2 other Freddy Jones albums, I must say that this is the best one i own and have ever heard. I read in the jacket that these were the band's picks of what they thought were the best tracks of their first summer tour. Well they were right because these are the best versions of these songs i have ever heard. The cd starts with a great version of \\"One World.\\" Track 5 is an awesome rendition of \\"Into the Wind.\\" Track 11 is the song \\"In a Daydream\\" which is my favorite Freddy song and is a really good version of this song. Finally, the Cd is wrapped up with a 9 minute version of \\"Take the Time.\\" This track is a great conclusion to a great cd with a nice jam in the latter half of the song. This is a must buy for any Freddy Jones fan and it would be a good starter cd for anyone interested in the Freddy Jones Band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good guide","review":"An independent musician may be a frustrated and irritated person, this largely due to the hardships he encounters during the process of promoting his music.

More expanded books, such as the Princeton Review or ARCO review books, are much better.

I didn't get to finish the book in the two weeks I had before the exam, but at least I learned a lot from it and ended up getting a 5.

If you get a lot of problems wrong don't worry too much cuz I think the problems in the book are harder than those in the AP exam.

DO NOT BUY THIS GARBAGE.....do the right thing...spend more than 50 dollars ...or just be smart and buy an ipod or zune! have a nice day!"},{"rating":"1","title":"PIECE OF JUNK!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"My son purchased this as a second mp3 player and has had nothing but trouble with it. It takes forever to charge to an computer so if you're going out of town and don't have access to an computer, you're out of luck. It's also hard to download videos. My son tried many times to download with no success. When charging the battery it takes forever!! He had his connected to the computer for 6 hours and it never charged. Also the back is constructed of metal and gets very hot when attempting to charge.The music sounds great with the tempo feature, however if you use this feature it takes up battery usage 2x's faster.All in all if you're thinking of purchasing this MP4 player- DON'T!!!!!!! You're waisting your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unusable Cheap Junk","review":"This thing works for about 15 minutes. The only way to charge is through the USB port on my computer. That would be fine if it worked. But I leave the thing plugged in for hours and hours, and the charge lasts 15 minutes. Sometimes less. Not to mention the non-existent song menu system. You actually have to forward through every song on the device to listen to choose one. And the control panel is cheap plastic that's just floating above the control buttons. Feels like a toy, not an MP3 player.I'm still talking to customer service at Coby, but from what I'm reading, this thing is probably going back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really 2 1/2","review":"I really give this item 2 1/2 stars. I have a COBY which I really liked, but wanted something with more memory. This one is okay except that it keeps coming back to the same song and I find it difficult to call up the other cd's I downloaded. My original coby has a built in usb port which is very convenient because there is no extra wire to use or lose. I like having an FM radio to listen to as an option and really wanted the upgraded version of my original coby which is advertised, but for some reason not available. For the price it works well enough if all you want is extra memory and a device that is inexpensive that you don't want to worry about if you are traveling or jogging. All in all I am still getting used to it and haven't tried any of the other features such as voice recording and book downloads."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Happy with product","review":"Did not receive ac adapter and having problems loading music on to this mp3. Although Amazon got my order out in a timely manor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor interface, cheaply made.","review":"Read multiple reviews. I own multiple brands of mp3 players. This is the worst. Interface is text based. Its like using the original text based internet searches or dos/unix to find a song. I paid $24 for this 2gb MP-C7092. For a Sandisk e250 2gb unit I paid $33. Both units were purchased thru Amazon. These units go up and down in price based on Amazon inventory levels. I purchased a Sandisk c240 for #19.99 within one week it was $34.98. So wait for a reasonable price for another brand to be cheaper and skip this junk it really is not very good. Its like something you would get in a happy meal or a cereal box.

Amazon went to wonderfully extraordinary lengths to take care of me, but the product was simply a dud.The original I got, a replacement I exchanged for, and another they sent me by 2 day shipping, all had the same problem: the internal battery would in no way be charged. I even tried on two different computers: my desktop and laptop. The desktop is a DELL, the laptop an Acer.I finally gave up, got a refund, and bought a COBY with a replaceable battery. That review to come. In short: MUCH better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap piece of crap","review":"Doesn't work unless it's plugged into the computer. Buttons don't work.

Every chapter is well written but be advised that you should have an understanding of viz before working through this book. If your just starting with the software, do the tutorials that ship with the software before moving on to this book.

I would NOT re-order these boots - cannot return/exchange after 2 years, even if only occasional wearing.He LOVED these boots - we invested in the hat and coat as well.=:-((The \\"seam\\" - connection between t he yellow toe and black, seems to bear the brunt of any pressure from movement - both boots the same - and maybe the rubber flexing only against thin cloth is more prone to tearing?? That's my non-engineering guess.Very disappointing. . . ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute with Poor Quality","review":"I purchased this as a gift. My Grandson loved these boots. They were just what a little Fireman needed. But the quality is very poor. Within 60 days they began to separate at the seams. Needless to say he is upset he can not wear his boots.

My five year old son had the same pair in a smaller size that we purchased from Nordstrom last year. He didn't wear them enough to judge back then because they were grown out of quickly. I purchased this pair in December and have not had good luck. The 2nd time he put them on the handles you grip to pull them on broke off on both boots. After wearing them for about a month the sole started pulling apart and ripping. I'm not impressed. I will tell you that my 5 yr old son is extremely high spirited so perhaps they wore out quicker than normal. Not sure but I won't be buying these next year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boots fell apart after 3 wearings","review":"I'm really sorry these were so poorly made, because my son loves them and wants to wear them daily. He got them for Christmas and wore them three times when the sole separated from the rest of the boot! The weather was good and they had been mostly worn indoors.I ordered a new pair, and he kept wearing them (no snow or rain, thank heavens), while we waited for the new ones to arrive. When they came the other day, I went to box up the first pair to return them, and lo and behold the OTHER boot had separated in exactly the same way!So now I'm just waiting for the new ones to fall apart, at which point I will give up and go buy boots somewhere else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fireman Boots","review":"My son (3yrs) had the Thomas Boots (\\"Choo Choo boots\\") last year and has worn them out completely!

They did not do well when he went puddle jumping - \\"note to self - put rain pants over boots\\" - they filled with water from him splashing it in from the tops!!! Simple rookie parenting mistake!!! After one year they still fit - upsized them on purchase - larger didn't matter to him he could kick them off real easy! The backs split recently - but these were heavily used - I just taped them up and they are good as new!

Unfortunately it seems as though they piece these boots together rather than taking a solid boot and decorating it. The boots split at the seam in the front over the toes. The size was great, they were not tight but after wearing them several times over a 2 week period we had a hole. I think given the price of these boots they should have lasted much longer. I have bought plain rubber boots from walmart for half the price and they last till he outgrows them. We aren't real happy and will not purchase these boots again."},{"rating":"2","title":"best investment","review":"My three-year-old couldn't love these boots more.

A worthy investment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too heavy!","review":"This boot is way too big and heavy for a toddler. My son (20 mons) could barely lift his leg with this boot on.

We live in a mountain area that consists of some paved roads and some dirt. My son mostly wears them on walks or playing in the yard.

I love the design but will not purchase again do to the lack of durability."},{"rating":"1","title":"Look great/fall apart","review":"These boots look great when you first get them, but they don't last very long at all. It was only a few months into wearing them when I realized that they came apart. They don't just come apart a little, they come apart almost completely, at least to the point of them being some flaps of rubber held together here and there.They split pretty much everywhere the black meets the yellow. It's a real shame because they look like there nice, but you can't always judge a boot by its looks, I guess."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 pairs and both fell apart","review":"We first got these boots for my [...]son for Easter and they split at the seam in about 1 month.

I just ordered him another pair of western chief boots since he is in a new size now."},{"rating":"2","title":"A favorite with my son","review":"These boots made a little boys face light up and they are worn nearly constantly.

It doesn't affect the function of the boot but spoils the look a little."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd give zero stars if i could","review":"These are some of the most poorly made kids fire boots I have ever seen. My 3 year old is really into firemen. I bought these boots at Stride Rite so I assumed they would be durable. I couldnt not have been more wrong. Within a month the boots had split across the front just under the shield. Not one boot, but BOTH!! The split just continued to get larger. Despite the fact that he mostly wears these indoors, the soles began to wear through and within 3 months the sole had started to detach from the boot all together.

It was not used the whole winter and was used few times during spring for the occasional rainy days. I was shocked when my son came home from school with wet socks last week. THE BASE CAME APART. We have used many a rainy boots over the years, never had this problem. We had to go for new ones only because he outgrew his current ones. Here we go, now got to buy another pair.

I just thought I would let people know what 343 means."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy-Reading!","review":"Wonderful book! One question to the author, though. Was this just a mistake, or did Isaac have two cars? On page 27 he used his friend's car because his 96 Lincoln was out of commission.

Just curious."},{"rating":"2","title":"It took me three days to read it: I couldn't put it down.","review":"\\"Bebe's By Golly Wow\\" was interesting because the characters Bebe, Sandy, Issac and Dash seemed so real.

I guess music, like books, can work wonders."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too slow...too childish","review":"I tried to give Y.J. a chance but it looks like it just won't work. I thought 'He Say, She Say' was slow and silly and I didn't enjoy it at all but I give all authors a second chance to show their growth. Unfortunately, Y.J. has not exhibited any learned lessons from her first novel. Actually, I think 'Bebe...' is worse. I can't even finish it. The storyline is silly and the characters are unbelievably childish(Bebe...a 40 year old woman, yeah right!). I especially hate her version of a 13 year old girl. Can she please get a clue...'and what not?' Sorry Y.J., I can't waste anymore time or money on your books."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Was Disappointed...","review":"I really wanted to give this book a try because I read \\"He Say, She Say.\\" What a waste--I had to look at the back cover thirty times because I couldn't believe Ms. Joe is a Yale graduate. I don't want to hate on her, because I am an aspiring writer myself, but this book lacks intelligence, the slang is cliche, and the characters are stereotypes, to me. It seemed rushed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overexaggerated","review":"I am sorry to say that this book seemed to be very unrealistic. I can usually give a book a benefit of the doubt, but I could not even get halfway thru the book. The slang and the characters profiles were extremely over-exaggerated. I know it is fiction, but she was very redundant with her slang, using it unecessarily which made it hard for the book to flow. It seemed like she was trying to hard to give the characters character. This was the first book that I attempted to read by her. Bad first impression. I will have to give her other books a try."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just plain awful!","review":"I read this book several weeks ago, and I'm still mad that I spent any time on it at all. This is one of the worst books I have read in years. I find it hard to believe that there could be such shallow people in the world as are portrayed by these characters. The title character is supposed to be a mature woman, yet she apparently spends nearly all her time thinking about CDs, cars, clothing, and other material things. It reminds me of what a not-very mature 12 year old girl would think an adult woman is like. Where is the soul in these people? I find it truly frightening if the average American reader is led to believe that this type of trivial, media-brainwashed pap is what the average black woman thinks and feels on an ongoing basis."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISAPPOINTING","review":"This got 5 stars??? I found this book to be so juvenille-- so insulting-- that i had a difficult time finishing it. Don't get me wrong- Yolanda Joe does have a story to tell. Unfortunately, she relies so heavily on hackneyed expressions, nonsense words and phrases (\\"fa-fa- fierce\\") and \\"urban slang\\" that its difficult to determine what she's actually trying to say. Unfortunately, Joe's book is yet one more addition to the \\"bubblegum\\" black fiction genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another disappointment","review":"This is another in the long line of awful black novels that have been released this year which contribute to the over-all marginalization of black literary standards.

I read He Say, She Say by the author. I got it as a gift, I figured no harm no foul. I BOUGHT this book, shame on me. The \\"slang\\" used in this book reminds me of how whites used to write blacksplotation movies, and sit-coms back in the '70's. Who talks like this? What 40 year old woman is this dumb? The ending was just plain stupid. This book is just straight up corny, and a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to follow","review":"I started reading this book last week and I have already skipped several paragraphs. I am usually a fast reader, but this one is just really hard to read. The language is overly trivial and repetitive. I don't think I will be able to finish reading the book. I am sure it's a great story, but the language used made it too hard for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISAPPOINTED","review":"I expected a much better book considering that I read the previous 2 novels by this author and they were excellent. This book was a waste of time and I hope the next book will be much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Entertaining","review":"I found this book entertaining throughout and very well written.

Keeping it real."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall A Good Book","review":"Overall I felt that this was a good book. However, I not did feel the need to stay up all night turning the pages. I was easily able to put it down. I felt that the story moved at too slow a pace.I wished that there had been more development to the Sandy character and I would have liked to have known more about Dashay's mother. It was hard for me to beleive that a mother could leave her baby like that. I know it happens, but it's hard to beleive. More development as to why that happened would have made me happy.I cried at the end when Isaac proposed to Bebe. I was very happy that things had worked out for them.I did believe in the characters. Ms. Joe was able to make me feel like these characters were people that I knew. Ms. Joe had the ability to make the characters real. I feel that that is the most important thing an author can do. As I said, I felt that overall the book was a good read. I look forward to reading future projects by Ms. Joe."},{"rating":"2","title":"BeBe's By Golly Wow an excellent book most can relate to","review":"I gave the book 5 stars because I like te way the individual characters have their day in the sun and we are able to explore each and every characters life. In reading you feel like you know them and it is very easy to sympathize with each character. The book is so real and in reading this you will definetly find a character who identifies with you or you know someone just like them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better \\"BEBE\\" good to me!","review":"The second installment to HE SAID, SHE SAID was all BeBe-brash and full of attitude! It was just the way that I liked it. Throw Issac and daughter Dashay into the mix and the entire book was filled with plenty laughs and honest feelings. Isaac and BeBe's love affair wasn't easy, and I am glad that it wasn't. It would not have been as interesting if it was a easy ride. The supporting characters supplied enough substance to make the main characters whole and complete. This book was a winner, so congratulations to you, Ms. Joe, because it was worth every page!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wizcom quicklink pen 1000","review":"I rate this product 2-star because it wasn't easy to use. The shape was not correctly designed to scan text easily. The scanner was not as accurate as I would have expected. On the box, it claims that it is 97% accurate but I found that it was actually not that accurate. It has poor letter sensitivity. It also took a long time to read the text and process the text onto the screen. I expected it to work like a highliter but it wasn't true. I think that the price is exaggerated when you take all the reasons I listed. I think that this pen needs to have a few improvements to make it more accurate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as C-Pen","review":"I've used both this and the C-Pen 600, and I found the C-Pen to be significantly better, mainly because the C-Pen has a much better user interface. As well as being more awkward to use than the C-Pen, the QuickLink is noticably larger. The QuickPen does have the advantage of having a serial port as well as the I/R interface. The QuickLink Pen is also a bit cheaper, as to get the equivalant functionality with a C-Pen you need a C-600, InfraRed adapter for your computer, and carrying case, all of which must be purchased separately."},{"rating":"1","title":"Device Fine, Software lousy","review":"I found the scan effectiveness worthy of praise, but trying to get the content to my laptop unbearable.

Unfortunately, the software app. for this scanner sucked, the interface was a total pain in the a** to get functioning correctly, and text- editing was a nightmare. I ended up wasting more time trying to get it to work than it was worth. Total waste of my time and money.Save your $$$ and wait until better models come out in the future.

When I first installed the software I could not get the pen and PC to communicate. It was extremely frustrating. Wizcom help staff wasn't helping (although it was a noble effort). Then the sun shined down upon Amazon - I read the reviews - and voila! After using online comments as a guide, I removed my PDA from COM1 synchronization, and it worked. The pen is great! Research reviews take 1/2 the time! Another tip was helpful as well - switch to left -handed use, turn material upside down, and scan right to left. It is much more precise.Once you get it going, it is a great tool."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Idea, Little Action","review":"The idea behind this product is terrific, but the execution needs much improvement. I found that the accuracy was much less than advertised, and the pen required considerable testing to get at the proper angle to scan material.

I priced things after using the pen and realized that I could buy a better scanner 9x12\\" with omnipage for under $90. Even the lite version that came with the scanner is better then the pen.

It has made my work as a scientist much easier (references and research methods can now be collected/scanned directly in to the pen, and then onto my desktop computer editing software). I no longer need to jot down notes in various pieces of paper. The pen had about 5% error rate, but that is more than compensated by the usefulness of this little known pen scanner and the relatively low price. It indeed is an electronic highlighter.

The size of the audience had no impact on the outcome. I was immediately impressed with Jill and her stage presence but more importantly, her music. Watch Over Me is the first CD I acquired (a wonderful gift) and I have found every song to be unique, yet very high quality. I have already ordered earlier works by Jill Jack and judging by the initial sound, I won't be disappointed. Jill is an artist on the brink of stardom and I really hope she continues to write and perform. The band provides tremendous musical support for all of Jill's talents. Watch Over Me is an outstanding CD that begs to be replayed again and again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Watch Out for Jill","review":"I cannot forget the first time I saw Jill Jack perform. She opened for Pat Benatar at Pine Knob in Detroit, and her musical presence, performance and music convinced me to purchase this CD. Years later, the music still sounds as fantastic as the first time I heard it. Everyone I've turned on to this CD has thought it was great, and can't understand why she isn't tearing up the mainstream charts.The song that caught my eye was \\"Stirs My Soul\\". To me, this song is the definition of what true LOVE should be. There isn't a bad cut on this disc, but highlights include \\"Rosie\\", \\"Austin\\", and the title track (my personal favorite).While the rest of the world and music industry is concerned with image (Britney Spears, 'NSync), Jill is what music should be about.... THE MUSIC. If you want image, go find some top 40 artist to purchase.

With an unexpectedly long stay, and adventure after scary adventure, he gets more than what he set out for. He becomes a man. He becomes a broken, humble man. He surrenders his life and his fate over to the God of heaven and earth, and offers the rest of his life in service, transforming a backwards, stone-age tribe into a influential force, changing even the government that rules them. This shows an excellant example of the concept of the indiginous church and how Christianity can transform a savage culture into the most culturally, morally, and spiritually sofisticated. This book lends encouragement to those who are discouraged, hope to those who are hurting, and testimony to those who are skeptics."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome book","review":"Even though I haven't gotten a chance to read this book since it arrived a week ago, I'm giving it 5 stars because my husband got a hold of it first and read it before me and absolutely loved it, and now I've ordered the next book for him.

He is nearly killed on several occasions, suffers much and loses several friends to death including his first convert who became his best friend. A truly amazing true tale of a man led by faith alone."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a Story!!","review":"Excellent book!! I could not put it down. I went to a 3-day missions conference (10/21/01-10/23/01) and listened to Bruce Olson's story and then went and bought the book. He was an inspiration in person as well as in the book BRUCHKO. If only we Christians had the Faith and Trusting in Jesus Christ as Olson does. What a selfless man. He is around 60 years old and still lives in the Jungles of South America. He mentioned during the missions conference that he could not wait to go back, that the jungle was his home with the Motilone Indians. One thing that struck me in the book was seeing God's sovereignty in all things including the salvation thru Jesus Christ amongst a tribe of Indians who had no written language at the time of many of the first converts.

Pygmy Children is, like many other bands, not able to create their own style but instead follow another bands's style stmes to the extent of copying. Some of them, however, make it good anyway: Mentallo and the Fixer, for example. But Pygmy Children is, IMHO, a band lacking interesting ideas; ok they have at hand good electronic devices and so their sound is magnificent; but they don't add any interestng thing FLA has not made before.

The authors spent a lot of time circling around what the concept of trust isn't (a field, unconscious, etc...), even as they continually assert that it is purely dynamic process and not content or 'stuff', and that it only lives in relationships. Then why not more examples and stories about trust itself? The authors seem to be trying to convince themselves that trust can't be defined, or reified, even as they assert their expertise as to its philosophical and conceptual nature. The book added very little to my own evolving sense of the importance of openness and conscious trusting, and I didn't feel the authors trusted me as a reader.It seems the distinction of talking about trusting experiences and talking about trust as a concept got lost, and I question the value of purely making (tangled) assertions about the concept as an entry into the conversation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drudgery to read","review":"I was required to read it and participate in a discussion about it for an important class I'm taking which is why I read and actually did manage (barely) to complete this book.In my opinion, the book could have been written in ONE single chapter.

The aroma and physical qualities are well tended to. I am an experienced wet shaver for over fifty years and am used to decent glycerin based soap pucks, whether Col Conk brand or the generic types that are sold for about a dollar each from Atlanta Barber Supply. I experienced my first shave with Tabac using an open comb razor and an ASTRA DE Blade that had already been in service five times. With the thick, protective, slick lather that Tabac provided, the used Astra blade felt like it had just been unwrapped new for the first time. I am sure that anyone who knows how to work up a proper lather will not be disappointed in this Quality Shave Soap. Worth every dollar...."},{"rating":"2","title":"One great soap!","review":"Most of the soaps I have are less expensive than Tabac. I added this soap to another order on a whim. i remember opening the box and taking the lid off the bowl for the first time. The soap gave off a rich smelling scent that just wanted to be tried. When I did get to try it, my brush produced this rich, sweet smelling thick lather in what seemed to be very little time time. Enough adjectives! This is one great soap. Smells good and shaves even better. Get it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great, no-frills consistant performer.","review":"Great scent, doesn't linger much, the lather is copious, verrrry slippery and quite hydrating -- drys out slower than, for example, Taylor of Old Bond Street sandalwood. The white ceramic tub is a very nice touch, and has a clean, modern, almost bauhaus, very German design (while the English soaps come in an Olde World, Distinguished-Gentleman kind of container.)

The high waist kept sliding down, too; I had to tuck it under my bra to make it stay up.

THE STORIES OF EVA LUNA did not appear on the USA Today top 150 best sellers list, although four of the author's novels have appeared on that list.THE STORIES OF EVA LUNA is a collection of 23 short stories set in a fictional Caribbean country. Written in the style of magical realism, these are tales about the lives, loves and lovemaking of impoverished but hearty folks, including bandits, scoundrels and prostitutes, who confront cruelty, misfortune or death.Although only six of the stories incorporate the characters and events in Allende's novel EVA LUNA, they do constitute a sequel of sorts, especially the final story. For an overall richer experience, read EVA LUNA first."},{"rating":"1","title":"2nd rate Allende","review":"Alas, while the book entitled \\"Eva Luna\\" was a well-written and interesting, the same cannot be said of the \\"Stories\\" which lack characters, plausibility, and even plot at times.

It is perfect for those who love Isabel Allende and have read all her novels................"},{"rating":"1","title":"Magical realism done badly","review":"Allende's book covers often gave me the impression that they were full of syrupy, sepia-toned impressions of Latin American life. I finally decided to read her when I found this book on bargain, though, and I can't say I my first impression was wrong. Unlike Marquez or Rushdie, she seems to insert elements of fantasy into her work just to be cute and fey. Her characters seem other-worldly in their simplicity. And the Latin America that her characters inhabit is a sanitized Eden a la \\"Like Water for Chocolate\\" rather than a complex, modern society a la \\"Amores Perros.\\" If you like fairy tales for adults or if you care for sensual writing, you might like this. Otherwise stay away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great avenue to discover the magic of Allende","review":"Having never read Allende before, I found this book in my hotel room in San Diego and flying back home, I devoured it as flew home. It is a magical, intoxicating book that has allowed me to discover the wonderful world woven by the word magic of Allende.

Maybe a little tweaking of the drivers can do the trick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great until it breaks.","review":"My cousin and I both bought one of these several months back. The controller was the best I'd seen. The problem lies in a design flaw that you don't find until after several months of use. I was talking to my cousin and he told me his directional pad had broken off. I thought it was just a flue and that he'd been rough with his, but the same thing happened to mine about a month later. Apparently, the d-pad is held in place by thin plastic that gives way after awhile. Sad, considering it was such a great controller and now I'm limited to using the analog."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good","review":"The buttons and things are ok, but the most important part, the directional pad is awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Neutral","review":"I dont want to be too harsh since the controller is not really bad, but since I bought it for a driving game and it didn't work its hard to say its good either. The size is a little chunky, compared to the Sony/PS2, I just didn't like the feel; the programming is vast,flexible and in depth-I'd prefer something more short and to the point. It allowed me to program the Dpad, the analog stick or the buttons to steer, none of them worked consistently or well. I'll never buy Saitek again but I suppose if you never drive with it its ok."},{"rating":"2","title":"a good layout, but not without it's problems","review":"This controller has an excellent control layout. However, the analog controls have fairly large deadzones, and the cord is particularly short. The dpad does feel really cheap, but works fine. Unfortunately, there isn't really any other controllers out there right now with a layout like this. It works great for numerous games, from shooters like Goldeneye to platformers. However, one thing this controller is NOT good for is fighting games."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best pc game for emulation","review":"I've owned the saitek 2500 rumble and the wireless logitech rumblepad 2 in the past and this one fits my needs.For n64 emulation the rumbblepad 2 doesn't cut it because of all the buttons the n64 controller has and this one is perfect. It's also great for arcade emulation for fighting games that use 6 buttons to attack. The 4 shoulder buttons is brilliant compared to 2 on other gamepads because it allows one of them to be used for the Z-trigger for n64 emulation. The only thing it doesn't do is rumble, but there are barely any games that support it. Perfect buy for me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great feel and function","review":"This is my second Saitek product (I also own an Eclipse II back-lit keyboard). My experience with the game pad has been fantastic.It has sufficient buttons for every game I've thrown at it.The lighting ring helps with visibility when you're playing in a dark setting.I'm primarily a Mac user, so I can report that it works fine on that platform right out of the box. I run Windows on my machine, too, and the gamepad works great there, although I have not yet tried the custom software.My primary gripe is that I would have liked the main analog stick to give some tactile feedback for the up/left/right/down directions. The stick is in a squared-off enclosure, so you get feedback for when you're hitting the diagonals, but it can be tricky to maintain a constant up/left/right/down direction without a bit of drift."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best","review":"This was a gift to a hardcore gamer who plays fighting games a lot, but after a few weeks of extreme-to-the-max fighting, the D-pad snapped off. You see, the whole thing was mounted on a thin plastic stud that does not tolerate a button-masher.The buttons are also an issue. They have a solid tactile response. However, they take more energy to push than the buttons on quality controllers. This may not be noticeable with slow-down-and-think type of games, but it is very inconvenient in fast-paced fighting games.The blue light looks awesome, but the now-missing D-pad makes it look bad.To sum it up, it works, it is compatible with Windows XP, and it looks cool; OK for casual gamers, but hard-core gamers will want something better.For the record, I didn't buy it at Amazon, but it's the same thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well and inexpensive...","review":"I do most gaming on my PC but if you want to do any racing games you really need a decent gamepad.This has a plethora of buttons, always gets detected properly, and is very responsive.

The photographs were fascinating and speak volumes of the lives of these death row inmates. I was most struck by three consecutive mug shots of Frederick Wood, which illustrated the aging effect that the prison had on him over 18 years. As an investigator, I was impressed that the author was able to obtain these telling documents from Sing-Sing. The book conjures up many emotions regarding the lives and deaths of these people. The fact that some of the subjects look like they belong in most family photo albums really brings it home. The book would make a riviting museum exhibit.

It's a bit hard to read with low contrast, and the date and other complications are so small you really can't read them without looking really hard or using a magnifier.It keeps pretty good time and it's and overall handsome watch, I'm still happy with the purchase, but glad I didn't pay any more than $80.00 for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"good watch, even better price","review":"Yes it is exacly that. A great looking watch by a great brand for a very affordable price. I guess its because I expected less. But honestly so far, the watch has held up great.

And I am picky when it comes to stuff like that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fell apart within the first hour","review":"Very disappointed with this watch, one hour after I recieved it the day indicator hand fell off. I hadnt even worn the watch yet because I wasnt sure if I was going to keep it. the hand must have been loose originally. I guess you do get what you pay for. But the seller of the item was very helpful. so the 1 star rating is only for the product not the seller."},{"rating":"1","title":"No customer service","review":"Timezone123 replaced my first watch after one of the hands fell off. The second watch lasted a couple of weeks and two hands fell off. After repeated emails with no response I have given up on them.

Just wish they would back the product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad product and worse service","review":"Received the watch and 2 weeks later, the push button for dates spoilt.

We followed the directions but could not get the motor to work. After looking at the design I realized the armature winding was incorrect. The winding must go around the cork in parallel with the axis, not around the axis. Needless to say a child trying to build this would be extremely frustrated. I have a feeling the author did not build all the experiments. The lack of explanation of how the motor works is also a drawback."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not scientific, but a 'cookbook' of entertaining activities","review":"The activites in this book are enjoyable for children to perform, but there is very little science taught.My daughter very much enjoys performing the activities listed, however, I need to heavily supplement the material and description given in order to provide any scientific explaination of what she is doing. Additionally, the scientific method is completely missing from the 'experiments.' The simple activites are prsented in a \\"do it and observe\\" form, with no specific idea or result which is tested by the activity.A good book for entertaining activities, but not for teaching science."},{"rating":"1","title":"Adequate but spend a little more to get better quality","review":"Well...I've never own a babyliss but heard that it's a great brand in europe.

Too much time on the autobahn? The sickly romance of St. Petersburg's future? Lovely decadence as panacea? Although I prefer the purer ambience of releases like On Land, Thursday Afternoon, and The Shutov Assembly, I can't fault Eno for reaching again (as he always does, but in different directions each outing), but I find the vocorder cheesy, Schwalm all but extraneous, some of the guitar sounds a bit too obviously Frippish, and, in general, a bit too much use of things from the old bag of tricks. Of course, they are mostly tricks he invented, so I really can't complain. Eno's truest gift is here (again as always) in the music's ability to travel and chart a subconscious terrain, sometimes seashore, sometimes highway, sometimes cityscape, always Eno's own avant garde."},{"rating":"2","title":"Modern Techno Eno","review":"I have several Eno works in my collection and found this one to be a different twist.

Color photos come out well too.I like how it previews the page without another step so you can correct the layout. I like how it turns itself off if you forget. Somebody said that it doesn't print labels or cards, but I've done both with good results. I haven't had to replace the ink yet, but it looks expensive and haven't found clones yet.

They seem to die on me soon after the 1 year warranty is past. Printer says yellow ink tank is out when, in fact, it is full, and it's the second new tank I've tried. Every print job stalls: I have to open the cover, reset the tank and start again. I read online that soon it will die completely. Customer service suggests taking it for diagnostic review at unknown cost--closest place is 1 hour drive. And then to replace the print head would be almost as much as a new printer. This is apparently a common problem.Quality of prints was very good but I am so annoyed with the planned obsolescence on these products, especially considering how expensive it has been to keep replenishing ink tanks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seriously Flawed","review":"We have had our Pixma IP4300 for just under a year now. For the first 3 months or so everything worked great. Then we started to get error messages related to a problem with the ink tanks. Specifically the cyan ink tank. We are now on our third replacement tank and the error has just popped again. We do not print much in color so the tanks that go bad are all nearly full. The IP4300 will not print until you open the cover remove and replace the tank.According to Canon support it is not a printer problem but rather an issue with the chip installed in the tank which can go bad.Avoid this model and look at comparable Epson or HP."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy it","review":"I bought this, within a month the print head went out.Canon replaced it.Now, I have had it over a year, and it has stopped working.It says:Document printing cannot be executed because the paper output tray is closed.But the paper output tray is open.I don't know where to get it fixed, or if it is worth it.Maybe I will have to throw this one out and buy a new one.Problem is, I have bought cartridges for this unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Driving me crazy","review":"I have been battling the yellow ink cartridge from day one. It refuses to work. I have replaced it and that pesky chip still doesn't register 75% of the time so nothing will print at all. It's positively infuriating. When it does actually print it works fine- quick and clear- but it takes at least 20 minutes to get started."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Photo Printer at a Great Price","review":"This photo printer is unbelievably fast! I was used to my deskjet printer speed, but man...Literally a 5 second color photo print with photo quality.

Make sure you select the proper tray and paper in print setup the first time through!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Canon PIXMA iP4300 Printer","review":"Prints very impressive photos on photo paper. Like the dual paper sources, tray and stack feeder. Quiet and pretty fast. Easy to set up. Photo paper does not work well in the tray as it jams easily. Use the stack loader for photo paper and keep normal paper in the tray.I am using the printer with an iMac G4 Flat Panel under OS 10.4.Howard"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent all-around printer","review":"The iP4300 is super-fast on black & white text and has great quality on photos. Be sure to tell it what type of paper you are using. I mostly print high-quality graphics and text, but on occasion like to print photos at home rather than uploading them. This printer does well at both. The only con I see so far is its relatively large size and the cost of cartridges (cartridges are expensive no matter what these days...)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't print text with black only","review":"It's a nice printer--until it thinks a cartridge is low. The magenta is half-full but it says its empty. I only want to print black and white, not color, but it won't allow me to print b/2 until I replace the magenta (in other printers, you can choose to use the black and white or the color).It does a great job of printing, but pretty expensive upkeep if I have to keep replacing color cartridges so I can print black and white text."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Printing WHILE IT WORKS","review":"This printer got great reviews by consumer reporting magazine for quality printing--and they were right. Great print quality but the power board (or logic board?) almost seems programmed for obsolescence after a certain number of print cycles (google it and see) because be assured, this printer will fail to power-up after an abnormally short life-span (mine only 3 years old but then I only printed on it once or twice a week!) and then you're all done. I have HP's that are 10 years old and still going strong. I'll never buy a canon printer again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Printer at a great Price","review":"I know many of you wonder which printer to buy. I have been doing photography for almost ten years and this is the first time I have printed my own stuff. I did a lot of research and read many reviews and I must say that this printer put out high quality photos and compares very well with some of the more expensive printers based on test images I have seen printed. This printer is intended more as a photo printer than basic b/w but certainly is capable of anything. I would highly recommend you give this a shot. You won't be disappointed, I'm sure. I was also looking at the Epson R800 which is more expensive but honestly the output looks the same as the Canon 4300."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleased as Punch","review":"I bought this for the speed and for it's ability to print directly from a Pictbridge camera. It not only prints blazing fast (compared to my Epson 1200) but uses lightfast ink resulting in a signifigant leap in image stability and longevity for the prints. After connecting the camera to printer I press four buttons (on camera) and the printer does it's thing and out pops a beautiful print without ever turning on the computer! Wow! It comes with separate ink cartridges for each color plus an extra larger black I assume for the laser quality text. It also closes up nicely keeping dust out and has two separate paper feeds for two paper sizes. I likey this printer!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good picture quality but ........","review":"When the printer is used often (daily at least) the prints are very good. If the printer is left off for even a couple of days, what should be a red color begins as sort of a rust color. On another site I saw a similar comment for this printer. After some usage the red improves. To initially get good reds the nozzles must be cleaned. I have not used the printer enough to get a feel for ink usage but if cleaning is often necessary to get correct colors I do not expect this printer to be economical on ink."},{"rating":"1","title":"My first and my last Canon printer","review":"I will never buy another Canon printer. I've always had HP printers in the past and had good luck with both a laserjet and an inkjet. Then I got this piece of junk. Like other reviewers, I had problems with the ink cartridges (won't print if one is low) and the paper output tray. My only consolation was that even though I thought my Pixma was a worthless piece of junk, I got a $50 credit for it when I traded it in for a new HP printer."},{"rating":"1","title":"problems with ink cartridges in less than a year","review":"I use my printer infrequently, so my first set of ink tanks lasted about 6 months. I replaced the PGI Black cartridge (one of the 5 that this printer uses) with an authentic Canon one which cost about $16. Now the printer won't print black at all. I have cleaned and deep cleaned the print head, checked the cartridge lights, followed all instructions on the manual. All seems ok but it still won't print black text - which is the one that I use most often.When it worked, I liked the clear printing and especially the duplex printing capabilities. The cost of the cartridges and the significant failure rate of the same is really disappointing.I am ready to throw this printer out, but I worry about the landfill impact of this shoddy piece of engineering."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't live up to expectations","review":"I bought this printer because I had read good reviews on it. However, I've had it for maybe a few months. Every time I turn it on it gives me an ink error. I have to open it up and just re insert the ink cartridges for no apparent reason. There is nothing wrong and it just keeps doing it. Sometimes even when I leave it on it does it at random times.I also think it is stupid that I could buy a brand new printer with a full set of ink for less than it cost me to replace the ink in the printer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Photographic Loser","review":"I generally don't write reviews unless my experience is very good, or very bad. In this case, it was very bad. The quality of a printed photograph is horrible. I tried it both from a Win XP machine and my MacBook running OS X. In both cases...bad bad bad. Maybe I got a lemon? I'm tossing it into the garbage and buying an HP. There is no reason to keep a bad printer since they are virtually free with the initial supply of ink."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still have not received product","review":"Terrible!

I did not get a USB cable with the printer so I called and was told they could not send me a USB cable that they had to send another printer. I was assured that they would check the contents to be sure it was included. I got the next printer again without the USB cable (the printer is useless without the cable to hook it up to the computer). Since I do not want to be shipping back multiple printers I gave up trying to get a USB cable sent to me. I had to go to Best Buy to purchase a USB cable to use this printer and it cost me $35.00, guess this is why they are missing from the boxes."},{"rating":"1","title":"dead as warranty expires","review":"Bought this expensive printer from Consumer Reports approval rating.

But unfortunately I must have gotten one of the rare lemons. The magenta ink cartridge did not work after only two printings. So I bought a new cartridge, and it still didn't work. Tech support was very helpful, but couldn't get the printer to work, so they told me I could take the printer to a local repair shop (one hour each way) or I can receive a re-furbished printer as a trade out. Not exactly what I wanted, a full month's time with no printer, and a used one in replacement, but really, what can you expect for $100? Not much, I'm afraid. We'll see how this replacement works.

This is my first Canon Pixma and I admit the color is really accurate. For the first time I don't have to deal with too much ink on the page or colors that don't appear as they do on my monitor or in real life. The printer hibernates all by itself which I like, so if I'm not using it for a week or so, I don't have to remember to shut it off as I do with the other printers. I've had great luck with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Consumer Reports was right","review":"This printer was one of the highly rated by Consumer Reports. I am impressed by: a) ease of installation with Windows XP; b) speed of printing text and graphics; and c) separate ink cartridges for every color. This is definitely a money saving feature, as one does not have to discard the whole cartridge because one of the colors is gone. In addition, printer does do justice to pictures (after all, it is a photo printer...). If I compare it to my old Epson Stylus Photo 875 DCS, I see about 50% better output by Canon. Overall, 5 stars for good quality machine, 5 stars for ease of installation."},{"rating":"2","title":"love my new printer","review":"I am very happy with my new Canon Pixma IP4300 printer. I especially like the feature that automatically turns the printer on if I send a print job to it. It also turns itself back off, which means I don't go off and forget I left it on. The photos I printed looked much better than my previous printer. On the glossy photo paper, the black was glossy also.

His perspective in not new; he just seemed to rename concepts that I already know. His layout of each chapter was difficult to read. He would combine the concept, the introduction and examples in one paragraph. I prefer to read numerology books that have a breakdown with the chapter stating a concept, introducing the concept, then show where to get the math and doing the math, show one or two examples, and finally show what each number means in that concept. His number definitions were good but it was too much work trying to figure out which concept he was working with. I would recommend Numerology: The Romance in Your Name by Judy Juno is a great introduction book for those who want to get started. OR Numerology has your Number by Ellen Dodge is another good one.I have many more, but these ones are books every numerologist should own or start with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Double Digit Information","review":"Unlike other numerology books this book focused a lot of attention on the double digit before reducing to the single digit. The information gleaned from this process was very informative and interesting. In fact I felt it was one of the most informative books on the subject that I have read.The reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is the way numbers are used for prediction. If you were born with a 3 birth path why do you become your birth month + birth date + whatever the year is? In my opinion (and what seems to make more sense) if your path is a 3 (and to stay on that path) you need to add 3 + the current year = peresonal year(x), x + current month = personal month (y), y + the current day = personal day. You are the number you were born with. The date of the year you were born is part of what you are. Why is that left behind when configuring numbers in prediction? It works, try it. I would love to read a book with this type of prediction. Open to recommendations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forget it!","review":"I am very concerned with the other high ratings.

One thing I really like about this bar is the smell of lemon. It does smell like pinesol but in a good way. The only con I can find in this soap is that it doesn't mention the ingredients. I have sensitive skin (I react to almost everything). For me it is important to know what I apply to my skin.

If you have oily skin then this is the soap for you. What is great about it is that it isn't soap at all. It doesn't contain the bad things that regular soap contains. That means it won't clog your pores or dry your skin out too much. It's low PH also supports your skin's natural defense against bacteria. But it won't sting your eyes.

In these albums, they sound like your average ska band, which attracted ska fanatics. However, many of them were turned off by this album. Why? Because the tunes in this recording has lost many of the key elements of ska, such as the chinky off-beat guitar which occurs only occasionally in this album, and also what happened to the horn solos? These and other factors have led me to believe that Buck O Nine is slowly edging towards pop rock and away from ska, somewhat comparable to No Doubt (Only they did it quicklier). I liked this album better than any other ska CD I have heard, and some pop rock minded listeners may enjoy it also, but die-hard ska fans are going to find something missing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Great Great","review":"All you have to do is listen to \\"Tell it like was\\" and \\"swimming in sand\\" and you will love this album.

So Libido brings a more relaxed mood to your speakers...with a reggae/rock/ska mix BuckO9 shows there expeirence and eclectic range of music. Libido in my eyes will always be looked at a nice \\"icing on the cake\\" to a group of awesome guys and wonderful musicians who have reached the top and are enjoying the view."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to Buck-O-Nine?","review":"This album is complete trash. It sounds exactly like their old stuff minus all the good parts. This CD is one of the biggest disappointments I've ever bought. Save your money or pick up Barfly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big band sound with a youthful theme","review":"The bands album is a cross between big band brass sound music mixed with a youthful theme. The music can cross over the generation gap. I am in my late 40's and liked the music. I really liked the sound tracks #1 & #13. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys the big sound and some interesting lyrics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buck O Nine trying to reach a larger audience - they lost me","review":"Libido is a lame attempt to disseminate the band from the deluge of ska. Gone is the fast, fun, edgy BON. Enter the bland watered down ready for mainstream radio BON. With the exception on Falling Back to Sleep and maybe Who are they the rest can go into pop music oblivion. Time to put on the old stuff and remember when......."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Speakers, Great Deal","review":"The foam around the woofers of my 6\\" Cerwin-Vega bookshelf speakers (purchased in 1998 (deteriorated, so I decided to repair them and also upgrade to the larger CLS-10 speakers. I wanted to stay loyal to Cerwin-Vega since my little speakers sounded so great for so long. (They still sound great, now that they are repaired.) I have been really impressed with the CLS-10 speakers. They sound great, were not very expensive, and really rock."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I have previously had Cerwin Vegas and was very pleased. However after trying these CLS-10's I was totally disappointed. The highs were tingy and NO midrange was evident. No music other than a rumble came from the lower speakers. I determined that this had to be a defect in both speakers and returned them. Five stars for Amazon customer support!Ordered a pair of Bose 301's and they are WONDERFUL!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Have I Been Here Before?","review":"Maybe I shrunk from even attempting to put any words to what I feel about this band, and this album. But here I am again, and the second glorious disc is playing in my ears. No one I've heard has said what M. Gira has said in the way he has said it. The lyrics alone are enough to keep them on the map of great artists forever. They used to be even more stark, but the band took a little turn toward the elegant, which worked extremely well. You can definitely hear the words with this one w/o going to the lyrics sheet. But go there anyway -- there's something about seeing them that brings home that stark poetry, makes you unable to believe anyone's really gone there, into that void, that submission to reality. Yes, it's a \\"time now gone,\\" but I am in Swans' debt for their cathartic expression, one capable of helping people everywhere.Yeah, something like that..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beware the list of tracks","review":"I bought this in December, 2012. \\"Can't Find My Way Home\\", \\"Love Will Tear Us Apart\\", & \\"New Mind (Acoustic)\\" are not on Disc 2 as this site claims.

The book is made out to be a bio of John Pershing but in the 331 pages of this book you couldent fill 25 with information directly about Pershing. This book is mostly a history of the times Persing lives with little about the man himself.

They're definitely more expensive than the cheapest brand but they seem to hold up well. I went for this large count size (72) because it's amazing how often a ball gets accidentally stepped on, paddle-smushed, or buried in all the junk in our garage where we play.

I personally bounced each ball and served it into the machine's reservoir; all 72 balls bounced evenly.I purchased the balls directly from Amazon both times, perhaps this is the reason for the inconsistent reviews?

Cleopatra Records, rather than mastering the CD from the master tapes, decided it would be a good idea to master the CD from an old vinyl copy from their personal collection. The sound quality, overall, is poor, and the stereo separation is off dramatically. If you really want this album, search out the Japanese 2CD, typically referred to as \\"Force the Hands of Chants,\\" which also contains the \\"Themes 1\\" album. This was actually mastered from the original tapes and is crisp in quality. Also watch out for the Cleopatra reissues of Kraftwerk records, as they were mastered in the same fashion, and I would not be surprised if other \\"classic\\" reissues from Cleopatra (Hawkwind, Syd Barrett, etc.) were done in the same way."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS VERSION","review":"This version is almost as much of a complete waste of money as the Cleopatra version. It's mis-labeled. CD 2 is NOT THEMES. CD 2 is a disc of bonus stuff that was ON the Cleopatra version, simply added as a bonus CD and priced higher than a single CD set would be. I call shenanigans on Stevo for doing such a rotten reissue. The double digipack is chintzy, the artwork is ruined by unnecessary text and the back is so poorly photocopied. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. Find the Japanese double CD version if you can."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pablum","review":"The pieces all lack any \\"edge,\\" and ,therefore, the music often seems wearyingly sentimental and saccharine."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't like it","review":"I bought this cd as a fan of John Barry's melodies but there are only two or three melodies that I liked from this album.I did'n like how the electric guitar sounds at the last part of the last theme.I think his album \\"Eternal Echoes\\" is much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely worth it if you are a Barry fan","review":"John Barry, who was made famous many years ago for striking themes like James Bond, has been one of the most spiritual and romantic composers during his latter years. His music is quite soothing and really speaks to the soul if you're heart is open. I think it's great that he can release original music that isn't pinned to a movie score. This collection is very good, though I think there is too much harmonica recorded throughout the cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Barry Sans Film","review":"This is another beautiful score by John Barry, but it's not from a film. Instead, it is a suite of very lush, lyrical, little pieces, not hampered by attachment to the presentation of a particular film. If you like John Barry film scores, you'll love these compositions."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best","review":"This ep is awesome, although there are only 3 songs it is well worth buying.

The layout is awful, poor examples, everything about it is awful. You can't even find any definitions or terms. If any definitions are given they are at the end of the section and don't expect them to be bold like most textbooks. The actual text is very dense and is organized poorly. Professors, please don't make your students use this textbook. The won't enjoy the class or get anything out of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING!","review":"I am currently in a MAT program.

The book has inadequate explanations - all too open ended for my taste, dry writing, and hard to decipher language. It says so much, while saying nothing at all! As if the field of assessment and testing wasn't dry enough, along comes Linn, ready to make it even worse. There has got to be a better book! Needless to say, I relied on the i-net for supplementary information to our class lectures. I did not crack this book once beyond the intro chapter!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I never want to see this book again!","review":"This book was used for an assessment class I took at TN Techological University. I'm sure the authors did not mean to, but the book is very dry and hard to read at times. However it gets easier the farther along you get. The sections with sample test questions were useful. Everyone in my class complained about this book. Our instructor used notes and powerpoints from other texts to supplement. I definately do not recommend this title."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written and difficult to comprehend","review":"My classmates and professor all agree that this book is horribly written and incredibly difficult for a non-expert to sift through and comprehend. The authors contradict each other continually and the specific ideas in the book are not well explained. I cannot imagine that there is not another text out there on the subject that is more well-written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont buy it!","review":"To add the chorus of negative views on this very bad textbook would probably be redundant, but I advise other readers not to buy it even if it's required for a class. It is a completely obfuscating and redundant text. You'd actually be better off not reading it and getting the information somewhere else where you can achieve an understanding of the subject matter, because you won't get it here. This book seems to be made with two ideas in mind: a) make it as long as possible, so it can be as thick and expensive as possible and b) make simple concepts difficult to understand thereby forcing students to buy it to understand it. So Don't be fooled!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What A Waste.","review":"Wow, this is a horrible book. I don't need to go into detail as many of the other reviewers have already explained, but this is quite possibly the worst book I have ever been forced to read. If you don't absolutely have to read this book...don't.The only saving grace for the book is the summary at the end of each chapter. They really contain all the information you would need in regards to the material. I feel like they just tried as hard as possible to bloat the chapters with meaningless content to make the book bigger because they couldn't make a full textbook out of the summaries alone.Avoid this if you can."},{"rating":"1","title":"Puts me to sleep","review":"I hate this book. I wish I had a say in what book to use for class, but this was required reading. It was so dry and boring, full of statistics-type language, no interesting graphics. The few text boxes they had were often irrelevant or confusing. As a future teaching, the entire Part I (chapters 1-5) were essentially useless to me. I wish they would have less theory and more practical applications for the average teacher. I don't feel like I learned much here."},{"rating":"1","title":"what happend???","review":"The overall series of sailor moon novels were okay. They were at times very childish. All so, there were parts in it that were from the japanesse series of sailor moon, no the american one.But the main reason for me to five the book such a low rating, was that the author stoped at this book. There are more sailor moon novels after this. I found this horrible when sailor jupitor was just about to be introduced. Maybe the author was lazy and tired of sailor moon, either way we will never know."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very interesting.","review":"This was a very interesting book. I liked it a lot.

It's NOT anywhere close to the manga (which is the BEST!), but it's better than that \\"Meet Sailor Moon\\" book that has 15 pages.

I recommend that if anyone is a fan of catchy emocore/indie rock music to pick this up immediately!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolute Brilliance","review":"One of the main reasons I absolutely adore Psychic(k) TV is the inability to classify their style of music. Whether it be pop, rock, industrial, experimental (one album consists in aprox. 40 minutes of overlays of a wolf growling), spoken word, ambience or acid house, this band consistently strove to surprise and expand the minds of their listeners like no other. Trip Reset is another fine example of the bands creativity, delivering a fine mix of sunny pop, foreboding drone, spoken word (an eerie tale of a girl's frightening insight to her mother's murderous intentions), and ethereal hypnotic ambience. Trip Reset is one of the finest examples of PTV's ability to cross myriad musical structures and moods."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality","review":"This item may be considered a good value but is certainly not good quality.

Like all BBC productions from 70s, it is cheaply made, though probably exact on the details, but stagebound, in that it's all set in rooms, the set decor really nice, but somewhat claustrophic. Cheap/regular video rather than film. Makes it look sketchy on screen instead of precise. I don't find the lead character to be that interesting. Though it is still a cozy mystery (takes place betw the two World Wars) it is excessively talky, the actors physically plain, sometimes irritating, and lacking in charm. Makes it more REAL that way, but less FUN. It's nice to see something NEW, but at the same time, if given a choice between seeing again my least favorite Midsomer ep or any Miss Marple or Poirot or one of the lesser-known sleuths, or watching one of these Wimsey's, I wouldn't be grabbing for Lord Peter."},{"rating":"2","title":"The bible regarding nose reconstruction","review":"Burget and Menick's book is indispensible to anyone who takes care of complex nasal deformitities.

It looks okay, though if it wasn't advertised as \\"Squall's Gunblade\\" then there'd be little way to tell since there's no markings on it like he has in FF8 to really make it clear and it has a weird hook-like curve to it at the tip of the blade. The part that has the Griever chain (the one thing that on this Gunblade that lets us know it's Squalls) fell off after a few months - and this was with it just sitting on a shelf. The swordis not durable at all, and if you do ever have to move it more than a few times then expect to regret it.If you want a cool-looking sword, which I do agree that it is, and never plan on touching it... ever, and don't mind that it doesn't really look like Squalls, then go for this. Otherwise, you may want to look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"Peach Girl is unique from many other manga series I've read, simply because it doesn't seem like a manga. Unlike \\"Sailor Moon\\", \\"Ayashi No Ceres\\", and \\"Magic Knight Rayearth\\", there is nothing supernatural about Momo. Momo is...well, just a regular teen, struggling to make her way through high school. And there aren't any superhero's or cross-dimensional jumps being made by anyone around her, either.\\"Peach Girl\\" brings the high school scene to life in a startling portrait of cliques, self esteem and love. The characters are vibrantly real and easy to identify with and become attached to. Sae is a wonderful protagonist, the kind of person that raises conflicting emotions in the reader. Momo's sweetness of character, her motivation and drive, and her insecurities will leave readers begging for more.This series shoots right at the core of common teenage experiences and hits home with stunning artwork and dazzling plot twists. No reader will be dissapointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow, ok so Im impressed!","review":"Alright, i was introduced to this series by a firend...i took one look at it and went, \\"bleh\\" but after reading this volume, I've been hooked. You get a very strong connection with Momo as you read...and every time Sae opens her big mouth, oh i want to smack her upside the head as much as momo does....definitely good, and not some (no offense) idiotic, far fetched, futuristic superhero manga."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best!","review":"ok, this is one of the best mangas ive ever read.

Weak characters with 'watered-down' emotions.

The main character, Harry, is so domineering and dismissive of everything good and wonderful about Augusta. That never changed - not even in the end. Harry may as well have been a member of the Taliban and Augusta, an entirely repressed and dismissed woman. Was so sad to watch this vivacious, full-of-life woman be reduced to nothing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rendezvous -- A definite keeper","review":"I found this book very enjoyable. Augusta is a heroine that succeeds in keeping her determination and spirit throughout the book, and Harry was a very dashing hero, if a bit boring. Amanda Quick writes her characters very well, because they are neither flat or one-dimensional.\\"Rendezvous\\" is a heartwarming read with an element of spy mystery. I'd recommend this book to any fan of Ms. Quick or Historical Romances."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well-Done!","review":"This book is, perhaps, one of the best researched books about the life of Mae West. Yes, some readers (fans of Mae) may be offended by the author alluding to West's black heritage. But, as Mae West showed us, her ethnic identity was more complex than who her parents or grandparents were. The important thing is not that West was white or black, but that she personally identified with the culture of black people in America. What matters is that the author has intelligently revealed this aspect about Mae West, whose life time achievement was tricking us all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What It's Cracked Up To Be","review":"I have read a lot of Mae West books. Obviously, that means I am a Mae West fan--and a big one. I found this book difficult to read, what I mean is-difficult to finish. It is boring, long-winded and the author seems to feel Mae had black roots. This is the writer's whole theme, and it is just groundless. On and on and on...enough already. This bio of Mae adds nothing to earlier works."},{"rating":"1","title":"OH, NO! EVEN MAE WEST IS POLITICALLY CORRECT","review":"Well folks, here we go again! Let's take a unique, popular icon -- an uneducated (in the book learning sense) woman who stood up for herself and blazed a new path in show biz -- created an indelible character that is still universally recognizable more than twenty years after her death -- and probably did as much for good ole 'woman's lib' as all the modern feminist combined -- Let's take an accomplished comedienne whose better movies to this day can ilicit genuine laughter and whose basic style and mastery of nuance were second to none ---BUT, let's not be satisfied until we expend thousands of recurring words in a hackneyed attempt to prove that Mae West was Black! Good, Lord, who cares?! Go rent a Mae West movie and you'll learn more about Mae West (and have a far better time at it) than this awful, misguided, pneumatic attempt at scholorship. Get a life Ms. Watts!"},{"rating":"2","title":"YES, AN ICON!","review":"When you tell the truth, people will be angry. Yes it is true that there is no real proof about Mae West, but I have had people insist that I had caucasian blood in my family tree. I look in the mirror from time to time and wonder why this was but I am now starting to see it to a degree. It is not that this or that person have this or that blood, but the truth is that we are made of one blood. That is the unique thing about the human race.I hope that this book becomes a #one saler to help people understand the genome project. I did not purchase this book to read about Mae West's genetic make-up, but to learn more about her fantastic mystical style!There is one thing that bothers me. Her movies tend to show racial inequalities. But this is the characteristic of 30's movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Good Example of Biography","review":"The book, Mae West, An Icon in Black and White, was one of the worst biographies I have read in recent memory. The whole premise of the book is that Mae West's grandfather may have been black. There is not a lot of proof given, just conjecture. Just because Mae was friends with Bert Williams and he visited her home, and that Mae enjoyed jazz, doesn't make her black. People of different ethnicities can enjoy many features of the culture of other ethnicities but they don't have to be of that ethnicity to enjoy it! You don't learn a lot about Mae the person from this book. Everything is discussed in racial overtones. There has to be some other books out there on Mae that will give folks a better idea of what she was like as a person."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I'll agree with the lid being a challenge to get on and off.

Not the routine itself, which was very easy to follow but the voice-over narration and the narrator.As I have a slight hearing difficulty, I found it difficult to hear what was being said... unless I play it really LOUD and then it would be too distracting to practice. Add to that, the narrator likes to \\"stretch\\" certain words to emphasise them such as \\"sweeeeeeeeep\\" your hands \\"aalllllll\\" (all) the way \\"doowwwnnn\\" (down)..... in an almost melodic tone.I guess this is what is meant by \\"gentle\\" voice but the style of narration simply did not suit me."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 of: Yoga: Gentle Vinyasa Flow (Used - Very Good)","review":"Vinyasa flow to fast in it.I do like long stretch,and with this DVD I have no Good stretch at all!!!So fast all the way,this DVD!!!! :("},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD does not work.","review":"DVD is faulty.

The plot was so ridiculous, I knew exactly what was going to happen at the end. It was very predictable. Truthfully, I was bored from the first page. I think that the reason why it was so bad was because it was her first book. Hopefully she will step up her game on the next one, because I love a good love story.

This is a definate must have!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"How bad can it be?","review":"It can be and is bad. A long time fan of crime drama, I purchased Silk Stalkings as for viewing with exercise. I have had it for months and haven't been able to get past first two episodes. Dialogue is pure drivel. The producers clearly thought a couple of pretty faces and short skirts would distract from the terrible acting. No one is that good-looking and the wardrobe it would take to carry this show has yet to be designed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perhaps, a mistake is being made","review":"I'm not sure, but perhaps they mean that Season Six is being released this March. They seem to get so many things wrong....like putting Mimi Kapture and Rob Estes name with Season Six or vice versa, putting Janet Gunn and Chris Potter's names with Season One, even though they are not in that season.....I am hoping they mean that season six is being released finally!! Trying to remain optimistic...even though its hard since they have seemed to take forever.

The TV series probably still wouldn't make it over the free air, still relegated to special pay channels. The action is good. The plots are good. Frequently you know the culprit instantly, however, proving who committed the crime is almost impossible. Definitely worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Rich, sexy and decadent\\"","review":"I watched \\"Silk Stalkings\\" when it first aired and I never missed an episode. It is a crime drama set in Palm Beach, Florida. Palm Beach, a place where the rich and beautiful have a different set of rules and if you like provocative and fun, you'd enjoy this show.The show is like \\"chocolate\\". It is sweet, delicious and decadent; you know it is probably bad for you but you keep endulging.I have purchased all five seasons of \\"Silk Stalkings\\" for my library and I recommend this series. Keep in mind that season 5 has dramatic surprises and changes.For a show that takes you to a world of the rich, sexy and dangerous-it is another winner created by Stephen J. Cannell.

It was so bad I couldn't watch it. We have ordered many DVDs from Amazon.com but this is the first one we've ever received of such horrid quality. My husband says he'll keep it and watch it for only $8. But I am very skeptical and will probably not order any more DVD's from Amazon any more because of it. I personally would like to have a replacement. I feel cheated out of $8"},{"rating":"1","title":"So Ridiculous","review":"This is the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen--this season is already available for sale, as are the first five seasons of the show. But now Mill Creek Ent. is going to release five seasons that are already on DVD before they release the seasons that haven't been released on DVD, namely seasons 6, 7, and 8. The logic of this move escapes me. Unless the picture quality is better and there are many good special features, there's no reason to buy this set in favor of the other one. Will someone just please release seasons 6, 7 and 8? We've already been waiting six years since the first season came out in 2004--now are we supposed to wait another six years for the unreleased seasons just so this company can start the sequence over again starting at season 1?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nostalgia","review":"I especially like the shows from the 80\`s and 90\`s so I am always looking what's on DVD, I've been wanting this series and now I am on my way collecting it, season by season.

I loved the song and went out and bought the album the next day. The album is very, very good .. I have heard Lagwagon before from a Fat Wreck Chords compilation and essentially knew what kind of music they played, but I didn't expect the emotional melody I got from some of the songs, especially tracks 2, 5, and 11. This is a definite good buy .. You won't be sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best lagwagon, No matter what anybody says!!","review":"This cd is amazing.

It also comes with a very small potty for the baby, and i have seen bigger \\"more sturdy\\" ones out there. I am going to buy another one that TALKS and says \\"mommy, pee-pee\\" and it is magnetic on the babies back and on the potty, so it only pee's when the baby touches the potty.Seriously, dont waste your 10.00.

We were hoping we would get a good deal on a doll that would introduce our son to the idea of potty training, let me say, you really get what you pay for.First we noticed it was impossible not over-fill the dolls mouth, causing water to drip/leak everywhere. Forget trying to get the underwear off. They were stuck in the legs and practically impossible to remove. I have yet to get them back on, which is even more pathetic. Part of teaching is showing the child that underwear/clothing needs to be removed. The difficulty of this dolls clothing makes you want to just leave it nude from the bottom down.

There was almost none, perhaps because the authors have not been in that situation. Other books about the Christian perspective on sex in general have addressed that issue more fully than this one devoted to \\"the consequences of premarital relationships,\\" so I was pretty disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of time","review":"When I began reading this book I was unaware that it was the third in the series and by the end of it was glad I hadn't bothered to purchase the first two. There is nothing arousing about this book, just gallons of come (literally!). The book is about 3 sisters who are trapped in a German schloss of a half mad, half genius man (according to the back cover). The writing is really annoying with sisters repeating themselves in a rythmn which I gathered was intentional but I found quite pointless. The supermarket scene was just sick (and I like my books weird!). The sisters are forced to eat products made out of their milk, mushrooms grown in their own excrement at a table decorated with orchids grown up a certain orifice. The sex scenes are brief (2) and if you don't like sister involved with incestuous spanking give this a miss. The ending was left open to allow for another book and all I can say is to the author - don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"AVOID THIS PRODUCT","review":"This product clams to be compatible with the Epson Stylus printer, but THEY ARE NOT.

And, yes, I installed it properly and tested it several times by going back and forth between it and the earlier Epson cartridge I was ready to replace (it still had a little bit of ink left in it). Every time I put the Nectron into the printer she makes a loud clunking noise during startup and the red \\"error\\" light goes on.

He seems to only get better! Destiny didn't disappoint me. I love Jim's piano, but he seems to have the right mix of songs with lyrics and songs with just piano. He has a wonderful knack, too, for getting the best performers to sing his lyrics. In concert, I was surprised and pleased to hear Jim sing. He was terrific. His music is wonderful and Destiny brought that home to me once again!

After giving this a couple of listens, I keep wondering what all the fuss is. This is pretty much like Kenny G piano style - something this world does NOT need! The biggest crime on this record is the song \\"Rendevouz\\", which features Herb Alpert. Alpert gets buried in the mix a lot of times, and just plays the melody over and over and over. It would have been nice to let Alpert cut loose a jazz solo. I found the vocals annoying, which is a shame since I like Carly Simon. I suppose the wine-and-cheese crowd will like this, but this music lover will only play this CD when insomnia strikes!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jim Brickman is an excellent musician, his work is awesome.","review":"My cousin recently used the song \\"Your Love\\" at her wedding.

I work at a gift store that sells this album, and blows have almost ensued over playing it. It is vapid, asinine, torpid, pop-trash. There is nothing of any real musical substance here. If you like piano, check out Robin Spielberg or the classics like Mozart and Beethoven. FOR THE LOVE OF GOD DON'T BUY THIS!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you have about 10$ that you don't need.

I can see why the donator gave it to the library. The CD is too generic when it comes to New Age music. Most of the instruments sound authentic (nothing too synthetic) but the music itself sounds cliché' and inside the cd cover the insert pops out to a poster of Jim. With the way this product is marketed I find it makes Jim appear egotistical and cocky (if that truly is the case). There isn't a wide arrangement of instruments, I know that it's trying to sell as a piano featured CD, but without a variety of instruments almost all the songs sound the same (and even in similar keys). Personally I find it boring to listen to, but I know that others would enjoy this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD : A must have","review":"This is another wonderful Cd by Jim Brickman.

I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A More Mature Work","review":"This CD is a departure from his earlier works in what I think is a good direction. Jim had become comfortable with his style of music, and is beginning to put some daring moments into his CD. Rendezvous is a perfect example of this, as are the plethora of vocals. Overall, he is starting to branch out of his earlier box into more areas. Songs like Crossroads and Part of my Heart still carry the sweeping melodies of his earlier work, but other, more subtle works such as Bittersweet work our ways into new parts. I do wich, though, that some of the \\"This is garbage. throw it away\\" reviews colud be thrown out, as they pull down the average review on this excellent CD, and aren't even a valid review. If they were, that would be one thing, but those do nothing but show potential buyers a lower average review."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Skirt","review":"This is a really pretty, flattering skirt on and gets lots of compliments.

However, these studies are not referenced in the book so you can not look them up to find out their validity. More important, doses are not mentioned AT ALL. There is no discussion about the dangers of combining any of the medicines or interactions with prescription drugs that some people may be taking. There are far better books on this subject.

And after shopping around there weren't any sets that even came close to this kit. I did some modification to the original plan because I wanted steps instead of the ladder. My dad and I built it in one day. We also added a shaded cover for the slide area and added a steering wheel prior to the slide, and after my daughter dove face first off the slide we added in a safety rail. When all was said and done the total project cost about $560. In my opinion it was better than the kits that cost $700-$800."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome! Terrific Advice. Great Writing","review":"I've learned from the Rinpoche, now I'm learning from his son. When I encountered Chogyam Trungpa many years ago, he figuratively slapped me in the face. And the cocky, ignorant me at the time deserved the wake-up slapping (and deeply appreciated it). Just a few days ago, I met his son Sakyong Mipham through his latest book. You could imagine Mipham took my hand, led me to the couch, sat next to me, and gently told this old me some more about the wonderful Buddhist wisdom in ways that are both timely and timeless. His expositions of Dharma are effective, yet very few technical terms are used. His explanations are modern and relevant. His persistent, yet loving, effort in helping us break through the illusion of the self pays off quite nicely. Mipham's previous book, Turning The Mind Into An Ally, is great, too, but I find his current one accessible to a broader audience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple, Profound...I'm Reading it Again!","review":"I read a great deal, but it's only one out of a hundred books that I'll read again within a month after the first reading and this is one of them. The concepts explained by Sakyong Mipham have so much relevance in our world today and those concepts are communicated with a breadth and depth that is at once simple and unfathomable. If you're looking for a thousand different steps on the path towards enlightenment, this isn't the book for you. If you are tired of struggling to hold onto power that is both elusive and insubstantial, take a look at this book. You won't be disappointed. Simple Breathing Meditation, Thought Exercises and Compassion will change your life for the better."},{"rating":"2","title":"down-to-earth spiritual advice","review":"This book is the second book by Sakyong Mipham Rinpoche - known as a Tibetan lama with Western upbringing, education and habits (he runs marathon and plays golf, is newly-wed but also represents the ancient Tibetan tradition of Shambhala in Tibet as well as in the West, thus providing a bridge between two worlds in more than one sense.This book contains practical advice for leading a meaningful and succesful life in East or West, using meditation as a way to overcome the difficulties in daily life - without having to give up our daily activities or go monastic. It clearly states the losing battle against adversity and death we all fight, and are bound to lose - and provides a straight way into a quite different view. To me, it seems he gives the only logical solutions to present predicaments in our personal life and society as a whole. If all people (or even only the well-intentioned) would take this advice really to heart, the world would be a better place."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Lineage of Shambhala From Father to Son","review":"The son of Chogyam Trungpa Rinpoche, Sakyong Mipham who is the lineage holder for the Shambhala world his father revealed, is able to freshly express this royal path. The \\"crazy wisdom\\" taste of Trungpa isn't here but is wonderfully matched by the gentle, loving and compassionate clarity of the Sakyong. This is a short book that is very easy to read and reflect upon. The chapters are short and to the point. There are glimpses of the writer and his life which make this very human and real. Shambhala, windhorse and the dralas are meant to inspire and this book does that. Although it's simple and clear, it bears rereading and studying. It makes this reader look forward to future teachings of the writer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pragmatic understanding of our power within","review":"RULING YOUR WORLD is an unintrusive, practical, and heart-warming modern treatment that gently bridges ancient Buddhist philosophy with our modern world -- a world that is seeing historic discontent and unhappiness, tens of millions every year taking doctor prescribed anti-depressants, and struggling economic and financial hardships.The title, RULING YOUR WORLD, might imply how you can become the ruler of our world -- this is not the book's intent, which you quickly learn. YOUR world consists of the space between your years; your heartfelt capacities to live, give, and help others; and embracing all of your talents, traits, capacities, interests, hobbies, and so on to become a \\"ruler\\" of your life.This book is also a valuable introduction to those interested in Tibetan traditions like Shambhala Buddhism and Tibetan Sanskrit language."},{"rating":"1","title":"Understanding your world should come first.","review":"Ruling without sufficient understanding has led to enormous difficulties in human history.If we truly understood our world, and wanted to help it and the people in it -- then developing intelligent networks would make more sense than creating authoritarian hierarchies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, couldn't be better!","review":"The book is very clean.

After all, what were you expecting from such a great title as \\"Environmental Land Use Planning and Management\\"?

Thankfully, I recognized the fact that this book is completly worthless and I litereally gave the book to a friend, who did not have one at the last minute. This is the worst review book that BArrons has put out becuase it does not review any of the actual history and focusses way too much on the analytical part dealing with essays. The AP US test prides itself on the need to understand the facts in US history through the entire exam (the multiple choice questions test specific topics and the essay questions require teh incorporation of outside information). Do not rely on this book if you are aiming for anytyhing higher than a 2."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Review","review":"Unlike most AP review books, this one fails to include what I'd call \\"American History in 150 pages.\\" The content review is extremely minimal and extremely difficult to navigate.

This book has no history review (yet it's for a history course??) and is all about how to write an essay, a skill we all learned a long time ago. Reading student essays and their critiques is not helpful whatsoever, and to make all of that worse the whole book is written in the most boring, dull and redundant language possible. The only reason I would buy this book is for a cure to insomnia."},{"rating":"1","title":"ehhh....not worth the 12 bucks","review":"this book was not very helpful in preparing for the exam. the practice tests and timeline in the back of the book were extremely helpful, but the essays were terrible! any student should know that an essay should be way more organized than those in the book! their tips were not helpful at all. my friends had a book that had something like 10 tests in it - this was a good study tool. you can also find practice tests all over the internet. find something that will tell you the basics about the test, and maybe a timeline, but most u.s. history courses should cover enough that this book won't be helpful. i feel confident that i got at least a 4 on the test, but only because i studied with kids who had books besides this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Enough Historical Information, Too Many Student Essays","review":"My mom bought this book so that I could study for the AP U.S. History test, but I was a bit disapointed. I was hoping to get a thourough review of history, but instead, the sections on historical time periods list only questions that you SHOULD know the answers too without giving you the facts. For every chapter, there is a sample student essay with teacher critiques. Reading one or two essays might be helpful, but reading student essays won't help me to understand the history. I am already a good writer. What I need is to review the facts.My Thompson's/Peterson's SAT II Prep book has been much more helpful since it includes concise summaries of key people and events for each time period (even though I bought it to study for a different test).This book is helpful in learning how the test works and has some useful practice questions, but if you want to review the history, this is not the book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"I recently purchaced this book and returned it.

The book would however be good for students who might have trouble writing or organizing essays. The only part of the book I found really helpful was the outline at the back of the book which goes over such things as causes of various wars and famous people. I used that to review the nigh before the exam. But be forwarned if you do buy this bok to help you with the essay it will take you a while to read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"This book was a big disappointment. First of all, there is only one practice test, which was upsetting because that was the main reason I bought the book. In addition, the review part is mostly just a chronological listing of events, which doesn't really help to study because it just encourages skimming. Most importantly, the book is written in condescending language that is very discouraging to a student who is already stressed-out and worried about the exam. It uses phrases like \\"the answer to this question is obvious because...\\" and \\"this is information that you should have already learned...\\" As a result, this book made me needlessly discouraged before the test. I also used the Barron's SAT II US History book, which was equally as bad. I would discourage people from buying from the Barron's brand at all in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be careful with this one","review":"I purchased this TV in September 2004.

Their songs sounded like they were straight out of '77, not too fast, not too hard, just good uptempo British punk rock. This compilation culls many of their finer moments and is a satisfactory 1-disc overview of their career, though bigger fans might want to shell out the dough for both of Anti-Pasti's original albums (both recently re-released by Anagram with bonus tracks). And if this sort of latter-day punk rock is your bag, be sure to pick up Chron-Gen's single disc collection, as it has many of the same qualities as Anti-Pasti."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT SO GOOD AS THE SOUNDTRACK","review":"It\`s the image album, not the soundtrack album.

This game version is GREAT because there is no chance of repeat names being tossed into the mix, you don't have to wait for the one slow poke friend to cook up 15 celebrity names on his own, and there are THOUSANDS of names in the box so you can play forever without running out of new names. With the celebrity names in this gift version being rated by level of difficulty, you can also play more strategically. I like bringing it as a hostess gift to dinner parties because 1.) I'm a game freak, and 2.) it comes in a compact tin box, which looks cool."},{"rating":"2","title":"Became a good show","review":"Never watched this show before the DVD.

Meanwhile, every other series from the past (and present) was being released. The wait was worth it; it was a joy to see these episodes again after so many years. The set and the acting hold up well. The issues are timeless and you can identify with all the characters. LaRue is a jerk, but a loveable one, and you really want to see him get over his addiction.

The ensemble cast creates many sub-plots which take the show in different directions and create a fast moving show. The only disappointment is the remaining seasons aren't on video and when you get to the last episodes of season 2 you feel a sense of loss."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic TV Series","review":"Hill Street Blues...a classic TV series. Good stories and characters, great acting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeps Getting Better","review":"Season 2 of Hill Street Blues out, and what a great season it is! The characters continue to grow and evolve, the storylines get more intense (they may seem a bit over the top with age, but I still love them). My only three gripes:1. No meaty bonus material.2. I really HATE the double sided disk format.3. Season 3 is not out yet.Pick these up, with all due haste. And hey! Let's be careful out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing compared to the first volume","review":"The sound quality is great and the playing is top-notch. However, only a handful of tracks here (including \\"Caroline, No\\" Elliot Easton, \\"Liz & Opie\\" Victor Wooten, \\"Wings of the Morning\\" Doyle Dykes and maybe one or two more) seem inspired. Taken on it's own terms, the collection overall sounds pleasant enough but the weaker tracks come across as being here just for the project theme- to demo the Taylor Guitar sound. If you can only get one of the two volumes, Vol. 1 is absolutely the one to go with. This one is for serious guitar enthusiasts only or music collectors/completists who want these tracks because they may not be available elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big disappointment--not at all what I was looking for","review":"I bought this album primarily for Clint Black's \\"Something that we do\\". The excellent customer reviews convinced me to buy this album instead of a regular Clint Black album. I was sorely disappointed to find that all the songs on here are strictly instrumental versions. Why in God's name would anyone play a version of \\"Something that we do\\" without the words? Not that the tune isn't wonderful, but all the meaning is in the lyrics! I'm baffled, and angry that I can't return the CD since it's not at all what I wanted.When I got past my frustration and listened to the rest of the album, I still didn't see what all the fuss was about. Yes, the recording quality is excellent, and the playing is fine. A few of the songs are winners, but many of them sounded very generic to me--not very inventive or original. Maybe some of these are also songs that have lost their meaning by having the lyrics omitted."},{"rating":"2","title":"The reason God made guitars","review":"I didn't realize there was a first collection of this music until I saw Sounds of Wood & Steel 2 so I bought it to see what it was like. My husband and I love it! We enjoy the way the artists describe the reasoning behind the songs they chose as well as knowing what make and key their Taylor was played in. I particularly enjoyed Richie Sambora's sound due to the description of the song's origination. I plan on ordering the first collection since we have enjoyed this one so much. This is wonderful music to enjoy your day or evening by. It's sure to please anyone who plays guitar or just loves to hear that awesome sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"A guitar-playing friend turned me on to this CD and the first Wood&Steel.

The undersea setting is intriguing, but not surprising for a story about a generic crustacean (Snappy), the main character. While the plot was quite linear, but there was no back story for Snappy.

Then she wraps it all into the context of the fascinating times in which Pepys lived and gives us rich introductions to those who shared his life and world.

While I appreciate her intention, this book promotes reckless techniques that promise instaneous kundalini awakening just by deciding to turn it on. The author promotes the erroneous idea that kundalini is set up like a heater's thermostat that you simply adjust by turning metaphysical knobs. Thankfully, as most responsible spiritual teachers advise, kundalini is not so easily tampered with. The techniques simply do not work and are a complete waste of time. My advice is to go online and get some responsible, effective tips that are safe and actually work from serious, respected spiritual teachers.

On and on she goes about the evils that happened to people who didn't listen to her advice. Of course, when she gives it it's not advice--no, from what I gather in her book when she speaks, it's actually the word of God Herself. And if you don't believe me or her, she'll sit you right down and \\"connect\\" you to God, Jesus, Mary or whoever who always agrees with whatever clap has come out of the author's mouth.It's amazing what owning a printing press can do for a person (and their ego!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Kundalini Rocks, This Book Doesn't","review":"Wanna have an author make you believe she's the foremost authority on the subject and scare you into believing that without her fabulous knowledge the flame of kundalini will rip you to shreds?

Wanna spend hundreds and thousands of dollars \\"learning techniques\\" that the author herself states are simple kindergarten exercises?

I fell asleep watching this movie because it was so boring, but I did rewind to finish it so I could give a fair review. It's a story about a hypnotist who is helping the cops track down a serial killer. He can see what others see. Sounds great right? Trust me, it's not great at all. I am glad to give this movie it's first 1 star review. If it was up to me I would give it 0 stars. The acting was horrible. The story was silly. It wasn't scary or suspenseful. The ending was so bad that it made me chuckle. Not to mention that the final twist was very predictable. I would have expected something much better from BBC than this failure at a horror movie.

The art work is good, done by the author, but if the pages were spread on a gymnasium floor and shelled corn thrown at them, a kernel would seldom miss a historical error.

The book is filled with what must be hundreds of portraits, artists' renderings, maps, etc., that only enhance the value of the book.

Similarly, he has brought together his best qualities as a journalist and his best qualities as a novelist.

The initial hook of the prologue is never linked to the main thesis, and the end leaves one hanging with more questions than answers.

Kitteredge is to be shown for what she is, and her \\"A&O\\" theories are part of what makes her attractive to a man like Herrick Hubbard while being herself somewhat self-centered and sometimes disturbed (and disturbing).

Weird Al continues to show his tremendous talent and great sense of humor, and while this album is not his best, it is still very good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could've Been Better","review":"There are only four songs on this that are funny. Eat It, Midnight Star, I Lost on Jeopardy, and Nature Trail to Hell. Other than those, the rest of the songs are just plain boring. I would have to say that out of all Weird Al's albums, this one is probably the worst."},{"rating":"2","title":"A transitional piece","review":"I really like this album. The original songs are what I like most about Al and these aren't among the best, but the overall package is still a good piece of work. After a low fi simple take on first album, this hints and the future of Al's sound, with the parodies being much closer to the original in sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"Back in the day...","review":"This is typical of what Wierd Al usually did about ten years ago. His later stuff is different, to be sure, but this album contains some of the classics, like Mr. Popeil and Buy Me a Condo.

I don't feel like I got the point of the story...maybe it's because I'm not into Broadcasting...I seriously doubt it though. I've read many books dealing w/ things I'm not into and have enjoyed them. When I finally finished the book I thought why did I waste my time. Don't wait for the paperback...I think this is one book you could really do without reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"News Flash: Boring!","review":"Let me begin by saying that I really wanted to like this book. A story about a television news station and all of the diversified characters working at the station sounded interesting. Unfortunately, however, interesting does NOT always translate into entertaining! The characters are thinly written, the dialogue is at times juvenile, and the plot (if you care to call it that) has NO staying power. The author does succeed in painting a picture of how a television news station operates, but you can get a FREE tour at your local TV station that will save you both time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"wait for the paperback","review":"I also was eagerly looking forward to the next book by Yolanda Joe but I have to say that I was very disappointed it was very hard to follow beacuse of so many many main characters I am still reading the book but only because I spent the money on it but I just didnt care about any of the characters. Take it from someone who spends quite a bit of money on hardback books do not waste your money. wait for the paperback"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliantly Entertaining","review":"The author Yolanda Joe created 5 voices that made me feel each one. The challenges that these women faced were so real the male characters as well. Yolanda Joe transitioned each phase in her book so perfectly.

The entire book grabbed me but what most got my attention was what a person has to do to get what they want, whether it be truth or a lie, right or wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"BOOOORRRINNNG","review":"I have met Yolanda joe at several venues, and I must admit that she is down to earth and friendly individual. I am a fan of her previous books, however, This just in was a difficult read and boring. I stopped in the middle of the book and gave it back to a co-worker whom I borrowed it from. I understand that she is from the journalism field, but as another reviewer wrote, a writer can give a reader a new perspective in an enlightening way. This book did not deliver. I am disappointed, but i did not waste my money. I will continue to support Yoland joe in the furture, however, it appears as though our new bred of writers is allowing their names to carry them and they are not producing the kind of enjoyable material that made them a household name."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed, let-down, definitely not best work. . . .","review":"After anxiously awaiting the release of Yolanda Joe's latest novel, after preordering a copy and having it delivered to my front door, to say the least, I was very disappointed. I was expecting the humor, dialogue and entertainment that I was accustomed to from her previous novels. \\"This Just In\\" was slightly interesting because of the newsroom tidbits that were provided entailing the day to day activities of a busy, Chicago station. However, I felt that Yolanda wanted to vent and express her frustrations from her previous newsroom experiences. I usually read a good book in two to three days. However, this one took me almost two weeks, I never felt anything for the characters. I didn't care what happened to them. Loyal fans should wait until this one comes out in paperback!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If it Ain't Broke, Don't Fix It ....","review":"I am a Yolanda Joe fan but, I was disappointed in this book. I met Yolanda when she visited Dallas to promote BeBe's By Golly Wow. This increased my interest in her work. I loved BBGW and He Say, She Say. They were outstanding. I purchased this book simply because it was written by her. After reading this book, I will be more hesitant to buy her next book without investigating it more first. I understand that artists want to expand their horizons and tell different stories but, I think she should have done a 3rd part to the old line of characters. Those books were really what won her fan base. If it ain't broke, why fix it. It's not too late to do that 3rd part to the lives of BeBe and Sandy. Yolanda is very talented. Continue to do your thang girl, but I say to beat the horse until it's dead! :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yo, Joe!","review":"This book started out well and interesting. Behind the scenes of a newsroom. But soon the characters started sounding the same. Issues were mounting with no closure. Back and forth the chapters go. It makes you dizzy. No flowing. For these people to be high caliber professionals, it was like reading a bad script of highschool girls cat fighting. 2.5 Stars on the SmithScale."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little different, but worth the read","review":"This was not the typical Yolanda Joe of Bebe By Golly Wow and He Say/She Say fame, but it was a good read. Ms Joe captures corporate America as she changes venues from her relationship books. She gives us an good look at the ongoing on in what some consider the glamourous world of television newcasting. They make it look so easy on the news, but oh.. the behind the scenes action can be more exciting. I found the characters real and very interesting, and easy to relate to. Even thought there was alot of racism and sexism, I found the book easy to read and and quite interesting. Looking forward to Yolanda Joe's next change as she tackles mysteries."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Read","review":"'This Just In' is a thoroughly satisfying read. Yolanda Joe aptly describes her characters and the world of broadcast journalism. Before reading this novel, I knew nothing about the field. I now feel like I know the inner workings and the cut-throat enviornment of broadcast journalism. The characters were shown in realistic settings, with real life experiences. Their methods of problem solving were interesting. I like this novel because I could relate to the characters and I could feel what they were feeling and for the same reasons. This Just in is cetainly worth the money that I spent on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!!","review":"This is a story that exhibits comaraderie among sistas in the complicated, and sometimes unfair, production/television scene. Kenya, Denise, Holly, and Alex form a bond and stick together so they will not be conquered by the powers that be. I am unfamiliar with production, so this book gave me insight on that profession."},{"rating":"1","title":"This just In","review":"I read the book This Just In and was really disappointed in it I have loved all Yolanda Joes other novels and loved them but I just could not read this one. I think you would have to be interested in the story line in order to follow it. Still can't wait for her next one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Journalism/Broadcasting - Racism 101","review":"This would be a good book for readers/students who are interested in a career in TV broadcasting. The book gave too many definitions of newsroom terminology & the entire book was based off the stories and characters in the newsroom. I was quite disappointed as the book did not give background information about the characters outside of the newsroom or go into detail about their personal lives. This book was not a page-turner despite the chapters having \\"Teasers.\\" I have read Yolanda Joe's other books which I enjoyed and I still have faith that she will get back on track with her next book. Maybe she wrote this book to vent her frustrations or to educate the readers about the challenges of people of color working in the newsroom, which was not entertaining for me a reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad, really sad!","review":"I was very, very disappointed in Yolanda Joe's new book...I found it followed no logical sequence....I can usually read a book within 2 to 3 days, but after I was approximatley half way through this one, I was through..I am now wrapping it to return to the seller....I cannot in good faith keep it...sorry, but this book was SORRY!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great curling iron","review":"I have shoulder length hair and this size barrel did a great job on my hair.

To my surprise, all 3 DVDs in the series do NOT have any audible explanations of the techniques/moves contained in the video, making this DVD impossible to follow and a huge waste of time and money.Thinking that I may have obtained a \\"bad\\" DVD series, I've been calling the distributor for assistance, but not surprisingly, I can only reach the sales department (instead of customer support) and no one seems to be able to help me.My last resort was to put a complaint with my credit card and see if I can get my money back so I can close this horrible chapter.

It's a nice try to explore other nations' heritage, but when you write a book about it, make sure that the facts are right. I was born in Hungary, and I've lived there for 20 years, so I know how most of the dishes in this book taste like and what goes in them. Some ingredients are missing from the recipes and the recipes included are just scratching the surface of Hungarian cuisine. Sticking the \\"Authentic\\" in front of everything won't actually make it authentic! I had fun reading the Hungarian names of dishes. The spelling is way off! All in all my advice would be: if you are looking for a GOOD Hungarian cookbook, look for a Hungarian author..."},{"rating":"2","title":"It really is authentic","review":"My dad was Hungarian, and the recipes I have from my grandmother are the same as those in this book.

I only bought this to get the full effect of the added non-soundtrack tunes on it. The one song that really rang my chimes was \\"A House That Has Everything\\" which believe it or not, is an actual soundtrack song. There are a bunch of half decent tunes on this CD, both soundtrack and non-soundtrack; there are also a few rather pedestrian songs too like \\"Confidence\\" and \\"Hey, Hey, Hey\\" (real garbage). Other than that, this is one CD I think most folks would enjoy if you can only get by the title song \\"Clambake\\"... take about absolute crap!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent reference material","review":"This book is very detailed and for the most part satisfyingly complete. The illustrative photographs (or in the case of airplanes that were never photographed, rare original concept drawings) are very clear and effective.

The entire Christian world, it must be remembered, was nothing but Catholic for centuries. Peter Browns series of essays shows how, far from being a pagan holdover, the use of saints as mediators between earth and heaven became so popular and so accepted.This is not a book to breeze through; rather, it requires careful, line by line reading. Recommended for readers who have the patience necessary to glean understanding from this scholarly material."},{"rating":"2","title":"a classic!","review":"Peter Brown's book on the Cult of Saints has become a classic work on the formation of the cult of saints in Late Antiquity/Early Medieval Europe.

People complain that the unlabeled, maze-like selection screens are confusing and that it is difficult to find what you are looking for, but I believe that that is somewhat intentional, because you are forced to go through each one, thus viewing all the material, to find what you want.

The real pain is that the clips often only run to literally 1 or 2 minutes and then you have to start toggling to find some more. If there's a \\"play all\\" function then I couldn't find it and it's definitely something that's needed here, with some 50+ sections that you have to find and play one at a time.The menu's are good looking, but they seem to be what the entire disc is all about, rather than the band and their music. Which really is a shame.If I wanted to play a game I'd buy a game, I wouldn't buy a DVD. Sadly, given that it's so much of a pain navigating around this disc and trying to remember where everything is, I doubt I'll be watching it much, which kind of defeats the object of buying it.Someone somewhere thinks they're clever.

The DVD is so incredible in format, but since it is a bit annoying, I give it four stars. The other people reviewing here over-exaggerate the difficulty of the navigation.

It is very lite reading and I felt not worth the expense for information that should be covered in any book on cruises."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"The book should be called \\"The Essential Little Travel Book With Some Cruise Tips Included\\" Anybody who has done a minimum amount of traveling will allready know most of the tips in this book. Most of them are just common sense. It's obivious that the auther does not want to say any thing bad about the cruise companies, and at the end you find out why. In his bio. it says he owns a travel agency. If you go to \\"cruiseopinion.com\\" on the internet, you can read the unbiased opinions of the people that took the cruise. Such as don't book your excursions on the ship,but wait until you get on land where they are cheaper. Save your money and go to the web site."},{"rating":"1","title":"A cute rendition of common sense.","review":"Not only is this book little (literally), it contains facts even novice cruisers are aware of (such as myself). Occasionally, I felt as though some of the comments were condescending, don't do this, do do that..., etc. There were a few nice ideas in the book but overall I was disappointed in the quality of the book and for paying extra to have it shipped faster to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Useful insights without the fluff.","review":"I have cruised a few times and found this book brief, to-the-point, humorous and helpful. Such as how to get invited to the Captain's table, if you so desire. How to make inevitable waits less taxing. Which is better a luxury suite in lesser ship or a lesser cabin in a luxury ship and why. And best of all it's a quick read with resources to check out and an e-mail to the author for further assistance. Great! Better in the ways of cruising but not which ships, which itineraries except to say the longer the cruise, the more elderly the population."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Particularly Useful","review":"The gist of this book is: \\"Have a good time, no matter what.

Had this information been contained in the 'description' of the DVD comprising only two interviews then I could have avoided the clear waste of money of buying them twice. The second DVD was all I needed and I could then have purchased something else with the money saved. In short the DVD \\"the iceman : Confessions of a Mafia Hitman\\" ought to be removed from publication entirely and only the second DVD \\"the iceman interviews\\" (comprising both the interviews of the former DVD together with the third interview of 'The Iceman and the Psychiatrist') remain available for sale."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shaken","review":"There are moments in this video that are truly bone chilling.One of them being when the doctor questions Mr. Kuklinski about weather or not some people he encountered in Georgia really deserved to die.By the end of his reply,I felt like the temprature in my livingroom had dropped below freezing.And I am not someone who is easily shaken.

I feel this documentary gives you great insight of Richard's mental state. He is without feeling for the most part which explains his ability to do the things he did in the manner that he did them. However, I strongly recommend that you read \\"The Iceman, Confessions of a Mafia Contract Killer.\\" This will give you insight to his childhood and explain the reasons why he has little to no feelings.Personally, I have great sympathy for the man and the way he was raised. In summary, I don't see how he could have been any different that he is; given his childhood."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good Documentary","review":"HBO did a great job with this!

Mine will be advertised very soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Put down your chainsaw and listen to me...","review":"Hilarious LP that still cracks me up. I dig the earlier more DIY sound of Al better than his more-mature, demure, long-haired self... His CDs have gotten smarter and stylistically more chameleon-like (remember back in '92 when the Al video for smells like nirvana came on and at first you actually thought it was the Nirvana video?), buit I still like this earlier stuff more...

The best is obviously YODA, then \\"This is the life\\" and \\"Girls Just Want to Have Lunch\\". The latter is almost the funniest, especially Al's scratchy voice. Other good ones are: \\"Dare to be Stupid\\" - almost in the top three; \\"One More Minute\\" - kinda gross, but had me shaking; \\"I Want a New Duck\\" - funny in an idiotic way. The others never really caught on with me. Well, this is worth getting anyway!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Definately an Improvement Over 'In 3-D'","review":"I bought this album and his other one, In 3-D, on the same day and this one reallycheered me up after the boring 'In 3-D.'

Granted I don't listen to it as much as Greatest hits Volume II it's still really clever. I listened to this a little while ago and it really rekindled my love for it. I did a lip synch at my intermediate school last year to \\"Girls just want to have Lunch\\" and they loved it. Afterwards one kid came up to me and said \\"hey, not as hilarious as the laughing policeman\\" (another one I did the year before) \\"but it's still pretty funny!\\" I think I've proven my point. No matter what age kids are they still appreciate the wonderful world of Al!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious and musically sound (sorry!) too!","review":"Like Al's other albums, the music on this one is excellent, and just as listenable as the original pieces which these parody.

Isn't that crazy?\\" \\"Yes it is crazy\\", I replied.This book is a god send. As a family we were all there when our dog of 13 years died. We cried, shared memories,laughed and said good bye. It was a perfect experience for our family and my nine year old and six year old were a part of it. Loss is an opportunity for growth...this book helps us with that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Joke Book","review":"This book was alright. If you are looking for a joke book this is not the right book for you. It attempts to explain the theory behind the jokes which I personally felt kind of killed the book.

If you are really that desperate to be funny you could read it otherwise I would look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"TAKEN by Kathleen George","review":"I found TAKEN to be a terrifically gripping page-turner. The characters were richly-drawn individuals,the settings were wonderfully evoked and the plot original and engrossing. I thought the 'maternal-instinct' aspect was clever and an interesting layer of the story, but it never diluted the \\"thriller\\" aspect of the book. I hope Ms. George will continue to write about these characters, especially Christie; I kind of have a crush on him,,,"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Taken!","review":"I am usually turned-off by mass fiction, especially thrillers, because alas, usually they are not well-written and are solely plot driven. I bought Taken as a fluke because the storyline, about a kidnapped baby and black market adoption, intrigued me.I was pleasantly surprised by how well-developed the characters were. They had true-to-life human qualities that made them believeable.If you're looking for a thriller in the vein of, say, James Patterson, then this isn't it. This is more of a beautifully written character study that is psychological and believeable.In the end, ask yourself, if you were in the heroine's shoes, wouldn't you have done what she did to rescue the baby? For me, the answer is a resounding yes!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Taken In","review":"I thought George's book looked like a mystery when I bought it. Unfortunately, it is one the most implausible, silly stories I have ever read. Just reading the official blurbs will tell one that. Taken might please an incurable romantic drama buff with delusions of grandeur (e. g. one who wishes to aid innocent children, meet a macho stranger, solve crimes the cops cannot, etc), but I suggest this sort of thing is done better in Steve Martin's Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid. Of course, Martin knew he was being silly. I am not sure why other reviewers have not been as critical. Then again, George is a drama professor in Pittsburg, and many of the reviews (oddly) come from there as well. Hmmm."},{"rating":"1","title":"Taken","review":"Taken is supposed to be a 'thriller'. But, it does not thrill. It has two main problems. First, it is written badly. The characters are thin, and the main character seems only to reflect George's (perhaps ideal) image of herself, her ideal mate, etc. Second, the story is not 'complex,' as such, but far-fetched. One constantly questions whether x or y event in the book would ever, in any possible world, happen. I am sorry but I cannot recommend Taken."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money!","review":"I'll make my review short, sweet, and to the point. This is absolutely the worst book I've ever read. The characters aren't believable, the plot has no substance, and to put it politely is quite boring to read. I'm appalled I actually spent money on this. There is zero suspense involved, considering you can figure out from the the first chapter, the ending. I would highly advise thinking twice before reading this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incoherent Mess","review":"Weak characters, plodding plot, absurd situations. Formulaic novel that has been done and redone. Doesn't appear that the author has the slightest concept of the dramatic world, the ability to hold the reader's interest or even involve them remotely in the unfolding tale. A true waste of the readers time, and an insult to their intelligence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't Like","review":"This book was almost a pain to read. The characters were hard to relate to and I personally found them unlikable. I think the author dragged on the plot too much. I stopped reading almost at the end because I realized I did not care about these characters that did not seem realistic at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Unfortunately, I have to say this book was boring. It was so hard to read. The plot was so poorly put together, that I had a very hard to finishing it.

It was so boring, I had to force myself to keep watching. Though true to James Gurney's books in visual terms, that was the one saving grace of this version. It was plotless, the acting was bad, the dinosaurs were underused as characters, and the editing often left you wondering what had happened. It was hard to feel sympathy for any of the characters, especially the insular, self-righteous Dinotopians as they try to brainwash the two newcomers to their world. I found myself most in sympathy with Cyrus Crabbe, which is surely not what the makers intended. Whether children would find this more watchable, I just don't know.What did this version of Dinotopia most remind me of? The recent movie of \\"Dungeons & Dragons\\". Hardly a compliment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dinosaurs","review":"I bought this DVD for my boys ages 4 and 7. They absolutely love this movie.

The packaging and labeling on the discs is correct for the TV miniseries (2002) which is what I've ordered but there's Disc #1 with the TV series that ran briefly in 2004.

I live in australia so I never saw it when it first aired, but im lucky enough to have a multiregion dvd player so I orderd it here.I was always a bit skeptical on how it would turn out, thinking that because it was just a miniseries and not a movie, the effects would be lacking, but I was amazed at what has been achieved. The effects are movie blockbuster quality and the story line and acting is great! even for an 18 year old student studying film at university. I cant wait to see it again.The show gives a real insight into a differnt view on dinosaurs. While jurrasic park may have been dinosaurs with a human buffet, this show lets us see humans and dinosaurs co-exist.

I recomend it to EVERYONE!."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, Entertaining Movie","review":"This was very nice, well made movie. I would say it was not quite as good as Lord of the Rings, but it certainly compares to many of the Disney movies in quality.

One of my better purchases!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for those of us who have never done yoga and are extremely inflexible","review":"I have never done yoga before but have become extremely inflexible due to taking the path of least resistance where pain is involved. This means not doing much of anything to avoid pain. Starting this program has even been painful but it gets better each day that I use it. I am starting to see some of the flexibility coming back very slowly, but at least I'm making small bits of progress instead of staying the way I was or possible getting worse. Patience in all things is good. I'll get it back for sure then move on the other sections. By the time I'm finished with a session my overall feeling is one of relaxation and find it's a good way to start a day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it.","review":"This is the best yoga DVD I own (and I have a bunch). After using it consistently for a few weeks, I noticed a HUGE improvement in my flexibility and greatly decreased back and neck pain that had been unresponsive to just about everything else. Zyrka is a wonderful, calming, soothing, clear instructor and I can't recommend the DVD highly enough. Get it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mindful, meditative yoga practice","review":"This is a beautiful practice DVD. Zyrka leads us through the practice with mindfulness and attention to alignment and breath. Her instruction is clear and uncomplicated.The real power of yoga is in becoming aware of your body without judgement. Zyrka's calming voice helps us to release tension, which allows us to free the body's energy for strength in the poses. Zyrka flows into and out of each pose, demonstrating one of the key principles of yoga as described in Patanjali's Yoga Sutras: the practice of asana with grace and ease.I have practiced yoga for over 20 years, and have taught yoga since 2003. My studio focuses on mindfully, gently taught Hatha Yoga, and I'm often asked for recommendations of DVDs to practice with at home. This one will definitely be on my list! I'll be using this DVD in my own home practice on a regular basis!Great for beginners, those recovering from injury, or for people who want to have a more meditative approach to practice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gentle Opening","review":"I find these gentle sequences very good for me. I use them to relax. I have noticed improvements to my energy , flexibility and calmness the next day after doing these at night. I love this dvd. Zyrka is an absolute pleasure to listen to . She has a quiet gentle voice . I don't think she adds any superfluous comments that can get irritating after doing the dvd several times. I am 55 yrs old and recommend this dvd wholeheartedly to people who are stiff and want to increase their health without injury.I focus now on her instructions and this has brought my experience up to a whole new level of enjoyment. I notice that her flow series dvdYoga: Gentle Vinyasa Flowis filmed outside under trees. Unfortunately this dvd is filmed in a white space. But I would give it more than 5 stars if I could because I love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"I\\"ve been doing yoga for over a decade. I am addicted to this DVD.

I did a lot of looking before deciding on just this one. It is the most like the classes I attend than anything else I could find."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depends upon how limber you already are","review":"I figured a \\"gentle practice\\" DVD would be a good way to get my 65 year old muscles into yoga. Unfortunately, her basic postures - which are all nicely and slowly done - start from the sitting cross-legged position. Since I can't get into that position, the DVD is useless. I may go back to using it after I find some other way to get more limber. If you are young and flexible, this DVD should be fine. Otherwise, I can't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too slow","review":"I didn't need a fast or over exercise yoga video so I thought I'd give this a try, but I agree with what others have written here, this was way too slow for me and actually made me sleepy. I give it two stars because after trying to watch it three different days in hopes that it would improve, it is going in the recycle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I am not sure how this video got such great reviews. She is VERY dull and very slow.

I have never done Yoga. I wish there was a booklet along with the video instead of trying to flip though a chart on the video for poses.

I have never tried the video again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Relaxing yoga","review":"Sometimes I don't feel like Power yoga...I don't feel like a million sun salutations.

However, about a month after purchasing this, the watch face became very scratched for no particular reason. Then the watch just died (after only 3 months) - no new battery would help. The watch eventually was replaced after a month of arguing with Polar. I've now had my second watch for over a year. It is working fine, but the watch face has become so scratched that it is very difficult to read when you are working out. I know that the scratched face is undoubtedly because of me, but the design of this watch is clearly different from that of the RS200, which never had the same problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid","review":"I got this watch in April. In May, it began to have troubles-- switched screen even when buttons were locked, zoomed in on screens and the manual gave no clue how to fix, deleted profiles. I contacted Polar twice-- no answer. In June, it stopped working altogether. I gave it to my healthclub who gave it to a Polar rep, who held on to it for 2 months, and then gave it back saying that I needed to mail to Polar directly. So, I've had the watch less than five months, it's worked less than one month, and Polar has been disappointing.

The old watch (625x) was always very touchy to download, took many tries. This fails to transfer at all. I've had the Garmin 305 for 2years and love it. It downloads thru a USB connector every time. the only reason I tried to get polar again is to for the OWN INDEX test. But I don't need to spend $249 for only that functoin when the Garmin 305 does everything else and also has a robust analytical software program (but you cannot print it). really wanted to give Polar another chance and really disappointed.

So, configuring it was a little involved, but once you know how to set things up, it becomes fairly straight forward. It is menu driven. I like having the local software on my computer. The irDA, as others have noted, did take a bit figuring out. You literally need to align the watch very close to the irDA for the transferring of information from my watch. The wrist band is a rubber like material. The one problem I had was after a year and a half, the wrist band tore. I talked with the trainers at the gym and they noted that there had been some issues early on with the wrist band. Fortunately, they had a spare one as I had difficulty trying to find replacement band. I also wore out my Wear link chest strap. So, it has been well used and recently bought a new one. The watch synch's nicely with the cardio machines at the gym and helps me keep focus on zone training."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor design","review":"I bought the heart rate monitor for some of the additional features. It works, but the menu to operate the heart rate monitor seems to require a lot of button pushing. The menu for the watch could have been done a lot better. It is annoying, but functional. Then the wrist band broke. It is a custom wrist band and you need to send it in to have it replaced. Personally, I would rather support companies that have better design practices."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short battery life","review":"I've had the RS 400 Polar HRM for about a year and I have to say it's been a love hate relationship. I loved the watch when I first bought it but now, after dealing with a defective watch that eats batteries every 3-4 weeks, a Polar representative that was rude on the phone and the inconvenience of shipping my watch a second time, I wish I would have bought a GARMIN. Despite only using the chest strap transmitter or foot pod only 10 hours a week I continue to change batteries every 3-4 weeks. When I first encountered the battery life problem I was instructed to change the battery MYSELF by one Polar representative and NEVER change the battery myself by a second Polar representative. I have used different battery brands and distributors. I have cleaned the terminals of the transmitter and chest strap WITH MILD SOAP frequently as instructed. I have followed every instruction given to me by Lifetime Fitness and Polar.

This record apparently came out early last year, but I only recently saw it at one of my local record stores, so it must have just come out in the U.S. I just happened to see it in a listening booth, skimmed through it, and bought it on the spot. Much like the Strokes' record, it's just an exciting record, pure energy. It's all quick-strum, jangly guitars and manic vocals from the lead singer(her name is Sue) who sings the lyrics sort of like the guy in \\"Shine\\" talked - words are repeated over and over again, Lou Reed-ish talk-singing is employed, stuttering, you get the picture.

When a story is as reliant on plot holes and the stupidity of the characters as this one is, you know you're in trouble.This story should have been epic. Instead, it was perfunctory and rushed. There was no real sense of the crisis the reappearance of the Borg caused; everything was focused narrowly on the Enterprise, with no recognition that anything else counted. The direction was very flat, and the writing so bad as to be laughable in places. The special effects, make-up, and art design needed to be a lot better, too.Worst of all, there was no emotional depth to this episode. Moments that should have been shocking, or moving, or chilling, just weren't. Nor was there any sense of how very much all this should have mattered to Data.\\"Descent Part I\\" needed a comprehensive re-write, a better director, and about twenty more minutes to really highlight what mattered. It was throughly flat, when it needed to be the exact opposite."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring","review":"Though this point has been time and time again, perhaps the greatest legacy that Carl Sagan left to us is how he was able to popularize science for the masses. While presenting a picture of a vast universe, one in which humanity is neither noteworthy nor the end result of the universe's creation, Sagan does not make the reader feel insignificant or forlorn. Rather, the reader is filled with a sense of awe and is inspired by the possibilities the cosmos holds for our species.

His voice intertwines the stories of history, philosophy, and science, and every sentence is both brilliant and fascinating. But the best thing about Cosmos is that it makes ME feel really smart. I can follow everything Sagan says, even though it's some pretty deep stuff, because he's so good at telling it on the level of the intelligent, interested layman. The last few chapters of the book may seem dated, but they really aren't; the \\"enemy\\" has changed but the issues are still the same. I heartily recommend this book for anyone who is the least bit interested in science.

That sometimes can be a little over-the-top. Usually a long essay will not put out the message fully. The ending of this book didn't truly fulfill what I wanted to read. The book does have some good points about the cosmos but it perhaps put too much emphasis where the book should not have went by doing too much info on the scientists of the cosmo. The truth is, this science book didn't fulfill what I expected of it.

This I question - because he was more popular than other scientists, that makes him inferior? Regardless of his credentials as a scientist, he undoubtedly began many other scientific careers in addition to my own.

This book is not intended to change the world, but rather to reflect it in such a way that the reader laughs, squirms, recognizes his/her own hypocrisy and the blatant absurdity of most unquestioned social conventions. In this, Crasta succeeds in ways not unlike Sasha Baron Cohen's Borat character or Chris Rock race routines succeed, i.e., brilliantly.

But dare she entrust her daughter--or her heart--to a man who would give them anything but his love? Or might a caring American mother and child finally move this proud, imperious monarch and make his kingdom complete?Third in the Desert Rogues series"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for beginners, but assisted by a teacher","review":"It is a good course for beginners, both students in university and adults learning for professional reasons, but you get the most of it while guided by a teacher.

His account of life amongst the Eskimos is at once fascinating and entertaining. His matter-of-fact and at times amusing tone belies the enormity of the adventure he was living. Duncan Pryde was a unique individual whose personal experiences in the far North are a delight to read. His full and non-condescending appreciation of a culture now rapidly vanishing make this book an absolute treasure. Through these pages book the reader is transported to another world. I never wanted it to end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Poole Pottery Historical Guide","review":"Better than expected with information regarding Poole's more vintage pieces. Great color plate photographs on heavy stock glossy paper. As a potter, I found them very inspiring. I was somewhat disappointed that there was not much in the way of Poole's more recent (as in the last 15-20 years) designs; maybe that's not vintage enough for this particular edition. In any case, Poole afficionados will appreciate the collections profiled in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drags on and on","review":"This book seemed promising. I admit I was a bit skeptical when I first picked it up in the bookstore, but it seemed like a decent read for the vacation I was about to embark on.I ended up buying a new book the first day of vacation. The author spends the first 100 pages of the book providing detailed settings that we don't care about, implying that we cannot possibly imagine anything as wonderful as she did, and the rest of the book boring us with her one act main character.It's supposedly a love story, although how it claims to be so is beyond me. Love stories are supposed to drag the reader in and have them swooning with joy at the first union. The character development in this book is so dry and so incomplete (due in part, I'm sure, to the authors fascination with unnecessary details) that you don't really care what happens to the characters.Do not spend your time nor your money on this book; it would be a waste of both when it could be sent to much better books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly contrived prose","review":"I can't comment on the plot because I got so mired down by Thornton's prose. She struggles to come up with different similes and descriptive words so she's not repetitive, but there's no need to constantly re-describe things except to fill space. I found they tripped my reading up so much that I abandoned the book. There are so many books that are well written - it's hardly worth spending time on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip it.","review":"The other reviewers are dead on.

J-- has grown to adulthood in a desert village, with fairly primative technology. After visiting a nearby fair with few other young men from his village , J-- decides to see the world, and discover what else life has to offer.The setting of this novel is approximately mideval. J-- has a magical talisman that protects him from harm, but otherwise magic plays a rather subdued role. The point-of-view changes occasionally.\\"The Iron Tree\\" moves at a leisurly pace and encompasses many years. The prose is beautifully crafted, and provides wonderful descriptions of culture and scenery. Readers who enjoy Frank Herbert's writings (e.g., Dune) will likely enjoy this novel. For myself, I found the pace too slow and soon became quite borred.If you enjoy this pace and appreciate a highly visual book, then I warmly recommend \\"The Iron Tree.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"'A' level english submission","review":"Previously to this book I'd only read Tolkien and CS Lewis fantasy, as well as Potter, so after reading the blurb on the back was quite intrigued and bought the book.I wish I hadn't, it was a waste of time to read. The reviewers that gave it a low star rating are all correct, and yes the prose is drudgy and repetitive, very much like an 'A' level student creative writing piece, or even maybe that's too harsh on 'A' level students.There are so many better fantasy books out there, please don't waste your time. Try Robin Hobb if you want to read a female fantasy writer...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just dreadful","review":"I am usually the sort of reader who will slog on and finish a book because there might be something wonderful half-way through that was hidden at the beginning. Maybe that was true of The Iron Tree, but I could not stomach reading it long enough to find out. The writing, which others have described as \\"lyrical\\" is just dreadful. We actually had a laugh reading the particularly disasterous sections out loud. As a fan of Tolkien and Lewis, I find comparisons between this tripe and their writing faintly insulting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully Written","review":"This is one of the greatest fantasy books i have ever read, rivaling Harry Potter in suspense and climax. This book is a true fantasy novel. I scoff at the one and two stars, their authors obviously have no imagination or creativity. They must not have read the novel I read because I was amazed and couldn't put it down; It does suck that they die thought, who would have thought mistletoe, a symbol of love."},{"rating":"1","title":"Iron Tree? More like deadwood..","review":"I must admit that I picked up this book after choosing to ignore the critiques below, which I felt must surely be a little harsh. The scope for an epic, involving fantasy tale seemed intriguing from the book's publicity.Sadly, I can only confirm what others are saying. This writer desperately needs a ruthless front-line editor to excise the deluges of description that completely sink this story. The author clearly lacks the restraint to rein herself in and evidently needs help to do so. Either a decent editor or back to writing classes, I'm afraid, because this material wouldn't pass muster on an average writing workshop.I'd like to be able to say something positive, but I'm afraid I can only sympathize with readers who have spent money to buy this book and also for the unfortunate publishers who appear to have a bomb of a trilogy to market now. One to avoid, I fear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Description, Description, Description, but NO STORYLINE!","review":"This book lacks focus. It was rough to get through and I feel as though it was a complete waste of time. Just a set up for future books. You do not get a real feeling for any of the characters enough to even care about the storyline (if there was one).A major dissappointment. Just description, description, description. Too wordy, not engaging by any means."},{"rating":"1","title":"After reading Bitterbynde, disappointed","review":"I bought this book after reading the Bitterbynde trilogy by Thornton. Expecting the same quality level of English mythology and original storytelling, I was very disappointed. The plot was trite, scenery and characters transparent. What's so interesting about two \\"most beautiful\\" characters meeting, falling in love, and then... well, I won't spoil the ending. But for fans of Thornton's previous books, I would not recommend this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why?","review":"I must say that after reading the Byyterbynd trilogy, I was reluctant to pick up another or CCT's books, after it started so well, only to finish in a horrendous rush, which ruined the story. And apparently my reluctance was justified.After reading this novel, it is no where near her previous standard. Lots of description proved that she could use a thesaurus, but after the first few chapters, the same phrases begin appearing again and again. Barely a touch of realisim that even the fantasy genere requires was present, the entire book a string of endless cliques.I can only hope that CCT listens to her proofers before releasing the next book, and if not, that the editors have the backbone to reject it until there is some form of story line."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deeply disappointed","review":"Having enjoyed the Bitterbynde trilogy - ornate and flowery though the language was, the trilogy had a fresh take on an old story - I quickly rushed out and bought the Iron Tree in hardcover.And quickly regretted it. The plot is unconvincing and the incredibly capable wise young protagonist is challenged by little that life throws at him. He lacks the 'flaw' a good character has to have to engage the reader's interest; heck he even has a charm that prevents all harm from touching him. No room for a character to evolve here! Ultimately, after having read about three quarters of the book on auto-pilot, I stopped and returned the book to my bookstore.If you are hankering for your fantasy fix, and MUST read this, wait till it comes out in paperback."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lush description, limited plot","review":"The descriptions of the Four Kingdoms of Tir, the people, the vegetation, the mythological creatures are lush and beautiful. However, the plot and characterizations are very thin. The two main characters, Jarred and Lilith, are not engaging, and the limited conflict that they failed to resolve was not worth an entire book. As I came toward the end of the Iron Tree, it was clear that they were only there to set up a further story in which their daughter would be the main character."},{"rating":"2","title":"Throw out your \\"cookie sheets!\\"","review":"This is a \\"half sheet pan\\" actually, like the full heavy aluminum sheet pans most restaurants use but half the size.The size fits in a small apartment oven (like mine), but still holds twice as much as your average \\"cookie sheet\\" you picked up at the local grocery store isle.Most cheap \\"cookie sheets\\", like mine and your mom probably uses, are steel or teflon things that often burn the bottom of whatever is cooked on them if you're not careful..My old cookie sheets would eventually (actually, very quickly) started to rust, got hard to clean, and looked like crap.. I found a good aluminum half-sheet pan doesn't rust, doesn't blacken the bottom of my food, and cleans up incredibly easily. I highly recommend picking one up! I've posted a couple of pictures of mine in action here too, check 'em out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"This pan arrived packed pretty well, but it had multiple scratches on the surface of the top and bottom.

Unlike this pan it's much better made."},{"rating":"1","title":"On it's way back","review":"I was excited when this arrived, as it appeared to be the same size and weight of one that I've owned for years and love. Unfortunately, it warped after only one use and is on it's way back.Updated - I didn't manage to actually send this back in time, so decided to go ahead and use it, warp and all. After pulling it out of the dishwasher we realized that where the sides roll back into the bottom of the pan isn't solid, there's actually a gap that allows water to collect.It's going to be have to be hand washed to ensure that dirty water doesn't pool inside.I predict that it's getting thrown out soon. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great pan!","review":"We have a small sided aluminum pan that we love and have had for years. After purchasing several sheet pans with teflon coating, that always ends up coming off, I decided to go in search of a larger aluminum sheet pan.I was leary of the shiny look when I received it, as my other pan is a matte finish. We have used it several times and what finally convinced me to write this review was because of the fish my husband cooked on it the other night. I don't think he used much, if any, non-stick spray since the juices from the fish looked pretty baked on by the time it was done.We put some water in the pan the next morning while crossing fingers that it would come clean. And to my absolute joy and amazement, it did! It is a clean and shiny as the day I unpacked it!I highly recommend this pan to everyone and will probably get another and even other sizes. No more crappy teflon pans!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Do you get the message??????????????","review":"From the first cut to the last this IS good, good, good! Every tune is great!

Christafari [early Temple Yard] were great and this latest 'evolution' is even better. I have been a reggae and rock-n-roll fan for years [I'm an 'old man' over 35, that is] and was so happy and praised the Lord for bringing these guys around, because back in my younger days when I used to drive around the neighborhood in my beat-up Toyota I had blasting out equally unrighteous junk--but I met the same Lord that Temple Yard did and the message is God rules! and we gotta speak the truth in love!

Screen savers used on Windows XP equipped PCs will NOT work with Microsoft mice. If screen savers are useful for you, I would strongly urge you to consider another product. I purchased the Microsoft mouse and found that both the screen saver and monitor shut-off features did not work with the mouse. Obviously this resulted in a major drain on power resources for my laptop. In addition it was just annoying that the screen saver feature does not work even though it was configured properly. Microsoft is aware of this and there is a soluton available on the Microsoft web site, but it seemed way too cumbersome. I returned the Microsoft mouse and purchased a Logitech, which works perfectly."},{"rating":"2","title":"optical mouse","review":"bought one of these and liked it so much i had to buy another one for my other computer."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good standard issue ergonomic wireless mouse","review":"I use this mouse as the \\"standard issue\\" wireless mouse at my workplace. It has the best balance of ergonomics, price, functionality and low failure rate. This was my personal choice for a wireless mouse for some time until I moved on to the VX Revolution mouse. The average user who just wants to get rid of the cord seems to be very happy with this mouse. Finally, on a Windows machine the software doesn't have to be installed, so it has a small footprint for helpdesk support."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible tracking","review":"I have had many mice, and all have been fine. I have never really had a problem with any mouse, until this one. The tracking is terrible. It is hard to click on links because the pointer jumps all over the place, no matter how slowly you go. The scroll wheel is awful too. In PowerPoint, even at the slowest settings, the scroll wheel constantly skips over slides."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice feel except for the scroll wheel","review":"If you are used to being able to accurately scroll a sreen up or down one or two lines, forget about this mouse. Most times, moving the scroll wheel a bit does nothing, until you move it again, then it jumps up or down half a page and overshoots. I tried all settings in the driver to no avail. The pointer/cursor, though, moves very accurately, why not the scroll wheel too? Very annoying behavior that I cannot seem to get used to. Hopefully an updated driver will fix this SOON!I like the heavy feel of the mouse. I use a wired Dell/Logitech at work that is too light and has a cheesy feel, but the scroll wheel is accurate. This one feels nice, but then, I also have big hands. Battery life seems not to be an issue. Been using it since Christmas."},{"rating":"1","title":"ms wireless optical mouse 5000 - negative review","review":"I found this mouse virtually useless given the graphics paces I needed to put it through. Aside from very frustrating inaccuracy, the thumb buttonsare placed too high,a completely inergonomic setup. When the hand is resting on a mouse, the thumb naturally rests inferiorly, on the desktop surface, not up at the top edge of the mouse. Additionally, it is extremely awkward to depress the thumb buttons without inadvertantly depressing the buttons on the opposite side. Finally, the clicking itselfwas not smooth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Microsoft 5000 Mouse","review":"Works great so far. EZ setup. Nice features.

I service and build computers and this mouse is a must for program specific settings for all the 6 buttons. I wore it out working 18 hours a day for a living, but I still recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good for gaming","review":"I've used this mouse heavily for about 4 years. This is definitely a mouse that you put your palm on. There's a decent polling rate such that you can give a quick swipe without having the cursor hang. Compared to wired gaming mice it's not the best but this is the best wireless mouse I've tried for fps gaming. Since the wheel is \\"smooth\\" scrolling if you press the middle button sometimes it scrolls a tad. Sucks to zoom in with sniper rifle and then suddenly switch weapons. But this happens with regular mice too, just a lesser extent.Of note you may have to position the wireless receiver in a few places before you get perfect signal. Also since the polling rate is so high the battery life isn't the best. I use only one nimh battery in the mouse and it lasts for a month (8 hours a day). You could use two batteries if you'd like but it's too heavy for my taste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Giant Mouse, more like a RAT.........I hate it!","review":"Buyer beware! This mouse is the size of a rat and about as unwelcome. It's way to big for a woman's hand, bigger than my mouse with the tail I am replacing. Also, it has this \\"thing\\" that you have to plug in to the computer with a very long cord that is also huge that doesn't even act as a base for the mouse/rat. There's no way to turn the mouse/rat off when you aren't using it. I would take this back to a store in a second but it will cost too much time and money to send it back to Amazon so I'm stuck with it. Why can't it have the little stick type USB thing that plugs into my notebook computer at work and when I'm done, I put the stick thing in the bottom of the mouse and it turns it off? That's what I pictured and that's what I wanted. This thing sucks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"CONVENIENCE OF OPTICAL WIRELESS MOUSE","review":"The optical mouse sure is an improvement over the old ball mouse. I don't need a pad and it stays clean and tracks well. The wireless feature is an additional convenience. What the heck.

The rubber grippy handhold sides degrade over time and begin to shed god-knows-what kind of chemical muck on your fingers. Once it comes to this stage, it gathers hair, dust and crumbs like duct tape residue. The mouse sides become impossible to wipe clean with a mild household cleaner and paper towel when it devolves. Selection of materials used for this product were a mistake in my opinion. Otherwise, this mouse would be comfortable to use if it didnt have an annoying set of magnify zoom buttons that you accidently press from time to time and try to remember how to disable."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Love & Hate; but Love wins!","review":"I've been using this model of mouse with my desktop computer since 2005. I've tried to stray to other models, but it has never worked out. The 5000 (aka IntelliMouse 2.0) feels like an extension of my biology. The full-size and right-hand orientation just fits me perfectly, which is more important than any of the bad stuff.The scroll wheel does fail, pretty much invariably between 8 and 14 months. The RF receiver is huge, so mobile use is not ideal. The buttons can fail, though the wheel is more likely to go first. Battery life is good, even if left idling all the time.So, my solution to the problems is to keep spares on hand. This is not an expensive mouse. I've gone through 8 units in 7 years, so the cost is negligible. My only concern now, in 2012, is that it appears that this model has been out of production for at least 2 years now. So, all that is left is closeout and old stock. I may have to say goodbye soon, but I prefer not to think about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This mouse is broken by design","review":"Unlike most of my other MS mice that I've owned in the past, this one is terribly unresponsive when trying to move the cursor or scrollwheel.

It becomes intermittent so that sometimes you have to click 5 times before it registers. The wireless has a delay that makes the computer feel slow, but it is really the mouse signal taking a long time to travel to the base unit.

Most of these songs sound nothing like the orriginals. They have ruined many of the songs like \\"Shot Down in Flames\\" and \\"It's a Long Way to the Top.\\" If you want to have all of these songs on one CD then buy AC/DC Live. It is far better. When it comes to AC/DC songs accept no immitations."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst tribute recording of all time","review":"this recording does not contain a single band that even remotely shows even a hint of talent. it states that AC/DC was the father figure of the punk rock age. I do not believe that the punk rock movement should be blamed on a band that has throughout it's history succesfully blended rock and blues together. the so called bands on this cd need to sit back and really listen to the songs they shredded , then they can see why AC/DC is where they are and how they got there. the only reason this cd got 1 star is it was the lowest grade available."},{"rating":"1","title":"This CD SUCKS! ! !","review":"I purchased this CD expecting MUSIC. Unfortunately the CD contains screaming no-name wannabe's that don't even know how the actual music sounds. And they call this a \\"tribute\\" album?!?!?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for AC/DC fans, maybe for others...","review":"The thing with tribute albums is that the chances of them living up to the originals is relatively small. Any AC/DC fan would shudder at the absolute lack of musical ability demonstrated on this record. Fans of Industrial music may actually like this, but it is a far cry from the sort of musicianship that fans of rock would like to hear on an album. Although the female vocals on Squealer are actually pretty cool."},{"rating":"1","title":"Biggest waste of money ever!","review":"Warning: do not even consider buying this piece of garbage. One song on this entire CD is done okay (squealer). The rest are absolutely horrible. Not only that but the song selection was bad right off the bat. The furor? Badlands? Gimme a break. The remake of Back in Black is quite possibly the worst thing I've ever heard. Was this CD a joke? The bands who particpated in this should be boiled alive.

There is absolutely no need to know or speak French with the way these sisters have so tightly laid down these tracks. The combination of harmonies, percussion, strings and keyboards are masterful. I was immediately hooked on track 2 (Les Portes Du Souvenir), and the remake of Sade's 'Sweetest Taboo' (track 7 'Tabou') is almost too funky. Buy the CD! You won't care at all what language it's in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved every note, hymn, and beat!","review":"Browing through the local cd store I came across this cd and decided to give it a listen. After the 2nd track I was hooked. The vibe of the music was intoxicating. This music moved me and the voices of these two sisters!WOW dynomite. I've played it over and over and over again. It's one of my favorite cd's to listen to, and I can't wait for future releases."},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD is HADES HOT!!!!","review":"From the first to the last track, I am swept away by the voices of these bohemian chantueses, the HOT styling of African drum beats, acoutstic guitars, hip-hop, R&B and soul and the eclectic topics of the lyrics into the Afro-French experience of Les Nubians. The music is so MOVING and INFECTIOUS that I sing loudly each song in my mispronounced, uninterpreted, \\"No French Speaking\\" rendition and never use language as a barrier on my enjoyment of the CD! I recently had a friend, who is fluent in French, translate the CD's lyrics so I could understand the Les Nubians perspective of life, love, social consciousness, pride and history that is recounted to me sweetly and soulfuly in each song making my Afro-French experience completely enjoyable. It's a must have for all Sade, Zhane, Soul II Soul, Roots, Erykah Badu, Lauryn Hill, Wyclef Jean, Sweetback, Seal...oh heck with the name dropping, GOOD music fans!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"MUSIC TRANSCENDING LANGUAGES","review":"THE CD BY LES NUBIANS IS THE EPITOME OF MUSIC TRANSCENDING LANGUAUGES.THEY ARE SADE+FRENCH X 2 = GREAT MUSIC.

The harmonies are beautiful and its even better if you don't understand the language."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Beautiful Album","review":"These ladies have a harmony that are like silk, they are so smooth. Normally, no one would be able to touch a Sade song, but The Sweetest Taboo is wonderful. I really really enjoy this album. Although I don't understand the language, their harmony and music breakthrough. This album is a must."},{"rating":"1","title":"one fantastic song","review":"I bought this CD on a reccommendation that I would like it because I love MC Solaar. I bought it and listened to it, only to find it had much too much \\"soul\\" for my taste. The only song that made me consider keeping it is \\"Les Portes du Souvenir\\" which is an amazing song. However, for 1 song, I'm not willing to listen to an entire disk of stuff I don't really like. For those who like this type of music, I'm sure it's a great album, but I don't think the Amazon suggestion was quite right in this case."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pour me some Les Nubians!","review":"Five stars isn't half enough to rate these fabulous sisters! I feel as if I've been in the Sahara, waiting for a drink, and Les Nubians is better than any oasis. I am uttterly in love with this CD, and music hasn't moved me like this in a long time.

The words are very catchy and anyone who knows a bit of French will quickly pick up and start singing along as I did. My favorite cuts are:Demain, Mekada, Les Portes Du Souvenir, Sourire and Sugar Cane. The radio stations in NY obviously are \\"in the dark\\" as no one is playing Les Nubians.....yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tres magnifique, plus des autres!","review":"I'm not a fan of R&B or hip-hop but this album has taken me over. I don't need to say that Les Nubians have integrated something I enjoy to make it mass-marketed appeal. This is just well done music that I can listen to. \\"Makeda\\", \\"Embrasse-Moi\\" and \\"Sugar Cane\\" are only 3 of all 15 great tracks. Tout a fait, il n'y a rien d'egal."},{"rating":"2","title":"INCREDIBLE!","review":"In short, this is the BEST album I've heard in years! I highly recommend it to anyone who is in search of a different sound. You won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"C'est Magnifique!","review":"When I first heard this duo on a local radio station a couple of months ago, it was so hooked by their smooth vocals that it was a couple of weeks before I realized that they were not singing in english! However, that makes no difference in this case. These sisters are awsome and I hope they have a long and bright future ahead of them. I personally recommend \\"Makeda\\" and \\"Domain\\", but by the cd and decide for yourself. It is wonderful to listen to, well produced and easy to like. There is even a cover of Sade's \\"Sweetest Taboo\\" called \\"Tabou\\" and sung in french. I plan on buying extra copies to give as gifts. This cd is definitely worth adding to your smooth jazz collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"you don't have to know the french language to like this cd","review":"what i love so much about music is that it's the universal language. in it, one can communicate love, tenderness, bitterness, feelings of injustice, pride, etc. les nubians is infectious because it said to me: i want to make you dig me, i want to make you dance to me, i want to make you groove to me. les nubians is a statement."},{"rating":"2","title":"soulful and hip","review":"Princesses Nubiennes is a joy to listen to. I find most French-Euro pop like candy - easy to digest but essentially unfulfilling. This album has a perfect blend of French chic and African soul that speaks to any listener. The harmonies are soulful, the singing sweet and the beat full of African percussion and rhythm. Perfect for background party music or headphones at home alone.

I was looking for a more upto date book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A treasure!","review":"I bought my first copy of this book over twenty five years ago. At that time, there were not many cookbooks that contained recipes using Caribbean fruits and vegetables and using techniques familiar to us. Now, many years later, I have bought my second copy and may even purchase a third to give to my God-children to teach them how and what to cook. Although a classic and harkens back to an earlier era in the Caribbean, it still reminds us of who we are, where we come from and just how good Caribbean cooking is. And the recipes, they all still come out wonderfully!

I've tended to blame myself for being careless. But I've concluded that the plastic is weak and poorly reinforced at the top-of-phone latch. Every one cracks in this area. Next, I'll look for a case-type holder that hold the phone like a wallet, instead of this clip-on style."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does the job pretty well","review":"This holster was purchased to replace a similar model that I really liked, but could not find anymore. The other one broke when I dropped my phone. The good news is that this new model is less brittle and seems less likely to break in the event of a short fall. The bad news is that 'less brittle' also equates to 'more flexible'. This holster could hold the phone just a little tighter for my liking. It does not 'click' when I insert the phone so I give it a little tug to ensure the phone is secure. I would estimate that about 10-25% of the time, the phone is not quite locked in and will come right back out in my hand. So long as you know to watch for this, it seems to be fine. I will note that my phone has not fallen out of this holster yet (I have used it a month now) so I could be just a bit paranoid too..."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK for the price","review":"Basically, it's a crummy clip. I've read reviews of the Brand name one and they don't seem to be much better. So If i had to I'd go for the cheaper model as they both will break.I dropped mine in the street and the top clip broke just as someone else said. Overall, the design is bad and there are NO good cases or clips for this phone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gone in 1 week","review":"Bad holster, don't waste your money on this holster.

He outright lied about training Ben Johnson, which was totally false since Charlie Francis himself (bens trainer) said so, lied about designing the program at Clemson and Northwestern. All he does is take a bunch of different looking exercises and put them in a book. his programs are unstructured with no regards to recovery and the work loads are ubsurd. Awful book by a huge fraud"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont buy this","review":"My main beef with this book is that, like everybody has already said, it's just a collection of pictures and description with some \\"rah-rah-rah\\" pep talk included in between about being a renegade. Although, some routines are laid out like the speed and jump rope exercises, there was no explanation on how to incorporate it in a training plan. There was not even an explanation of basic physiology and training principles.It's probably okay if you already have a basic foundation on training methodology but for a beginner or a novice, it's better if you look somewhere else.Plus, you can actually find in the internet 90% of the stuff in the book in John Davies's past articles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what was expected.","review":"When ordering this book, I thought that it would be a comprehensive guide to football training, with sample schedules, routines, etc. Instead, it's mostly photos of exercises with weights, agility drills, and flexibility drills.I would not recommend this if you are looking for a complete football training guide. It may be good if you want a few different exercises to try, but I find it hard to believe that most football coaches don't know these drills already."},{"rating":"1","title":"Exercises Not Training","review":"This book promises a lot, but doesn't deliver. Its simply a compilation of exercises. Most seem reasonable and useful, but it makes this a picture book and not a training book. While exercises for the various aspects of football are provided there are no routines or program recommendations. For example in the strength training section there is no discussion of reps, sets, % max, etc. On static stretching there is no discussion of how long to hold or how many sets to do. The same applies throughout the book except for the skipping rope section. In other words, other then talk about how hard his program is, Coach Davies doesn't provide a clue as to what it is. There are much better references for training. Save your money, there isn't anything here other then pictures."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Their Best","review":"Calling Dr. Luv is easily one of the best albums by El,ectric Hellfire Club. I like it a lot because it's varied. There is pop-metal, glam and industrial. Electric Hellfire Club are easily one of the best industrial-metal bands right now. Very Groovey Boots steps back from overt Satanism but is still goth. Book of Lies is a signature Hellfire song w/ personal topics such as Shane's Death. Calling Dr. Love is a reverant tribute to Shane Lassen. Hellflower and Prince of Darkness are funny and catchy. He Who Holds the Lightning Rod is a hymn to Thor, God of Thunder. Servants of Evil is a techno anthem with funny lyrics referance The Partridge Family. This disc rules."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reprint of a Classic","review":"For those who don't know it, this book is an expanded reprint of Fisk's outstanding book \\"Divine Sovereignty and Human Freedom.\\"In much of it, Fisk does a survey of opinions of eminent Bible scholars about election and free will to make a case that Calvinism is unbiblical.

Only the first chapter or so is worth reading. His position that God really does not know everything and that if God cannot learn anything would make His life one of stagnation are seriously flawed. I realize that he is quoting others, but they were not worth the space.This book will not help an extreme Calvinist reexamine his position, it will only drive him further into his system. The seeds of open theism are seen in the appendices. Quite frankly I was shocked when I read the book.I hold to an unlimited atonement so I am not giving this book a bad review because of its position, but on how the case is made.

Although the ink tank is a wear and tear item and needs to be replaced every so often, the Nectron knock off inkject cartridge probably hastened the replacement schedule.

There are 7 major areas: Communication, Attitude, Resolving Conflicts, Religious Orientation, Money matter,s Sexual Relationship, & Family planning/children. Each area has T or F questions for YOUR opinions (Both what your personal one is and what you this His/hers is)! You each do the same questions, apart from each other then come together and compare results, and on areas you are totally different on it helps you to discuss through them.

If we had not gone through both we would have had some very serious surprises and problems early on in our marriage.Going through this material I can see why most couples divorce in the first 5 years -- it is because they either werent properly prepared or didnt really know each other.

What I found was this was recorded relatively late in Astaire's life when his voice had lost its brightness and youthful beauty. I didn't realize this when I purchased it. The older voice just has no zing for me; the timbre of his voice completely changed. While this set is indeed a pretty comprehensive collection, you may not like what you get if you are looking for the younger Astaire sound. Astaire also makes numerous comments throughout, which I find interesting at first, but intrusive later.In the same vein, I've learned that I don't enjoy the very young Sinatra or Tony Bennett vocals since I didn't grow up hearing them, but love their more mature voices; often I don't even recognize them as the artists in their earlier recordings as a result. Lesson learned: Determine which phase of an artist's career is on the CD before purchasing."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Astaire Story","review":"This album is so wonderful everyone should own it.

Here he gets a chance to sing(or should I say swing) with the likes of Charlie Shavers, Oscar Peterson and many other members of the JATP. Astaire has never sounded better, he sounds truly thrilled to be working with such talented jazz players. He gives all of the musicians plenty of solo time and even gives them a chance to do a jam session(without him singiing). This session is truly a gem.

Its written in a very visual way that really sticks with you and conveys the concepts going on behind the scenes as well as the actual nuts and bolts of the program. Its written in a logical progression from start to finish that allows new Editors to take it a step at a time. The author spent time where it was needed the most and moved along quickly in areas where the learning curve was easier, encouraging readers to start with solid fundamentals and build from there. I was able to get right into a big project with confidence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"This was the first of two audio purchases that I made from theHynosis Network series.

Inkubus Sukkubus starts out the album with a distraught reinvention of \\"Spellbound\\", Switchblade Symphony & Stone 588 capitolize on the gothic beat of \\"Night Shift\\", while Collide improves the tainted \\"Obsession\\" into a phenomenal meloncholy ballad. For the darkwave fans Corpus Delicti pounces on \\"Head Cut\\" (also the only male vocal cover on the album). Regenerator utilizes an 80's beat that strengthens \\"Ordinates Of Gold\\", and The Shroud's \\"Red Over White\\" is a dramatic masterpiece."},{"rating":"1","title":"A horrible \\"tribute\\".","review":"I would like to have given no stars but it was not an option, I don't usually like to out and out slam a musician, but in this case every one of these groups has woefully fallen short of the musical talent of the woman they are supposedly trying to pay tribute to. I guess I can blame this fiasco of an album on the fact that idiot music critics have chosen to label Siouxsie as a goth songstress, which in my humble opinion she is most definately not. The atonal screeching, hissing, and wailing I was subjected to listening to this alblum hardly even resembled the songs that I love and cherish by Sioux. In closing save your money, either buy the real thing or if you are into these bands buy their tapes and CDs and keep this travesty from ever occuring again."},{"rating":"1","title":"This album is an absolute \\"silly thing\\"!","review":"While some of the tracks contained on this album are mediocre interpretations of Siouxsie's songs, most are truly terrible.

Here is a man whose simplicity and sincerity permeate every page. At about the age of fifty, unable to ignore the deeper questions of life (Why, and What for?), Tolstoy began a search for meaning rivalling any undertaken by a man before or since. From Socrates to Schopenhauer to Solomon to Buddha, and, finally, to Christ, he studies the greatest minds of antiquity and today, rejecting everything that refuses to face-up to the ultimate problem of human life. The result is a profound affirmation that shatters his existing world-view and replaces it with a life entirely dedicated to God. Brilliant!Also recommended: Resurrection (the Vera Traill translation) and the Death of Ivan Illych and other stories, also by Tolstoy, Selected Essays by Tolstoy (esp. The First Step and What is Religion?), and The Brothers Karamazov (Andrew MacAndrew translation) by Fyodor Dostoievsky."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great read, but BAD publisher. 50 EDITING ERRORS!!!","review":"Whilst reading the Aegypan Press's publishing of \\"A Confession\\" I realized it was in large print, had numerous editing errors (I counted 50), and did not provide any copyright information. For a short ESSAY, the publishing caliber of this book is abominable. I am an avid reader but had I been just graduating from the 5th grade, I could have done a better editing job than this. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!To buy this version of Tolstoy's \\"A Confession\\" would be to disgrace one of the most lucid and personal essay's in literature. I strongly recommend investing in this book published by another press. The afterword, containing Tolstoy's dream is a poignantly intimate and yet applicable summation of his struggle to find meaning and rest for life - a passage that has the beauty of poetry and one that will stay with me forever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aegypan needs a proofreader","review":"The Aegypan (hardcover) edition of this book is a scandal and should not be on the market: almost every page boasts its typo -- most are harmless, but some, such as \\"whore\\" instead of \\"shore,\\" leave one breathless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Philosophy one can read","review":"I'm a student who takes a philosophy class every semester, despite the fact that it does absolutely nothing for my graduation requirements. I always do well in the philosophy classes, but there is one part I hate: the reading. I was convinced that there was no point in philosophy that one could not talk through with another person; the words and semantics in philosophy, meant to clarify arguments when spoken, simply seemed a muddle to me when read. So it was with trepidation that I picked up my latest assignment--Tolstoy's Confession. I read it, and was shocked to find myself completely engrossed. Here, finally, was what I'd been looking for...the On the Road of philosophy, the self-effacing Jack Kerouac of the field.

The narrator is clearly of Chinese descent and swam to Thailand. About half of the book takes place in a refugee camp in Thailand, and most of the other half takes place in America. The communist disruption of his schooling prevented him from school study of Laotian.The book is very insightful and often funny about the affronts a sensitive young man faced in a succession of foreign settings, and the rejection by Laotian Americans obviously makes another one.

He only use's these and has had better results with using these pad's than he did using medication. They really help get rid of the oil and also help close up the size of the pore's his acne is very mininmal. Honestly within 2 days of using these his face looks better than it ever did. He loves waking up in the morning without all the oil laying on his skin!So if you are suffering with acne and alot of oil on your face give these a try my sister who also was on medication in her 40's now use's these instead of medciation she also say they have changed the texture getting rid of the oil and overall apperance of her face, no more giant pores and red bulging bumps on her face. Really a amazing product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Alcohol, not tea tree","review":"A reviewer states they changed the formula and there are several recent negative reviews so this may be correct. I have dry skin and I use a tea tree serum. I could not use this due to high alcohol content. I was disappointed as I was expecting a reasonably gentle product, especially given others' glowing reviews. I would not even recommend this for people with oily skin. Way too much alcohol! And the pads are also rough like paper.PS: I also paid something like 3.79 for it w/free shipping. Definitely overpriced for $8 given it's basically rough paper with alcohol on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too harsh and drying, made me break out","review":"I was excited to try these cleansing pads because I love tea tree oil-based products...but unfortunately, this is an alcohol-based product! The pad made my skin burn and my eyes sting, and to top it all off, it completely dried out my rather oily skin and made me break out. Avoid this product - it is no good!"},{"rating":"1","title":"far too drying and fume irritates eyes","review":"2 stars because it is natural and might be right for a different skin type- I have combination skin.It's interesting to note that the second ingredient in this product is alcohol. This is very apparent when you apply this product on the face. As soon as the pad got close to my face, I had difficulty breathing because of the strong alcohol AND tea tree scent. Not only that, but the fumes also irritated my eyes. I had to close my eyes to finish wiping my face with the cleansing pad.Your facial skin is one of the most sensitive areas on your body. Something this strong is not good for it. It left my skin parched. my t-zone more oily than before and my cheeks flaking."},{"rating":"2","title":"best cleanser ever","review":"I tried the cleansing pads because I read about the benefits of Tea Tree Oil. These pads work great ! I also love the cleansing lotion . In fact I've ordered several other products from this company and have been completely satisfied with the results. The products do what they claim to do. Oh Yeah my face looks smoother and clearer and cleaner without over drying. Much better than those expensive high profile products you see on TV. Will continue to use this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad ingredient","review":"I bought this mainly for the tea tree oil , because I thought its easier and more convenient than mixing tea tree oil and lotion at home. But after reading the ingredients, one of the main ones is alcohol, and the bad drying type Denatured alcohol. I was surprised and very disappointed. This ingredient will cause dryness and irritation and make acne much worse. I will not be using these pads and I recommend you be careful before you do, especially if you have dry skin and fighting acne."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good stuff!","review":"Use this stuff after shaving to heal small unnoticeable cuts, it definitely feels like its burning at first but it soothes shortly after.

Tea Tree is expensive I've found out."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like it","review":"I like these. They def help get the dirt off your face.

My skin was never as clear as it was while using this amazing product! When it came time to reorder, I ordered 2 knowing that I would definitely use them all up. The problem is, when the product arrived, it was in a new package. This jar was white whereas my old trusted product came in a brown jar with brown lid and green label. I figured that it must be the same product only in a different packaging.....WRONG!!!!!!!! The pads were dried out, the smell was different, and there was no tingle on my face telling me it was working. I compared the ingredients from the old packaging, and found slight variations but the end product is completely different in my opinion. I need to find the old product again in the old packaging. I will be contacting the seller."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fresh and clean","review":"I use this product mainly at night before bed after washing my face first.

I tried other products without success. I remembered these from highschool, my mom used to buy them for me when my Proactiv ran out and it was too expensive to buy more, and these worked very well then too. At the time I really disliked the smell- it is very strong- but your sense of smell often changes when you're pregnant. Not only did these get rid of the breakouts almost entirely, but now I can't get enough of the tea tree oil smell. I love it. The smell may have something to do with the witch hazel in these as well. It does leave a strong taste on your skin though, so if you use these on a blemish too close to your lips, you may be surprised by the unpleasant taste if you later lick your lips or put on chapstick. Overall, great product that gives serious acne relief with all natural ingredients."},{"rating":"1","title":"great product...horrible company!","review":"I have been using this product for a few months. It is a good natural alternative to all of those cleansing towelettes that are on the market. The ingredients are much better for your skin than the other cleansers out there. I haven't noticed any difference in my breakouts but these pads remove face makeup. The reason I only gave two stars is because of the problems that I have had with the company. I highly suggest that you buy these in a store versus buying them with [...]. I never received my order and sent many unanswered emails to ask what happened. After my fourth email within 2 months I finally received a reply saying they would look into the problem. It has been 2 weeks since that reply and I still have not heard back. If only this company had better customer service."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very badly burned","review":"I was using this product along with Desert Essence Daily Essence Facial Moisturizer [...] and at first, I noticed that I felt a bit of a burn and discomfort from both products. I tried using the products separately as well as together, and thought that maybe it was normal. However, after a few days of using this product, I ended up getting a severe burn all over my face, and broke out into a very painful rash.It started out as just a prickly pink, then went itchy and red, and eventually broke out into a severe burn, and was extremely painful and peeled for several days. It took weeks for my skin to stop feeling sensitive and raw.I'm not sure why my face reacted this way, but I'm really sad that it did, because I had been searching high and low for an all natural facial product, and all of my searching on Amazon pointed to this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Harsh","review":"I am 53, and have had very oily skin all of my life, but it has never been overly sensitive. When I saw alcohol in the ingredients, I wasn't concerned, because for four decades I have been using products - from many brands - with alcohol as a main ingredient, and I've never experienced a problem. When I went to use it for the first time, I discovered the fumes from the alcohol were so overpowering I literally could not draw a breath, and when I did it was more of a gasp. I let the pad air out for about 30 seconds, wich helped some, and I was able to apply it to my skin. Afterwards, my skin didn't feel cleansed, so much as stripped. I decided to give it a try anyway, since not much bothers my skin, but after a few days, my skin began to break out. I think the problem may be that the alcohol is grain alcohol, also known as moonshine, and it's too harsh to use on skin. Maybe next time I'll try something with witch hazel."},{"rating":"1","title":"like sand paper!","review":"Desert Essence Facial Cleansing Pads are very rough on facial skin, it felt like sand paper!

I personally found the 2-CD Essential collection, which came out much later than the Greatest Hits CDs, to be disappointing, and it included 38 tracks overall! Altogether, the two Greatest Hits CDs only have 22 songs, but I don't consider even one of them to be a waste of space on the discs. Sure, the CDs are each sold separately, and they don't include any of Al's recordings from '96 onward, but they're still better than the so-called \\"essential\\" collection, at least if you look at them as a single entity rather than two separate collections.

And it sucked to begin with. The songs are hackneyed, the solos perfunctory and cliched. In fact, I think Eric Clapton's 80's output is some of the worst music ever recorded by a major artist, right up there with post-Keith Moon The Who. It reeks of sellout. The only super-hack track missing is his lukewarm cover of his own cover, After Midnight, recorded for a Michelob ad in the 80s while he was struggling with recovery from alcoholism. He should have spent the decade underground, the way Dylan and Young did. Luckilly, the real deal is readily available, particularly the sublime 461 Ocean Boulevard. You'd also do well to check out Blind Faith and anything by the Cream."},{"rating":"1","title":"No shame","review":"Timepieces 1 & 2. Crossroads. Crossroads 2. Unplugged. Cream Of Clapton. Blues.

I believe it to be one of the most haunting & beautiful songs I've ever heard---it's just about perfect---lyrics, vocals & the beautiful background orchestration. Brought tears to my eyes. I don't need to analyze it; I'll just enjoy it! That's what music is for, after all!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a Nicely Done Compilation","review":"Throughout the Years The Legend of clapton has been deeply forgotten from all the hypnor ythms produced by mainstream pop. now-a-days People would rather a justin timberlake backed by hundreds of producers then real musicians. Clapton Chronicles is for those of us who despise our current era in Music and Appreciate The sole honesty Of songs like \\"Tears In heaven\\" a soulful song that Clapton wrote for his late child that died in the early 90's. That song alone is probably worth all the money! cause it will guarente a tear in your eye. And the Unplugged Rendition of Layla a soft mellow Track! that has historicle boundaries. This is not your ordinary eric clapton! its soft mellow and takes maturity to listen too. So before you bash it \\"take a look into yourself\\"yours truly the prince of pop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clapton's best fluff recordings","review":"I really like Eric's work and listen to this CD quite a bit, but it showcases Eric's transformation to an adult contemporary artist, not the blues guitarist people know. \\"Running on Faith\\" from the Unplugged sessions is really the true bonus of CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clapton was GOD","review":"If you want a good CD that is solid and you can listen to more than once, go buy Cream Of Clapton. It represent Clapton during his years with the supergroup Cream and also when he went solo. Cream of Clapton is a great CD and is my favorite. All the songs on this so called best of CD are nothing to compare to his early work. And to the guy that said that a lot of people weren't born when he wrote Layla, well no one alive was born when Beethoven wrote Fur Elise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterful....as ever!","review":"As a life-long fan of Eric's, I can but wholeheartedly recommend this album as an ideal way in to his work. I myself was introduced to Eric's work by songs like 'It's in the Way that you use it' and that was the start of a long and fruitful journey into all aspects of his work. To me, the real treasure in this new collection is the new track, (I) Get Lost....so few of Eric's contemporaries would be so open-minded, and adventurous. It was brave on Eric's part to attempt to meld his unique style with contemporary dance rhythms. Of course it invites criticism...I personally think it's sensitive and moving. The sound of EC's voice and guitar are unmistakable, even as he presents his art in new contexts. It saddens me that so many people cannot accept the fact that Eric has moved on since his Cream days. When asked in an interview not long ago why he no longer played in that style, he replied \\"because I've done that\\"....he has indeed, and so much more!"},{"rating":"1","title":"...and \\"for your love\\" was too pop?","review":"It's hard to believe that the blues purist that walked away from the Yardbirds is the same guy responsible for this garbage. Still coasting on the \\"God\\" reputation of the Cream days, E.C. has been turning out this boring, over-produced swill for two decades now. The fact that he's an undeniably gifted guitarist does nothing to salvage his recent output. The man has lost it, in short. Listen instead to his Yardbirds and Bluesbreakers work, and sigh over what might have been."},{"rating":"1","title":"Focus on the Early Days","review":"Eric with Cream was great. Eric with Derek and the Dominoes was unbelievable, but you can stop there.

Then it starts to liven up with his '80s material but the last song with it's Madonna dance beat is completely out of place. A soothing mix of ballads and rockers. You would be better off to buy his other 1999 collection, Blues."},{"rating":"1","title":"A horrible misreprentation of Clapton's career","review":"Considering that this compilation only covers Eric Clapton's career after 1981, I suppose I can't complain too much about the choice of material. But it is still painful to hear former \\"God\\" Clapton ape Michael Jackson on \\"Change The World\\"...he might as well have been singing \\"Heal The World\\" while trying to keep his nose in place, and his older material, which consists mainly of slick pop-rockers and lounge-like ballads, is overproduced and sounds lifeless and bland.If you are just looking for a single-disc compilation, go for \\"The Cream of Clapton\\", which, although not perfect, is much, much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"YET AGAIN!!!!!","review":"Sure he's put out more greatest hits albums than most artists put out CD's and yes there are always the same songs on them, but it's Eric Clapton.

His music is authentic and real and I don't know a soul that wouldn't or hasn't been touch by his music even if it's only one song. He sings one song at a time but gives us multiple classics. He is, in my opinion the best artist of this time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seriously?","review":"IMHO, this is the worst of Clapton. His early music was awesome, this music is main stream pop @rap they play on the radio. This version of Layla is terrible. It lacks the passion and desperation of the original. Somehow I think if Pattie Boyd had heard this version over the original she would have thought he was kidding around. You want to hear some good Clapton? Check out Cream, Derek and the Dominos, Blind Faith, The Bluesbreakers or just some older stuff before the radio friendly muzak started coming out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrifically competent wallpaper from a former god","review":"There's no doubt that Eric Clapton is one of the best pop guitar players of the recorded era. Nor can there be any denying that at the height of his first era popularity, the music he recorded was also first rate. But in the mid '70's Eric tasted gold with a series of mid-tempo tasteful but frequently less than tasty albums, which served as a template for all that has come since. Though an occasional flash of brilliance shines through, the '80s and '90s music documented here makes for better dinner party wallpaper and beer commercials than anything else. Perhaps worst of all is the lifeless acoustic remake of Layla, which sucks all the life out of the raging original. In the end, this music is not offensive. Which, when you think about it, coming from someone with Clapton's obvious talents, is in itself offensive.dap"},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be banned","review":"How dare the record company call this \\"The Best Of\\" without qualifying it with the label 1985-1999? I'm surprised Clapton himself didn't put up a stink when they released this as it is clearly only a representation of Clapton's songs from the 80's onwards of which 90% were awful and showed the wrong direction Clapton headed. There is no sign of the magic he recorded in the 60's and 70's. The missing magic songs include: After Midnight; I shot the sherif; Let it Grow; Cocaine; Promises; Lay down sally; and of course the original rock version of Layla. To find all these classics, look for the far superior compilation \\"Cream of Clapton\\".And remember, after midnight we're gonna let it all hang out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eric Clapton is the greatest!","review":"I've been a fan of Clapton's from early on, but his past year I've learned to really appreciate his talent.

Clearly inspired by his experiences in the White House, Mr. Libby uses vivid imagery and poetic language to take his readers deep inside a world of political intrigue, child prostitution, kiddie rape, and bestiality. The cigar scene in The Starr Report set the bar high, but Mr. Libby topples it completely with his titillating depictions of young girls being raped by bears. In a scene sure to anger PETA, a man has sex with a deer and urinates in its nose. If you like your novels nasty and neoconservative, \\"The Apprentice\\" will not disappoint."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Deliverance\\" without the Charm","review":"This is simply the worst book I've ever made myself finish. The world sketched here has not one sympathetic character and is filled with evil intent and vile actions. I could not have conceived of scenes with 10 year old girls raped by a bear, hunters debating whether to copulate with a deer, little girls dancing naked for a leering crowd where no one thought such an act either disgusting nor sad. Did I mention the torture scene? Oh, yeah, it is here too. And all of this is delivered up in tired phrasing and confused staging. It does give me some insight into the imagination of the man behind the man behind the man that has brought us abu ghriab and guantanamo.

Lewis \\"Scooter\\" Libby's first novel brought to life for me a fascinating period and place in history (1903, rural Japan) of which I knew very little. The world of the snowstorm-ravaged inn at the center of the story is at times mysterious, dangerous, and sweetly sensual, populated by vividly-drawn characters whose perils and emotions will touch all but the most provincial contemporary reader. Libby's prose is economical, yet remarkably evocative -- I could smell the smoky fire and wet fur in the overcrowded inn, hear the sounds of the violent storm, and feel the stinging of the driving snow against my face.

Susan Faludi destroys false statistical claims (e.g., a woman in her 30's is more likely to die in a plane crash than marry) by investing the methods and motivations behind such studies. She interviews dozens of people from social scientists and military school staff to actors and directors who don't bother to hide their bias in the institutions they run, they studies they publish, or the entertainment they make.

I have been raised by a single mother and I watched her struggle through the misogynistic climate. Four hundred sixty page of facts, statistics, interviews and historical references describing this rage against women, laid out in a clear, organized fashion. Many reviewers have accused her of blaming some conspiracy when she clearly states that it was not an organized, strategical attack but a common belief that surfaced and resurfaced over the course of the decade. While the effects have dwindled, there are still veins of it in our society. There is nothing advocating violence, revolution, or any male bashing so please don't share your insecurities."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Book","review":"The thing that I love about this book is its use of hard facts. It systematically goes through Anti-Feminist arguments and breaks them down using statistic after statistic, yet it is still so well written, that it is really a pleasure to read. I have always considered myself sympathetic to the feminist cause in a vague sort of way, but this book has inspired me to look at problems facing women in a more concrete and active way. I do not consider this a man-hating book as some other reviewers have suggested, but I can understand their exasperation with this book, because it convincingly attacks the very ideas that people against feminism use to attack it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Identity","review":"Faludi doesn't tell women -- or men -- how to act. She doesn't say women need to have a career to be satisfied, or that they need two kids and no job to be happy (etc.). She says that women, just as men, should choose their own, individual identities, and what's more, that we all should be free to do so. Some women (and some men) choose to stay at home with the kids. Other women (and men) choose to have careers with kids, others careers with no kids. The point is, \\"we are not two species, but two sexes\\" (I quote from the book). We are all individuals, and we all have the right to choose what we want to do with our life, without overwhelming influence from the media. And Backlash does an excellent job at reminding us of this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure Fact","review":"Isn't it increasingly obvious that the backlash figures Faludi writes about are among us? They have written comments on this very book that seeks to unveil their incompetence and shaddowed conspiracy. I will give them the benefit of the doubt that perhaps, since they never finished the 8th grade, most of Faludi's concepts are beyond their comprehension. The work itself is truly magnificant! The research is overwhelming and exhaustive - to a good point! I reccommend this book for women and men everywhere who want to read about the truth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Has it achieved its purpose?","review":"Some of the horror stories from the 1970's and 80's would not happen now. Does that mean that Faludi was over-estimating the power of the backlash? or does it mean that she stopped it by means of this book? Of course a lot of other horror stories are still happening, especially outside the United States and Western Europe (although she seems to limit herself to the USA). A lot of the data is squishy and some (I suppose inevitably) is erroneous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Women Don't Need Men","review":"For all you fathers out there who have had to fight with the tenacity of a pit bull for a modicum of visitation rights with your own kids, it may seem difficult to understand how feminists could be so livid - and so full of hate. I speak not only for myself, but for male friends, co-workers, and family members who have lost their homes, a good percent of their income, and have been told by their ex-spouses, girlfriends, and the court just how little time they may spend with their own children.It seems men are just a gang of aggressive tyrants. Of course, they are certainly convenient when it comes to fathering children and paying the bills, aren't they! I find the book to be a declared war against men. I wish a feminist could experience what it feels like to be a disenfranchised father, with the unspoken cultural belief that you're not a man if you show your hurt.

That Faludi is now a star with a new book out and an editorship at Newsweek just goes to show how thoroughly feminized America (and the whole publishing and media industry) has become. Plus, Faludi is just plain wrong about how \\"career-minded women are generally not husband-starved loners on the verge of nervous breakdowns.\\" She hasn't dated \`em, and many are just exactly that. Pop culture is too easy a target for someone who went to Harvard, but you won't find any deep and meaningful insights in this sad excuse for investigation and research. A forest of trees died needlessly. . .the declared war on *men* by feminists, which this book attempts to justify and smokescreen, is where attention should be focused. Read Farrell's \\"The Myth of Male Power\\" for an antidote."},{"rating":"1","title":"Narrow minded and inflammatory","review":"Reading this book will enlighten you about one of the core problems in male-female relationships caused by extreme feminists like Faludi. She doesn't seem to understand the real differences (biological and otherwise) between men and women.What's sad is that some women buy into this propaganda and believe that they should do what they want when they want and how they want even if they've chosen to be married where one needs to compromise often."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yeah, right...","review":"This book is a work of hate. The hatred of men. That is what Faludi and women like her promote. Half way through this book, I felt the same way I did when I was reading Clancy's Red Storm Rising. \\"The war effort continues.\\" Red Storm Rising was about a Soviet plan to conquer Western Europe.This book isn't a battle plan on how to conquer men. It just talks about all of the troubles the war effort was having in the 80's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absurd by-product of Anita Hill brouhaha","review":"This became an enormous hit right after the Anita Hill-Clarence Thomas brouhaha (remember that?).

Some would criticize \\"Tinderbox\\" for being more \\"pop\\" and less \\"gothic\\" than the Banshees' previous releases. It's perhaps true that the music is less adventurous, and the style is different than their previous releases; but it's more accessable and easily the most consistent album they produced. But don't think that the album is less dark and brooding as a result - it isn't. \\"Tinderbox\\" is a very somber, moody and atmospheric set of songs. Siouxsie Sioux's vocals are at their best, and the rest of the band does excellent work (John Valentine Carruthers' ethereal guitar work is sadly underrated). The album is solid from start to finish (including \\"Cities in Dust,\\" which should not be dismissed for being radio-friendly). \\"Party's Fall\\" is probably my favorite, but all the tracks are winners. Gloomy and exhilarating, I give \\"Tinderbox\\" my strongest recommendation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully Dark, Melodic Classic","review":"This is probably the Banshees' most immediately accessible album, and it is also one of their best. The lyrics are as dark as ever, but it never sounds overwhelming. To my ears, Tinderbox ranks with Juju at the very top of their catalog, although it is a very different style of album. The sound is definitely guitar-driven alternative rock circa the mid 80s. The songs are excellent. The album is most known for the single Cities in Dust, but The Sweetest Chill and the trio of songs that immediately closed the original album (on my aging vinyl) are much better: Party's Fall, 92 Degrees, and Land's End. This album also works as an album with a cohesive sound and theme.

So who cares??"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent 80s Show!","review":"Having only recently become a Rick Springfield fan, I wasn't too sure what to expect from this DVD. Having just watched it, I can confirm that I'm now a bigger fan than before! Rick had an incredible amount of energy to be able to jump around, dance, play guitar & piano, and give a very strong vocal performance for the entire show.Several tracks from TAO (Dance This World Away, State Of The Heart, Celebrate Youth) are music videos rather than live performances, and they add a sense of variety to the show. Personally, I would have liked to have had a few more videos added as bonus features, but that's besides the point.Rick manages to shift the mood between his very personal and touching song about his father's death (My Father's Chair), and an excellent performance of Jessie's Girl in seconds!I would highly recommend this DVD to all fans of 80s power pop, and anyone who wonders why Rick Springfield was such a success!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Go back in time and enjoy the ride!","review":"Being a young Puerto Rican in the US, this is the CD that keeps me going on when living so far from my island.

The contemporary masters CD from 1991 is terrible.I just got my hands on the Japanese mini LP from 96. the sound is amazing.

Miles does not solo at anywhere near the peak of his powers--he sounds depressed or ill to me. The first two sides are generally cohesive and strong, if rather simplistic. Sides 3 and 4, everything after \\"Maiysha\\", are not nearly as interesting and are often downright dull. Once you get past the fact that the music is sometimes exciting on the surface due to its funkiness and screeching guitar solos, there is just not that much substance here. Miles' playing is certainly several levels below what he was playing on \\"Bitches Brew\\" and \\"Jack Johnson\\".

This is really unfortunate since if you thumb through the book there are useful bits of information hidden away, but finding them is nearly impossible.They should pull this printing, burn it, and reprint after the corrections have been made."},{"rating":"1","title":"good for your library, not much more","review":"alright, but a delves a little too much into theory and Instrucitonal design... not as much advanced info as I would have liked."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing Great","review":"I recently went to a bookshop to see some books on multimedia. I went through the Table of Contents and flipped through this book. Took about 20 minutes to go through the book.The book is for the beginner level only.Nothing great about it.

I typically learn best by playing with software and using the manual to construct my own exercises. However, I knew Authorware was pretty complex so I thought this book would help. Well, it did help a little but overall I became quite frustrated with following the book's exercises. As I use Authorware I imagine I'll keep this book on my desk as a reference tool.

I know that I've had a few delicious wines, and I swear I'm going to try to write down their names when I'm at a restaurant, but invariably forget. The Renaissance Guide is a helpful reference to a person like me as it contains guidance from real experts. I thought that the interviews captured both the personalities of the chefs and the knowledgeable authors, but also gave useful information - and they were fun to read. While to a true onephile, like the character in the movie \\"Sideways,\\" this information might be considered basic, to most of us the primer on wines in the second chapter will be informative. And for the person who already knows wine, I'm certain that there are nuggets and ideas that they will enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not As Good As You Think","review":"I have an older polaroid camera that takes better pictures than this one.

I used it after the birth of each of children to ease myself back into exercise. This workout is also good for beginners or people who have been out of the exercise loop for a while as it is easy enough to tackle but you still feel like you got a good workout. If you are a regular exerciser this won't be a huge challenge for you, however, because the workout is so nicely done, it is still worth using on a light day or, as I do, at night to supplement your morning exercise - to burn some extra calories, get in some extra toning - especially abs and legs - and it will leave you feeling more refreshed unlike a more intense workout that can leave you feeling wired at night."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Beginner CD","review":"I am new to Pilates and I found this CD to have everything a beginner needs.

Tracey explains everything well and gives you reminders at the right time to make sure you are doing the exercise properly. I gained some weight a while ago and remembered I bought this (for really cheap compared to other dvds) and since I have been dieting and doing this on a regular basis I have lost weight, so much that other people have even noticed!

It is worth a try for the amount of money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to follow","review":"I've had this for a while and recently pulled it out of the closet and tried it again. I forgot how good of a video it is. Tracy is very plesant to listen to and she describes the moves very thouroughly. It's not a high impact video but it does get my heart pumping during the standing portion. It's only 30 minutes total so it's probably not enough if you're looking for cardio, but it's a wonderful way to change up your routine.

The instructor, Tracey, is awesome. She's got a positive attitude and explains everything extremely well. Coming from someone who absolutely HATES to exercise, I can't think of higher praise.

I can't say I have a strong knowledge of nobility system in Britain, and only a marginal understanding of British political history, which may have detracted from my enjoyment of this volume, but I found it almost incomprehensible.

The main purpose of this book is to examine the minds of people with no short, medium, or long term plans (disposessed french soldiers) when facing confrontation with an alternate culture in which everything falls under a master plan (the Nazi invaders.) Lots of good commentary between the lines on topics such as human nature, art, sociology, and moderate international politics of the '40s.

These are masterfully crafted songs whose seductive melodies often belie a range of wisdom, feeling and even biting wit that is rare among singer-songwriters.

But I'll give it a try. \\"Descent Part II\\" has all the faults of Part I, and then some. To an utterly stupid storyline, bad directing, and a lack of suspense and the necessary epic feel, Part II adds gratuitous cameos, a nonsensical storyline of Dr Crusher commanding the Enterprise (wasting heaps of time that could have been used to far better purpose), and - YET AGAIN - a \\"no consequences\\" conclusion. Many of these problems stem from the fact that Part I and Part II were written by different people, I suspect. The one good point is Brent Spiner - he does a scarily good job as Lore, now driven by a sense of destiny as well as his own superiority.

What is wrong with the man who wrote these books? My opinion is that Mr. Schwartz is a disturbed and depraved person and he should seek help - not write childrens books. Even more is wrong with the reviewer who decided these disgusting and morally void stories were appropriate for young children.

I'm sure the new artist did his best and is talented, but you could not top the original artwork ever. This has obviously been censored so for the sensitive parents...you know...the ones that will let kids watch Family Guy on TV, but think that effectively scary images are the thing that will twist little Jimmy or Judy's mind.Do not support this heresy on a classic.

Examples of problems: wouldn't download drm managed content online, had problems when downloading itunes purchased music (the first time I've had that problem in 4 years of ipods and itunes), couldn't connect to my corporate VPN, and finally, just as evidence of the lack of QA on this device, the included instruction manuals were for the previous version of the Apple Extreme. The images were of the previous white, button-shaped device.This was a genuine disappointment, and it seemed to stem from bad software and bad QA.

The swing itself is now a lot more enjoyable for me. There is some repetition in the book, and reading about Knudson's time on tour is rather boring.

If your arms are tired, back strained or hands hurt after playing, you are doing something very wrong.This book is the best I have found that explaines how simple a real golf swing is. Use your center, shift your weight and let you arms, hands and club go along for the ride. This will produce the most solid consistent swing. It is truly that simple. The problem is we try and add to much.People who diagree dont understand physics.This book is an excelent introduction into the realities of the golf swing.That said it is a little \\"fluffy\\" and long winded but I challange someone to find a better, more simple way of explaining the secrect to great golf."},{"rating":"1","title":"total crap","review":"Do not waste your money.

This one was a bit better than most anything else she has done in a \\"star\\" capacity. The computer generated effects though obvious where not that bad, and the action sequences where fun and well shot. Bai Ling has not yet reached the level of 'actress' yet, but does pull off about 75% of this flick pretty well. Unfortunately her talent, or lack there of does show through in enough scenes to reinforce the rumors of her inabilities. Costuming was a hoot.

Too much biography of famous contemporary ceramic artists (totally uninteresting - these are not names that mean anything to me, so, bleah), but otherwise interesting explanations of different types and techniques. A very worthwhile book - it will probably either galvanize you into investing in the kiln and materials, or turn you away from it, saving your money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes, it's that good","review":"For the children, the art is wonderfully warm and appealing so they just keep bringing it back to be read again.For the parents, it gets the kids to sit and be read to and, most importantly, the art is warm and comfortable enough and the prose lends itself to sound effects and play-acting so that you don't feel like fleeing the country when your child brings it up to be read for the 500th time.All of this series are very good but, in my opinion, this is the best of them all. In fact, it's my daughter's favorite book and has been for over 6 months.

The remainder of the album is upbeat, catchy, and pure fun to listen to. \\"The Night Santa Went Crazy\\" is an instant classic. And, incase you didn't know, the song \\"I Remember Larry\\" has a backward message that is as funny as the song itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bad Hair Day? Call In Sick!","review":"Okay, this was his...let's see...his tenth CD,made in March 1996. I know personally, I bought this for one song: Amish Paradise, which was the bigcheese of the album, I believe. But truth be told, it is one of the best, but ultimately not the onlyattraction of the cd. The song after it, Everything is Wrong, is just as good, upbeat, and happy. And thevery last song-The Night Santa Went Crazy, has a Christmasy sound, but good for year round listening.Overall: Five Stars, more if I could.

I remember Larry may be a tad bit overboard, but just for SMALL kids. Anyone who understands this guys just playing will laugh really hard.

Sure, the cover proves alluring and quite hilarious, but beyond the brilliant Coolio/Stevie Wonder parody \\"Amish Paradise\\", and spunky PUSA (The Presidents Of The United States Of America) parody \\"Gump\\", the rest of the CD demonstrates pure comic turmoil and disillusionment. Not only are the remaining 10 tracks more annoying than hilarious, but also they completely lack the comic genius we once heard on albums \\"Off The Deep End\\", \\"In 3-D\\", \\"Dare To Be Stupid\\", and even his ultimately average \\"UHF\\".

If he would've done this from the beggining, he would be the main guy in music right now. They were sent in to clean up this gangster stuff, which they got accused of being Gangsters themselves.

I looked at several products and this one blows away the competition. The product is very accurate and compact to carry. The only downside to this product is that you will need to push the device in the tire valve several times to get an accurate reading. Therefore, it will take you 2 or 3 tries before you get a correct reading. But remember that each try is about one second, so no big lost of time. HERE IS A BIG NEGATIVE POINT: ONCE THE BATTERY GOES LOW OR DIES, THEN THE ENTIRE PRODUCT DIES AS WELL. THIS MEANS YOU CAN NOT REPLACE THE BATTERY. THE PRODUCT WILL NOT WORK.

At some point the album had been crushed in such a way that the record itself pushed through the top and bottom edges of the jacket. Unfortunate damage. Luckily I do t really care, but a lot of collectors would."},{"rating":"2","title":"What would you do? With all your power!!!","review":"Reading all of these reviews I was expecting a huge departure on this Lips' album than their previous three. Everybody was going on about how this album dropped the conceptual label that they had been so attached to. People implied that this was just a series of random songs, not tied together. Well, I disagree, I think the sound is similar to their last two albums and there are plenty of concepts floating about. The album gets off to a blazing start and stays interesting until the bloody end. Another great album from those strange bloaks in Oklahoma."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Have for Do-it-yourselfers!","review":"Learn from the best and benefit from the author's many years of personal experience.

What results is a twist on both worlds not easily forgotten and refreshing to enjoy. Because this book is from the 80's, I would recommend reading this with your child, to explain all the background Pamela Service draws upon. Nuclear war isn't as big an issue as it was then, and Arthur isn't as well read as it was then. Most younger children may find it confusing because they have not grown up with both worlds in the background.

Winning at the DMC's as well as modernizing the way one manipulates the turntable. This album can of course get repetitive, but singles aren't always the most interesting things to buy. There are occasionally a bad mix and there are very few songs on these smaller albums. Singles are not usually a person's top albums. However, eventhough fellow ISP member, Q-bert, is a phenomenal dj who puts out dazzling albums, his success and style is in great part due to MMM. So, the hype is real, mix master is a phenomenal dj. He is and will always be one of the greatest dj's ever.

They feel great, not the best flannel but nice all the same. But after washing it 3 times within one month the fabric really weakened and the flat sheet tore. Later the fitted started getting holes. So since this was rather cheap I am not horribly sad about it.

And words like \\"Luxury\\", \\"Deluxe\\", \\"Special Edition\\", etc, in the product name mean nothing except that the manufacturer's marketing department is doing their job.After washing & drying these once, the fabric is already starting to ball up (pile?) and my dryer filter was stuffed with a half-inch thick layer of fuzz. (Yes, I cleaned out the filter before drying these, so I know that everything in the filter is from this product.)

Joan Sutherland unfortunately has neither. Her technique carries her through the music but she barely explores the dramatic possibilities. Her declamation during \\"Giusto Cielo\\" and her entrance in Act One is embarassingly bad and her death scene is reminiscent of Lucia di Lammermoor. The production is a head-scratcher. Why set the opera in the late nineteenth century when Adrienne Lecouvreur was a historical figure of pre-Revolutionary French theater. The reference to Moliere being in the audience during the first act thus makes no sense nor does the presence of an Abbe. The supporting cast is more than adequate (except for John Shaws woofy Michonnet) though they seem to have to watch Bonynge continually. The sets and costumes are quite opulent"},{"rating":"2","title":"Joan Sutherland is amazing","review":"Joan Sutherland is amazing in this production.

Given the overheated reviews found here on Amazon I expected much, much more; but, although innocuous enough, the songs on this CD are neither particularly original nor at all memorable, and after 10 listless listens-through, it's clear that it's not going to be a keeper. Indeed, compared to Waits or Young, Gelb's lyrics are incredibly trite and his music is forced, clunky, and evocative of nothing in particular--the album's a real yawner. Perhaps it's one thing for long-time followers of Giant Sand, but if you're new to Gelb's sensibility, as I was, I'd recommend thinking twice before purchasing this album.

Saberhagen short-circuits this by changing sides! His favorite vampire uses his abilities to help humans, frequently at his own peril. This book illustrates this without pushing it to extremes, and he allows the poor humans to intervene decisively at critical points. A very good read or re-read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another of Saberhagen's Dracula series.","review":"An Old Friend of the Family was the first of Saberhagen's Dracula I read (many years ago) and it is still one of the best. While not as long or as meaty as some of his later books in the series, it is an excellent read with just the right combination of mystery and danger."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Fiend in the Family","review":"I didn't particularly like The Dracula Tapes, but I thought that might have been because it seemed forced; Saberhagen was obliged to stick with the \\"facts\\" as written by Bram Stoker, which produced some very silly and unintentionally comical results.I was sufficiently entertained so as to be drawn to a second novel, hoping that the author might do better when not fettered by the chains of existing narrative. I selected \\"An Old Friend of the Family\\" because it is an early book and might still retain something fresh.I was dead wrong. Writing in 81, Saberhagen makes attempts to modernize his tale of Dracula coming to rescue Mina Harker's descendants but those efforts now seem dated and comical. The entire setup, about Morgan Le Fay and her minions, seems forced. And kidnaping Dracula by whacking him on the head with a wooden stake just seems ridiculous.This book is the one that pretty much convinced me not to bother with the rest of the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Divine instrumental","review":"I am very selective of music for relaxation/meditation/comtemplation. The kinds that resonate with me are those that do not include vocals. If you enjoy string instruments and the flute this album is perfect.

It is interesting how we experience certain emotions as a result of years and years of conditioning. I have since tried to listen to this cd with an open mind and heart. And it will take you places.

Ruskin told this story 150 years ago, and Feyerabend told it more recently: imperfection is human, we need humane design.This book needed more thought and theory.

The paragraphs on defining a home were fantastic - I even wrote up that segment and sent to quite a few of my friends.Where this book fails, for me, is the extreme self-indulgence of the author. I'm a fan of elitism - we should be as elite as we can possibly be. That word is nice. But there is elitism, and then there is the self-love that this book is all about. The whimsical writing contrasts heavily with her judgementalness and her own severe issues.For every 2 times I quoted the book in a positive nature, I found myself quoting double the amount of passages in a \\"jeez, someone is full of herself\\" manner.

Period.","review":"Ugh! I loved Susan Matthews' three previous novels, but Avalanche Soldier is hideously amateurish -- did she write it a long time ago, and only publish it now? The writing is choppy; the plot color-by-number; the emotions unconvincing; the religious backdrop derivative; the characters unengaging. I lost count of how many times the stupid heroine lost consciousness, and how many important plot points happened while she was unconscious. My disappointment was such that I tossed the book right in the wastebasket upon finishing -- and I only finished it as a result of nagging incredulity: how could this drivel be written by the same woman who'd written the wonderful Prisoner of Conscience, etc.? SHAME on the author and publisher for fobbing off genuine fans with this rubbish."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun quick read with plenty to think about later","review":"This is way different from author's previous, and I liked both. This story goes down so quick and smooth that it wasn't till days later that I started really thinking about some of the ideas that it had raised in my mind that had been just sort of rattling around in my head since I read the book. Sure there was meat on its bones that I gulped down whole while I was reading it & digested later, but basically it's an easy read with an interesting plot.It's a deceptively simple story. The heroine goes through a lot of changes and the choice she has to make at the climax of the book was a real doozie -- a great payoff that really tied everything together.There's character-driven stories and there's plot-driven stories, and this one's both. I liked it. Give it a whirl!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Science Fiction or Literature?","review":"As with her other books, _Avalance Soldier_ can only be classified as science fiction because of its setting. This is an excellent study into the psychology of the convert and the inner workings of a religious organization with a charismatic leader. Ms. Matthews has a powerful way with language, simple to read, but complex in tone. Her books touch on the dark side that resides in us all, but with a liberal sprinkling of humanity and emotion that makes it much easier to bear. _Avalance Soldier_ is less dark than _Exchange of Hostages_, _Prisoner of Conscience_ or _Hour of Judgement_, but also of the same high calibur of writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"An intriguing angle on another difficult subject","review":"I liked the question this book tackled. What we think and feel about religious beliefs as a society and how such ideas can grow out of social and scientific events that have nothing to do -- originally -- with religion.It's a passionate subject, which Matthews presents from a dispassionate side. It's an unfamiliar fit but I wonder if it isn't deliberately done? The Andrej books compelled people to identify with a passionate character no matter how much they fought against it. I learned that I could like a man I despised. And the shared passion was enjoyable. Here, where I would feel comfortable with passion (even assume it these days), Matthews doesn't employ it, forcing me to look at the subject matter more objectively.I agree that the story could have been longer. But, I think it's a good read. I'll be interested in seeing what tack Matthews takes in the next book (and I look forward to another Kosciusko book)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major Disappointment","review":"After her previous books I bought this one without a second thought.

The price is 1/5th what my last replacement battery cost. I would recommend this supplier-great price-fast delivery.*NB. It is confusing at times to find the right battery-it does take some investigating on-line. Panasonic has changed the model number as this is an \\"improved\\" battery (smaller with comparable run time). I went to the Panasonic site then a battery site to compare numbers etc. \\"Progress\\" may be good but it ain't always easy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT compatible","review":"Why are you continuing to group the Lenmar LIP07 Lithium-ion Camcorder Battery with the Panasonic SDR-H40GB Hard Drive Camcorder? The dimensions of the Lenmar LIP07 ARE NOT compatible (it's too slim) with the SDR-H40 camcorder -- it does not snap into the port, essentially making it useless.

In all however, this is still worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"BONE CHOMPING POWER!!!","review":"I rarely review things, but I've been highly satisfied w/ our WK8k. I had never even HEARD of the brand, and assumed I would buy an InSinkErator...Until I researched. I love the lifetime in-home warranty factor, and ...well, everything about this.To those who said the installation was a pain, I have to wonder if they're from the competition. My biggest problem regarding installation was my space limitations, no fault of the product.Dad bought an InSink brand for a little more than this one, off-the-shelf from HD/Lowe's, but got 1/2 the horsepower, no sound reduction, and it was to replace an insinkerator............which had developed a leak! And, the InSink Dad owned was no more than ten years old. Thus, I am perfectly happy with going with a brand I've never heard of when I've got the peace of mind of a lifetime warranty.We've had ours for ~six months. So far so good. Works great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"So far so good - Breeze to install","review":"I'm no expert on garbage disposals but this one was so painless to install that I'd highly recommend it to anyone. Especially on the stainless steel sink where you don't need plumber's putty. Start to finish - including cutting and installing a new drain line/trap was about :45. It's also smaller than I was expecting once it's in the cabinet.I have two comments.1. it's too bad more stores don't stock them. you can get insinkerator parts everywhere - different metal parts to match your sink for example.2. I thought it was a little odd that he dishwasher input, the drain output and the cord all exit from the side of the machine in the same orientation. Turned out to be relatively easy to compensate for but when your drain's on one side and your dw comes in from the other it's a little annoying.So far so good though. It's quiet and seems to much all that we've thrown at it."},{"rating":"2","title":"great item","review":"replaced a 20 year old unit. Works just as described and very easy installation. I recommend this to anyone who needs to replace an older or non functioning unit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Buy","review":"I ordered this disposer and installed it a couple of month ago, but haven't used it much. It works just fine for the small items I've put in it though. The install was easy in a sink that didn't have a disposer before. The unit is very quite compared with other disposers that I have owned. At the price I paid, I probably saved around $100, I'm happy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read the instructions carefully!","review":"I had a horrible time getting the unit to install. My spousal unit and I even hauled in a floor jack to try to cram it into place. I finally read the instructions out loud to my wife and found that I had screwed up repeatedly in placing the infamous rubber ring on the top of the unit. Once I placed it on properly, the unit slid into place effortlessly. Boy, did I feel stupid. I spent 3 hours on what would have been a 15 minute job. I have had it for about a month now. It eats everything that my old one wouldn't (the worst being broccolli stems). VERY QUIET unit. I cannot imaging anyone complaining about the noise level."},{"rating":"2","title":"So far, so good","review":"2 1/2 years ago our plumber replaced the disposal that was in place when we moved in. That disposal (which the plumber provided) died young but just out of warranty. Wanted something with a longer warranty. This disposal runs well and has a much longer warranty. Can't comment on installation difficulty; our plumber installed it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Disposal","review":"This disposal works extremely well. It replaced a Badger 5 that was worn out (a cutter came lose and completely froze the unit), I am happy with the way it functions. It make a loud noise when it starts (a one hp motor is powerful) but within one to two seconds it is very quiet. I had it installed by a licensed plumber: the \\"easy fit\\" connection required a call to the 800# (answered within two minutes} to get the alignment correct. If replacing a badger with the three mount bracket the adapter kit will be required unless the sink drain is replaced also ( as I desired in my case).It completely grinds everything I have put in it in the 3-4 weeks that I have used it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"This disposer is great so far. I have had it a couple of months. It runs smooth and quiet and was easy to install. The only setback was, I didn't have an outlet under my sink so I had to remove the plug from the unit to hard wire it. Couldn't beat the price either. Everytime I go into the home centers and see how much the ISE units are and what you get for the money, features and warrenty wise, I can't believe it. I'd recommend Waste King to anybody that needs a disposer."},{"rating":"2","title":"great !","review":"this is a great product line and this is a great disposer.

And higher RPM. Best thing, GREAT PRICE."},{"rating":"2","title":"So far so good","review":"I bought this disposal 2 months ago when my old one died. It was extremely easy to put in, and it took around 30 minutes or so. It may be one of the more expensive disposals, but it certainly does the job. I've seen some complaints about noise, but I don't really have any. It's not whisper quiet, but I don't run it for extended periods of time either so it doesn't seem that bad to me. Also, power was more important than noise to me, but everyone's needs are different. This disposal certainly delivers on power."},{"rating":"2","title":"Waste Ling L-8000 Waste Disposal","review":"Delivery was very prompt and product was as-expected (new in box, not a reconditioned unit). Installation was very easy (I was replacing an existing disposal) and instructions were clear, pictures helpful. Unit is much quieter than the previous unit, a pleasent surprise as most past disposals I've owned were somewhat noisey. Have used it 5-8 times a week for ordinary household, after the initial 30 days I am very pleased with the quality and performance. Only concern is the 'lifetime' warranty. The company does not require you to register the unit (as many household electronic manufacturers do). Yet to be determined if and when I'll need to contact the company how easy they will be to do business with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worked as advertised!","review":"Replaced an old Kenmore (15 years). The instructions were easy to follow and even though I had some other plumbing issues the whole process went very well. The Waste King is much quieter than the Kenmore and it has worked great for us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Would Highly Recommend!","review":"Great price! Great product! And a lifetime warranty! Where else can you get that?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Waste King L-8000 exceeds my expectations","review":"This unit replaced a 1/2 hp In-Sink-Erator that started leaking through the seal and motor. No complaints about the old unit - it lasted many years and always did the job. But, when shopping for a new unit it seemed like Waste King offered more - more hp and higher end material - for less money. In-Sink-Erator really promotes quiet operation, while Wast King does not emphasize that benefit as much. But in actual operation, this Waste King runs very quietly, especially when actually chopping food waste. It may be due to being a much larger capacity than our previous unit. Regardless, I am please with the sound level and delighted with how well in handles food scraps. Installation was easy, since it was a replacement unit. I highly recommend Waste King, and this model in particular."},{"rating":"2","title":"so far so good.","review":"I have installed this stuff, cost me 2 hours, but the first hour is used to remove the old one, :(.

The only concern is that it contains some yellow stuff inside the disposer, and i had thought it is a used one, but not have guts to send it back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Waste King L-8000 Legend Disposer","review":"This purchase was a replacement for an earlier model Waste King disposer that went out after 10+ years of heavy service. Unit was very easy to install, runs very quiet, and never misses a beat no matter what you feed it. The L-8000 at 1 HP is actually a step up from the 3/4 HP model we had previously. Price on Amazon was about a third of what the big box stores were asking for the same model. Amazon shipping was fast and convenient to my door.There was nothing to dislike about this transaction. You should be very happy with your new Waste King L-8000 Legend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Waste King L-8000 Legend Series 1.0 hp disposer","review":"The entire experience of this disposal has been great.

Haw!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Plastic and flimsy","review":"I bought this because Consumer Reports rated it highly. My plumber went to install it today, and said that he'll never install it again. It's plastic (instead of stainless steel) and flimsy, and a pain to install.

In a nutshell, it was LOUD, LOUD, LOUD, vibrated a LOT, HUGE (too big), ugly, and did not come with a brushed stainless sink flange (the chrome flange against a stainless steel sink looks cheap). We returned it and got the Insinkerator Compact. I was very disappointed after reading all the good customer reviews here on Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"cracked","review":"Gave this as a gift for Christmas and recipient just had it professionally installed in April.....very defective...large crack. He had to purchase a decent one from a home store. Installer said he had seen this same kind from Cosco that was cracked also. Very dissapointed in purchase and as a loyal Amazon customer will be very skeptical about future purcases. Expensive product so my advise is not to buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective!","review":"Ordered this disposal for a kitchen remodel. Paid a plumber to install and after 45 minutes of trying to figure out why there was a leak under the sink determined that the disposal was leaking from the bottom. Back to the drawing board, had to purchase replacement through the plumber--more expensive, and then pay for more time$$$$$ to install the second disposal. Would not recommend this brand. Guess you get what you pay for. Very expensive proposition. Fortunately Amazon was great and took the disposal back even though past the 30 day normal return policy.

It works great and is very powerful for disposing of waste. I can not think of anything that is not excellent about this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great","review":"This unit replaced an Insinkerator 777SS model that was about 7 years old. The old model would not shred the food fine enough so the sink drain would always get plugged. I kept a plunger under the sink just for that reason.The Waste King does not do that. I have run various foods, especially onion peels, without the sink plugging. You can tell by the sound that this operates at a higher RPM that my old unit. Other people have complained about it being noiser than an Insinkerator, which it is, but not objectionally. It is actually noiser if the water goes directly in the center of the drain, probably due to the higher speed. Move the water out of the center and the unit is only slightly louder than the Insinkerator. I can put up with a little louder noise rather than the sink plugging all the time."}]`),C={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:E},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:x,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},O={class:"card-container"},B=["disabled"],M={key:0},N={key:1};function W(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=y("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your SNAP 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",O,[(a(!0),i(w,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(a(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",N,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",M,"See more"))],8,B)):b("",!0)])}const R=d(C,[["render",W],["__scopeId","data-v-de0a0d62"]]),j=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"glossary/13.md","filePath":"glossary/13.md"}'),H={name:"glossary/13.md"},P=Object.assign(H,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(R)]))}});export{j as __pageData,P as default};
