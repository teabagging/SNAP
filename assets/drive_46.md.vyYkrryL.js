I was hoping this book would give me ideas....especially on work-a-bility of patterns with challenging yarn. That is perhaps not a fair test, I admit.This book is loaded with designs for fizzy, hairy yarns. As a result, everything looks very dated. I found almost nothing that would work with \\"my\\" novelty yarn, a slubby Gedifra number. I would wear almost nothing I see in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Receiver","review":"I've been very pleased with this receiver.

Current speaker (non powered subwoofer) would not work so I bought the onyko speakers system. 98 connections on the back panel! Hook up anything.

I like it a lot and would purchase it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value, but CLICKS","review":"This is a good receiver for the money and I purchased it after doing a fair amount of research. However, if you are going to use this with HDMI be warned that the unit 'clicks' quite a few times as it negotiates the proper HDMI signal from the component to the TV. For example, when playing a Blu-Ray movie using a PS3 the unit will typically 'click' about 8 times before the movie kicks in... this is NOT the fault of the PS3. The click is the sound of the internal hardware relay... pretty bad design in my opinion but everything else works as advertised... not sure if I'm going to keep the unit, but I will give it 4 stars as it does what it advertises to do."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's solid and great but HDMI is slightly limited.","review":"Everything works great. I don't have any weird noises and think that it is nearly silent when just in the \\"on\\" position.I have only a couple of complaints from my research and using it. Onkyo does not in general have support for HDMI on Zone 2. Not a big deal, but you have to hookup some analog cables to use a device on Zone 2. It's on the last page of the manual, and not in the Zone 2 section of the manual.As others have said, use an analog cable to setup the unit too and the receiver basically sets itself up. Very good overall and all the other features work great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing but boring...","review":"So the story is cool, some of the imagery is cool, but Josh Hartnett as a detective? No. Also, the pace was slow, and really did not give us much of an ending either.Now, I am a big advocate of a movie with subtlety, which most people find slow and boring, but this is slow and boring, and without subtlety. Just a reason to put Mia Kirshner in some sexy scenes before she is killed.Now, this was based on a true event from many years ago, and with true stories, Hollywood normally jazzes them up a bit. Now here, the story was changed and they added some stuff, but you know, it really did not add much to the movie. In the end, the movie is not about the murder or trying to catch a killer, it is about trying to gets more girls to woo over this Josh Hartnett person that can't act to save his life."},{"rating":"1","title":"A trainwreck from beginning to end...","review":"Wow...what a disaster...Though I do have to give De Palma SOME credit...he may be the only director in history able to get Scarlet Johannsen to come across as boring, dour, and unsexy on screen.

I loved the book but realise that Ellroy's prose and complex plotting do not make for easy transition to the screen. But it can be done. Hello LA Confidential. And so the incomprehensible mess that is The Black Dahlia is just a major, major disappointment. Even for one who has read the book it is unforgivably confusing! The film seems to have no focus and despite it looking fabulous it is completely devoid of life. And that's all before we get to the last 30 minutes! Now I love high camp as much as the next person but the film's last scene is just laughable - and unfortunately not in a good way. A shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Black Dahlia","review":"I do not own the movie and will not own it. I saw the movie in the theater and it was a very bizzare movie.

That's probably because I read so many negative things about this film, I was expecting the worst. I was enthused, even heading into the second hour but as time went on I began to become less involved with the story. That's probably because none of the characters are likable people that I would care about. With no one to really root for, after awhile the movie loses its appeal.The worst part was the last 20 minutes. It was so sordid, it got absurd. It's too much corruption, sick people, ugly violence and nasty overall attitude. The \\"Linscott\\" family is so bad I could do little but just shake my head in disgust. The whole thing wound up too depressing. When it's over, you want to take a shower.I loved the cinematography and overall 1940s film noir atmosphere. On that aspect alone, this movie almost was a keeper until they went overboard on the seedy stuff in the last 20 minutes. What a shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"This just goes nowhere.","review":"This movie is 2 hours and two minutes long, and it really leads to a bland ending. The story is long and thin, and by the time it gets to the end, I forgot what the significance was supposed to be. The camera work was very stylistic and artsy, but that does not make up for just a plain poor story. This is supposed to be a story about two ex boxers who make detective rank, and then become obscessed with horrific murder of a young woman. That ends up being one of many sub plots which just tie this story into one giant tangle of weak, uniteresting plots that I did not care to find out one way or another about.

The Black Dahlia is the kind of 2 hour movie you wanna see when you have trouble falling asleep but need to watch moving objects on a television screen. There was no suspense in this crime drama, and honestly, the best part of the film was the boxing segments in the beginning of the film which truly showed some graphic violence and excitement. Otherwise, I was totally bored and recommend avoiding this movie at ALL costs. The only thing nice about the film was the scenery presentatation which truly looked like something from the 1940's. The suspense came in the way of slowly-moving scenes that bordered on old-fashioned romance segments and soft-soften romance bits. Yuck. A film you need to NEVER watch under any circumstances."},{"rating":"1","title":"shouldn't the movie be about, you know, the subject of the movie?","review":"I just finished watching on TV.

This was a bad film with actors spouting cliched/bad dialogue. Avoid if you're thinking of buying. Better off watching it and then decide."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Black Death","review":"Sort of \\"The Big Sleep\\" on meth. De Palma clearly wants to revive the classic film noir experience but has instead created a monster, a movie that is more undead than alive. Who would have guessed just how bad Hillary Swank and Scarlet Johansson could be? It takes an iron will to watch this to the end, but unless you do, you can't truely appreciate the depth to which De Palma is willing to plunge in his exciting denouement. Quite possibly the worst movie of the year, an Ed Wood movie on a major Hollywood budget."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to stay awake.","review":"I found that this movie had a great ending, but that was the only part. My husband fell asleep, and I had to fight to the end. There is no build up of the story line. I did, however, enjoy that I was not expecting the ending that I got (although, I was extremely tired!)

If you've never read the book, then you will be utterly confused by the ending. Either way you probably won't enjoy the movie. It's not the fault of the actors. The performances are good all around but when you're not given much to work with you can't expect miracles. I give the movie two stars only because of the performances and the design of the film which is very stylish. Other than that, the film's a real stinker."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't waste your time","review":"i was hugely dissapointed in this film. i know it's based on a book, but the movie itself is nothing to rave about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Black Dahlia Murdered again","review":"I was looking forward to this film with great expectations.

I will say to fans of Ellroy, the original book, etc. This film has NOTHING to do with those. They take some names, the Dahlia murder and mush it up with the worst, unbelieveable inane story. There is even a note at the very end of the film (which was too small for me to read on my tv screen) that said something like they use the characters and settings, but this is loosly based on the original novel.What was DePalma thinking? One could almost see a line of thought that said \\"let's make another....L.A. Confidential...no wait! let's make it like an old 40's film...no wait! let's make it like \\"Chinatown\\"!

The story meandered endlessly, yet went no where. I still don't quite understand more than I already knew - once there was a woman who was murdered and the case was never solved. What that had to do with the characters in the movie is beyond me; and what their interpersonal issues were, were vague and annoying.How sad. What a waste of talent.

There is so much talent wasted in this film that it just makes one wonder if Hollywood has lost its way! This film should definitely be taught in film school as to what happens when someone with almost no talent rises to this level (that would be Mr.DePalma)and continues to make films with the pretense of great art when in reality, they are just plain bad.The storyline here is completely lost in the mess of spinning cameras, POV's and noir that isn't noir at all. The only thing this movie has going for it is Hillary Swank doing a very bad Catherine Hepburn impersonation (which is laugh out loud bad). I guess it was that excellent direction - this is as bad as it gets!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply the worst...","review":"Seriously, the worst film I've ever seen.

The only redeeming thing about it, was Mia Kirshner who gave an amazing performance as elizabeth short.

Excellent 40's era sets and costumes.... a great moody atmosphere.Weakness = story, pacing, character development."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is not Television","review":"Television has ruined the ablility of movie fans to stay focused. So many of us are attuned to 8 minute bytes. This film is an excellent \\"noir\\" but it requires the patience of a literate adult! Yes, there is a lot of dialogue; but it all has a reason. The production values are excellent. The acting is top notch; just look into Josh H.'s face for the unspoken dialogue - he's excellent. This is NOT for the 15 to 25 year old crowd. It's for us grownups. Thank God someone is still makeing movies for us. Calm down - watch \\"The Big Sleep\\" first, and you'll see the tradition from which this one comes. Hitchcock once said about a negative comment concerning one of his films: \\"It's only a movie!\\" I suggest you'll enjoy it more if you keep that in mind. Don't mind the children; watch this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"She looks just like that dead girl!\\"","review":"The Black Dahlia is a great book but a bad movie. The actors in this film are going to take a lot of heat, but that is unfair; when all the performances are bad, it's the fault of the director. Some people are calling for Brian DePalma to retire and, on the basis of this film, they may have a point. It's not just that it's bad, it's aggressively bad - the kind of bad that takes real work. The audience I saw this with was laughing through the whole thing. Indeed, it is the type of film that Mystery Science Theater 3000 would appreciate. The only thing I can think of was that DePalma was trying to parody the conventions of noir: the tough guy detective lead, the voice-over narration, the over-the top acting and dialogue. The trouble is, it doesn't come off as tongue-in-cheek - it just comes off as bad. The only actor who really does a good job with her part is Hilary Swank - because she does play it for laughs."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was a great book...","review":"Elroy's first entry in the L.A. Quartet books (along with L.A. Confidential, etc.) is a crime fiction classic. Brian DePalma's incoherent attempt at bringing it to the screen, sadly less so. Hartnett's Spock-like delivery, Johansson's oddly detached line-readings and Eckhart's minor role combine into a perfect storm of bland movie-making. Hilary Swank, however, comes across as strangely appealing and Mia Kirshner affects a palpable sadness and desperation. Unfortunately, these could not rescue this film; I could conceivably eat some Alphabits cereal and poo out a better and more logical script."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad acting anyone!?","review":"The Black Dahlia is hideous and I'm being kind here. I can't believe this movie is directed by Brian De Plama (Carrie, Dressed to Kill). He must have been desperate to direct this crap. Hilary Swank's acting is actually worse than Jost Hartnett's. The plot goes nowhere, the nude scenes are embarrassing, and the movie is shot in complete blackness, I could hardly make out a scene. I couldn't find one person who enjoyed this filth. The Black Dahlia is one of the worst films of 2006, now I know why this movie did horrible in the theaters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two Hours Of My Life I'll Never Get Back","review":"This movie is awful. I was interested in seeing it, after seeing various news shows about The Black Dahlia murder. I really thought it would stick more to the real story, even though so much is unknown about it. But, to my disappointment it is a totally fictional story, that just happens to take place when Elizabeth Short was murdered. The story even makes up a fake confession, that made me feel like I was watching an SNL skit got awry. I had much trouble following it, mainly because everyone's speech was so unclear, and there was so much in the movie that was completely pointless. The constant background music tried too hard, and got on my nerves.I think it is true that Elizabeth Short had a questionable social life, but to portray her as doing lesbian porn against her will, and prostituting herself, is very disrespectful towards a real woman, who really was murdered, and who undoubtedly still has relatives who are alive and well. Shame on you Mr. Ellroy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow, boring, this movie sucked.....","review":"What a real loser this was, we suffered for over two hours on this one.

There is really no nice way to say that this movie just stinks. Worse than gym socks. The movie isn't really even about the Black Dahlia. I won't give away the entire plot as I don't want to spoil it (right like it could get worse) but I will say that if you are watching this movie because you care about the history of the actual case, you will be sorely disappointed.

Within the first fifteen monutes of the film I sat there trying to figure out what exactly was wrong with this film. I came up with the following:-Bad acting. Josh Harnett is basically just a pretty face because the guy has almost no emotion at all. Plus, the guy was too young for the role. It made me grimace. All the other actors were okay. They were directed badly so it's not their fault they were in a bad movie.-Bad screenplay. The storyline made no sense at all. I was paying close attention to the plot and I couldn't quite get what was going on. The written dialogue was just plain bad.All in all this was a really bad film. Avoid it. If De Palma wants to take another stab at a noir film he ought to at least have a decent screenplay the next time around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck","review":"If the option of negative stars were available Id give this horrid film a negative 10!

Aaron Eckhart was perhaps the best, followed closely by Fiona Shaw as Mrs. Lindscott. From there the movie disappointed.The dialogue was very difficult to hear, we kept having to put the volume all the way up.The plot was confusing, especially at the beginning and end (when it's most important).Scarlett Johansson was almost likeable, but looked horrible and almost unattractive. She looked as if she were ill and didn't fit the part at all. Swank tried her best, but did not fully pull off Madeline Lindscott. And Josh Hartness, whose performance I enjoyed in \\"LUCKY NUMBER SLEVEN\\" seemed to sleepwalk through this one. I think he was too young or lacked character of facial expressions for the boring slow plotline. Mia Kirschner was entertaining as the murder victim herself, in those screentests which were hilarious."},{"rating":"1","title":"It Will Cure Your Insomnia","review":"I was intrigued by a movie about the Black Dahlia murder, and thought I recall it getting decent reviews when it was in the theatres, but it was incredibly boring. Although I haven't read the book, it can't be as bad as this.Did they forget the movie was supposed to be about the Black Dahlia murder and the investigation? Instead, they relegated that to a subplot in a ridiculously long - and bad - love triangle movie. The sole bright spot was the performance of Mia Kirshner as Elizabeth Short, but that isn't worth sitting through 2 hours. What a huge disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"IT IS REALLY A ZERO RATING.","review":"THE MOVIE STARTS OUT PRETTY GOOD. THE FIRST TWENTY MINUTES OR SO ARE DECENT.

I happen to like Josh Hartnett and the list of the cast looked good. But the movie cheats at every point.It tries to look like a serious \\"noir\\" but then smth like Swank's heroine comes forward and it starts looking like a cheap comedy. Or Fiona Shaw with her histrionics - as somebody already noted here, it is so bad that it is actually fascinating to a certain point.Yohansson is two-dimensional (she usually is) and others are lucky if they reach even 2 dimensions.The overall impression was no-logic, no-visuals, and really cheap."},{"rating":"1","title":"another bomb from Hilary Swank","review":"I have no idea why there has to be yet another take on the Black Dahlia, and Brian De Palma seems to have completely lost any ability to make remotely interesting anything anymore.To top it off, I don't know what Hollywood sees in Hilary Swank at all. First of all, are they all blind. This is not a sexy attractive woman and yet she plays a femme fatale in this.Throw in the whole Scarlett Johansson, Josh Harnett, Aaron Eckhart what is the deal with them? Are they living a polyamorous lifestyle? It's never fully revealed and I couldn't figure out if it was implied or what it had to do with anything. She's wasted in this role and she should have played the femme fatale character.Anyway, it's a complete mess and looks as flat as a made-for-TV movie.Could we put to rest any more Black Dahlia movies.

Instead, it presents the story of two cops that are sort of trying to solve the killing, but are instead distracted by everything else. This is yet another crass Hollywood attempt to cash in on a name. The book \\"Black Dahlia Avenger\\" has been a bestseller for some time now, but this movie comes nowhere close to what the book is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"What a waste of time and money.

The movie was ok but I purchased the movie with intentions of learning more about the Black Dahlia unsolved mystery not about the two investigators life. The movie was almost nothing in regards to the Black Dahlia and it seemed what it did cover was based on no facts whatsoever. This movie was dramatized Hollywood style and used a famous unsolved murder to gain interest. Again the movie had some great actors and was ok of a movie. But it did go in so many directions my head was spinning after watching. Speaks alot about the book the movie was based on. So much for that one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Plain Awful!","review":"I'm glad to see all the negative reviews concerning this film. There's hope after all for those who post their reviews here. The \\"Editorial Review\\" says it all concerning this film. I was 13 years old when Elizabeth Short was murdered & I was living in L.A. where it occurred. It became traumatic for me because I had met one of the apparent suspects & couldn't discuss it when the police questioned me because it involved a personal friend. The book upon which this very badly made film is only loosely based is itself only loosely based on the actual murder case - but it is much more so than this film is.The title is a misnomer. The film is actually about a fictional L.A. police investigator."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mind Numbingly Boring","review":"The Black Dahlia is an extremely disappointing movie. Adapted from the James Ellroy book of the same name, it uses a real life grisly murder in LA as the backdrop for what should have been a fine suspenseful, mystery.Instead, this movie is one of the slowest and mind numbingly boring films I've seen in a long time. The plot not only unfolds at a glacial pace, but the connection between scenes makes it difficult for the viewer to easily follow what is going on. Yes, it's supposed to be a mystery, but even the logical links that the viewer should be catching are hard to follow as the editing, pacing, and direction of the movie are terribly executed. The movie does eventually come together in an utterly undramatic, unrewarding, but merciful (for the viewer) end.A definite thumbs down for the entire production."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just plain bad!","review":"I went into this movie with high expectations and was extremely disappointed. Not only do I wish I hadn't spent money to see it, I want the precious time spent watching it back.

I thought it was about 6 hours long - which gave me plenty of time to think. Did DaPalma think he was taking Chinatown and and L.A. Confidential and throwing them in a blender with a real-life hollywood mystery tacked on? Not a good move. This is as tedious as they come. H. Swank should be forced to return her two Oscars. Her over-the-top (unintentionally hillarious) performance makes Faye Dunaway in Mommie Dearest look subtle. Nobody else fares any better. I think they brought back Gloria Swanson to play Swank's mother! Save your time and money. Or put it on when you need a good long nap!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I had hoped for","review":"I've read the other reviews and they are right.I was greatly disappointed in this movie. Mostly because I expect so much more from De Palma. He has turned out such classics in the genre as 'Dressed to Kill', 'Body Double' and 'Snake Eye' that I was eager to see how he handled the case of the Black Dahlia.In the end he does pull it all together and packages it up for you. However, this movie meanders and actually avoids the subject of the murder. It became so far from the point that I was actually considering turning it off. But I kept going out of curiosity.The plot of this movie grows so many branches it becomes difficult to track so you need to pay very close attention .... even during the boring parts.This movie is based in the true story of Betty Short. Therefore liberties are limited. It would appear that works of fiction play out better for De Palma."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Plain Bad.","review":"Anybody expecting to get a great account of the Black Dahlia case, even fictional, will be disappointed going in to this movie. Of course, I knew that it was a fictionalization of the case, but I had no idea the movie would present its own evidence and draw its own conclusions.They obviously didn't intend to make this a serious movie, but rather it was a cheap attempt to imitate a Film Noir sometimes, a TV mystery sometimes and then other times I don't think they knew what they actually wanted to do.Although the film brings a clearcut finale rather than a vague puzzle, too many loose threads come together too neatly and rather than bringing the film to a satisfactory conclusion, it leaves you scratching your head, is this what I spent the last 2 hours waiting to hear? Overall, there is too much plot, too little character development and a wildly uneven tone. The movie has its moments but it's a blinding mess all together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I Expected","review":"I am a big fan of true crime stories. I was afraid to watch this movie due to how gory the real case was, but I thought I'd give it a shot - I found the case facts fascinating.Unfortunately, the movie was incredibly boring. I could only sit through half an hour before I had to turn it off - I hardly ever do that. Even if a movie is bad, I tend to sit through it just so I can say I watched the whole thing. But this movie was SO slow and confusing and just totally bizarre.The way it was filmed and cut together made no sense to me and it hardly even dealt with the murder; it was more about some moron cop. I'd rather hear about the killer. I don't recommend this movie at all and I'm surprised anyone else could sit through it, let alone give it a five-star rating.If you're anything like me - a true crime lover - steer clear of this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"DEPALMA ENDS HIS CAREER!","review":"GROWING UP WITH DEPALMA, DIGESTING HIS NEO-HITCHCOCKIAN MATRIX HAPPILY,APPROVING POSTERITY WITH HIS INCREDIBLE ABILITY BEHIND THE CAMERA, WHEN YOU EXPERIENCE SUCH RESULTS OF NOW YOU HAVE TO SAY HIS DAY IS PROBABLY GONE-HOW SAD GROPING IS!

CARRIE, DRESSED TO KILL and BODY DOUBLE are some of my favorite thrillers. But there is little of DePalma's visionary direction in this tepid thriller. In fact, so much time is spent on the rivalry between the two detectives that little focus is actually on the murder itself. The script is contrived and puzzling; the performances are far from what you would expect: Josh Hartnett is way out of his league in the role of the heroic cop; the usually dependable Aaron Eckhart doesn't seem to want to be in the movie; Scarlett Johansson and Hilary Swank perform as if they were mimicking Lauren Bscall or Rita Hayworth.

I knew Brian De Palma's reputation had taken a beating in the last decade or so, but I really understand why now. This was easily the worst movie I had seen in a long time. And a warning for anyone who is interested in seeing this film because of the real Black Dahlia murder: \\"The Black Dahlia\\", the film, treats it as nothing more than a springboard and a background. The very real murder is secondary or perhaps tertiary to the silly and contrived plot, and - at least in my opinion - this film trivializes what was the brutal and gruesome death of a very real woman. I would have been embarrassed to have made a movie like this.

The only redeeming component of this film can be found in its all-star cast of screen celebrities, none of which can, despite their best efforts, revive this wretched reel from its well-deserved death. The story, composition, cinematography, and execution alike all fail to meet even the lowest of expectations and instead, make for a wholly underwhelming and lamentable experience.

Actually, any book is better","review":"Intensely boring and tedious interpretation of James Ellroy's fictional account of the most notorious murder in L.A. history and the lives it damaged is directed by Brian de Palma and is easily his worst effort. Chock full of camp and unintentionally laugh-out-loud moments, The Black Dahlia is more melodrama than gripping character study or murder mystery yarn. The actors flounder, overact, spew forth inane dialogue and try to look and sound \\"noir\\" to no avail. The story moves along like a slug. What was that earthquake scene about? There's not enough Betty Short to justify the title. Is this thing called \\"The Black Dahlia\\" or \\"Bore Me To Tears\\"? The book was taut and fast-paced and fun.

This film has little to do (AT ALL) with the Black Dahlia. It is a series of disjointed scenes that are a good depiction of L.A. in the 40's-but that's it. For sensationalistic purposes, the film maker decided to throw in the Black Dahlia case, that has but a few minutes in the whole film. It was an attempt at 'Film Noir' in color.

I kept thinking, \\"Yes, but how in the world did he figure out where ...?\\" Some mysteries like the \\"Big Sleep\\" can overcome incomprehensible plots, but these mysteries need a strong lead like Bogart. Unfortunately, Hartnett does not carry the film. He's ok, but he can't carry all the deadweight of the plot. Swank seems to be channeling both Bette Davis and Harlowe at the same time.

The movie uses the murder to push along a boring love triangle.The movie was so bad I almost fell asleep in it, and one of my friends actually did.I really have no idea what the director was trying with this movie. Is it a love story, or is it a murder mystery? The movie tries to be both, but I feel fails miserably at both. The love triangle was not anywhere near believeable, and in the days of numerous Law & Order, and CSI shows, the murder mystery was so poorly followed, and there was a complete lack on intrigue.The movie just droned on and on and on.

As others have noted, the acting is quite bad, the script incredibly confusing, the direction misguided, and in the end when (FINALLY) the myriad plot threads attempt to come together, there are so many impossible coincidences linking the characters, you wonder that the writers had the nerve to suggest them. Amazingly, as bad as the usually brilliant Hilary Swank is here, the worst performance award must go to Fiona Shaw, an classically trained actress with an incredible pedigree. Is it possible this was supposed to be a comedy, and we all just missed it? Because I was actually embarrassed for these actors. Still, the film looks great, and the boxing match in the beginning was quite good. My advice? Once the bell rings and the match is over, switch to another movie. It's a downhill slide from there."},{"rating":"1","title":"If It Ain't Broke, Don't Fix It","review":"What a disappointment. I bought this DVD in Target on impulse. Bad move, bad movie. While I never read the book, I did see a version of the Black Dahlia a number of years ago starring Lucy Arnaz as Elizabeth Short. It was an absorbing film, compelling, very well done. The major focus was on the mystery of who the Black Dahlia was, where she came from, trying to piece together her life in L.A. It was done in flashbacks showing Elizabeth Short in quick scenes up to the point where she was murdered.This movie rambles on for about an hour before the murder is introduced, and then the focus doesn't stay on it, but bounces around on a bunch of shallow, boring characters. It all has about as much essence as confetti flying around on a windy day. I was sorry to see Hilary Swank in such a feeble production."},{"rating":"1","title":"So much going for it; dismal result...","review":"Despite the cast of A-List actors, the best thing about this film is the glorious noir photography of Vilmos Zsigmund. The acting is unconvincing, and the direction is sloppy, but all elements of production design are first-rate. Mark Isham's score is appropriate, but a little too much like Jerry Goldsmith's \\"Chinatown\\" music, especially the use of the solo trumpet. Mr. de Palma missed on this one, and his cast seemed uninterested in their material. James Ellroy can be given brilliant film adaptation (\\"L.A. Confidential\\"), but not this one. What a bummer. I was hoping for so much more. The DVD extras are more entertaining and informative than the film itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Mr. Fire & Mr. Ice\\" ~ All Smoke & No Substance","review":"Wow, I can't believe how much I disliked this film, especially with the presence of such attractive actresses as Hilary Swank, Scarlett Johansson and Mia Kirshner. There's simply nothing entertaining or engaging about this movie. It's admittedly stylish, but so slow. Making matters worse, there's no sympathetic figure to care about.Ranging from the amoral police practices of officers Bleichert and Blanchard to the rich, perverse and disgusting Linscott family, the storyline drifts through the seedier bars and nightspots of Los Angeles circa late \`40's. The only one to muster a spark of interest is Mia Kirshner in the ill-fated role of Elizabeth Short (Black Dahlia) but her part is so short and interspersed so infrequently through the film it's virtually impossible to maintain your connection with the character. I recommend you pass on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am just sorry that I can't give it a negative number!","review":"Its just a shame in that this film had a good premise on which to build upon. (1940's Los Angeles, The zoot suit riots,The LAPD, Hollywood at the height of its power and a horrific murder that has never been solved.)But instead we get this attempt at a Film Noir that just falls flat on its face. Frankly I am very disappointed, it was altogether a very confused, poorly thought out film that and the actors did a really shoddy job altogether. The only bright spot being the attention to detail for the sets."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks good, but nothing more","review":"What a disappointment. The film looks great, but that's about all that can be said about it. None of the major actors are convincing as mid-1940s characters - they are just people who have dressed up in costumes, but, don't have any sense of the period. Everything about them screams 2006. Brian de Palma has made his share of unsuccessful films, but until now at least they were all interesting. The script is confusing (is it a flashback or not?), there are all kinds of side stories, and it's only at the end that the director and writer suddenly remember that they are supposed to be making a film based on a real killing, and hurriedly come up with as contrived an ending as one might ever see."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"This movie s*cked. The plot was poorly developed, the acting was estranged and it could have been better. It sucked"},{"rating":"1","title":"I remember when this was popular","review":"There once was a day when I would have given the sickness 4 stars. But long since purchasing this, my music collection has grown considerably and I no longer consider Disturbed to be as great as I once thought of them. My despise for them probably came with my complete disappointment with Believe, that record sucked. As for the Sickness I find tracks 1-5, 10 and 11 to be listenable. Everything else is boring. The song Down with the Sickness is the heaviest song here, which was one thing that disappointed me when I first listened to it and has been featured in so many movies that its lost all meaning. Sorry kiddies, but if you want great metal, then you have to look elsewhere, Disturbed only live to disappoint. Check out bands like Malevolent Creation, Slayer, Sepultura (Old), and Vader instead for some real metal."},{"rating":"2","title":"We have found Shakespeare's answer to hard rock","review":"Wow, after hearing Stupify on the radio I must say these guys know how to jam. The lead singer (you know the one whose bald and has chin piercings) is incredibly awesome. His lyrics are like poetry. They are really inspirational. Remind me alot of Shakespear even. I really like Shout 2000. Its very emotional and has a lot of depth. I love this album, and i am down with the sickness for sure!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This got old fast!","review":"I previously gave this album four stars, but I don't know what I was thinking. I should have known I wouldn't have liked this. \\"Stupify\\" is okay, and \\"Numb\\" and \\"Shout\\" aren't bad either, but that's it. Unless you like nu-metal stuff like Korn and Limp Bizkit, you will not like this. (...) Not the worst of the genre, but bad just the same. Give me Iced Earth over this ANY day!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Start of a New Rock Era.","review":"When I first checked out Disturbed on M.T.V. I thought they were amazing! Really moshy tunes and great sounds makes this album extremely good for rock fans or anyone in that matter. It's nothing like the Slip Knot, Korn, Limp Bizkit or Papa Roach sound, it's very original. My favourite is 'Voices' and when you hear it you will always be shoutin' out 'ZORR!' every time u listen. 100% satisfaction guarenteed from a Rock fan! Get this album from amazon and your spirit will be 'zorring'! into the air!"},{"rating":"2","title":"DAMM GOOD METAL","review":"When i first saw this cd i was slighty put off by the cover, i had stupify on a nother album and i was interested to know what the album sounded like. Anyway after a grilling at a local cd store i finally decided to buy it only lisening to half of the album, i got home and was dissapointed will the second half with lirics like (droppin plates on your ass) which made me go off the album. Even though the second half from songs 9-12 are quite rubbish i would recomend this album to anybody ( watch out for songs like VOICES, THE GAME, DOWN WITH THE SICKNESS AND STUPIFY which are top class songs!!!!!! and by the way check out buckcherry if u like punk rock, your in for a treat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"This CD is the best CD I've heard in a long time! Disturbed became my favorite band instantly after listening to this. Every song is unique, making it hard to choose a favorite, due to the fact that when you listen to it, you listen to the whole CD, and not just a few songs. Completely awesome...buy it now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best I've heard in a long time","review":"Gotta get this CD if you're into heavy metal/hardcore. Very diverse sounds, all good. Down with the sickness is a tune you'll wanna hear over and over again. Reminds me of the first time I heard Nirvana, although this is not that kind of metal (harder/has some techno feel on some songs)"},{"rating":"2","title":"We Are Disturbed From Chicago!","review":"Down with the sickness!I caught these guys opening up for Danzig and liked their tunes. When I picked up the CD the next day I couldn't believe my ears! It rocks! It's too bad I didn't know of them before I saw them live, I probably would have enjoyed it more recognizing the songs they sang, but at least I did see them and they did so good I got their CD!Three to four songs are top notch, but the whole CD is pretty darned good. Some songs on first listen I didn't like that much, but after listening to the CD over and over and over again I have found they all are great.Pantera, Almighty, etc. type music fans should dig this.I am so glad I didn't miss this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best NEW Group to hit the Metal Scene in YEARS!!","review":"In a world where it's all been done before and groups like Metallica are causing more yawns than a Presidential address, Disturbed emerges as a much-needed breath of fresh air. I almost gave up on heavy music because I haven't heard a decent metal album in nearly ten years. If you are tired of predictably boring Pearl Jam clones (like CREED!) check out this band! This album made me feel the same way \\"Appetite for Destruction\\" did when I first heard it. This is good music to work out to. I play this CD on my walkman everytime I hit the gym, very high adrenaline music. The music is kind of hard to describe but it's unique. Kudos to whoever signed these guys. Thanks for letting a band sound original for a change."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good","review":"Well the title pretty much says it all. It is a pretty good CD. My favorite songs are voices, Stupefied, fear, The meaning of life, The Game, and Down with the sickness. I would really only reccomend this CD for people who like heavy music or bands like.............. well, theres really not a band like this one that i can think of but this is definitly a heavy CD. Take a chance and by it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breath of fresh air.","review":"I've had this CD since Dec 99, as a friend of mine works for a college radio station and they received one too many advance albums (of new bands that would be released the following year).Among the assortment was this group, which I never heard before. I popped the CD in and while this is not entirely my kind of music (not heavy enough) I was simply amazed at the effort and energy put in. The production, mixing, was good. The actual lyrics left a little something to be desired, but the singer's Reggae-style is kind of catchy (I do like reggae). A good rule of thumb, if you want to keep the listener interested enough in wanting to hear the next song, make it catchy. And the band succeeded in just that.An idiosyncratic mix of N17, Gravity Kills, and Incubus, which is, in the longrun, worth checking out."},{"rating":"2","title":"yeah man, its weird, but youll learn to love it","review":"Hey you guys, i saw the cover of this CD and i was like \\"no way im buying this....\\". But then i heard \\"stupify\\" which freaked me out at first, but i got into it and now i love the CD! I can't say this is a must to buy or anything cuz its so weird, but check it out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This Album Blows","review":"I bought the album, the Sickness thinking that it would be really good like the album Believe. But \\"the Sickness\\" really reeks!The music is ok, but the lyrics are really bad.This album sucks, bottom line. I shouldn't have bought it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kinda repetitive, but I like it.","review":"I don't listen to a lot of \\"nu-metal\\", especially the stuff that sounds like Korn, so I'm kinda surprised that I like this. After hearing \\"Stupify\\", I became addicted to the band, and had to get their album. And, although there is little to set the songs apart, it's really not too bad. David Draiman is a wicked vocalist, he can make some really weird sounds, and, unlike Jon Davis, can actually sing. \\"Stupify\\" is the best song, and most of the songs on here are pretty good, but the album starts to get a bit irritating toward the end. The lyrics start to get really weird (droppin plates on your ass?). There's a cover of the Tears for Fears song \\"Shout\\", which is pretty cool, even though I never really cared for that song. Anyway, this is a pretty strange album, and not terribly impressive, but it ain't too bad. Four stars is kind of a stretch, more like 3 1/2 or 3 3/4. They're no Staind or Cold, but I'll take em over Korn any day."},{"rating":"2","title":"can't say enough good things about this album.","review":"this is an amazing album. if you look down a bit, theres a guy who says he doesn't really review old releases, im kinda the same way. i heard the new disturbed song STRICKEN and it is AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!! so i had to come and review THE SICKNESS.i personally wasn't a big fan of BELIEVE, there were a few good songs but THE SICKNESS is far superior. hopefully this album will re-invent disturbed. in the new song, daves voice is AWESOME!!! he definately has one of the best voices in metal....ROCK ON DISTURBED, cant wait till SEPT 20."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow","review":"When my friend burned this CD for me I was not expecting this. This CD Blew my mind away with tracks like Violent Fetish, Stupify and Fear. I highly recommend this CD and this is by far the best and only good CD by Disturbed to date."},{"rating":"1","title":"MORE PHONY METAL","review":"Who are these guys think they are.

This has got to be one of the worst CDs I have ever heard. I am a fan of the rap/metal combo but this band has taken it too far. Every song is exactly the same, there is no inventive textures, the playing is simplistic, and the lead singer's voice isn't even an attempt at singing it is just flat out screaming. My advice to anyone who thinks they should buy this CD is to go out and buy Korn or Limp Bizkit if you really want a disc from this genre. Better yet, try out Incubus."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painfully Bad","review":"The first time I heard Disturbed, I knew that the death knell for nu-metal had been sounded. A watered down copy of a watered down copy of a good idea, Disturbed take the requisited de-tuned guitars and \\"sick\\" vocals and manage to create something entirely uninteresting. The songs don't feel heavy, the vocalist sounds like a barking hyena most of the time, and the lyrics end up being hilarious more than anything else (\\"No mommy, don't hit me again. . .I'll be a good boy\\"). Rather than creating something new, Disturbed ride the nu-metal wave with minimal success."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is just bad.","review":"Here is another album of guys who want to try and show how angry they can be. The bad thing about this is that there is no substance to it. Just because you can shout profanities doesn't mean your music is going to be good.\\"Stupify\\" is getting the airplay right now. I would not be surprised to see these guys disappear like many other hate bands. This is just noise and nothing more."},{"rating":"1","title":"nothing new","review":"The rock/metal arena in the States is getting stale.

They rank right up there with the annoying metal bands of today like Drowning Pool, System of a Down, and Flaw. If you want good year 2000 metal, pick up aomw Stereomud or Godsmack. The only song I liked on this album was Shout 2000, and Disturbed didn't even write it! And don't get me started on the grunts \\"ooh ah ah ah ah!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Disturbed... and Disturbing","review":"Lyrically, I really wouldn't want to be friends with the author of these songs. However, there is a musical beauty and power beneath the ugliness of the themes that makes this one of the best albums of the past decade. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"hope this helps","review":"I love this cd its my favorite Disturbed Almbum and the Lyrics are great.voices- 4/5The game- 5/5 Everytime I hear this song I jsut have to sing along it doesnt matter what kind of mood im in.Stupify- 5/5Down With the Sickness- 5/5 I play this song everytime im angryViolence Fetish- 4/5Fear- 4/5Numb- 3/5 A little different from there other songs.Want- 3/5 not one of my faves.Conflict-5/5 great song.shout 2000- 4/5Droppin plates- 5/5 deff. one of my favorite Disturbed songsMeaning Life- 5/5"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Second Greatest album of all time","review":"As my title states this is the second greatest of all time. The Best being \\"Infest\\" by papa roach. No band will ever be able to capture the aggresion of this album. This is definately nu-metal at its finest. This is even better then \\"Korn\\".The best songs on this are everything except for Droppin Plates and Numb. Those 2 songs arent near as good as the other ones but i still like them and will listen to them. The Best 2 songs being Voices and DWTS.Overall this album is only second to one. I doubt any band will ever even come close to topping this. Go buy this album. You will not regret it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Still Makes Me Sick...","review":"I've recently attempted to listen to this album again and I still don't like it. I'm into nu metal and raw emotions as much as the next person but screaming essentially every track doesn't show emotion but instead a lack of vocal ability. Also, the lyrics to the songs are extremely repetitious and seem good on the first listen but listen one more time and you'll grow tired of it. I really do like the band Disturbed, particularly the new album Believe, but this debut lacked diversity and control needed to make it an awesome break out. Raw emotion doesn't eminate from screaming all the time but instead from a combination of highs and lows, not just pure hatred screaming anger. Overall, this album just made me plain sick but I do still stay true to Disturbed and highly recommend Believe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just get it anyway you can","review":"This is by far the best cd I ever heard.

Ugh, good thing i didn't. First of all, I still like Voices and Stupify, theyre very good songs, but the rest of the songs are not only boring, but they give me a headache... He's not really rapping, more like sing-rapping. It is original, but i wouldnt really recommend this. I'm absolutely sick of Down with the Sickness by now, The cover of Shout is stupid, and the lyrics in Droppin Plates are horrendus. I'm glad I didn't spend money on This. Disturbed is better than most nu-metal garbage out there right now. Some of the other songs sound sorta cool, but I definately wont be listening to this often."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't get better than this!","review":"I can't believe this.

And for all the people who think it's bad, then I got one thing to say: You have no taste in music at all. I recently saw them in concert, and they were by far the most amazing band I have seen. They're music is for anyone whos filled with anger and the need to show people that they don't need the world, the world needs us! without different ppl, we're all just a bunch of clones, so do us ALL a favor, and buy this album, love it, and make it one of your favorites!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My Review For...The Sickness","review":"I have to say that this is the first cd that I could really appreciate on the first listen. Other band's albums take 2 or more listens. This album supplies pure metal with great lyrics. The best [instrumental] wise, [most famous], and best [lyrics] wise song on the album is Down With The Sickness. I wont go through all the tracks because a million other people did and this song is alone enough to buy the album. Some reviewer said that the ending didn't fit the song. HELLO! The chorus and versus is the effect and the ending is the cause. listen to the song and you'll notice. This is a great debut from a great band and hope the third and future cd's are just as good. I highly recommend this album but if you dont like cursing.. stay away as you will find the f word slammed over and over like a 12 year old kid at a michael jackson slumber party. The album kicks ass and know anyone would enjoy it.* I realize that Michael Jackson joke will get me a lot of not helpfuls lol."},{"rating":"2","title":"Note to the negatve comment on here","review":"Excuse me,note to the reviewer that gave Disturbed a zero rating. You've obviously not heard this cd before. It rocks. It rocks really good. And the cd label is kinda scary. Why do people like you have to make remarks like that? Everyone knows the only people that rate these bands are fans of the bands. And if you're not a fan of this band, don't comment. We want strangers to see a five-star rating so they will be compelled to give the cd a chance. My fav tracks are 3 and 4. They make me feel good.

I almost fell asleep listening to this actually, no kidding, THAT boring. This band is a fad and soon will fade away. The only reason Disturbed is popular is because weak-minded trendy teenyboppers will kneel to whatever receives mainstream airplay, regardless of talent or quality.

Most mainstream \\"metal\\" music sounds so much alike it can be hard to differentiate between different bands!Musically Disturbed is nothing big. I can say in all honesty that I can play all Disturbed songs on guitar and bass. It's not that the music isn't good, but it sounds so generic, and each song sounds almost the same as the last. I hate you MTV.Lyrically, I don't like Disturbed either, but I'm not gonna badmouth them on lyrics because if that is really what the singer feels I'm no one to say he sucks.

The rest of this cd is extremely forgettable and laughable, I just can't take these guys serious. The singers voice sounds like he violently needs to go to the bathroom.

I didn't like Stupify, but it had started to grow on me about a week or so ago. Then I went to Return of the Rock with Stone Temple Pilots, Godsmack and of course...Disturbed. I went for STP and left a Disturbed fan. I bought the CD at the concert and afterwards was able to go to the tour bus and hang out with Dan (badass guitarist), Dave (badass singer), and Fuzz (badass bass player). I just listened to the CD today and it is awesome. \\"Down with the Sickness\\" is one of the coolest songs I've heard in a long time. Godsmack and STP also signed stuff and hung out. We hung out with Scott Weiland and sang him happy birthday and he got the whole band to sign my STP No. 4 CD because we sang him happy b-day. But anyway, buy the Sickness, it rocks."},{"rating":"1","title":"The \\"Sickness\\" True to Title","review":"As hard rock goes, Disturbed produces some musically satisfactory material. Unfortunately, I part ways with this CD's lyrical obsession with violence and murder. Perhaps if I was some young punk trying to psyche myself up to pick a fight, or slaughter my parents, this CD might come in handy. I'm also sick of bands dropping the F bomb as much as they can. Seems to be an indication of intellectual shallowness and linguistic inadequacy. I suppose that if rage, violence, and over-use of profanity are sicknesses, then this CD is true to its title."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disturbed Isn't Very Good","review":"I really enjoyed Disturbed's first hit single \\"Stupify\\", so I must say this album came as a dissapointment for me. A lot of people are raving about Disturbed, and I like their lead singer, but like many other nu-metal groups, their guitar player is not even marginally talented. Dan Donegan can do a catchy groove, but the guy isn't even on par Kurt Kobain in terms of playing ability. Distrurbed have a good attitude, but someone really needs to sit down with Donegan and show him how to use his instrument. I don't reccomend buying this album, as you can already hear all the best tracks on the radio. If you like Draiman's vocals, get Soil's album \\"Scars\\" instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad version of the same hard stuff done over and over","review":"isn't anyone getting tired of bad angry music?

The guitar player comes up w/ poor, ... riffs, the bass player is ugly and not very talented (eh, dreadlocks), and the drummer is really bad. I hate \\"Down w/ The sickness\\". The rest is really not much better.

He has a cool voice and he's one of the best new singers I've heard in a while.The best songs on the CD would have to be \\"Down with the Sickness\\", \\"Stupify\\", \\"Voices\\", \\"Want\\", and \\"Meaning of Life\\".All the songs are pretty hard and loud, but they are not repetitive at all.If your into the Nu-Metal genre and like your music fast and loud then get this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"I had never heard of Disturbed when I worked a Kittie/Disturbed concert in Winnipeg.

Great anger release music!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Heavy Metal Band","review":"I first listened to this CD when I bummed it from a friend of mine. I borrowed cuz I LOVED stupify. The Album is an extremely tight sounding piece of audio. The only set back is number seven. It's too slow and doesn't fit the pace of the album. The best track on the album is Shout 2000, a cover of Tears for Fears \\"Shout\\". Buy this album if you're into the whole heavy metal scene. I won't lie to you, it's not for the new fan of metal or the weak of heart and mind. So if you're a \\"newbie\\" wait about six months and then com back and buy this CD.

I don't know why, but for some reason I'm don't like the others all that much. I listen to them, and don't skip them while listening to the CD,but am not overly fond of them. All of the others, are kind of odd, I think. Almost scary. But if you're fond of that, you'll love this CD. Literally. The only one I absolutely hate is, I think its called \\"Numb\\"? I mainly just don't like the way it starts. Stupify for some reason strikes me as a funny song. I don't know why, but its my pick me up song. But, if you're a fan of Disturbed, you'll probably like this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"hehe...80s rock is funny","review":"for me this is in the same category as Bon Jovi's \\"Bad Medicine\\" or Styx's \\"Come Sail Away\\". It thinks it's gonna be so cool, and so great, that everything is overdone. From the overly angry lyrics that only shock you once (why'd you do it mommy)to the distorted and fuzzed guitars in the background. It's worth having, and will energize you. But it's by no means great music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really rather kicks butt...","review":"Disturbed and Chevelle are my two current favorite 'alternative metal' groups. For those who like b*tching about how bad this music is, why don't you either hit the Barry Manilow section or go listen to \\"Unleashed in the East\\" for the ten trillionth time. Some of us are looking for newer talent in raw, aggressive music. Yeah, I liked all the old brit-metal and classic rock groups too, but at some point it just gets old. You can listen to both. Or maybe not...P.S. I really wish people would quit rating specific 'nu-metal' albums based on their general hatred of nu-metal.

Eureka!! Disturbed has created a connection that blends industrial 80's (Ministry, Acid Horse, Front 242, Pail Head, etc.) with Y2K metal. The fact that Disturbed is from the same city (Chicago) as Ministry played a big part in their sound. \\"Meaning of Life\\" is Al Jourgensen-reincarnated pure-industrial bliss.

There was one really dumb song (Dropping Plates) but the rest was the best. I love Down with the Sickness (best song they ever made-except for David ranting at the end about his mom-didn't fit in with the rest of the song)and Stupify (lyrics are addicting). I did hear the album when I was about 11 (15 now) while I was in my aunts van. My cousin popped in the Cd saying it was the greatest in the world. I listened to Down with the Sickness and it instantly got stuck in my head (even if I didn't really know what the song meant) I forgot what it sounded like but I stumbled across it while I was on the web one day and kept on listening to it, and thus buying Disturbed's cd.

This is a sad excuse for music, I really wish some record executive would've shown an ounce of integrity and realized just what a musical atrocity this was and made it somehow impossible to be released.

And in this incredible era of mega-selling albums, mega-tours and mega-parties that seemingly would last forever, the record company would not balk as long as units could be shipped and sold.The band had been in the fast lane, touring virtually non-stop since 1977 and quickly progressing from clubs/small halls to become an arena/stadium monster that was propelling the music industry, while recording a wealth of new material. Roth wanted a party-hearty band while Eddie Van Halen had his focus on the craft of making music.This ship was starting to sink, but Eddie Van Halen was able to patch up the holes in the hull before the band became a parody of itself, with Roth as the drum major."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"GREAT OVERLOOKED VAN HALEN ALBUM??!!\\"\\" COME ON !!!","review":"THis is the wortst Van Halen album. 29 minutes long, filled with covers and second-rate compositions by the band.

Also, \\"Where Have All the Good Times Gone\\" is a smoking album opener, followed by the blazing \\"Hang Em High.\\" \\"Cathedral\\" shows us more of Eddie's genius, and other originals like \\"Secrets\\" and \\"Little Guitars\\" are worthy additions to the VH catalog.

'Little Guitars' is a great, great song!"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Diver Down\\" may let you down.","review":"Of the six albums released during Diamond Dave's stint witht the band, \\"Diver Down\\" is the only disappointment. This album contains too many cover tunes (though \\"Pretty Woman\\" and \\"Dancing in the Streets\\" are well done), and instrumentals for a newcomer to be impressed with. On a 12 track album there are 5 cover songs and 3 instrumentals. That leaves only 4 songs where the entire band coule potenially work their magic. And these 4 songs aren't that great. Only \\"Little Guitars\\" and \\"The Full Bug\\" truly stand out on this album, and that isn't saying much. \\"Diver Down\\" marks too much of a departure from the seminal \\"Fair Warning\\" and the outstanding \\"1984\\" to let someone actually believe it fell in between the two. If you are a die-hard fan, then you HAVE to get this -- otherwise, don't waste your time and money. There's good reason why no songs from this album appeared on the Greatest Hits CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISCARDABLE","review":"If you have tha bad luck of owning this CD by VAN HALEN, there's still time to sell it...

The rest is discardable."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little of everything","review":"I can't believe no one has mentioned Big Bad Bill. That tune is a hoot (featuring Eddie and Alex's dad on Clarinet). Yeah, there's one to many covers but the diversity of tunes makes this an interesting album."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST OWN for any True Van Halen fan!!!","review":"Diver Down represents Van Halen in transition. They are truly one of America's BEST ROCK BANDS EVER! This album illustrates a true departure from straight ahead hard rock into a much more melodic mix of sounds and ideas. Yes, there are a couple of cover tunes on this album, but so what. VH1 had a cover song too. Their following album, 1984, brought Van Halen into the worldwide POP spotlight and also brought to an end the era of Diamond Dave. Diver Down is the metamorphosis of the group and certainly shows their ability to experiment. As a whole, this album is definitely a keeper. To truly understand and appreciate this Van Halen offering, play the entire album from song 1 all the way through to the Full Bug. The subtle nuances of sonic seasoning will leave you feeling satisfied."},{"rating":"1","title":"WASTED ALBUM","review":"I wonder how much pressure the badn was suffering to fulffil his contracts with the record companies. Only this justifies the absurd low quality of this DIVER DOWN. Only thirty minutes of music, mostly covers, some tasteless instrumentals. It seem another band altogether. THis was their first clear failure after four great albuns."},{"rating":"1","title":"every band has its down side...","review":"I give this album two and a half stars. Every great band must have an album that isnt as good as the rest, and Diver Down is van halen's. Not to say that this album is terrible, some of its songs are alright, but few live up to any of Van Halen's other 5 David Lee Roth Albums. If you want to buy Van Halen's albums, buy it in this order1) Van Halen (5 Stars)2) Van Halen 1984 (This is what I Call It)(5 Stars)3) Van Halen II (4 1/2 stars)4) Fair Warning (4 stars)5) Women and Children First (3 1/2 stars)6) Diver Down (2 1/2 stars)"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the FULL BUG","review":"Man, I cant believe music critics and especially VH fans put this album down. Come on people, this is Van Halen doing what they do best. Rocking, and having a good time. Even though most of Diver Down is covers, but WHAT COVERS they cover! Oh Pretty Woman, Where Have All The Good Times Gone, Dancing In The Street. They are all done in the Van Halen Way. I recommend this album to anyone. Its a must for VH fans. Its just a really feel good, fun, party kind of a recording. This is probably my favorite VH era...."},{"rating":"1","title":"LESS BANG FOR YOUR BUCK","review":"Checking in at just over a half and hour,to call this album a rip-off would be too kind.Asking music fans to plunk down twenty bucks for a thirty minute album is not only arrogant, it just shows tat Van Halen totally sold out on this one. And what's up with all the cover songs. Not that I don't like a good cover song,but Pretty Woman(! ) PLEASE. A must have for Van Halen die hards only."},{"rating":"2","title":"VH","review":"Love Van Halen, did not have this CD so now completes my collection, Thanks for the fast shipment and CD quality, It rocks.."},{"rating":"1","title":"vERY BORING","review":"This is the typical product Van Halen's critics feed upon.

For a real and lucid VH fan, this is on the theirs leatest fine moments."},{"rating":"1","title":"For the hardcore fans.","review":"Clocking in at 31 minutes and containing maybe 12 minutes of original Van Halen, this sounds more like a contractual obligation than an actual album Van Halen would have made, especially in their 80s heyday. Their covers of \\"Dancing in the Street\\" and \\"Pretty Woman\\" are inspired, but hardly worth the purchase of the album. If you're a completist, get it. If you're casual, get \\"Fair Warning\\" or \\"1984\\" instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"I've been listening to Classic Van Halen lately after I bought A Different Kind Of Truth so I decided to buy the first 5 albums, Diver Down is a very different one but shows how remarkable the Roth-era was. If you purchase this album don't expect to like it at first glance, It will grow on you as more as you listen to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Covers Are Weak","review":"Love Van Halen (not Hagar), but I hate covers in general anyway. The music is not that bad but I really just don't like covers. If you are looking to start listening to Van Halen stay away from this one. Get Van Halen, 1984, Van Halen II, or Fair Warning. They are much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Second rate album","review":"An album less than thirty minutes long and filled with covers.

There's only a handful of decent tracks on this album; these being: Hang 'Em High, The Full Bug, Little Guitars, and Cathedral. Dancing in the Street is simply atrocious. The less said about (Oh) Pretty Woman the better. I don't even know what to say about Big Bad Bill (Is Sweet William Now) - isn't this supposed to be a hard rock album? Happy Trails is just a waste of time. What were they thinking when they recorded this drivel?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull","review":"This is a very timely idea for a teen novel, but unfortunately the writing lacks style and energy.

It is 2-channel Stereo only. The 1812 is available in another mastering, a true multi-channel SACD and is spectacular. There is nothing comparable out there. The Gershwin is good, but.... It is worth searching for the other 1812. Skip this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stereo Only","review":"While this disc is remastered from a 50kHZ master and is a working SACD hybrid disc - it is in stereo only. There is no use of the surround channels or LFE channel on this disc. It does sound marginally better than the Telarc CD release - but only marginally. This disc is a waste of your SACD player's time and yours as well.Had any of the product information stated that this was a stereo only disc, I would not have spent money on it.If and only if you don't already own the standard Telarc CD release of this material, you might consider it for purchase. But please be aware that it is ONLY IN STEREO. It is certainly NOT a good use of your funds."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO not buy this book!","review":"I have ordered two of these book/CD books and both of the CD's will not play through a tune.

I LOVED the Infinity Gauntlet and was excited to read this new tale of Adam Warlock, Silver Surfer, Thanos and such. So do me a favor and look at all those marvel superheros....they are all just scattered around the story adding no depth what so ever. As a matter of fact almost all of them could have been left out, its hard to sell books that way though. Better put Wolverine and Captain America on that cover, Adam Warlock doesn't ship enough units on his own. Do yourself and me a favor.

THIS is the kind of thing that killed comics in the nineties."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as good as Gauntlet but still worthwhile","review":"The Infinity War is not as good as the Infinity Gauntlet for two main reasons The art is not as good we dont have Perez art this time and even Lim's artt is not as good with stiff looking characters in too many panels. The bringing back of the Magus was inspired but the relative lack of action a normal Starlin strength was not. It still is worth the read especially if you like Starlin and his way of doing cosmic stories.

To the credit of the eponymous quartet, while listening to the notturno, I feel as if am being serenaded by a beautiful chanteuse. It is a movement of such profound elegance and feeling that one is disarmed by the experience, while the movements framing it are in turn lyrical and provocative. Certainly a keystone of the repertoire."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Sublime!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This is probably Borodin Qt's greatest recording, even greater than their Shostakovich cycle. In both no.1 & 2, they achieve near-miracle performance with amazing technical perfection and warm autumanal tone. The famous Nocturne in the 2nd quartet is undescribably beautiful and even Borodin Qt's own later versions fall far short of sheer sublimity of the music making. Rarely performed Quartet No.1 is even greater work in many ways, and here Borodin Qt captures the rustic beauty of the music like no other ensemble could. Buy this one while availalbe (EMI has notorious habit of deleting great recordings while reissuing inferior recordings as Great Recordings of the Century!), you shall never regret."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great recording killed by trasfer engineers!","review":"Without question, This is one of great chamber music recordings of all time...Alas, EMI transfer engineers added some ambience while remastering, and the result is like a stereo rechannelling of a mono recording, and natural balance of recording gone forever...If you listen with headphones, you'll quickly understand what I mean... Sometime ago, I listened the same original Melodiya LP, and I saw what's the difference is. In late 80's French harmonia Mundi label transferred more faithfully, but more tape hiss. I think EMI should re-remaster this enchanting performance, or give permission to another company for a really good transfer (BMG would be a good choice, issued sucessful transfers of melodiya recordings)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Be pleasantly surprised.","review":"Can you go wrong with Borodin?

Yes, it is a great vacuum as far as suction is concerned. It picked up pet hair from the stairs very efficiently. However, the vacuum gets hot very quickly. On two occasions I had to take it apart to remove the cat hair which was preventing the roller from turning and consequently making the vacuum useless. Now the belt has broken and from the reviews I have read it seems I will have quite a time finding a replacement belt.Too bad - it works well when it works - but I have only had it for about 3 months and may have to trash it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loved my first one","review":"I loved the first one of these I purchased.

This time it lasted for 2 months before the belt burned through. Called to get a price for a new belt, but it was more expensive than the unit. I am now convinced that my first one was a fluke of quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you want a durable vacuum, you don't want the Shark","review":"If there were a market for disposable vacuum cleaners, this would be the perfect product. It is powerful, but not designed for longevity. Starting the day I took it out of the box, it regularly overheated after several minutes' use and switched itself off, unusable for at least an hour while it cooled. The manufacturer even mentions this in the owner's manual, as though it's a feature. The Shark consistently clogged with pet fur because the opening in the dust receptacle is too narrow, leaving the opening packed with debris while the majority of the receptacle is empty. Finally, it died completely after six disappointing months. There's a reason this is one of the cheapest hand vacuums--it's low quality, amateur engineering and won't last. If you need something more, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Luck Finding Replacement Belts","review":"This is an excellent vaccuum when it can be used. We have used our mainly for our stairs where using an upright was next to impossible. It picks up very well. We have had the belt break in it after only about three months of use.

I think that it has some value as a quick and dirty reference material when trying to write cogent para or two on some faddish management trend.However, I would recommend that for most purposes bookmark to the online content would do just as well and perhaps this is something that one would give to their dilbertesque boss for a holiday present - void of any contention.Having said that - the references for in-depth discussion for each \\"tool\\" or concept are useful although some of these (esp in the realm of options pricing) are a bit dated.-> Bottom-line: If one has an expense account, buy it, for the rest, prod around Bain's site and bookmark the material."},{"rating":"2","title":"Plays Both NTSC/PAL With Some","review":"When I first opened the box I was pissed as I once again had purchased a dvd player from Amazon that was advertised as multi region yet only played Region 1 (US) dvds as the box clearly states that 'this DVD player only plays US DVDs'. But after reading the review from Emet and spending no more than 2 minutes to complete the setup and enter the code to make it region free it now plays all DVDs without a hitch.So if you want to buy an official multi-region DVD player that comes ready to play any region DVD then don't buy this, but if you don't mind spending 2 minutes to configure the player then this product is a great buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Versatile Features and Good Price","review":"I've only had the player a couple of days, but I really like it so far.

I also found start-up times and loading times to be good.Of course I wouldn't buy this player if that's all I cared about, I also was interested in the DivX features and so far it's handled several files just perfectly. It has played a couple of different videos from different sources once I burned them to CD-RW.The menus left a little bit to be desired and can be difficult to navigate at times, that's my only complaint."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Value For Your Money","review":"I would purchase this unit with confidence because it is a great value for the price.

When I first got it, it wouldn't open, unless you pressed the \\"off/on\\" button first. Then you pressed the \\"open/close\\" button on the player and wait an eternity for it to open. Now, the only way to get the door to open is to use the remote and hold the \\"Stop\\" button for several seconds and the only way to get the door to close is to use the remote and press the \\"Play\\" button and the door instantly closes and plays the media.

I am sure you can find a better DVD player that is less aggravating. When you try to open to insert or to remove the disk it is very slow to open.

I bought it to play several PAL format dvds from England as well as a Region 0 music dvd which would not play in my Region 1 dvd player, and it played all of them immediately and flawlessly. I didn't even have to enter any codes to get them to play, so perhaps this multiformat dvd player was already preset on Region 0. In any case, I am delighted with this dvd player and would highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great little region free DVD player","review":"I've had this player for about a week now and so far, so good. After putting in the code to make it region free, it has been able to play all my PAL DVDs with no problem (as well as NTSC.) The quality of this device is really good so far. My only complaint is with the remote; there is no open/close button on the remote. Oh, and there seems to be some kind of energy saving thing going on because it powers off after about 1/2 hour of not using it. I guess I'll have to look through the settings to see if I can change that... But otherwise, I've been happy. Definitely worth the price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great DVD player for the money!","review":"I bought this device because it could play DivX files mostly because I wanted to fit multiple movies onto DVDs. It was easy to setup, the menus are very easy to navigate, and all of the files that I had burned played beautifully. I was also able to play other home-made DVDs that had not been able to play on my older DVD player. The picture quality on the AVI files was perfect (although I just have a standard def TV), and the sound was great as well. My only complaints about the device would be that there is no eject button on the remote, and that if you have multiple video files they will play in order without allowing you to go back and choose another (at least that I have found).I was able to burn video files to CD-Rs as well with this and they played beautifully also.I highly recommend this product, and I had my parents get one for themselves as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"All Region, but skips","review":"While this DVD player is indeed all region (after entering the code in the preference menu) it is still an inconsistent player. I immediately had problems with skipping and freezing during play back. The remote only works when pointed directly at the player and within about 6 feet. The reviews posted by others lead me to believe that while this DVD player has potential to be great, it is all about whether you're one of the lucky who receives one without glitches. Philips has done something wrong with this player. Too many cheap parts perhaps?"},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent region free dvd player","review":"Just got this dvd player and am very satisfied. I wanted a player for my British dvds (region 2). I followed H. A. Emet's instructions for making it region free. So easy and it works great! Just one thing I would add . . . when following the instructions, just enter the code like it says.

No such luck with this player. Not only is this player difficult to navigate with its remote control and slow response but it conveniently forgets the last location I was at. So if I stop a DVD that contains lots of annoying advertisements or previews that cannot be skipped, I will need to go through the annoyance every time I resume the DVD. Terrible design and I will not buy another Philips DVD player."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Nice DVD player, Plus it plays DIVX","review":"I've had mine for over a year now.

An e-mail to the company yielded repair/replacement options that cost more than buying a new player. It suddenly started giving \\"NO DISC\\" readings upon inserting a disc. Tried resetting it and shaking it :) to no avail.Apart from the failure, the remote control and buttons are very small (and you have to be pointing right at it), and there are few buttons on the unit itself, making it difficult to do anything without the remote handy.Look elsewhere and spend a few more $$ to get a reliable player! Read a lot of good reviews (and very few \\"dead after 6 months\\" reviews) for:http://www.amazon.com/Sony-DVP-NS710H-1080p-Upscaling-Player/dp/B001URY8CI/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top"},{"rating":"2","title":"What a bargain","review":"This is a great player.

So far, (I have had this for 3 weeks and played about a dozen new and old dvd's) it hasn't quit one time!!! It is very small in height, disappears on the shelf.

Read all my computer files, region 1 & 2 dvds, and even the remote worked. Then, not all dvds would read or I would have to open and close the drawer several times before it would work.

The picture is also nice. However, the remote control reception is maddeningly poor; it's very iffy even from 6 feet away. Tried new batteries, a universal remote, still not good. The other problem is that it doesn't remember where you left off on a DVD, or forgets once it goes on standby. Once its on standby, you seem to have to turn it on from the front panel. I'll go back to Sonys, which have fine remotes, which remember the positions of your last six disks.One star for the picture and price, and one star for the multi-region feature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hypersensitive poor product","review":"I bought this DVD player for it's multi region capabilities and after reading the many positive reviews for this player.

You cna change the chapters, fast forward or fast reverse, open the tray, or get back to the DVD's main menu.The unit supports Windows Media but only WMA files on audio disks. It will not play WMV videos.In two weeks time the unit has worked without fail. It does not skip. It plays music CDs. The picture is sharp and the audio is great.

They have offered that I could return it but I just want the right DVD. I also discarded the package it was sent in. The Philips CVP5140 is supposed to be multi region but they say that the model I received was missing 3 digits after the model name. And that the model I wanted had different digits after the model number. I am just so tired of this that I am probably never going to order ANY electronics from Amazon out of fear that there is some invisible digits following the model number and therefor will not work. I have been a loyal customer for many years but feel that since Amazon involve vendors that are not living up to what they promise, I have to go back to local stores where I test the merchandise and check the DVDs upon purchase.SincerelySteen Lauridsen"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, except for remote","review":"Remote does not work well at all. even using my logitech universal doesn't help.

I have used the earlier DVP642 for about a year, but it won't play DivX6. DVP5140 plays DivX6, this player is a wonder it literally plays everything that you throw at it.I am satisfied with this player. The only flaw i find is the build quality is not as good as the DVP642, it feels a bit vulnerable compared to the DVP642. The DVP642 appeared more robust. The second thing is, it does not have a volume control on the menu.Other than that this player is good and for the price its a steal deal.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reviews weren't accurate","review":"I spent an hour researching region free DVD players- apparently I should have looked further. This unit would take forever to load the CD, and other times it would tell us it was the wrong region and not play at all. Fortunately, Amazon has a great return program and we printed out a postage paid return and back it went.After further research, we bought a Pioneer. I learned that there are a numbr of ways to make a DVD player region free. 1) A software hack, or 2) a chip replacement. The software hack works most of the time, but will never be totally consistant , where the chip replacement is a real \\"fix\\" that will work indefinately.Spend a few bucks more and get a better DVD player.

I bought this device for the purpose of being able to play foreign DVD's from out of the US, and this electronic mechanism disappointed me greatly.I could not get smooth playback at all with the foreign DVD I tried to play. However, it does work good for DVD's made in the US.So if you have DVD's in the US only, this DVD player probably would be good for you -- but for any DVD's out the the country, this device was a piece of junk.So all my prospective consumers out there, based on what I have written, you be the judge a decide if the DVD player is right for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"success story","review":"For anyone who has DVDs from other countries and wants to play them here is the US, this player is the answer.

There is no open/close button on the remote, so to change a dvd you have to: 1.Press On button. 2. Wait until it loads the dvd it has inside it. 3. then press the open/close button on the dvd player, then wait some more until it actually opens. Depending on the disk you have inside it, the process takes about 1-2 min. This is very inconvenient and extremely annoying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Phillips 5140 - Great Machine","review":"I bought it for the VCD compatibility (showing slides made into movies on CD).

I don't think you can do much better with these features at this price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great DVD player","review":"I've had this DVD player for almost two years now. It always worked great.Plays anything I throw at it (divx, other avi, dvds, etc). I mainly play dvdsand avi files, so I cannot vouch for other formats, though. It comes as a region 1 player (if you buy it in the US), but unlocking it so that it plays other regions took 30 seconds (google and you'll find how to do it). Overall, it is a great product. I read that the remote is flimsy and so I control it with my universal remote and have its own remote put awayin case I need it at some point for some menus that the universal remote can't access. Didn't need to use it so far (other than for unlocking the player).I should also add that I recommended this player to a friend and they love it as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good quality for the money","review":"This is a great dvd player if you want to play divx movies or mpeg files burned from your computer onto a cd-r, dvd-r, dvd+r etc. It plays just about every media format on any kind of blank cd or dvd. It also plays the the standard store bought dvds just fine. I needed it because all the dvds I made at home would receive a disc error when trying to watch them on my old Toshiba. It connected to and played fine on my 42\\" flat screen LCD HDTV. Photos burned onto a cd also play in a slide show without having to connect your camera - very cool. The only thing about this player I would change would be the remote control. It looks cool but is kinda clunky and has to be pointed at precisely the right spot on the player or you'll end up pushing the button numerous times with no effect.

Being a Pat Paulsen fan I purchased this series to re-kindle that enthusiasm. Unfortunately, my enthusiasm was somewhat dimmed. The production qualities are excellent, but I now recall why this series was canceled after 13 weeks. Pat was a great monologist, and his deadpan delivery of comical material was top notch. But he was not a great sketch comic. There is not much to recommend as far as funny bits are concerned. In fact some of the sketches were downright terrible and repetitive (\\"Peanut Brittle, Mister\\" and \\"Then Came Paulsen\\" being the two worst, in my opinion). This set also includes a collection of his later commercials, which are funnier than some of the comedy routines. Perhaps someone can collect his \\"Smothers Brothers\\" appearances.

I do like the recipes and the \\"folksy\\" feel of the book. Unfortunately the examples given above made me leery of Ms. Dunwich for a while, but her other books have not disappointed me, so give her another chance!

Reasons why: 1.) the author had some VERY questionable sources for this book, one of them being the author Sarah Lyddon Morrison. Ms. Morrison fancies herself a so-called \\"satanic witch\\" 2.) some of Ms. Dunwich's spells/potions violate the Rede, and from the \\"About the Author\\" page in the back, I know she hasn't been initiated into some form of ceremonial magick In short: get another book. I'd recommend Scott Cunningham."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not in accordance with the Wiccan Rede!","review":"I've owned this book for at least a decade. Yet, I still have it, and I don't know why except it is an example of the kind of book a Wiccan should never use. This starts off with thanking the Goddess--what about the God? Also, it does give the Wiccan Rede but obviously she doesn't follow it as there are spells that go against the Wiccan Rede. There are spells that go against the free will of others. For that, I would suggest to look elsewhere because this isn't a book to be trusted, and as far as a spellbook goes, there is much lacking. This is the first and only book I've bought by the author and it will stay that way!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for starters","review":"I got started studying Wicca with this book.I foud it easy to follow and informative.

Their voices are musical instruments of the most rare quality. Having been a fan since the 60's, I cherish every recording and encourage anyone in love to share their music. They are more than 'cover artists'. The tender, thoughtful lyrics of Ed Farran speak volumes. If you see a lady with an Idaho license plate cruising down the highway singing in total bliss, she's wearing out an Arbors recording!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It could be better","review":"It was a good group specially in late 60', when 'The Letter' was released, but the songs could be better selected cause when you don't find in the track list one of their best like 'Most of all', surely there's something wrong.

I am a Felicia Munson fan, but not a fan of this book. It has an unbelievable premise, and the language is very cliche. To be fair, there are some nice moments and a few spots of interesting imagery, but it depends on a lot of description that could have been lifted from any romance novel, and the dialog is wooden. I recommend the author but not the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must-read book","review":"This book broke my heart, made me angry, and then saddened me to tears. What Mr. Wiesel, and other Jews endured at the hands of pure evil is astonishing, and revolting.This book was difficult to read, but not because the writing was hard to understand, rather it is the subject of the book that is difficult to read about. Were this a work of fiction, one could easily breeze through it, but that it is not fiction, but the retelling of an actual event in history makes it unbearable, yet all the more important to read. So that we will never, ever forget."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent great way to get the idea of WWII","review":"Some encounters in this book really shocked me as to what went on with the war with Germany.

One thing I do want to point out though is this is 100% nonfiction. This is his autobiography. The other books in the Night trilogy are fiction which is what is getting people confused. This book is 100% true. It tells the story of his life as a Hollocaust survivor which is part of what makes it so amazingly moving."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most amazing book I've ever read","review":"I first read this book my sophomore year of high school as a reading assignment and was heartbroken at the tales Elie told. His graphic descriptions stay in your head and when you put the book down you almost have to catch your breath. I read it again most recently for my sophomore theology class in college and as I read more deeply into the book it has more meaning than just discussing the concentration camps. Elie puts us in his eyes as he witnesses his whole family destroyed by the camp and how his religion is forever affected. I was thrilled that Oprah had put this on her book club, but I think it should have been on there much earlier."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Of the Most Important Books Of the 20th Century","review":"Regardless of how many times I return to this book, it never fails to shock and inspire.

I was really sick with a stomach flu one time and I read the entire trilogy start to finish. I have never done that with any other book.The imagary is amazing. Wiesel has a way of creating an environment of such hostile conditions that you feel it in your soul. Any other person would want to repress such horrid memories, but Elie brings them to the forefront of his mind, and I was left with such a feeling of gratitude when finishing this book it was overwhelming."},{"rating":"2","title":"Night","review":"This beautifully-written book provides emotional, physical and spiritual insight into what is a hellish nightmare. At times its haunting images and perspective are overwhelming so I can only read a chapter or two at a sitting. Night is a short yet very powerful book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great- but something missing?","review":"I did enjoy this book. However it seemed to have missing parts or something of the like. I understand these events occurred quite some time ago, and that any recollection as time goes on is a wonderful work of art,but in the 'gaps' of recollection that seemed, I would have liked more of a description of the surroundings and people.I would highly recommend this book. Even those not terribly schooled on the Holocaust are able to follow quite well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Student must read","review":"This should be required reading as an accompaniment to the teaching of the Holocaust. It's really more of a novella, because of its brevity, but don't let length fool you. This book has a very powerful message; I would say 8th grade level and above would be appropriate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Black Hole for the Soul","review":"This is the story of a Transylvanian Jewish boy's total emersion into the hell of the Holocaust. It flows dramatically like innocence caught in a raging river of hate. When I finished the marathon of hopelessness, I read it backwards like the Hebrew book it is. I retraced in slow-motion the journey from the concentration camp back to its source--the boyhood home of the Wiesel Family. Reading it forward and backward opened me to the deepest parts of my own soul. This is a book you can never forget. If you have the courage, read the Diary of Anne Frank along with it. Somewhere in that Black Hole of humanity, you will see the glimmer of the light of your own Hanukkah."},{"rating":"2","title":"Night","review":"It was a very moving story of torture to human beings.

I highly recommend this book - I believe if we do not learn from history, we are destined to repeat it. I believe humanism is re-defining morality in America, just as it did in Germany. I believe we must comprehend how political correctness is robbing us of our freedom of speech. This book shows the end result.Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. (1929 - 1968) said:\\"We should never forget that everything Adolf Hitler did in Germany was 'legal' and everything the Hungarian freedom fighters did in Hungary was 'illegal'.\\"There comes a time, when silence becomes betrayal. \\"The day we see truth and cease to speak is the day we begin to die.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recommended","review":"My review will be short; frankly I feel a bit foolish appending any comments at all to Mr. Weisel's memoir of his time spent in the concentration camps at Auschwitz and Buchenwald. My main reason for reviewing at all is simply to add another voice to those who have already praised the book as austere and powerful, and hoping thereby to help bring the book to the attention of an even wider audience.One point I am surprised by is the fact that some reviewers have chastised the book for its 'pointlessness'. They seemed to have been expecting a summation at the end which would impose an structure on Mr. Wiesel's experience. It seems to me that the pointlessness is entirely the point. So be forwarned, Mr. Wiesel's story in this volume will end upbruptly, and will not provide any catharsis. And I believe it deserves to be read not in spite of that uncomforting thought, but because of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Leaves you heartbroken","review":"I want to thank Mr. Weisel for writing this book and sharing his experience. As you read this you will find yourself thinking this couldn't have happened! How could anyone be so cruel? How could so many people be so cruel? Who were these men who could throw live babies into a fire? Were normal people before the war? How did they live with themselves? What happens to humanity when the insanity of war takes hold?I avoided reading this book as I knew I would be left with a feeling of dismay. However, I did read it as I felt rather obligated to. I can't say I enjoyed it, but it isn't a book meant to be enjoyed. The lesson....we must remember. We must not close our eyes in complacency. It is still going on all around us....on our earth community. Insanity is still alive and well.To all the survivors of the atrocities of human cruelty, my heart goes out to you. I do what I can and encourage everyone else to do the same.Peace on Earth....good will towards men."},{"rating":"2","title":"How could this happen?","review":"This book was phenominal. It puts you there, in the concentration camp, and you live it with the author. What is so unbelievable is that people deny this happened. It is so horrible that it is beyond the human perception.A great book, worth reading, worth remembering."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Amazing Story","review":"Elie Wiesel's true story of his Holocaust experiences is undoubtedly a profound book. It is a must-read for anyone, especially those with an interest in history. Almost everyone will be impacted by Wiesel's narrative: certain sections have the effect of bringing tears to your eyes while others force you to ponder universal questions. This was required reading for me in high school, and it was one of the few assigned books I actually enjoyed. Is it sad? Yes, but it is well worth it and I think that readers will grow from the experience of reading this selection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Concise memior that all should read","review":"Having read a number of holocaust memiors before, I knew Wiesel's night would be a difficult but important read to further deepen my knowledge of these events we must never forget. He manages to give a poignant and concise account of his experience, incorporating objective views of what occurs around him, which includes the saga of his father's time in the concentration camp with him. His tale of survival is nothing short of inspirational and I was moved by how strong he was not only to go through all he details, but to be able to put it all on paper in such a compelling way.If you are interested in more riveting accounts of the holocaust, Sala's Gift provides a detailed account of a woman's struggle to survive through the brutality which occurred."},{"rating":"2","title":"From a teacher's perspective...","review":"I ordered 27 copies of Night for my advanced students to read and have been thrilled. The new translation is beautifully written and the story is, as it always has been, a brutally honest description of life in the camps."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eye opener","review":"Love this book!

It's been a few weeks since I read \\"Night\\" and one sentence has stuck with me as if I were the witness of the horror described in that one sentence - such a despicable act performed by fellow humans, absolutely horrific. You must read this book to really understand what Holocaust survivors went through, what they saw and what they felt. Many of them refusing to believe that such hatred and suffering was taking place in the 20th century, yet there it was before their eyes, ripping out their souls."},{"rating":"1","title":"2.5 stars, could have been better","review":"I was expecting so much detail, but it lacked. The book felt rushed, so maybe the longer version held more in depth descriptions. There's so many questions while reading that should of been answered, but they never are, you can only assume.

He repeatedly uses the symbolism of fire and of nighttime, with excerpts that could move someone to tears. He says that he would never \\"forget that night... which has turned my life into one long night.\\" He would \\"never forget those flames which consumed my faith forever.\\"Most of the book however, simply tells a story. It relates terrors with no particularly pretty words or fancy writing. Usually it reflects limited anger or sadness, but simply says what must be said."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just as they say, Can't put it down!","review":"The book is so moving and heartbreaking as are most of the Holocusts books.

( 5 to 10 is the norm for me)I couldn't wait to see what Wiesel was going to share next. I also couldn't wait for the punishment to be over. Having just discussed \\"Night\\" with a friend over coffee, we both agreed that one good thing about this book, is that it will cause most of us to see that what we feel are terrible, dreadful problems, might not be that bad afterall.

This is real. The emotional impact of Elie Wiesel's work is only realized when you think: This actually happened. There's no good way to write about the evils of which humanity has shown itself capable, but Wiesel's way is powerful. The narrative is simple and unadorned - it tells it the way it was - and transports the reader to a world of unimaginable horror. This should a novel that everyone should be required to read - only the truly depraved would be unaffected."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceptional resource","review":"Night is a powerful personal account of a holocaust survivor from capture to liberation.

This book brings you through those moments through the frightening eyes of Elie Wiesel in Night.This book tells about the true horrors of the Holocaust. If you can't easily handle death in books then this book is truly not for you. It also jumps time both forward and backwards which makes it harder to follow than most books.

Good read it kinda bordelines on horror because what happened during the Sho'ah is simply heart aching to know all those ppl died because of their culture..Anyhoo buy it but if possible buy from a vendor because i kinda regret buying it for the $11.

I was wrong. It was beautifully written, despite the ugly story being told. The new translation in the forward, along with the Nobel Peace Prize acceptance speech just added to the raw emotion of the subject in addition to exploring the author's personal feelings about his survival.

Everyone of them beautiful and touching in their testimony. However, this one--is so much more. Night breaks your heart and strangles your soul. This book does more than tell a story it teaches and warns us about the evil that lurks among us. Hatred is a monster none of us can afford to feed, but there are those who do. Oppression continues to this day. Stories of horror continue to write themselves and most of us, too many of us, do nothing about it. I've learned from this book that silence is a deadly weapon easily weilded and often used. I hope and I think it's the author's hope that we disarm that weapon and speak out.

Where this stood out is the way the story of a son and fathers journey through the camps is told - detail is pared down and yet the images come strongly across. The brutality becomes normality, the prisoners dehumanised, ready to kill for a few crumbs. While the author was only 15 , he is forced to grow up quickly. The images of sons throwing their dead fathers bodies from the train. Son killing father to survive. The prisoners are not venerated as heroes. It is their sheer ordinariness and fraility that make this a powerful story. When you read this it reminds you of how we allow evil to live on. The people of Sighel ignored the warnings and were blind to what was happening. The world still has evil - read this and remember."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just as moving now as when I first read it","review":"I first read \\"Night\\" about 25-30 years ago. This new translation is just as powerful as the original English publication. It's a very small book, but it packs an incredible punch even for a story that's been told many times by others who survived the Nazi death camps. Wiesel doesn't need many words or excruciating details to shock the reader into remembering how unbelievably cruel humans can be toward other humans. If there was ever a case study for showing where prejudice and hate can lead, \\"Night\\" is it.Read it. And someday ask your kids to read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"We Live in a Messed Up World","review":"Elie Wiesel was a teenager when he and his family were forced to leave their home in 1944 and sent to the Auschwitz and Buchenwald concentration camps. Night is the horrific story of Elie Wiesel's memories of the death of his family, the death of his own innocence, and his despair as a law-abiding Jew confronting the sinful nature of man at its worst. This book by the 1986 Nobel Peace Prize Winner is an extremely sad, but gripping account of what happened in the camps, and an unforgettable message that we must do what we can to stop the forces of evil.

You will be horrified, confused, angry, awakened, uplifted, and empowered."},{"rating":"2","title":"Night","review":"Night is Wiesel's personal memoir, which relates his personal story before and during World War II, as he and his father are separated from his mother and sister and interned in a series of concentration camps.\\"Never shall I forget these things, even if I am condemned to live as long as God Himself. Never.\\"I read Night in high school, and always think of it as being a particularly long book, which it is not. Wiesel manages to pack more than I would think possible into a little over a hundred pages, which relates the story of himself and his family during the Holocaust. It is a beautifully written work that relates a terrible story. I found the story of Wiesel's loss of faith and the relationship he had with his father particularly memorable.

It is fairly close but the sentences are reworded in most areas, and synonyms are used for quite a few ofthe words. Maybe 10-15% of the book is the same. I did not see anywhere when buying it that it is based on a foreign translation.

It's so short too but when you read it, it feels like a long time cause that's how boring it is. Okay, so he was a victim of the Holocaust.

This is the third time I've read it. The first was in high school and I disliked it, the second was a few years ago when I started to read for pleasure and I while I thought it was better, I still didn't like it much. Now on my third time to read it, I finally like it. I think placing it in the context of WWII helps. Also now that I'm older and have experienced death of people close to me, I can better understand losing loved ones, although I'll never be able to comprehend the magnitude he went though. Finally, the first time I read it, I didn't like the fact that he seemed to lose his faith, now days I think that anyone could lose their faith suffering through this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"This is a deeply moving narrative from a survivor of Hitler's extermination camps. There have been several of these types of books released in the past few years, but I believe this is one of the better ones.

She was having problems relating to the topic and the main character so I thought if I read it I could have a sort of home review with her and open some discussion to help her better understand what was happening in the era of the book. We did have some good discussions and my granddaughter had a good grasp for her assignments around the book. I remember all too well what went on in Nazi Germany; not personally, but because I was born in 1945 and, therefore, studied this topic when I was in school. I also attended a church with families from the Netherlands who escaped from their country during these horrible times.

'Night' made me think and ask questions. The way Mr. Wiesel re-tells his experience, I could picture everything, but I also knew that wasn't the half of it. Even though this is a short read, at times I found it diffcult to get through because my mind did not want to know anymore. However, I did finish reading it, and I plan to read 'Night' with my teen daughters over the summer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intense and very meaningful.","review":"Mr. Wiesel overcame so much for someone so young.

It struck all of our hearts on a daily basis when we would turn on the next CD. This book is a must read. The horrific injustice the Jewish people undertook will never be forgotten and shouldn't be by anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Boil the frog.","review":"Elie Wiesel's first-hand account of living through the hellishness of a work camp gave me insight into how this happened. Just as (I hear) a frog placed in a beaker of water doesn't realize until too late that the temperature of the water it sits in is slowly rising to the boiling point, the Jews were slowly drawn more and more deeply into their situation. At each level, these civilized human beings could not fathom that life would get worse, and chose not to believe human beings could treat other human beings in ways it seemed they were about to be treated. They forgave their torturers even as the torture continued, and they assumed it was a mistake that would quickly be exposed and reversed. We all know now, sickeningly, they were much too kind in their opinion of their captors, until it was much too late. We realize, sometimes too slowly, that there is pure evil in this world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely depressing / Parents beware!","review":"This book should not be read by anyone who is likely to have nightmares based on horrific stories. This is an inappropriate choice for English teachers to assign as reading unless your students are all over the age of 16 and you know that none of them are subject to depression. If the book is included in a suggested reading list, it should be noted that the story is very depressing. I found my 14 year old son in tears reading this story and I called his school to ask that he not be required to complete it which is what happened."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amateurish Robotic and Lacking","review":"The book is simply amateurish and I cannot fathom the merit of its rave reviews - certainly not as a noteworthy BOOK and I wonder how much the vote has to do with sentimental PC endorsement of the story VS the value of it as a book. It has very little going for itself, except the unemotional list of events presented in a rushed and sloppy book. Perhaps it was all lost in translation?

Anyone out there have any good book suggestions?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it...","review":"What can I say, I heard a lot of hype over this book and was anxious to read it. But, I was very disappointed. The author, in my opinion, seems to blame God throughout the entire book for what happened to him and his family. He has an incredibly selfish and generally uncaring attitude. Sorry but, of all the books about the holocaust that I have read this was by far the worst."},{"rating":"2","title":"A powerful reminder","review":"This book had been sitting on the same spot on my bookshelf for about 15 years. Last night i finally decided to pick it up and see exactly what it was all about.Three hours later I was finished the book.This book is beyond powerful, and leaves you with chilling images and thoughts left in your head about what happened to millions of people across Europe only a few generations ago.While Weisel has managed to portray these images to us, I can obly imagine what it was actually like to live through all of that...Read this book as a reminder of the realness of what happened, and to pay respect to the millions of people who died mercilessly in Europe during the Second World War."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved It! Quick Read.","review":"While the story of this book is tragic, it is a must read for anyone over 16. I loved this book!

The suffering the Jews went through and some survived is a testament to mankind and what we can go through and come out stronger."},{"rating":"2","title":"aga","review":"I wanted to know more about atrocities on Jews, so I picked up this book. The story is narrated by a young Jew boy, who along with his family is taken to German concentration camps. The story gives insight of the concentration camps in which Jews were kept. Jews were not even given adequate food, clothing, shelter, and medical attention. Several Jews died because they did not have adequate clothing to protect themselves from severe cold. Physically weak such as babies, old and sick were burned alive, because they could not contribute in the camps harsh physical work. It is unbelievable that all this inhumanity occurred in the twentieth century. I was touched by the writer's message at the end of the book:\\"We must take sides. Neutrality helps the oppressor, never the victim. Silence encourages the tormentor, never the tormented\\".Overall \\"Night\\" is a quick read. I recommend this book and give it four stars.Happy reading !!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The death of God","review":"In Wiesel's account of his internment in Auschwitz, one can feel his sense of loss -- the loss of every member of his immediate family, the loss of dignity and of humanity itself, and -- the loss above all losses and the source of all other losses -- the loss of God. The theme of the loss of God -- or, to use Nietzsche's terminology, which Wiesel invokes as well, the death of God -- runs throughout this book. This is a story -- THE story -- of the dark night of the human soul that modern man has taken upon itself. God is dead -- but, as the author of the introduction eloquently tells us: there is a Resurrection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"Well written as expected!!

But, students cannot simply follow along to this version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant book stands the test of time","review":"I initially read this book many years ago and found that it haunted my imagination; I never could get its profound narrative and images of the suffering of the Jews and other concentration camp inmates out of my head.

All in all, this is a powerful book that ought to be read by everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"A clear and concise memoir","review":"I hadn't read any of Wiesel's other works, and admittedly picked this up after hearing about it on Oprah. The subject matter is one that I find myself drawn to-I feel like I can never read enough survivor stories from the Holocaust. Elie Wiesel does not write to sell books-he writes this out of self-necessity, and the end result is stunning.Though Night is a quick read (I finished it in 2 nights, and only stopped to go to bed so I could work the next day), it delivers a powerful account of Wiesel's experiences at the hands of German soldiers.What surprises me most, though, is Wiesel's accounts of the mercies he received from some concentration camp workers during his oppression. I fought a number of emotions while reading Night, but mostly, I felt an ache at a young boy's fight to protect himself and still be loyal to his God, and to his father.I would definitely recommend Night to anyone. I feel more complete after having read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book full of real emotion","review":"A enjoyed this book from begging to end. The new oprah book club pick is another great book to read and one of her better picks. The book tells the true story of a young mans ordeal in the consentration camps.

Overall a great book everyone must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chilling and Incredible","review":"This book is very scary filled with all of Mr. Wiesel's experiences in the concentration camps during the Holocaust. The book covers from when the man, Moishe, warning them about the coming German soldiers to the undefinable ending.What Mr. Wiesel saw during this time was what most people don't even dream of seeing. He even saw a father getting killed by his own son for a small crust of bread. What he went through is horrific.This book may be one of the most touching books you may ever read. It is amazing how this man went through all this without freaking out. This book will deepen your sadness for the Jewish people and it will increase your hate for the man named Hitler."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most powerful book I ever read","review":"I believe the headline says it all. This little book left me shaken and speechless. I am not Jewish, it is not about my personal heritage, and yet it moved me like no other book.

Like someone else commented here, powerful it is an understatement."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Bit Chilling, but Necessary","review":"I read \\"Night\\" a few years ago and before I finished the book I swore to myself that I would visit Auschwitz to maybe get a glimpse into what Wiesel witnessed. This summer I was able to take a guided tour from Krakow in hopes of having some of my questions answered.That is what \\"Night\\" does to the reader, it leaves him/her with many questions. Most of these questions are not easy ones. They are questions about fear, human nature, obedience, and the power of propaganda.Reading \\"Night\\" and then seeing things firsthand really affected me. I have become more sensitive to others because of Wiesel's story.The most important idea that Wiesel imparts in his book is that \\"there is danger in indifference.\\" Many of us are everyday witnesses to the horrors of the world and do nothing; we say nothing.---Michael James D'Amato, author of \\"The Classroom\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Night","review":"Night.enjoyed the story from a different prespective.Would have prefer a longer version of this book,too much editing I thought"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful!

I just couldn't continue reading but I had to. I know a book is different than the actual event that occurred in real life but it was the closets I would ever get to know how it felt to be in Elie's position or anyone else's.After being separated from his family and living through near death situations a am thankful that Elie Wiesel made it through during the Holocaust and I prey to the millions of Jews and other people that have died in there innocents."},{"rating":"1","title":"Took me ages to write this brief review","review":"I feel a little bad giving this book a poor rating because of its subject matter.

This book is also a very interesting look into the American mind immediately after World War I. The bookseller has many underlinable speeches about the importance of books in a world of peace. For the modern reader, it's depressing, knowing that the utter non-peace of World War II -- and indeed most of the rest of the 20th century and all of the 21st-- hangs over this optimist's head."},{"rating":"2","title":"tiny but perfect","review":"Tiny little silver spoon, not old at all but adorable!

My biggest gripe with the product is that it turns off about 4-5 mins into a song on its own. I understand a feature like that being implemented into another similar product that might require batteries to work as an energy saver when the product is in idle mode, but this one is hooked up to the car, no batteries needed.

Does not seem to have the power as other transmitters either.The most annoying this is that it will turn off if it thinks you are no longer playing music. This typically happens to me when a quite song comes on. Because the radio is turned way up to hear the music (my ipod's volume is almost maxed out and this still happens) when this happens you get an earfull of deafening static."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst $7 ever spent","review":"This product is awful. I read the reviews ahead of time and decided that it couldn't possibly be as bad as people were saying, especially for only 7 dollars. Wrong. It is every bit as bad as everyone else says. Even after changing the settings as recommended, the sound quality (that's an oxymoron in this case) is absolutely terrible. It is literally hard to listen to. Every time the song is even remotely soft, or even sometimes just for no reason at all, the itrip will just shut off or go to a different station. Every time you hit a small bump it turns off. I had to tape it up to my dashboard (very classy) for it even to get remotely decent reception, and even then it's just awful. Put your $7 towards one that actually works, not this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"obsolete, not easy to use, avoid!","review":"this itrip FM transmitter is not the cutting edge one, therefore, we cant expect too much. But the sound quality is not good enough after you connect it to your ipod or other mp3. Also, it doesn't power up automatically when you start your car. You have to pull it off then back in to start it. It's \\"convenient\\" only when you always left it hooked up to your car and don't want it to power-on simutaneously. But the most important is, it doesn't have a \\"smart scan\\" function like its new surpasser \\"itrip auto\\" or \\"itrip auto (2008)\\". If your travel covers a long distance, like interstate, your radio band that suits best for the transmitter may change too. and once that, you have to adjust it with many clicks on button up or down while you're driving. That's insanely dangeous and complex! So, i would not suggest this one, instead, get a newer model though some bucks more would be added to your budget.Griffin iTrip Auto FM Transmitter and Auto Charger for iPod (Black)"},{"rating":"2","title":"My Love Life","review":"I was elated beyond compare with the first collection of Morrissey's first ten solo singles, and equally pleased to note the release of a second companion set.

His country had been devastated by the Second World War, and it was from the lofty plateau of a wiser old age that he looks back with these wonderful reflections on mortality and the rich beauty of life. I think the Four Last Songs the best thing Strauss wrote.Many will debate their favourite recordings. There are different strengths to different performances. For me, Jessye Norman has the controlled power to make this the standout performance so far recorded. Kurt Masur's conducting is superb, and the Gewandhaus produces all the calm variation of this rich score.Whilst Wagner's Wesendonck Lieder are a very satisfying addition, they do not reach the ethereal heights of the Strauss."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great HEATSHIELD sunshade","review":"Does the job with no issues, fits PERFECT, stays up without any issues or even use of the visors.

If this stuff had been recorded in the early 60's it might be worth mentioning but the fact is a long line of better groups (Dylan, Beatles, Byrds, Beau Brummels) were already on the market.

Since this game has been released for both systems I could have chosen either one. At first I thought the use of the stylus on the DS with this kind of puzzle gameplay would warrant my purchase of that version, but after downloading a demo on my PC and seeing what a beautiful and colorful game it was, I decided to get Puzzle Quest for the PSP. Since both versions are the same price, the choice for me was easier. Which version you decide to get depends on your personal preference. Keep in mind that the DS version uses solely the stylus for gameplay. If you like RPGs with engrossing stories and also like puzzle games you can't go wrong with this game, it uniquely combines both genres very effectively and delivers a fun and entertaining title, ...regardless of what version you purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"very fun game but way too short","review":"This is a very fun game but its way too short. (around 25 hours on main quest)about the bugs the partner bug isnt that big of a deal cause you never notice it, but there are a few other nasty bugs. One of the bigger bugs is if you learn certain spells from monsters the game will freeze and mess up your saved data (meaning you will have to start over) The way to get around this bug is not to master spells from monsters.this is the best PSP game for 2007 so far get it and you will love the game.

Even when I first fired the game up, I was still a little hesitant. Now that I am well over 60+ hours into the game, I am still hooked. The game is like Bejeweled with a purpose and RPG flair. It is unbelievable as to how quickly you get hooked on leveling up and capturing creatures and laying siege on the neighboring cities. The only reason why I gave the game an overall 4 instead of 5 stars is due to the AI sometimes cheating a little in how your opponent sometimes seems to get many more skulls than you do in battle. It does make the game more challenging though and at least you aren't left with no experience when you lose a battle.

Sorority rush has changed tremendously in the past few years. While this book gives some good advice to future rushees and is able to familiarize young women with the rush process, the authors get away from the whole point of sororities. A sorority is a place where women can be themselves; young women should not feel as if they need to go out and get a manicure or buy a new wardrobe in order to receive a bid from a sorority. This is not the type of message the Panhellenic Council wants to portray.

Russo plays his role ala Prozac; Theresa Russell tries to maintain the sexy kittenish style she used 20 years ago and comes across pretty wimpy; Steve Railsback looks older than he is, and acts awfully and Michael Rooker hams it up as the bad guy.

So much so it is almost laughable in places.The author does not appear to understand that slandering someone is rhetorically very difficult-- usually the reader will see through the attempt, and end up sympathizing with the one being slandered.She particularly loses credibility in her portrayal of Clarissa Roche-- presented in this book as an almost angelic presence in Plath's life, with no gray areas. By golly, look at that! The book is dedicated to Roche!

It's a good book for what it is but I wouldn't reccomend it to everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Story","review":"I purchased this book for my 11 year old grandson. He needed a book to read at school when his work was finished. He is captivated by the story. Everyday he comes home from school telling what is happened in the book.

The characters include a young boy named Marty and his parents. There is also a mean man named Judd who has a dog named Shiloh. First, Shiloh starts to follow Marty. That's where it all started. Judd is hurting Shiloh, so Marty tries to stop him. Most of the things in the book are sad, but we still thought that it was a nice story. We thought that the way that the characters spoke was really cool. It is neat because they speak differently than we do in Delaware. Overall, we really liked the book Shiloh, but you will have to read it yourself to find out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A parent's review: Good dog.","review":"1991. It is imperative that Newbery Award Winners attack White males, so this book does.Rural adult white males in this book are:1) distant2) remote3) disapproving4) terrifyingRural white society in this book is closed, secretive, and often violent. Rural white families are terrified of the fathers. We see this in the protagonist Marty's family, and in the antagonist Judd's family.Good dog in this book.The author displays antipathy to fathers, men in general, and rural people. There is a LOT of cursing in this book. Dammit, God, Jesus, and even using Jesus's name to curse a friend if he discloses a secret. Yikes.What are boys supposed to grow up to be?

She has been accused of being an inferior performer who couldn't sing and only became famous because of her husband, fellow musician Johnny Hallyday. Even so, despite her critics, her career has enjoyed a curious longevity, still surviving to this day. In my opinion, this CD proves Sylvie's merit. Though nothing especially deep, the light, bubbly, bouncy rhythms are catchy, and rather amusing, something you can really tap your feet to. When you abandon all need for aesthetics and meaning and just let yourself have some fun, Sylvie Vartan actually becomes a real treat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not So Hot","review":"I'm a huge French pop fan. Sylvie Vartan simply didn't have the canon of songs like France Gall's or Francoise Hardy's. Her singing was fair.

If the author has tested these formulae I cannot understand why these illustrations were not included, but without them the reader is left having to conduct his own test to determine the effects achievable.

Either way the reader is left with a lot of work to do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good instruction","review":"I remember reading this book when I was a young teenager...who knows how it ended up in my house. It was instructive in that it was written from a feminine point of view at a time when those types of perspective weren't as widespread as today. The book definitely urged boys/men to respect and revere the feminine. Courtesy and manners were also addressed, and helped shape my behavior toward women in matters such as holding doors open, walking on the curbside, opening the car door for her, etc. I still think things like that matter in society, and this book helped ingrain those thoughts in me. For that, I'm grateful."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT MOVIE about a GREAT MAN","review":"This was the first movie I had seen of John Barrymore.

John Barrymore was and still is one of the greatest character actors that there ever was. Being an alcoholic, he is actually drunk (in real life) throughout this movie. And yet he can still pull off a prize winning performance.

The story was very complelling but very different to what is portrayed on screen, for example, Dr. Carl Hill isn't even in the book, there is a character call Sergent Clapam Lee in his place and the story follows Herbert West from his college days to his death at the hands of own creations, much like Dr. Frankenstein. But the really cool thing was that Jeffery Combs was reading it, so you got the feel of the films and the voice of Herbert West himself relating the events to you.

It completely skips Belle's reaction to Dove House burning down, which I thought would be great to see. With all of the different stories that kind of seem to pop out of nowhere, the book seemed more difficult to read. The preacher and his son were kind of interesting, but I didn't think a man that age should be interested in any way with a fourteen year old, even if he thought her a bit older. I do like that Ruby and Rand have a strong faith and show it constantly. I just felt like this book was missing what the first two had."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened to Belle? Slow Moving 3rd Edition","review":"I loved the first two books, Ruby and Pearl. I have to affirm many of the other reviews. Opal's character grew up quite a bit in this book, but she seemed much older than a 14 year old. I also didn't like the match between Opal and the preacher. Their personalities just never seemed to fit. My biggest grudge with this book was that Belle's story was completely written out. She was such an integral part of the first two books. I have a hard time believing she would have just walked away from all her money (that burned at the end of book 2) and the dove house without some sort of fight. Belle's fire and spark is part of the reason I loved the first two books so much. I also didn't understand why Ruby briefly talked about her savings when everything they had burned in the dove house. Just didn't make sense.

You buy one, now you are forced to buy the other for a much higher price. This is definitely false advertising.I contacted the company and explained my situation.

The price and soft cords would be nice if not for the drop, which makes everything else about the hammock useless. It is unusuable, to the point that I wouldn't feel comfortable trying to sell it to someone else unless they took a ride on it first. Before you buy it, envision yourself kicking your brand new hammock to the curb with the cans, a week after receiving it. I hope the seller can get the consistency straight, as I'd love to buy the 5 star version at this price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money.","review":"The only good thing about this hammock is the price. I knew it was too good to be true. By looking at the hammock it looked fine but the rope was more like a stretchy soft yarn. I put the hammock up on my large hammock stand that I bought at brookstone. I had my 6 yr old sit on the hammock and it went right to the ground. I tried to make it as tight as possible but still it would not even hold up my six year old so I was not about to try it out. I guess you could maybe attach this to some trees in the yard but it would have to be ten feet high so hopefully there is a ladder nearby. I then had to pay $16 to ship this back.

Messiah is so well known that it seems everyone is looking for a gimmick, but this recording is clean, clear, crisp and emminently listenable. Davis does not rush the tempo. Battle, Quivar, Aler and Ramey sing as if they believed the text. The orchestra and chorus have a full sound. This version is a familiar friend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overproduced!","review":"There are many brilliant moments within this recording including some of the solos, BUT the use of too much brass and an organ give it too much of a 'production number' feel. {My experience with The Messiah includes singing it on stage at Carnegie Hall and Avery Fisher Hall ~30 times total among other venues - as a bass section member.} While not a true purist in that all the choral members be male [ala boy sopranos and altos...] a harpsichord, limited brass and a fairly small orchestra is better suited to the baroque music and renditions which are supposed to be emotive, evocative and spiritual. This rendition is just too far into the big, brassy and bassy is better zone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating","review":"I don't share the other reviewers' enthusiasm for this performance. To my ear, the chorus is too large and diffuse and the soloists are, conversely, too distant to be emotionally involving.On the good side: the final Hallelujah is the best of my 30 Messiahs, magnificent.Kathleen Battle's \\"Rejoice\\" is terrific but she uses the same concept with better execution in her recital with Marriner, and better still on her disc \\"Grace.\\"The bass Samuel Ramey has a great voice but his mind seems to be on something else. I prefer Terfel and Herincx on Messiah.Tenor John Aler and alto Florence Quivar have some good moments, but better can be found elsewhere -- including Aler on the Westenberg recording."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Review","review":"I am happy with my purchase, as I have been with all my other ones from Amazon.

I think the amazing part of this performance is Katheleen Battle's singing. Listen to her musical use of consonants. The consonant sounds in English can at times be ugly. She turns them into beauty. It is truly extraordinary and better than anything I have heard since Adele Addison in the 50s and 60's. The down side to this recording I think has to do with its sound engineering (perhaps microphone selection and placement). The tone seems a little lean to me. I have heard richer tones from these soloists on other recordings. I like the balance between the large chorus and the organ, but the orchestra seems too light in weight."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the most extraordinary recording of The Messiah I have ever heard.","review":"The soloists are all superb, and the orchestration is the best I've ever heard for the piece of work.

One example is don't buy a comedy album with a white guy talking about white people. Another is that if a pop song says \\"baby\\" or \\"girl\\" or others expressions like that more than two times in the opening line, chances are the music is unbearable.Likewise, usually you should steer clear from white guys trying to play the blues. However, one exception can be found in Eric Clapton's new album.On this two disc CD, there are both electric blues and acoustic blues. Both of these styles are mastered and presented by Eric Clapton. Clapton takes it a step further by adding the rock and roll drive into the mixture.

It's true, he is mellowing out nowadays, and \\"Layla\\" is a little more mellow compared to the original, but hey, it's \\"Layla,\\" who cares, if you're a Clapton fan.

Listen to his croonin on I Want a Little Girl. And Badge, thank goodness, is longer than the original, and Clapton's guitar easily dances over George Harrison's lick in the original. His most recent offerings from Reptile sound so much better live, without the electronic percussion on the studio version. And My Father's Eyes could not have sounded any better. I have about four of EC's albums, but having this live version marks the highest point of his career. A must have!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Eric's Last Live Performance? Running on Faith? Blues Power?","review":"It's not likely that EC will go intoretirement after his recent world tour. He probably won't do the long drawn out, 8 month long stintsthat he completed in 2001. This is a great performance filmed and recorded at the Staples center in L.A. on the last night of this long tour. The quality of the audio and video is superb with many different camera angles not too many shots of the audience as in Paul Mc's recording here for his latest cd/dvd. I gave this only a 4 star rating because of the lack of more good blues material and the strange rendition of Badge that didn't sound close to the original by Cream. All in all a very nice package for EC fans!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Before Sep 11th","review":"Aug 2001, just before Sep. 11th, Eric Clapton made a live at Madsion Square Garden in NY. The live was excellent! Moreover, he chose the last song 'Over the rainbow'. After the Sep. 11th, our life in NY was in mess, however, the song 'Over the rainbow' always reminds me of 'HOPE'. I like this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best Clapton","review":"The man is a master, doubts there, but this CD was really not the best Clapton I've ever heard. Everything was a huge production and I can understand that for concert goers, but frankly it ruined some really great classics; especially Claptons blues covers and his signature Layla. I was really hoping for some great tunes from this CD but I think I'm better off listening to some of the past works Mr. Slow Hand has done."},{"rating":"2","title":"A GREAT WORK FROM GREAT MUSICIANS","review":"This CD is great because of the musicians who play the songs.

This version is definitely not worth the headaches."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Kindle edition is really poor quality","review":"Some parts of this edition of the book are unreadable. No one's done any editing, it seems. I would recommend going to the library to borrow the book instead of purchasing the Kindle edition of the book. Or buy the physical copy.

Yes, they are still happening even today. However, Riis's writing style is quite sensantionalist, it had me rolling my eyes every paragraph or so. And he is quite prejudice against a whole multitude of races and religions. Again, yes I know this was written in 1890, but the sheer volume of his judgement against other cultures, etc. really took me out of the core stories of the conditions of the people detailed in the book.A fair amount of the book had me interested, it's just the way the stories were told made me not be able to disgest their content very well."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrendous edition","review":"This edition of How the Other Half Lives is astoundingly bad.

That's part of it's 'charm.'The problem, though, is this specific edition--many images are left out, and the images really make the book; after all, Jacob Riis was one of the first muckraking photojournalists... wouldn't you want to see those pictures? They add incredible depth to the story.

The sound is good enough but the picture doesn't seem sharp, and the video production very amateurish, like they didn't have enough cameras.The program is spread over two dvds, which is wasteful, since the whole thing takes less than two hours. Seems like a ruse to make you think you're getting a two-for-one deal.The accolades in the booklet declaring Badura-Skoda as \\"one of the greatest pianists of our time\\" seems self-serving and highly exaggerated.If you want Mozart piano concerti, Buchbinder/VPO on Euroarts dvds are much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"The one book I'll return","review":"Healthy?

The characters suck, the setting is decent but could have been described better to draw the reader in, the overflowing amount of sex is distasteful (as is most of Laymon's work). I just find Laymon in a 2nd or 3rd tier class of horror writers.

This is a good example of movie companies trying to make money by hitting a target audience with a very shallow product. The dude they had playing Eric Clapton made me laugh, He looks like Neo from \\"The Matrix\\" without the funny glasses.Basically, the music sucked, the acting was bad, there were huge gaps in the story (whatever happened to Jimi's military service?), and there was a sex scene thrown in just to attract people with dirty minds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insightful","review":"This movie offers an inside look at the things that took place about Jimi Hendrix.

Wood Harris did a good job in my opinion in playing the hell out of James Marshall Hendrix. Anyone who has seen the documentary \\"Jimi Hendrix\\" or the (in)famous Dick Cavett interview could see that Harris has done his homework in captuning Hendrix's speech patterns and mannerisms. This is particularly true in the scene where Harris-as-Hendrix tries to explain what he is trying to do with his music to the Mike Jeffery and Chas Chandler (Jimi's managers) characters.Much of what happens on screen here has appeared in the numerous bios of JMH.Harris plays Hendrix as a confused but sympathetic person that all surviving accounts indicate that he was in real life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical TV Movie","review":"This made-for-cable movie is an honest attempt to boil down Jimi Hendrix's life and music down to less than two hours. Unfortunately the producers were unable to obtain the rights to any of Jimi's songs, so the musical score is entirely made of up his covers (Hey Joe, All Along the Watchtower, Wild Thing, etc.) plus some unattributed jamming. You get the typical 60s montages (JFK, Malcom X, the Beatles, Dylan, etc.) along with the cookie-cutter dialogue and vastly oversimplified story.Despite some good performances, the script doesn't really offer the scope to examine why Hendrix's music was so revolutionary, or the problems that led to his early death.There's not much fire here, either, as the film suffers from wooden pacing and is never especially absorbing.The documentary film \\"Jimi Hendrix\\", also available on DVD, is a far better way to gain an appreciation of this artist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent job despite limitations","review":"Yes, the music wasn't that great, though the playing for the M.L. King tribute in N.J. was excellent, a real highlight. Harris did portray Hendrix well, at least in comparison to documentary footage of the man. As TV music biographies go, this is quite good. I gave it an extra 1/2 star, being a Hendrix fan. Worth renting for Hendrix and rock and roll fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it","review":"This movie is horrible.

If Jimi Hendrix was a famous clothing designer this movie would have made more sense.Imagine making a film about Gene Kelly and giving the lead to someone who can't dance, BUT TRIES,........disgraceful. I only hope the people responsible for this film were punished severly, Jimi deserves better. I can see why the Hendrix estate refused the original music to the makers of this piece of garbage, they must have known it was doomed.Anyone involved in the direction of this film should be banned from the universe, it really is that bad. All the bad reviewers are right on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck","review":"Caught this flick on cable tonight and all I can say to any Hendrix fan considering a purchase should SKIP IT! If you have to see it out of curiousity then rent it. Other negative reviews have detailed some of the problems, but what must be stressed here is the lack of quality music.Hendrix was a great musician, but here you have a film about a musician whose music is not highlighted. I particularly hated the way Wood Harris played Jimi. Why the producers felt it most important to find someone that sort of looked like Hendrix regardless of talent I'll never know. Harris' lack of talent was the reason for the MTV fast cut, mocumentry style camera work which is particularly annoying.Bottom line: Poor soundtrack, poor acting, poor screenplay.

The conversation begins fine, and barely lasts for 20 seconds or so. The quality of voice starts to stutter and gets really..really choppy. Finally to the extent that one has to drop the call. Although its out of warranty, but for the of this system, one would not expect such a poor quality from such an expensive set. Our much inexpensive phones from other manufacturers are still working flawlessly.I would NOT recommend this system to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent System","review":"I love this phone system. The sound is great. The feature set is great. I have seen mixed reviews on the unit. One thing to remember, these run on the 2.4 Ghz ISM band. The FCC regulations require that the 2.4 Ghz ISM unlicensed manufacturers engineer their equipemnt to tolerate interference, and not to generate interference. However, this does not apply to Microwave ovens. If you crank up your Microwave to pop popcorn, and try to talk on the phone, I can guarantee that the phone will sound bad, or not work. The Microwave has a magnetron oscillator running in the 2.4 Ghz range. It is essentially, a wide band jammer transmitter. Another thing to note, with all the new wireless home networking coming out, you will start to see more issues with interference. Choice? The cool toys, or the Microwave."},{"rating":"1","title":"Siemens Poor Quality","review":"We bought two Siemens 2.4 GHz two-line cordless phone systems and two one-line instruments. These phones have proven to be so bad in terms of voice quality that we are now going to replace them. Consistently, the phones have a stuttering voice quality making it very difficulty to understand us when we are talking.Overall, despite the very high cost, these phones have to rank as the worst phones we have ever purchased. We have written to Siemens about the poor quality and received a polite non-response."},{"rating":"1","title":"0 stars... I do NOT recommend this phone system!","review":"We have had this system for almost two years -- DO NOT BUY IT! After writing the manufacturer and getting a form-letter response, we still have had no luck. We have the base and 4 cordless extensions, and nothing works right! All of the cordless extensions continually sound like you are underwater or as our callers put it \\"have a helicopter flyng above you.\\" Other times the phones just drop the call. And this is when the batteries are fully charged, although we have also found that they don't hold their charges for long.The phones look cool, but that's all going for this system. Given the price, you would hope for something more functional, better organized (try getting through the answering machine menu... THAT'S a chore!!!), and more reliable. This phone system will NOT work in a cordless environment, is NOT easy to use, and should NOT be purchased!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor sound quality mars potentially great phone set","review":"I concur with \\"Electronics fan from NJ\\" who wrote his review on the 2415 base unit, which I also bought: the sound quality is a big problem. Background hiss, feedback (hear yourself talking), and dropouts.Also, all the phone's features are accessed through soft menus. This very modal behavior is difficult for many users. If my wife wants to turn off the ringer on the handset, well, she just puts it under a pillow! Commonly accessed features need dedicated buttons.I am returning the 2415 and 2400 I bought, and going back to my 900 MHz Panasonic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good looks, good price (refurbished), but poor range and broke quickly","review":"Got this system, the baseset and handsets, but they didn't last much more than about five months. First one handset stopped charging, and then the base unit stopped transmitting. Their range (within a normal sized house) was never all that good either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ambient noise a big problem","review":"We have a siemens system with five handsets. I am worn out by the extent to which ambient noise is picked up by the speaker, when I'm talking to other people. The microphone should be much more focused on the speaker, not on the room. It's completely aggravating, and very disappointing in such an expensive headset.The menu system for setting up the handset and the transmitter is also annoying, but that's par for the course in these kinds of headsets. I do like the intercom feature and the range is satisfactory, though not stellar."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looking for a replacement...","review":"I have a base unit and 3 handsets, and in about a year 2 of the handsets died. One was replaced by Siemens under warranty, and the replacement kind of sort of works if you don't mind pressing the buttons real hard and being patient. One hand set was about a month out of warrenty, and I replaced it with a refub unit, which also kind of works - as long as you don't talk longer than 10 minutes, after which time the handset cuts out. The one handset that still works is one that is not used much. The hand sets are not very robust, and I would definitely not buy a Siemens product (again)."},{"rating":"1","title":"A promising start--then profound disappointment","review":"Great concept in a phone. It initially worked very well and then rapidly developed problems in the handsets (none in the base unit). Poor reception, poor battery life, etc. all prompted me to return units, only to receive equally poor quality handsets. For the price it's truly an outrage. Now I'm stuck with this pig and I hope this review helps others avoid the same mistake.Switched to a similar item from Panasonic which works far better."},{"rating":"1","title":"NON-DURABLE, REFURBISHED SAYS IT ALL.....!","review":"There are more refurbished Gigasets by Siemens's esp 2400 & 2420 on the market... Does that tell you something....(Duh) Both handsets stopped functioning properly after only a month....repeated registering to base failed..handsets are easily damaged...Do yourself a favor get a DIFFERENT brand. Wish I had read more reviews, before I got mine...they'll work, but not for long."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice features if they would last","review":"Just as another reviewer mentioned, our cordless often made it sound as if we were talking under water. The cordless handset would not hold a charge very well either. Finally, after less than two years of use, the cordless died on us. The features are what sold us on this phone as we had hoped to use it for both our home and home office. We love the light-weight, slim cordless. The desk phone has great features. However, it's tough to swallow that we spent this much on a phone and the handset didn't last at all. We are left with a desk phone but can't convince ourselves to risk the money on another handset to replace it. Anyone care to buy a couple chargers? :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Man Oh Man...","review":"Even though many of these songs are just different mixes or out-takes... The Flow...

My only complaint is the artwork; the first three volumes (that I read several years ago) were illustrated by someone else. The artwork reflected the dark nature of Roland's world.

And this is the beginning of it. First, I must give in that this is a complementary book. Perhaps it was a bit too unnecessary long, but hey.. Tower junkies like me don't want this story ever to end, and that's why I can forgive him those 'mistakes' or 'liberties' if you like.Long story short, the story is lineal, with no huge surprises, the mithological subjects about the Tower keep growing. And we've waited so long for this story to move on (and finish), that I think we can all see that this is the beginning of the end, and we'll read this book with that in mind.I liked this book, and I know I'll looooove books 6 & 7."},{"rating":"1","title":"He forgot to be objective...","review":"This book would have been great if it was the length of the original gunslinger. it was a long, long book that seemed even longer than it was. it was actually much shorter than his last book, however the flashbacks were quite useless and added nothing to the story.lets make everyone happy and cut the whole summary chunk in the middle of the book down to about 30-40 pages, keep the intro, and keep the last 20% of the book. the whole thing could be about 300 pages of top-notch writing. instead, it's a wordy tale that does little to gain your interest.oh, and another thing, he relies on alcoholism far too much as a character flaw. it's pretty ridiculous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pricing issues?","review":"Why is this book so much more expensive than the rest of the series?

He turns to shameless self promotion of his other writings and the same digression that we see in so many of them. Instead of expanding on a truly great work in progress he tries to tie several of his other works into this story, Salem's Lot is the most obvious and does not belong. The story no longer flows well and we have 700 pages of crap to digest, hard to eat, painful to read. This book clearly does not belong in the series and is not part of the story that Steven King set out to create."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definite Let Down","review":"This book was tedious and unoriginal. It felt like Mr. King chose to slap together this book in response to the reader demand. I think he may have lost his vision for this series that I have been greatly anticipating. I was very disappointed Mr. King."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Disappointment","review":"I loved the previous books in this serious and eagerly anticipated this novel. Boy was I disappointed. This book is a boring, rambling mess that made little sense and did nothing to further the series. Save yourself some time by reading the first 200 pages (at most) and then the last two chapters. You won't miss a thing. Let's just hope the next one is better and that he starts listening to his editor (or gets one with the guts and/or power to trim his novels)."},{"rating":"1","title":"nothing happens","review":"This is the most boring book i have ever read. The only book that comes close to it in sheer boredom is Wizard and the glass, but that was at least redeemed by the part with blaine the mono. nothing happens in this book. nothing. for 700 pages. and the plot is a complete rip-off of the 7 samurai. The Wastelands was one of the best books I have ever read - fast-paced and full of interesting concepts, but this book is just a mess of interminable old west cliches."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn","review":"While I love most King...perhaps this series should not have been resuscitated!...its still dead...Steve buddy...uhm...I guess it is time to retire."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Dark Tower series went from classic to rubbish in this entry.","review":"I love the first four books in this series, but when this crappy follow-up came out, I found that it sucks hard.

I'm hoping someone has and I might still yet finish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stephen King Please Retire","review":"I am so sick of this story, I can tell Mr.King is just reaching for storylines the whole story is getting so idiotic. He should have written one book and left it at that. I liked the characters at first then as the story dragged on I hoped Oy would become a giant and eat all of them and let out a huge burp!Bag of Bones was passable, at least he didn't drag it out to 4 or 5 books. I think he's lost his touch, but there comes a time when we must all leave the party. He is a multi-millionare and should relax and enjoy his money. He's written alot of excellent stories, I don't take anything away from the talent he had. But retire while you still on top. Give someone else a chance to become world famous and wealthy. Don't be greedy, you had your place in the sun it's time to give someone else a chance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utter garbage","review":"Stream of consciousness nonsense churned out so he can finish the series before he dies.

The book is packed with excitement, although the actual fight between the ka-tet and the wolves coulda been a little longer in comparison to all the time leading up to it. It is also filled with surprises, including an old character from another story. It's also good that King is going to give us what we deserve as faithful readers (since i was in high school)and give the Dark Tower Series an ending. I only hope the ending is a fitting one for such a complicated and long series."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!","review":"So far, this is one of very few stories to ever captivate me. I don't mean just interesting. When Wizard and Glass was released, I read it in two days. for a total of about 8 hours. When I was finished, i felt sad, honestly sad, I had seen the candy in the store, bought it and ate it ravenously. Now, nothing is left, except the anticipation and longing for the next installment. Well, after a few years of waiting, I got another candy bar, savoring this one a bit more than the last. This story is a must read. It almost appears to be the center of the King Universe, as many of his other Characters have either ended up here, or even originated from here... BUY IT, READ IT, YOU'LL LOVE IT"},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have been called \\"Nineteenth Nervous Breakdown\\"","review":"Most of the reviewers are right on. I cannot imagine anyone being able to stomach this unless they read the first four.I feel kind of mad that I'm hooked on this. I wish I would have read this one first. I probably would have avoided the previous four and not gotten hooked. As it stands now, I will have to force myself to finish the journey and read 1,500 more pages of this drivel.The dialect of the Calla people is beyond annoying.The smartass tone that is typical of the one or two other King books I read outside of this series could not be more grating in this effort. It sounds like all four of the ka-tet are Larry from The Stand. Terms such as \\"The Chap\\" and \\"Sug\\" REALLY get on my nerves.To boil it down, it feels that King didn't put a lot of heart into this. It has a first draft feel. I may feel different after I finish VII, but right now, I feel used."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long read, little pay-off","review":"I wouldn't be surprised if, in the next installment, Roland actually finds a motorcycle and jumps a shark with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book, could lose the epilogue","review":"The charachters in this book are really brought to life, this includes many new characters and then of course the gunslingers themselves. Oy takes a C3PO-like entertainment position in this book. In ways this book tells four stories. One story is about susanna, one story is about a new character called Callahan, one story is about the wolves that the book is named after, and finally the larger story of the journey to the Rose. The way he wrote the book was to mix the four so that you had to keep reading to get to the book's resolution of them. It is deffinetly a page turner.Without the epilogue the book is easily four smileys/stars. I wasn't to found of the epilogue, mostly because it is about Salem's Lot. I have no interest in Salem's Lot and hope the final books in the series will not go into further depth about his older book. Since this only became blatently noticeable, and thus annoying, in the epilogue I can't hold it against the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Yet","review":"Wolves of the Calla is, in a word, outstanding, both as a stand alone novel, and as the fifth book in the Dark Tower series. I'll try to express my opinions of the book without spoiling the book for anyone who hasn't read it yet (I hate it when people do that).I loved the character development in this book. We finally see what being a gunslinger really means and Roland, Eddie, Sue and Jake really live up to the title in a gripping ending. The old style Western feel of the book (with a few differences) really appealed to me also. King has created a world where things are almost normal, with subtle and some not-so-subtle differences that make this book my favourite of the series. I could write a lot more but I'd probably give too much away.And look out for characters from King's other books (I just love the way he interweaves different stories). Read this book; you will not be disappointed, and keep an eye out for his next in the series, which I hope will be out soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good summer read","review":"I have been into the Dark Tower books from the start. They have been with me from college thru fatherhood, almost like my own saga. Ka. Any way King had the magic for these books for a long time, did he get bored along the way, sure, I did too sometimes. Wizard and Glass was hard work to read. Most of Kings work is from his own experience's and life. I am sure you all have read Bag of Bones. Somewhere in Boston or New York or maybe even Bangor there is a safety deposit box."},{"rating":"2","title":"Roland and the Wolves","review":"This is one series that I hope never ends, although I know, because Mr. King has stated, that there are only two more books to go until we reach the Dark Tower. I've read all of Mr. King's works, since I chanced upon his first by accident when it was first published. The books have grown in length, and often they cry out for some editing, but this series could be twice as long, and I would have no complaints about length. It's great to get wrapped up in another type of world, and to see how many of the author's books blend into the story line of the Tower. When a new Gunslinger book comes out, I just open the cover, and go along for the ride with Roland, Eddie, Suzannah, Jake and Oy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wolves of the Calla","review":"Ihave not yet completely read this book, however, it is as good as the rest of the Dark Tower series, which is excellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"A shallow piece of work !!","review":"If you read the prologue and the LAST chapter in this book, you have essentially read the whole plot. What's in between is just materials to fatten up the book, and does NOT contribute AT ALL to the story of the Dark Tower or about the main characters. Having reading this book, you won't have any greater insights into any of the characters.This is a sharp contrast to the previous 4th book, which I very much enjoy except the ending where the characters turns into plastic and the dialogue turns to mush. This 5th book is a continuation of that cheesy, unrealistic set of dialogues that just makes you wonder what really happenned to Stephen King."},{"rating":"2","title":"ANOTHERr GREAT BUY AT AMAZON","review":"Most of the time I check out books from the library.

I've read the first hundred pages of this book and I've decided to go back and read 1 through 4 again before proceeding. Maybe I'm slipping into early senility, but there is simply too much backstory to sort through without having it fresh in your mind. Even with this problem, I'm giving the book 4 stars, because it is starting out nicely, personal memory problems aside. I will edit my review after I backtrack through the series in order. By that time, I'm sure the final volumes will already be in print."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply amazing","review":"I picked up the Gunslinger Nov 19 and finished Wolves of the Calla just now (Jan 11).

This was an uterly fantastic read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read/listen","review":"Once again the master of storytelling strikes gold with Wolves of the Calla. I am an audio listener and was most apprehensive by the new reader who had big shoes to fill replacing Frank Muller. It did not take long for George Guidall to grow on me and it was a thoroughly enjoyable read. Those that criticize the cultural language (thankya big big, ya kin, may it do ya, etc) as annoyances would benefit from the audio version. The language and inflection brought richness and depth to the story/sub-stories and is perhaps my favorite part of the book.All in all a terrific story, and I thank ya."},{"rating":"2","title":"He's Done it Again!!","review":"I was anxiously awaiting the 5th installment of the Dark Tower series! I started reading the series in the late 1980's and have followed it faithfully.Wolves of Calla is simply a good read. It brings the gunslingers in a new direction and we see the characters growing older and wiser. Stephen King has this ability to pull you into his stories and make your heartbeat speed up with suspense.We see a part of Roland that we haven't seen in earlier installments and Eddie is becoming a fierce gunslinger. Jake is old for his age and Susannah has many hidden surprises......I loved the book! When I finished the book I was saddened because reading other books afterwards just wasn't the same as reading a book of King's magnitude.Stephen King has outdone himself with the Dark Tower series."},{"rating":"2","title":"RECOMMENDED READ FOR THE STEPHEN KING FAN","review":"I very much enjoyed this book and would recommend it to any fantasy/horror fan, it is a fine addition to the series. It was a little slow to begin with, took about 50-75 pages to really get into it, but once I was past that, it was hard to put down. Others have complained about all the time spend on Father Callahan, and I admit that his story was pretty indepth, but as with the other major characters in the ka-tet, his history was needed. For the most part, the other members we have had a chance to explore and learn their history/stories as we go along, with an extensive section of writing done about them when they are first introduced. I see the same with Callahan, the only difference being he is being added near the end of the series so King doesn't have the luxury of spreading out Callahan's history/story over several books like the others. Overall, very pleased with the book and am anticipating the next installment of the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dark Tower","review":"Loved these books till he couldn't figure out how to end them and then killed off all the great characters.

The battle is worth the wait; you'll feel quite rewarded for your patience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Least favorite of the series...","review":"This is the only book of the series that made me take a break. I grew tired of Roland and his Ka-Tet always shooting dead-center bullseye every single time and everything always working out. However, the book was still decent and you have to read it to finish the series so I recommend doing so if you want to reach the end of this 4,000 some odd page series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Closer To The Tower","review":"Tha latest chapter in the tale of Roland, has the ka-tet riding into the town of Calla and preparing to fight a battle against a group of mysterious child snatching wolves. The wolves come every twenty years or so, and take one of the many sets of twins that populate the town. When the children return sometime later they are husks of their former selves, or roont as they call them. Much of the lengthy book is buildup to the eventual confrontation, but there are also character events large enough to propel the story into an entirely new direction that will obvious be what the next installment is about.If you've read and enjoyed the four books previous to this you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"prettty good. can't wait for the next one","review":"this one was not as good as Wizard and Glass, which is my favorite in this amazing series but it was still a great book. i cant wait for the next one. i want to know what happens to Tower and Susannah. the only problem i have with this book is that it raises more questions than it answers. some people say that his trip into Calahan's(Salem' Lot) life is stupid and a pointless waist of time. but i think that everything stephen king says in this series is important and should be read like it is. something will surlly happen with calahan in the next book or in the dark tower."},{"rating":"1","title":"epic adventure grinds to a halt.","review":"After reading the first in the series, I eagerly awaited each of the next three books and couldn't put them down when I finally got them.

I'm sure the last book in the series will be wonderful, King just thought he had more story than he actually does. And whatswith the awful artwork?

The sassy, street-wise Susannah is a joke of a character. I can say the same for the whiney, exceedingly tedious Eddie. Even Roland is starting to act like these two, with the corny one-liners over and over again.The language used here by the group and the people of Calla Bryn Sturgis is borderline verbicide. Couldn't King think of a dialect a little less annoying?What happened to the morbid, lonesome GUNSLINGER in the first part of the series? These people are supposed to be killers, not a party posse, for crying out loud.People, stop being clones and give this book an honest review. It stinks, almost as bad as \\"Wizard and Glass\\", and you know it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Aweful","review":"I anxiously awaited the 5th installment. I should have waited for the paperback - this way I would not have felt as if I threw away $30. I loved the first 4 installments and hope that 'Wolves is nothing more than a momentary transgression.

I cry ye pardon King, but Wolves of the Calla blew serious chunks. The beginning prologue is great (and has been available from Stephen King's website for over a year), and the ending is \\"interesting\\" (with interesting revelations made about the true nature of the \\"wolves\\") but the 600 pages in between are, simply put, really BORING!!! This is probably King's worst and most boring novel since the Regulators or the Dark Half.

Without giving anything away from either story, I heartily recommend NeverEnding Story (the book, not the movie!) to any Dark Tower fan. It's a great story and as the Dark Tower has continued to unfold, the parallels have only grown stronger.As for the Dark Tower, It's great to see this series continue and I for one will continue to follow the path of the beam..."},{"rating":"1","title":"This baby took me awhile to read.","review":"*Possible Spoilers*I was dissapointed with this book. I crave action and this book was 90% mumbo-jumbo. I loved the fourth book and I read that one in about a week. This book took me two and a half months. I hope the next chapter is better.The plot of the wolves attacking Calla Bryn Sturgis was very cool. The whole thing with Mia was BORING. I hope the 6th chapter quickly resolves this issue and moves onto Thunderclap!Can't King imagine something else to write about besides Susannah's stupid schizophrenia?The whole thing with Callahan was also very boring. I found I wasn't very interested in his alcohol addiction.People, I think King is going soft."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the wait!!!!","review":"This book was not worth the wait, although it is a must read for Dark Tower buffs. I love the Dark Tower Series, however #5 is my least favorite. The book was about 250 pages too long. I found myself getting bored towards the middle of the book. Everything having to do with Callahan's past was interesting, but all of the exciting parts of the storyline were rushed! Potential SPOILER...don't read ahead if you yet to read the book~The battle with the Wolves was also disappointing. It was hyped for a good 300 pages, then the actuall battle consited of about 6 pages. The whole dish throwing thing was a little ridiculous too. Personally I am glad to see Susannah has transformed to MIA and disappeared. I can't stand her. This book would have been better had King expanded on the Calvin Tower storyline (I assume this will be a good portion of 6).After reading Wizard and Glass, I was hoping to hear more about Roland's youth. Hopefully, that will happen in volume 6!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The past meets Future, and the future past.","review":"Wolves of the Calla introduces you to an Old friend from King's Salem's Lot and answers a long asked question why he ran.

Set in the far off future ware were not shooting at each other with Laser beams but Hard Caliber 6 shooters. Roland is a Gun Slinger, a Law Giver on a quest to find the Dark Tower, a nexus point that holds millions of time lines and worlds in check. Roland's quest will sling shot him back and forth between the present, future, and Past. All of Kings Books tie into this Dark Tower in some way or another.

Much like it did in Book 4, when the young gunslingers were going against the Big Coffin Hunters.The old mysteries of Thunder Clap mountain are replaced with new mysteries like the numbers 19 and 99. That's were King really gets you sometimes, the synchronicities of everything, and how everything is interrelated. But at times you wonder if the author really knows what he is doing, or if he is just hoping it will all come together somehow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet deal","review":"I read many of the reviews for this distributor before I decided to buy. There were a couple of reviews stating that the books were damage when the readers received them. I could not disagree more about my purchase. My book was in better condition than I would of expected and better quality. I originally bought this book online because I lost my copy from the book store, which was three times the price and half the quality of this book.

I am not starting on Song of Susannah so I can't comment on the last two books yet, but yeah, so far this is the best book of the series.My favorite parts of the Dark Tower series have taken place in \\"Roland's World\\". I don't care so much for their trips to New York. I like the land of the lobstrosities and Blaine the train and most of this book took place in that world, Calla bin Sturgis to be exact.The build up to the coming of the \\"Wolves\\" was well done and I, at least, was surprised with what they turned out to be. Like all the other Dark Tower books there is really no way to read them out of order and have any idea about what is going on. This really is a series that must be read in order.Thus far, this is my favorite book of the series and I was excited about going straight into the next one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A mess","review":"I recently re-read The Stand for the first time since I was a teenager and was struck by the great storytelling, interesting characters and tight writing in the book -- despite its length. It was particularly striking because I had just thrown Wolves across the room in disgust after about 150 pages. Wolves is a self-indulgent and frequently revolting mess of a book that's nearly incomprehensible in its own self-referentialism. This isn't because King is \\"ready to retire,\\" as some have put it. If you read the recent collection Everything's Eventual, you know he still has every bit of his storytelling power. Too bad he didn't use it here."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst King books","review":"For the first time I actually skipped over long sections of text in a S.King book, because it was so boring.

I felt as if Blaine had taken the story to a new low. Granted, Eddie had to prove his committment and skill as a gunslinger but I was very turned off the character/immaturity of Blaine. I didn't feel as if he fit into the Path of the Beam well at all. In Calla, we are introduced to many new supporters and objectors to Roland's idea of the Rose and the Tower. With multiple problems that will be resolved by the power of ka, I am transfixed on the way all of them will fit together. The ka-tet & an-tet is being challenged and thus far, we are getting to know much more intimate details of each New Yorker especially, and their desire for the Tower. It's great."},{"rating":"1","title":"It should have stopped at wizard and glass...","review":"I was suspecting that the series was going south at the end of the 4th book.Wolves just shows that King got lost in the middle earth and is just trying to pull resources from ANYWHERE, his own work or any other work, and he is doing it not from \\"literary genius\\" but just from plain desperation, which is more evident in the next two final books.I do agree with the other comment, he should have stopped after the fourth book and should've avoid giving us the \\"Wachowski feeling\\" of destroying what might have been a really good and original idea..."},{"rating":"2","title":"King fan","review":"How he was able to write each part of this story and still leave you looking for more is proof that King can never be dismissed as a great story teller."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too long","review":"I know every chapter is designed to build momentum for the final battle but... i don't know it could be a little bit shorter, not that i have a problem but i'm just saying.

I'll just say books 1-4 are definitely worth reading, but 5 dragged like nobody's business and I don't like where King is dragging me. From the way the plot is going now, and King's \\"old man trapped in the '70s-'80s\\" and repeated writing style/themes, I will NOT be finishing the series. I read enough spoiler reviews to get a gist of it, and don't like what's going on. What a waste of a good beginning (books 1-4) of the series.

Finally we are getting somewhere. It has been YEARS since King has been this good. It is good to see him back. Don't listen to the reviews of people who don't like the fact that it seems King is going to include himself in the Dark Tower series. What is the difference between that and Eddie, Susannah, and Jake entering Roland's world. Obviously they don't understand the point King has been hinting at all along: the thinness of reality. He even goes into a beautiful aside about how the choices we make and how one side step can change the course of our history. This is King's oh so subtle way of letting us know that our perception of reality may not be the truth of the matter. I'm hooked again Mr. King. Bring me to the Dark Tower. It has been years and I am ready. As we all are. I'm sure you won't dissapoint."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the money!","review":"Catchy, powerful riffs are what makes this album great.

However, the font style and formatting used by the Oxford press is really unattractive, and there is no way to change the font style. You can change the size of the font but not the actual font style itself. It is a very old style and looks like something from the 1800s. I'm sure this was fine for printed books in the 1800s, but it looks horrible on a Kindle 2 screen in the 2000s. Come on Oxford, when you convert your books to an e-reader format, you need to put some thought into how the work will be displayed on e-readers. When given a choice, I always use the Oxford edition of classics, but for this book I switched over to the Penguin edition just because of the way the work is displayed on the Kindle 2 screen.

First of all, I can easily see how it was written; while doing the research for the Endurance the author undoubtedly kept coming across references to Mrs. Chippy in all of the diaries and ship logs she was reading and thought it would make a good story of its own. Thus, although the journal itself is fictional the account still has the raw feeling and detail of a true primary document. Second, Chippy and his relationships with his Mate, Blackborow and the other crew members are incredibly endearing--a very fine cat indeed!--and it's not hard to believe that his presence would be a source of comfort to the crew in those difficult circumstances. Mrs. Chippy deserves his own memorial. I only wish he'd completed his journey!

The only draw back is that the size of the hard drive makes it hard to maintain without splitting the drive into at least 2-3 partitions. It takes about 10 hours for this hard drive to be defragmented (optimize) when it is 90% full. Of course, this is always the issue when buying a huge hard drive.

I replaced it with a Seagate Barracuda and, the jury is still out, but at least I won't have to worry about warranty coverage. The warranty on the Seagate drive stipulates that subjecting the drive to more than 350 G's will void the warranty, so, as long as I don't take it apart or throw it in front of a speeding bus, I should be covered.

Maxtor drives may be cheaper, but they will cost a lot more when you have to replace a dead drive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maxtor drive, switched at birth","review":"My son purchasd this Maxtor drive for christmas. Opened the box and inside was a Quantum drive, with a note attached stating that Maxtor had merged with Quantum. Also on the note, it stated that the utility programs would not work on the Quantum drive. I find this dispicible if not illeagle. Nowhere in the ad or on the box was there any mention that there was a quantum drive in the box."},{"rating":"1","title":"Suckered....","review":"HII responded to the Amzon ad which display Maxtor DiamondMax Plus 40 GB 7200 RPM Hard Drive.

Now I must purchase a Ultra ATA/133 PCI card to make the drive work.I was duped, bambused, suckered, an object of false advertizement, sucker punched, tricked.

This hurts too much."},{"rating":"1","title":"A huge disappointment.","review":"Unfortunately, I have to agree with the reviewer who recommended avoiding Maxtor products. I recently purchased a new computer which had a Maxtor hard disk drive, and after less than a month, it quit working. All Maxtor will do is ship me a new drive after I return the old one, expecting me to be able to handle the installing/uninstalling myself, and I'm a complete moron when it comes to computers. It doesn't seem to me that Maxtor offers any customer support whatsoever for those of us who aren't computer geniuses. Did I mention that they also want me to pay for the shipping and handling to replace their defective product? I'll never buy from Maxtor again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Product","review":"I had three western digital drive all failed by the third year got a maxtor drive and have no problems"},{"rating":"2","title":"good drive, but the max blast software is confusing","review":"I bought this drive since I know maxtor is a great name in storage devices. It's my secondary drive on my computer, my original is a 5400 rpm 20 GB. Although I haven't filled up the first drive, I needed something a with a little faster access time to pull digital videos off my video camera via firewire. This drive does the trick.The only reason I gave it four stars is the Max Blast software for partitioning the drive it a little confusing. This drive is set up as my slave, and when I went to partition it with Max Blast, it labeled it in the software as drive C:. C: is my master drive, so I didn't overwrite it. Not knowing what the outcome would be, I decided to exit out of Max Blast and configure the hard drive with fdisk, so I knew what would happen. If you know how to use fdisk, I suggest you use that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most space for your $","review":"This is the best deal I could find on a 40 gig drive, I have had little or no problem with the drive except it goes into idle mode in less than 10 minutes.

As this was the second book I have read in the series, it is quite promising and prompted me to buy some more! Meg Cabot is an excellent writer with true talent, spunk, and imagination, as seen in her books The Princess Diaries series. I do believe that this is her first attempt to write this kind of a novel, and she has successfully written one.

It will make any woman with a heart fell anxious, smile, giggle, and even blush while reading it.As soon as I read it I told my friends all about it. I mean Captain Jacob Carstairs (unusual last name)is like the boy next door, handsome , rich, classy, and teasing. You can't help but like his jerkiness, but Hugo Rothschild is the guy everyone wants. He is handsome, like Jacob, he is popular and very charming, and he wants to marry Victoria.The big kiss in this book made me blush so hard and feel so good it won me over. Any romantics will just looooooove this book.It is a book with Meg Cabot's stle the Jane Austen way.

Since then, she has been raised in India by her uncles, but now that she is sixteen, she has been sent back to England to find a husband. On the long sea journey from India to London, Victoria meets Hugo Rothschild, the ninth early of Malfrey, who proposes to her shortly before the journey's end. Victoria is thrilled with the proposal. But why is Jacob Carstairs, who was also a passenger on the ship, trying to get her to end her engagement? Now that they are in London, why won't he just leave Victoria alone? And why is she even attracted to such an infuriating man as Jacob? And is Hugo hiding a terrible secret? I enjoyed this book even more than Meg Cabot's first Avon True Romance. It had a really good romance and also a good mystery subplot."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Enjoyable Read","review":"Lady Victoria Arbuthnot is a young and headstrong heiress who grew up in India after the deaths of both of her parents. When she comes to England to find a husband, she hardly expects to find one as soon as she gets on board of the ship to take her to England. Her fiancee, Hugo Rothschild, ninth earl of Malfrey, is good-looking, sophisticated, and quite a gentlemen - everything that Victoria could ever ask for in a husband. But she becomes confused about her feelings when a handsome ship captain, Jacob Carstairs, keeps interferring with her affairs.This is the first book I read of the Avon True Romance Series and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Though Victoria annoyed me at times, I thought that she was likeable. I also enjoyed that this novel was humorous. Overall, I'd recommend this book to anyone who likes Avon True Romances or would just like to enjoy a simple romance."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great likeness","review":"I loved this movie and this character even though the movie was hailed as a dismal failure.

The pedal seems solid enough, it doesn't take up much space, it sounds great, and it has a versatile range of sounds as far as tremolo pedals come.AND, if you are like the typical musician, you are looking for something that's not going to break the bank."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great journey!","review":"This series of books is wonderful and thought provoking.

If you have an interest in one of the greatest healers and mystics of our time, read The Magus of Strovolos : The Extraordinary World of a Spiritual Healer, which was the first and only book approved by Daskalos ( the magus of Strovolos ). Although Daskalos didn't approve of the second book, Homage to the Sun : The Wisdom of the Magus of Strovolos...I still recommend it.

Meanwhile, Trixie's brothers Brian and Mart have returned from camp, meeting Honey and her brother Jim for the first time, so the secret Bob-Whites of the Glen club is ripe for formation.As much trouble as the girls get into, the adults still come off as helpful and intelligent, unlike many other YA mystery series (or even the Harry Potter books).Usually I prefer the Deluxe edition from the 1960s with covers illustrated by Paul Frame, but for this one, check out the edition illustrated by Mary Stevens. One picture shows Trixie and Honey doing some pruning -- with Trixie looking remarkably like Beavis of MTV fame -- and a charming Ashley Judd look-alike picture of Trixie greeting Mart. This book also features the memorable line by Regan, the Wheeler's beloved young groom, \\"Reach for the ceiling, Laughing-Boy.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Revisiting my childhood","review":"Reading Trixie Belden once more was like revisiting my childhood.

As of today, you can get a double CD of One More Night & his self-titled 1st album right here on Amazon. Look under: \\"One More Song/Randy Meisner\\". I didn't realize it but the CD has been re-issued a couple of times in recent years. Personally, I only like the 2 hits: Deep Inside My Heart & Hearts on Fire. You can get live(pretty decent) videos of those 2 songs(and more if you want) either off the TUBE, or his own website. Out on Napstr, you can get stuff from a Covers-Band he had for a while, \\"The Driving Dynamics\\".

The first time I found it was in Hawaii in 1981 and I have never found it since."},{"rating":"2","title":"One More Song INDEED!","review":"A truly wonderful and melodic effort from the Eagle who \\"couldn't handle the pressure and competition\\". It's never been clear just exactly why Randy left the Eagles, whether due to Glenn and Don's refusal to give him more track-time or his desire to make his OWN music. Regardless, he wound up only making three solo albums in the late 70's and early 80's, of which \\"One More Song\\" was the middle effort. He didn't appear again for many years until he did some excellent work with Poco, only to disappear again....Randy, where are you? Unfortunately, \\"One More Song\\" is the only one of his albums I've seen available on CD (anybody out there who can happily prove me wrong?), but it is WELL worth having if you like melodic ballads and great country-rock tunes.

He presents some interesting ideas but I never like characters speaking to the audience in a drama - BLECH!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Discovering an Unexpected Treasure","review":"\\"Dreams...\\" is the kind of subtly compelling music that continues to reward with repeated hearings. Its surfaces only hint at the mesmerizing treasures to be discovered within its depths -- much as the title suggests. Boyce's sensitivity to text, texture, timbre and meaning combine to create music full of drama and transcendence. From the same sound world as Benjamin Britten, Samuel Barber and George Crumb. Don't overlook this gem. Artfully paired with a rapturous performance of Vaughn Williams' \\"The Lark Ascending.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Hoshi finally gets her own figure..yay!","review":"Though she doesn't get to do much, Hoshi is my favorite character on the new Enterprise. She was left out of the first series of figures, but here she is finally, albeit encased in a bulky spacesuit.Her facial sculpt is a decent likeness. But, like all these Art Asylum Trek figures so far, it seems to capture the features, but not the expressions, sorta like a \\"dud\\" photo. Better than 95% of the figures this size, but close enough to just leave you wanting better.The articulation is excellent. Her hands hold the props great; what a rare treat! She's held onto her communicator through some pretty demanding missions. Her removable air pack fits on perfectly. The helmet detaches from it, again perfectly.I would have preferred Hoshi in her uniform, but this is such a nicely done toy I can't complain."},{"rating":"1","title":"MSN Direct was shutdown on January 1, 2012.","review":"MSN Direct was shut down on January 1, 2012.

Similarly, the \\"outside\\" temp for the region bears little resemblance to our actual location and temp.

She cuts to the heart, so beautifully."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful","review":"After reading some of these reviews, it seems almost seems unecessary to add another, but like everyone else, I am moved to comment on this beatiful recording. There are few artists who stand the test of time and whose songs can be listened to over and over and over, Patty is one of those rare gems. She truly \\"sings my life with her words\\" and tugs at emotions I was unaware I even felt. I know this is from another record, but the line \\"my heart is big and sore\\" may describe a feeling better than any other phrase. She just does that on every song. The song \\"Long Ride Home\\" is one of those tunes that will be around in 100 years. I call her the female Johnny Cash. Been there, done that, summed it up for everyone else in a way that is as heart wrenching as it is beautiful. Thanks Patty."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Simply Gorgeous Album","review":"\\"1000 Kisses\\" is music at its finest--raw, genuine, and beautifully sung.

The record has the raw power of her first recording, Living With Ghosts, as well as the musical complexity of her second, Flaming Red. Do yourself a favor -- if you love music, buy this record. Today."},{"rating":"2","title":"If You Buy Only One Patty Griffin Recording.....This Is It!","review":"1000 Kisses is singer-songwriter Patty Griffin's masterpiece. Personal, soulful and haunting; there is not a bad song in the collection. If you are new to Patty Griffin or don't own any of her recordings, I highly recommend that you start with this one. The songs are acoustic and lean, pared down to their essential spirit. Patty's voice is rich and controlled, her words poetic and moving. There is something extremely traditional yet very contemporary about Patty Griffin. My personal favorite on this recording is \\"Tomorrow Night\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"MULTI-TALENTED REDHEAD","review":"I enjoyed Patty Griffin as the sarcastic secretary on the sitcom \\"Suddenly Susan\\".

Patty sings with honesty and raw emotion that is rarely, if ever, found in 'pop' music. If you enjoy heartfelt lyrics and acoustic guitar then you will enjoy this cd. 'Nobody's Crying' is one of my favorite songs of all time. 'Rain', 'Making Pies', 'Long Ride Home', 'Stolen Car', and 'Be Careful' are my favorites from this cd. \\"Living With Ghosts\\", and \\"Flaming Red\\", and \\"Impossible Dream\\" are other Patty cds worth checking out. I can only hope that Patty will have more music on the way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good to hear Patty again","review":"Having much more in common with her debut (Living With Ghosts) than her \\"electric\\" 2nd CD (Flaming Red), Patty Griffin's new disc has a directness and simple beauty. Her songs on 1000 Kisses paint pictures of country life (\\"Making Pies\\"), the fragility of love (\\"Rain\\"), reflections and regrets (\\"Long Ride Home\\") and various other subjects, all done in sepia tones and sung with a kind of tragic sweetness. Her two choices of cover songs, Bruce Springsteen's stark \\"Stolen Car\\" and the lovely Spanish ballad \\"Mil Besos,\\" fit in well with the rest. The arrangements and production emphasize Patty's voice and acoustic instruments - mostly acoustic guitar, but also piano, accordion, violins and cello. The result is an intimate and revealing CD that charmed me and had me wanting to hear it again. I do miss the rock 'n' roll of Flaming Red, though, and hope Patty returns to it again soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"marvelous singer songwriter","review":"Wonderful album.

There are many points where I had to the internet and search for the particular topic being presented in the book, just to understand it better. It tends to go all over the place and does not comprehensively or completely explain much of the history. I frequently had to stop and search back to find out who the author was talking about and how he fits in with the history. If this occurred once or twice, I'd chalk it up to it being an oddity. But in fact, it happened too many times for me to count. I liked the information and it did prompt me to read in more depth on certain times and topics, but I could not recommend this as a good book to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Back when they were good.","review":"Never underestimate the power of a rhythm section. In the mid to late 80s REM evolved into one of the best of the alternative bands because they had a powerful sense of crafting uptempo rock and roll numbers that showcased a rhythm section built around the passionate low-key voice of Mr. Stipe. Life's Rich Pageant, top to bottom, is the classic REM album and had them at the peak of this definitive sound. Begin the Begin and Finest Worksong and who can forget the refrain, \\"This one goes out to...\\"While they had their moments in the 90s and here now in the 21st Century they are still putting together well-crafted songs, the exuberance, the unabashed layers of guitars and drums, that made those late 80s years so striking, has left them too tame to rival their past.If you want to hear a band at its peak of both musicianship and influence, this is the place to start."},{"rating":"2","title":"More like 4 1/2 stars","review":"This is more complete than the IRS best of 'Eponymous'... 9 more songs!

According to him if 'Fables of the Reconstruction' isn't your fave REM album, then you, my friend, are not a true REM fan.Anyway... the music. Jangle rock at its finest. The thing that impresses me most is with all the remastering technology available, I STILL can't make out any of Michael \\"Mumbles\\" Stipe's words beyond the choruses.

You hear things you never did before-- BECAUSE THAT WEREN\\"T SUPPOSED TO STAND OUT IN THE MIX! Everything just stays at the same level, it sounds like there are some phase issues on some tracks as well.I just encoded a couple tracks and the originals, do that if you want to see it-- the songs are all peaked at max level throughout on the remaster. The original has highs and lows...well, dynamics! imagine that! This is unlistenable to me, stick with the original. Of course it may be worth having for the rare stuff, sadly that's no better.

He manages to evoke through sound almost as powerful a production and entertainment landscape as the film he is scoring.

Either way - your soul is headed for a real treat.The songs on this excellent work weave a tapestry of at times haunting, beautiful and soothing feelings and dreams of other realms. Like the master Almodovar himself, this keen, accomplished collaborator quite simply deserves the highest praise for his enduring work.I have only purchased three or four movie soundtracks over the last few years.

Some episodes and almost all of the special features on disc 4, for example, are not playable at all, disappointingly rendering the original black and white pilot of the 1960s \\"Match Game\\" unwatchable.

It sure does keep her still and quiet!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved the puzzle!","review":"At 18 months, my son knew his alphabet thanks to this puzzle. We have 4 other puzzles from this manufacturer and this is his favorite. He loves puzzles and quickly masters them so we keep buying them. We also let him watch Wheel of Fortune and he calls out letters as Vanna turns them. He spells out letters on books, cereal boxes and tee shirts. These real life examples demonstrates that he can distinguish the puzzle from the real world. We play mind challenging games with our son daily!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Buy!","review":"I got this back when my son was only about 9 months old to supplement my home-made flashcards & the educational videos. I didn't take out the plastic at that time since I know he'd just eat them. I just let him point out the letters besides the alpha blocks that he's also learning from. To make a long story short, my son's mastered the alphabet at 14 months old (& to think he was 5 wks preemie when he was born) both the upper and lower case letters and all the letter sounds. Also, the main thing that made him extremely excited and interested are the animals behind the letters since he's familiar with all of them. Now at 18 months and with a vocabulary of over a hundred, he's reading the words that he used to know by recognition only. He can actually read now and builds the words using the letters on this puzzle. It's cheap but learning with it lasts a lifetime! Great buy indeed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great book- helps if you already know engines","review":"1st off, there are NOT a lot of other options, but it's OK as this manual is really pretty thorough.

The sound is great considering most of the numbers are so old. It's usually difficult to find compilations of this great quality, but this one delivers.

I'd encourage any professor with a choice not to use this book.So what to do if it's required, like it was for me? I'd say buy the book used (lots of low priced options currently), and use the savings to hire a good tutor to help explain what the book doesn't. I did this, and it did help a lot.

The camcorder is great, but the burner is a piece of junk. I have NEVER been able to use it. Each time I try a disc - including the blank disc that was enclosed by JVC in the package with the burner - I get a message reading \\"incompatible disc.\\" I returned the unit to JVC within my warranty period, and they sent it back saying it was fine. Next time I tried, same thing, only now I was out of the warranty period, and I am stuck. Yes, I should have acted more quickly to begin with - I didn't try using the burner until I'd accumulated enough material on the camcorder to make what I thought would have been a full DVD. Lesson - use all of the equipment you buy as soon as you get it. But even if I had, the cost of continuing to ship the unit back for service was ridiculous, and I had to cut losses.

One of the best voices, the hard rock/punky style is stunning. The sonics are sharp and clear. I happen to like the Italian she sings in. I don't understand it, but every time I get one of these world discs, the voice is like another instrument to me. I don't have to understand it, I hear it. It's part of the instrumentals. This is a very sexy style of music. Lot's of bass. I like that. Very 21st century.

She refuses to buy him a blue balloon even after denying him the merry go round because she only has enough money for one thing, and she wants cotton candy (\\"candyfloss\\"). Yes, I am aware this is a cartoon, but I was teared up over it and just about sobbing when Angelina says she hates him.My almost 4 year old daughter, however, loves anything with Angelina and didn't notice either the distressing situation or my distress.

Prior to that I was not pleased with the fantastic events introduced, although I usually enjoy reading well worked out whimsical prose.

The album, happily, has held up very well. My favorites are the excellent \\"Ship of Fools\\", still applicable today. The haunting \\"All Come True\\". A pretty good remake of Dylan's \\"All I Really Want To Do\\". And the superb final track, a scathing piece of introspection \\"It's All Mine\\". Karl Wallinger was/is a good lyricist, in same vein as Dylan/U2/Waterboys. Musically he was fairly experimental on this, going from the straight ahead rock of \\"Ship Of Fools\\" to other tracks in a more Prince like musical feel. Highly enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Supurb, brilliant, a very cool album","review":"Karl Wallinger (formerly of the Waterboys) is the driving force behind World Party and this is their debut effort. The timeless 'Ship of Fools' is probably the crown jewell of this album which alone makes it worth a buy, but the other songs are almost equally as good. Since I bought this album way back when it was released I have treasured it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ship of fools","review":"The price was right but I only bought it for the one song it seems.

I was not disappointed. It is stunning, easily on a par with All Things Must Pass. Listening to it both elates and saddens me as the music is so moving which makes the loss so much harder. Thank you George for this wonderful gift to the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid album","review":"This posthumous release is a solid rock album. The twelve tracks here (though Amazon's listing is missing #3 \\"Pisces Fish\\") are all strong songs. Of course, George always took his time releasing albums (almost fifteen years since his last studio album).The album itself is mostly upbeat, with George playing the moving guitar licks for which he is famous. His voice--though weakened over the years--still imparts wisdom, dark humor, and spiritual guidance, all rolled into one 48 minute album.The Wilbury influence is heavy on this album. Jeff Lynne's production is never hard to miss. The jangle of George's twelve string guitars may call to mind Tom Petty, while his voice now more resembles Bob Dylan than his earlier solo outings.In short, this is a good album from a legendary musician. If you like George's other solo stuff or his work with the Beatles, you should also enjoy this album. I especially like the tracks \\"Looking for My Life,\\" \\"Stuck in a Cloud,\\" and \\"Brainwashed.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"George at his best","review":"When hearing about a LP from a person who dead not one year ago, one thinks its a rush job to cash in.Not with this jewel. The best work from Harrison since All Things Must Pass.It shows a fresh George, and there's no weak moment in it, he's alive in these twelve songs!And what the hell! He's a beatle!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Underrated.","review":"This album went Gold (500,000+) when it should've sold diamond (10 million). It is every bit as good as, if not better than, Band On The Run, Plastic Ono Band, Imagine, Ram - all the other solo Beatle albums that get talked about.Any Road opens it up with beautiful slide playing, and sets the tone of the album which is searching. George knew he had months to live, and the album reflects that soul searching even if this song was written in 1988.P2 is just a bluesy song, not out of place on a Clapton album.Pieces Fish is beautiful, mellow, calm reflective of a very wild life he lived.I could go on, I will say the \\"indian harp\\" (forget the correct name) as used in Strawberry Fields is used again on Marwa Blues which is possibly the best song on the album.An all around great, but serious, record. Similar to Traveling Wilburys, or Cloud Nine with a more relaxed, current Flaming Pie feel. A very great and underrated record. Good job Jeff Lynne and Dhani."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good stuff","review":"This CD grows on you; it's bloody good stuff. It could almost be another Wilburys album to complete the set. What it is really is a swansong, an album of it. One of his best, no doubt about it. No collector of George's or ex-Beatles stuff can pass on this one; it's that good.A really fresh breeze of music, especially when considered against all the crap they put out now."},{"rating":"2","title":"A George Harrison Must Have!","review":"If you're a George Harrison or Travelling Wilbury's Fan, this is a must have. I'd rate All Things Must Pass as George's best album, but this comes right behind it. The songs melodies and lyrics will haunt you. Make sure you get the special edition enhanced version. The DVD of George's last interview are touching although the DVD is short, it shows what a truely great and honest person George was. What a shame this is the last we'll ever have. A true loss."},{"rating":"2","title":"George Bows Out in Style","review":"Beautiful. Strong melodies. Passionate lyrics. Gorgeous guitar. If McCartney recieved a Grammy nomination for Flaming Pie and Dylan got one for Time Out of Mind, then Harrison should at least get a nomination too because this album is better than both of those. Well done, George."},{"rating":"2","title":"BRILLIANT","review":"I have to admit I wasn't too impressed after my first listen, however, the more I listened the better it got!!! Now, after 4 listens, I can honestly say this is the best Harrison solo album!! \\"All Things Must Pass\\" was great, but it had a few clunkers. \\"Brainwashed\\" is brilliant from beginning to end! There is not one bad song! If this is not named album of the year at the Grammy's, I would be lead to believe that those responsible for the awards are either deaf, braindead or perhaps even \\"brainwashed\\" by our society, and what our \\"society\\" considers MUSIC!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing, except for one song","review":"George Harrison absolutely LOVED ukulele/Hawaiian music in the last years of his life. It is a shame that he didn't do an entire album of covers as he has the exuberant, buoyant spirit of that genre down perfectly in his cover here of \\"Devil and the deep blue sea\\". It is the one irresistably charming element in an otherwise hum-drum set. Most of this album is uninspired and lacks melodic hooks to draw you in. Songs begin, progress, and then end with hardly anything musically noteworthy occurring. Some seem as if they were slapped together quickly and beg for reworking. Yes, I know that George was very ill when he made this. An album should not be given high ratings merely because it is a memento of a dying legend, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm sorry this is his last CD","review":"I'm a Harrison fan. And I can't stand this cd, it's nothing.I prefer to keep playing All Things Must Pass or Dark Horse thank you very much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please Keep Jeff Lynne away from The Beatles !!!!","review":"I swear anything that Lynne touches becomes Cheese. Why must he mess up this recording, Full moon Fever and Trav. Wil. stuff. Everything sounds the same! And futhermore Harrison never wanted all the production on this. What a fool Lynne is; he is not and never will be a producer and furthmore ELO blows."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful man, beautiful album","review":"This is a wonderful album. The melodies and undercurrents stay with you. It is mostly upbeat. The guitar work is George at his best. It closely resembles Cloud 9. It is a must for any fan of this beautiful man. We miss youGeorge. Thanks for this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Final Recording from our George","review":"I bought this and the enhanced version yesterday (11/19). I didn't know what to expect. I knew that Jeff Lynne was going to have a hand in it, si I knew that was good. On the DVD,Lynne says how George wanted it be more simple and not alot to it, but Jeff Lynne thought the songs were too good to be left alone like that. He was right. \\"Brainwashed\\" is fantastic album. Great writing and melodies. Dhani, Lynne, and Keltner have added terrific ingredients to an awesome album. My favorite tunes so far are: \\"Any Road\\", \\"Rising Sun\\", \\"Stuck Inside A Cloud\\" and \\"Brainwashed.\\" I'm sure in the coming weeks I'll get to know them all better. Everyone may not like this album, because it is not as commerical as \\"Cloud Nine\\" was. But thank you George for being strong enough at the time to put these songs on tape for us! We miss you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterpiece","review":"This album just may be the most heartfelt and spiritual recording by any artist released in the new millennium. SENSATIONAL from start to finish. Thank you George for many years of inspirational and spiritual music, see you after I'm done too living in the material world. PEACE."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT CD AND PACKAGE BUT ALMOST NOTHING ON THE DVD!!!","review":"Of course the CD is great and in my opinion is one of George Harrison's best solo album. When I decided to buy the Brainwashed Special Edition, I was expecting a lot of material about George and his music on the DVD!!I have to confess I felt quite disappointed after watching the video because all the great updated new material I was anxious for were almost nothing: the material in the entire DVD is only seven minutes long... and I do believe there are lots of new material that could be included in this DVD - certainly the fans deserve and are anxious for more!!The material in the the box and in the DVD itself is great, no doubt about it, but I rated this Special Edition with only 4 stars truly because I found the DVD to be too short for this anxious fan..."},{"rating":"2","title":"True to George","review":"As George gave us inspiration during his life through his music, he left behind a very inspirational piece of work for us to remember him by. While George will be remembered as the \\"quiet Beatle\\" his music is all but quiet. This album, like his others, is full of music with meaning that prompts listeners to reach inside and search not George's life but our own. \\"Brainwashed\\", the title track is hauntingly true. While this track is pretty obvious, the other songs are less forward and are fun to analize. George has had so many great songs that to say this was his finest moment would be too subjective but if George is one of your favorites, \\"Brainwashed\\" too will be a favorite. I highly recommend this piece of work."},{"rating":"2","title":"The one and only George","review":"It's pure paradox, the last and the best album with a very clear and rich sound. Is just George. A great R'n'B production, fresh and clear. Everybody talks about Lennon's lyrics, but, did anybody stop to listen, I mean, really listen what Harrison said? Is just humanity, is poetry, living poetry talking about life and its meaning, even the cover he makes of \\"Devil and the Deep Blue sea\\" fits like a glove in this album. Is the deepness of a soul that knows that's leaving the case where spent all those years knowing that will remain - as we all - forever. Is a witty, sarcastic, deep, funny, loving record. Not for tumb seekers, not for people hungry for a death myth, is music to understand a little bit more the meaning of life. Thank you George, God bless you"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of his best!","review":"A real fine album I must say. It contains 12 fantastic songs.The album is touching, warm and a bit autobiographic as well.\\"Stuck inside a cloud\\" for example is about George suffering from cancer, and goes right trough the spine.Then again, songs like \\"Brainwashed\\" and \\"P2 vatican blues\\" proof that George has never lost his humor, nor his fabulous way of writing songs.For a Harrison-fan, as well as a Beatle-fan, this is a must-have!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Harrison","review":"This is a very good CD--classic Harrison. It is spiritual, playful and thoughtful. It's sad to realize that I will never again experience listening to a new George Harrison CD, but reassuring to know that his wonderful music will live on forever."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Simple Review of this surprisingly good album","review":"I've read a lot of the reviews that have been posted, and I agree with many of them - but some of the reviews are so long that I decided to write a quick one. I initially was not expecting a good album, I really don't know why, but I guess it was based off of the first single - \\"Stuck inside a Cloud\\" - which, by far, is the worst song on the album. In fact, it is the only bad song on the album. When you put the CD in, you a greeted by two songs that sound like they belong on a Traveling Wilbury's album (that is a very good thing!!!) then you will hear a dylanesque song, a great intrumental, and a really fun ukelele song \\"Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea\\". Besides the one bad song - Stuck inside a cloud - the only bad thing about this album is that its only 42 minutes long."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Extras\\" Are Hardly Worth It","review":"While the music on \\"Brainwashed\\" is charming (\\"Stuck Inside a Cloud\\" an \\"Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea\\" are highlights), the \\"extras\\" you get in this Special Edition are, in my opinion, hardly worth the extra cash. The DVD contains only 1 track -- a 7-minute \\"Behind the Scenes\\" look at the making of the record that barely says anything at all. The \\"poster\\" is small and too delicate to do anything with. The guitar pick is cool, though, but I have other guitar picks. Unless I'm missing something, I hardly think the Special Edition is worth the extra hard-earned."},{"rating":"2","title":"really nice goodbye from the quiet beatle","review":"won't say much except this is a keeper.if you're a beatle fan, its essential..if not still good way to get turned onto the genius and easygoing sound of the quiet beatle (and you gotta add 'all things must pass' to your collection as well.it's all really well done, a mixed bag of rockers and his eastern sound on a few. very tight and he sounds great.sorta travelling wilburyish, but vintage harrison as well.you could imagine the other 3 easily fitting into any of the songs. track 3, looking for my life and tracks 8, never get over you..and track 10 looking for my rocking chair are standouts.to think most if it was done as he was very ill, with not a trace of sadness or morbidunity..a really nice ending for the guy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Among George Harrison's best","review":"Rather than talk about which tracks are best, I'll mention the feeling of the CD. George sounds very relaxed, at home with himself. He's not trying to be someone that he isn't. So to me, that makes for a very successful, honest record.I didn't like the CD the first play or so, and I don't understand why. But this is the kind of CD that magically improves with each listen.If you waited for years for George to do another quality release, this is what you have been waiting for.Best Line: If you don't know where you are going, any road will take you there"},{"rating":"2","title":"A legend is back, 4ever!!!","review":"George will remain in my heart with this CD. It is the best of the best of George Harrison. It seems that this is always what he wanted to accomplish."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is Classic George! Truly a brilliant album!","review":"Having largely ignored most of George Harrison's ouput except \\"All Things Must Pass\\" and \\"Cloud Nine\\" and the occasional song, it is great to hear such a moving and timeless mix of songs. This is an album out-of-time, one which could be enjoyed by any age and during any era. Even without being a religious or even spiritual person, I enjoy the 'at ease' vocals that give me a sense that all is well in the world. Mixed with spirit, clever and classic lyrics, and George's comforting vocals. George, always being my favorite Beatle, continues to be awe inspiring and a talented and cherished treasure that will be enjoyed for decades to come. This album is simply beautiful, only such an immense musical career could put out such an album...thank you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thanks George","review":"Instead of the 'quiet' Beatle I always thought of George Harrison as the humorous yet thoughtful one. All of his marvelous traits are here on BRAINWASHED. Tongue-in-cheek wit one minute then a serious line that needs to be pondered for a time in order to understand, it's all here on this album. Rather than note any particular song I will just say that the entire thing is a joy to listen to. Working on these songs must have been therapeutic for him and now are ours to savor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Music Like This Will Be Missed","review":"I had to have this disc being a George Harrison fan from the Beatle days of the sixties all through his solo career. You can always tell when George Harrison's guitar is playing. It has that special sound only he can produce. The songs here are magnificent - some spiritual - some fun. I listened to it all day today in a joyful yet sad way. I bought the DVD special edition for 18.88 at Best Buy. It has a poster, a guitar pick with his signature embossed on it, a Dark Horse sticker and a 7 minute DVD of info, interviews and philosophy from George, his son Dhani who talks much like George, Jeff Lynne and others. I love it. Thanks George!"},{"rating":"1","title":"KAPOW!!!!","review":"I haven't heard this CD yet, but after hearing Stuck Inside A Cloud on the radio, I'm beginning to think that people are afraid to pan the new George Harrison album because he passed away a year ago due to cancer. Don't get me wrong, I'm a huge Beatles/Harrison fan. I love most of his Beatles and other solo songs. But this has gone too far. Stuck Inside A Cloud, was a long boring tune. George Harrison was without a doubt a lengendery musician and I was devestated at his passing, but the line's got to be drawn somewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brainwashed","review":"This is a slightly strange album with a great title song. some of his vocals could be considered shaky, but this album has great instrumentals and well written songs. Overall i really like this album, but it is not my favorite harrison record. Still I would recommend to any harrison fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Last album","review":"The second Beatle to leave us and this is his final album; finished right before he passed away. George was still searching the spiritual side of life even to the end and it shows through every lyric and note on Brainwashed. Expertly produced by Jeff Lynne (ELO) and George Harrison's son."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good-bye Old Friend","review":"I've read a review in the newspaper the other day that said this album was the highlight of George's solo career. While I would love to give it my sympathy vote for all the joy George's music brought me through the years, I honestly don't think this is his best. That title goes to \\"Cloud Nine\\" in my book. Nevertheless, about half the songs on this album are really good, a couple are great and a couple more are dreadfully boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great final note","review":"One of George's best recordings, and one of the better post-Beatle recordings that any of the Fab Four did. A very personal record that gets better with each listening. Recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for George Harrison fans","review":"I was afraid \\"Brainwashed\\" might be a weak effort, but was very pleasantly surprised to find it is one of George's best. I honestly like every song on the cd, especially \\"Pisces Fish\\", and his cover of \\"Devil and the Deep Blue Sea\\". Dhani has done his dad proud!"},{"rating":"2","title":"George Still Teaches and Comforts with BRAINWASHED","review":"George Harrison has given us another gift. BRAINWASHED is many things, all of them good. I always thought he should have been labeled the 'humorous' Beatle instead of the 'quiet' Beatle. Many tongue-in-cheek lines as well as very thoughtful 'deep' ones make a George album something to listen to many times and enjoy thinking about what he is trying to tell us. Without mentioning any specific songs, George gives us all of his traits in this album. You laugh at his wit one moment then choke up a little when he jokes about his unfortunate situation. In other words, after 40 years the Beatles are still affecting us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sensational","review":"If you like the Traveling Wilbury's/ Beatles with a touch of ELO you will love this. Great production from the sixth Beatle Jeff Lynne and wonderful guitar and singing from George. If you enjoyed Cloud Nine it really is a continuation of that album, maybe it should have been titled Cloud Nine Part 2. We are very fortunate to receive this album and as Jeff Lynne stated there are apparently enough songs in the can for a couple more albums.So please Jeff roll them out asap.Buy it it's a classic"},{"rating":"2","title":"What can I say ???","review":"I knew this would be a poignant album as Harrison was working on it before he died. Too bad this album didn't get as much airplay as it did.Macwoodusa."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rather nice.","review":"I had never heard any of Harrison's solo work till I brought this, and truthfully i diddnt expect to much. But this is a really good album woth the songs having a soft, country kind of rock to them. The songs here are actually much better then what he wrote when he was with The Beatles. I think the highlights are \\"Brainwashed\\" \\"Any Road\\" and \\"Rising Sun\\", the former more of a rock sonh with the later 2 having a country feeling to them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mr. Harrison's final offering is a real treat!","review":"I ordered George Harrison's final album, \\"Brainwashed,\\" without having heard a single track, and I'm glad I did. Although his voice sounds a little thin at times from the throat cancer that would tragically take his life in November of 2001, the overall sound of the CD is terrific, and the song selections are classic Harrison. \\"Rising Sun\\" reminds me of the Beatles, or at least the way the Beatles would sound if all members were alive and performing today; a masterpiece of a song. George also does a cool remake of a 1930 song I hadn't heard before, \\"Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea\\" (co-composed by Harold \\"Over the Rainbow\\" Arlen). Great guitar work throughout the CD, wonderful tight harmonies by all, super contributions from George's son Dhani, and a CD I recommend without qualification."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent Album (Yes, I said Album)","review":"This is a great album! I think it is easily George's second best album and maybe even his very best. It is hard to compare it to All Things Must Pass because it was a \\"classic\\" album of a different time period. ATMP is great, but I don't listen to it repeatedly as I do \\"Brainwashed\\". If you love George or The Beatles, you should already own this album (CD). George was great and he left a wonderful gift for everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST ALBUM OF 2002 HANDS DOWN!!","review":"This album is fantastic. I really can't think of any other words to describe it. Altough this is George's final album released one year after his death, I am sure this brilliant music will live on forever. From the opening of \\"Any Road\\" to the bitterness of \\"Brainwashed,\\" George shows everyone how great an artist he really was. This whole album is great, but \\"Stuck Inside a Cloud\\" and \\"Looking For My Life\\" are standout tracks. I would recommend this album to all, not just Beatles fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"all things must pass","review":"But not before George gave one more gem to the world.

Its only George Harrison rival is \\"All Things Must Pass\\". It's also as good as or better than all of John Lennon's post-Beatles records except (of course) \\"Plastic Ono Band\\" and \\"Imagine\\". It IS better than EVERY Paul McCartney non-Beatle record, with no exceptions (although slightly less than one half of \\"Flowers in the Dirt\\" is very good also).

I loved it from the moment I first heard it. Every song is a gem, including, no matter what anyone else says, \\"The Day We Fall in Love.\\" If narrated songs (or Davy) bore you, then you probably won't like it. But for everyone who enjoys narration and Davy (as I do), they will find it a treasure. The bonus tracks are great, too. I love hearing all the different versions of \\"I Don't Think You Know Me\\" on various albums. This one boasts a version with Peter singing lead, and Micky and Mike (my two faves) on backup. And the goofy version of \\"Look Out (Here Comes Tomorrow)\\" makes me crack up! The early version of \\"I'm A Believer\\" is wonderific, too. I even think I like it better than the version that was put out as a single! You will luv this album, I guarantee you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Disc.","review":"The Monkees, from what I read, hated this album. Primarily, it was because it was released without their consent, without their input on song selection, and with them in clothing they thought they were modelling for a JC Penney catalog.That said...this is a great piece of pop music from the 60's. Two chart hits are on here: I'm A Believer and (I'm Not Your) Steppin' Stone. Great tunes. The rest of the album is not filler, but completed with fantastic tunes.My personal favorite on the disc is the Carole King written \\"Sometime In The Morning,\\" but many other great cuts fill this one: She, (Look Out) Here Comes Tomorrow, When Love Comes Knockin', and Mary, Mary are all fantastic.If you can ignore \\"Your Auntie Grizelda\\" and \\"The Day We Fall in Love\\" (\\"Laugh\\" okay, I suppose), you have one of the better albums produced in the era."},{"rating":"2","title":"My 2nd Monkees LP...","review":"I got this at E.J.

It was hastily slapped together to cash in on the Monkees growing popularity. It is definitely a mixed bag. There are some great songs and some downright awful songs. All the songs that Micky sings are great, especially the classic hits \\"Steppin' Stone\\" and \\"I'm a Believer\\". Mike's one vocal, \\"The Kind of Girl I Could Love\\", is a solid effort. And Peter's sole vocal, \\"Your Auntie Grizelda\\", is an amusing novelty song. The album's weakest parts come from Davy. \\"Look Out(Here Comes Tomorrow)\\" is great and \\"When Love Comes Knockin'(At Your Door)\\" is pretty good. But \\"Hold On Girl\\" is mediocre, \\"Laugh\\" is a poor attempt at a novelty song, and the spoken word \\"The Day We Fall in Love\\" is embarrassingly bad.

There are, however, two marginally good Meshuggah songs back to back on the disc (I'll let you figure out which songs I mean), and combined with the sheer curiosity of some of the other tracks, they make this album worth owning if Meshuggah is one of your favorite bands--and they are one of my favorite bands, hence my owning the disc.

Because the balance between him and the orchastra is in his favor, it sounds like he has the lead, he plays and interacts with the orchestra. I think it serves the recording as a whole.

Some drastic measures were needed...Fire Blaze Bayley as scapegoat to the fact that the songs in VIrtual XI are simply bad songs... Hire Bruce Dickinson and Adrian Smith to return to the good old times... Smart guys....VIRTUAL XI is something very sad. WHy? Because, with all the fall they had in the nineties, Maiden at least never sold out to commercial music. They are already getting openly into the compilation market (their new compilation release, EDWARD THE GREATEST, is simply a greedy manouver. They hadalready released a master compilation,BEST OF THE BEAST, and \\"dozens\\" of live albums[.]!), but their music is Steve Harris's music, strong and powerful.In VIRTUAL XI, the production is weak (as ever, since Martin Birch stopped producing Maiden albums, and some of the songs had potential.

But it still deserves 4 stars. This album isn't as good as the previous one \\"The X Factor\\" but still good. The album suffers from Blaze's vocal range, but not enough to make it unlistenable. His voice worked better with \\"The X Factor\\" as the music was more his style, and the music on here is more reminiscent of latter day Maiden. The worst song on this album is \\"The Angel or the Gambler\\". The song is almost 10 minutes long and is pretty boring. It also features annoying keyboards in the intro. All in all, this isn't the unlistenable abomination make it out to be and is worth purchase price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lightning strikes twice","review":"While Maiden deviated from their traditional sound for this and X factor, the underlying sound that their fans have come to love is still there. I don't care what the critics say and you shouldn't either. People complain about Blayze and they complain about Janick, but let's face it, Steve Harris is in the pilot seat. While I am sure that they had some influence over the sound of the album, I can't believe anything made the cut that the core members didn't want. While I felt that X factor was a little better, this album is still amazing."},{"rating":"1","title":"sloppy","review":"This is pretty bad. I'm only a few songs into listening, but the sound on here is horrible. I'm not going to touch the new singer, that's low hanging fruit. The guitars sound like they were recorded using PODs, the drums sound like they ran out of mics after doing overheads...the bass sounds decent, but isn't that always the case when he's the main songwriter? The performances here is what really kills the record though...sloppy enough that it really shows how little time was spent recording this record. Even a little bit of editing would be able to time correct some of these late hits, but there are just too many on the record I guess. So...if you're wondering what the band would sound like drunk, have a listen."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE","review":"This album just sucks - far away from the classic iron maiden albums. only for guys who want to have all of their albums.

It gets me, personally, going. Everything that made Iron Maiden great is here: Eddie, powerful vocals, sing-along choruses, killer riffs and epic arrangements. Blyze Bayley may not be Bruce Dickenson but I like him. It takes balls to fill that big of shoes. X Factor's best song really was Sign of the Cross, and to an extent they worked with it here- most of the songs are long epics besides the opener Futureal. Are these people giving it poor reviews hearing the same album as me? Sure, there isn't the same craftsmanship present that made albums like Number of the Beast, Piece of Mind and Powerslave all-time classics, but the spirit is there. This is still Iron Maiden and on their worst day they are better than 99.99 percent of bands out there. Eddie Lives!"},{"rating":"1","title":"yikes....","review":"this album (and lineup) is a turd.

Futureal is as solid an opener as you can get, short but catchy. angel and the gambler is another solid song. the clansman is a great epic, one of my favorite songs they have ever made, and probably Blazes best work on vocals. honestly theres not a single song on here that makes me want to say UGGHHH, turn it off, but then again never has maiden made me say that. I honestly enjoy this album better than FOTD and NPFTD but thats just my opinion. no blaze isn;t as good as bruce. but he still rocks. people will always complain when there is change.

Don't waste your money. Please."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrific.","review":"Easily the worst album Maiden ever released. Futureal is a good opener but there is nothing good about this album whatsoever. The production is thin, the guitars are synthlike, the instrumentation is basic and passionless, and every song repeats itself more than it should.Blaze's vocals are very lacking and it seems as if every song were written for someone with more range (I.E-Bruce). The album is overall an uninspired parody of Maiden, especially with the redundant choruses that make certain songs more \\"epic.\\"However, if you see a used copy, pick it up for a laugh.

And this was the lowest point of their career. I know because when Maiden came supporting this album, they could only play clubs and bars. That's how bad it got. It's also pretty obvious that at the time, they were more interested in Soccer than making music. I really thought this was the end of the line for Maiden. But thank the maker, they reunited with Bruce and Adrian and set Maiden back to where it belongs. As far as this album goes, there's only one bright spot: The Clansman. Great concert song. For that I'll give it 2 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the hell???","review":"\\"Futureal\\" and \\"The Clansman\\" are the only 2 songs worth anything on this dreadful CD, and only when performed live with Bruce Dickinson on vocals.

X Factor was crap extraordinaire and Virtual XI is beyond that. I'd rather chew broken glass than have to listen to Blaze Bayley. Steve Harris has lost his mind.

I don't hate Blaze, I stay away from that bandwagon. X-Factor was a pretty enjoyable album, and the music was dark for Maiden, fitting Blazes voice. Blaze, despite being a mediocre singer, sounded pretty good on that album. On here, musically, they tried to regress to their old sound which leaves Blaze's vocals sounding so out of place. At this point in the Iron Maiden career, we are also cursed to songs with 6 minutes of chorus. \\"The Angel and the Gambler\\" is the most annoying Maiden song ever. Imagine \\"Heaven Can Wait\\", but make the chorus EVEN longer, and repeat it EVEN more times, and then on top of it make the song bad. Perhaps a light in the dark for my fellow Maiden fans?

I think the main problem was that it became increasingly difficult to continue to like the main character as the story developed. I guess this is a reflection of the trade he had chosen to ply - does anyone like a tort lawyer? One knew that as the story went by it looked increasingly likely that Clay was going to be hoisted by his own petard, but I was really looking for a story twist that would bring him out on the right side.

But The KING OF TORTS was just a story of the underdog lawyer, so to speak, immense greed, but no interesting subplots or twists that kept you going. At page 324, I decided to skip ahead to page 424 to finish it. I found that I missed nothing in those 100 pages that I didn't read that I couldn't figure out by page 427. This book left me very unsatisfied, as did the wwful THE SUMMONS and wondering if John Grisham has just lost his original touch to write a great legal thriller. I hope not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as his others.","review":"I am a John Grisham reader and fan. Normally I enjoy his novels. I did not particularly like this one. Primarily because the main character, a public defender turned tort lawyer, is greedy, shallow, and ridiculously naive. Unlike other Grisham novels where the hero is trying to fight society's wrongs (or at least the Firm's), this book's plot is about screwing the little people (even ruining an entire small town) to make millions and buy jets. I found the whole concept rather disgusting and the hero got off way too easy in the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one for the time capsule.","review":"On the positive side, this was a compelling read - suspenseful, with interesting characters and decent plot development. Sadly, it ultimately disappoints. The main character's journey into greed and arrogance would seem to lead the reader toward something either meaningful, catastrophic, or in-your-face-greed-is-good cynical. Maybe it tries to do all three, but sadly, it succeeds at none. The almost inadvertant climax leads into an unsatisfying, incomplete, unresolved, weak ending with the reader (or at least this reader) feeling, \\"So, what was the point of this again?\\" Grisham seems to have been drifting toward this type of unresolved ending, with no clear resolution. \\"The Summons\\" ended with a similar lack of resolution, but worked better.With \\"King\\", Grisham just left me wanting. Not more, but something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grisham at his worst","review":"John Grisham past the peak of his writing with the Rainmaker and now continues to publisher a book every March, whether he has written anything worthwhile or not. He has the potential to write great popular fiction, but quite obviously didn't devote much time to character or story line development in this sad effort. Perhaps Mr Grisham should disregard any contractural agreements and leave the story writing until he feels creative. How much longer can his novels wear the title \\"bestseller\\" merely based on his old reputation as a great fiction writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete waste of money and time","review":"Like reviewers before me, I was completely disappointed in this book. Thankfully, I found it on the discount table at my local bookstore so I spent very little money on this horrible Grisham tale. Perhaps Grisham is too busy lately to actually put any real effort into crafting a plot line that captures the reader. I will think twice from now on before picking up anything by this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"King of Tedium","review":"The first and last 30 pages were okay. It was the middle 310 that were the problem. It reads as though it has been cranked out like the mass tort settlements Grisham loathes. This book could use some serious editing. It is also cynical, cliched, and predictable. To be sure, this is nothing new. Grisham's books are typically cynical, cliched, predictable, and in need of editing. What is different is that this book inspires little more than long fits of boredom punctuated by short bursts of tedium. Grisham thrillers are usually at least, well, thrilling. Not this one. I admit that because I liked the Summons, I'll buy the next one. But if they come out any faster, the bookstores are going to have to start selling them on the magazine racks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This is the same story that Mr. Grisham has told before with a different cast. A young lawyer sells his soul for money. He rises like a rocket from nowhere to become the \\"King of Torts\\". His subsequent fall is no less than meteoric. The ending is less than satisfying. Wait for the paperback."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of his best...","review":"I've read almost all of Grisham's books and can usually count on them for a good read. This book disappointed me greatly. The main characters, Clay and Rebecca, don't turn out to be very likeable; he's as greedy as all lawyers are made out to be and she's a golddigger. I found myself not caring whether they got back together, and actually hoping he might do some jail time.At the end we find out that greed is good if the cards fall your way, and if they don't, well, you still get the girl, your friends will give you some of their misbegotten fortune, and you can fly off to London and start a new life. Quoting, \\"He had Rebecca all to himself, and nothing else mattered.\\" Well how about the thousands of people he screwed over in order to maximize his own wealth... don't they matter?Grisham did a good job of exposing the greed behind mass tort reform, but the story he wrote as a vehicle for his expose left me cold."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Grisham's Best","review":"I was about half way through this book when I realized it was going nowhere. I was expecting something, anything, to happen. The characters were thin and the plot bounced along from case to case. Really glad it's over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn..............","review":"I have read all of Grisham's works and this is one of the least impressive. The plot was predictable: Down on luck lawyer has woman problems, mystery man gives him the case of a lifetime, lawyer makes tons of money, gets investigated, loses money, gets girl back. I knew the ending around the fourth or fifth chapter. Grisham has to get out of the rut he is in before his loyal fans go away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't read if you just read The Runaway Jury!!!","review":"While not too spectacular, it does make for fast reading. I bought this book because I am a Grisham fan, but it did not live up to my expectations. Now I'm afraid to buy The Bleachers. I hope that, like this one, it will not be a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Half decent writing - piss poor plot!","review":"After having read a number of Grisham's novels, this was the most dissapointing. I suppose it started out strongly, you know... classical Grisham. But then something went wrong and the plot never recovered. The characters were shallow and one dimensional and the ending fizzled out. I finished the book feeling cheated. How I wish I could get those hours back!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Can this be John Grisham?","review":"I've read all of John Grisham's books and was severely disappointed with this one. There was no character development, I never could figure out if I liked or even disliked Clay Carter because I didn't know him--or any of the other characters. The book read (or listened, as I did audio) like transcripts--I even found myself re-checking the jacket to make sure this was listed as fiction. There was no conflict until the last of 8 tapes--and I can't say that I cared once it arrived. I had much higher expectations when I got this book, I've really enjoyed all Grisham's other books, even the 'unusual for him', Painted House and Skipping Christmas."},{"rating":"2","title":"All Hail the King","review":"Yes! Finally mr. grisham is back with a juicy book! This book carries the story of a young lawyer faced with ethics, money, romance. The main character is believable and I felt compelled to see the affect of his decisions. I really didn't know how it would end, which was great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Sprint to the End","review":"Here we go again, or there we went > WHOOSH! Another sprint-to-the-end novel, a character with \\"Clay\\" feet, a boring bimbo, friends who are too good for him. I'm glad I got it from the library. In the last few years, authors who have given me years of enjoyment have apparently tired of their craft, and I wonder why they keep writing. Can it still be the money? Still? With The Summons I thought Grisham was \\"back,\\" or at least heading in that direction, but guess not. I feel like a fair-weather fan, but I think I'm entitled."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth my time or money","review":"I love John Grisham's books, but this one is honestly NOT good. At first the story caught my interest, but as the chapters slowly slide into each other and as money and greed come to the main character, educated readers already know what is going to happen. There is usually a twist toward the end of Grisham's books and you can foresee even what that will be. This novel got so boring that I finally skipped to the end of the book (which I have never done with one of Grisham's books before). Sure enough, all my guesses were correct. I am very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay for Grisham","review":"This book is oaky if you REALLY like the legal issues dealt with in the book and the under current conditions of tort reform in the United States at this point in time. But if you want a suprise twist or a murder or two; this is NOT your book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still not satisfied","review":"Like the other reviewers above, I too have read all of John Grisham's books. The last few have left me very disappointed.You always say to yourself that the next one will be better, back to the days of A Time to Kill or The Firm. In The King of Torts I find nothing sensational in the characters or the plot. This book could have taken so many directions to be suspenceful but it didn't,. You read to the end and you find yourself left way short. So we received a short lesson on mass tort litigation.What happened to all the characters? Why was Clay Carter chosen...it asks but never answers. Is this an economics book or a mystery? All I now is I am done.. if you want to read this definitely wait for the bargain table at your bookstore. Talk about mass tort lawyers being slime...what about lawyers turned authors who don't take the time to write a good book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed again","review":"I read this book very quickly, not because it was a real suspenseful page turner, but because I kept thinking that surely the next page would be better than the last - when is something going to happen? This book was so predictable to me - Clay was a struggling PD with a snobbish girlfriend and even more snobbish future in-laws. He became filthy rich, through less than honest means, and embarked on a journey that had a inevitable ending. It was just a matter of time before he began losing everything and I wasn't disappointed in that respect. I will probably wait to buy his next book on the bargain rack or in paperback."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same old same old story","review":"Grisham does a very predictable story thats has been done a million times but this time with lawyers big deal .Leave it on the shelf"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best, but okay","review":"Could have been better, I felt the best book in today's market is, Ross P.

A man of his intelligence could write this shallow waste of time in a day, and he probably did just that. If a book was ever written simply to profit on the author's name (or what's left of it) this is it. The plot is preachy and predictable, the characters are unremarkable and poorly developed, and the ending is incredibly flat. What's worse; a book written by a lawyer is packed with legal errors, from ethics to procedure. Grisham seems somewhat apologetic in his afterword, and he should be for stamping his name on this thoughtless wonder. Save your cash and spend it on an author who's still hungry enough to put some effort into his writing. Grisham's interests now seem to lie in other realms."},{"rating":"1","title":"never again Grisham","review":"After reading the worst book of my life, A Painted House by this author, I have vowed to never turn over another penny for his meaningless, pointless stories. Good reading all."},{"rating":"1","title":"King of Torts. The King of Pure Fiction.","review":"This book is based upon nothing more than fear, ignorance and trial lawyer bashing. Grisham should try writing a book on what the corporate attorneys do to the victims.At least it would be easy to base it on facts.The KOTs makes Dumb and Dumber look like an intelligent script."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read","review":"This was an enjoyable book. I liked the humor. My favorite scene was the wedding reception. It's not really a thriller; it's a morality play about selling your soul. What I like most about Grisham is that he can write (something a lot of bestselling authors don't seem to know how to do). It's amazing how he can make a topic like torts sound facinating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacks the thriller you seek in a Grisham book","review":"I was really disappointed after I finished this book. It started like a great read but ended with me asking... Why did I waste money on this book? I was looking for the chase, the thrill like his earlier works but what I got was a dud. Lacking any excitement, you'll be left wondering whether Mr Grisham's star is on its way down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth every minute","review":"Loved this book, as I knew I would.

I eagerly kept reading waiting for it to get better and it never did. \\"I want my money back\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and Predictable","review":"I am reviewing the audiobook version of this book, which I believe is an abridged version of the original.I found the story shallow and predictable, there were no surprises or intrigue like in Grisham's earlier novels. Perhaps he felt like he exposed the world of mass litigation on his book, but I didn't feel I got any insider info.All in all one of the weakest stories from Grisham that I've read thus far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read & Intimate Insight Into Mass Torts","review":"If you like Grisham, you'll enjoy this. Not his best work in terms of drama, but up to par in terms of story-telling and character development. This is a great practical and up-close primer into the world of mass torts and class action law suits."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Ending is Not the Book","review":"In some of Grisham's latest works, the ending is not a knock-out punch as they could be (such as Last Juror), but he makes up for it by spinning such a fine tale until then. That's often life, right? The conclusion to an event often isn't as compelling as the event itself.This audio book took us from Oklahoma to Nevada to Utah to Colorado and back to Oklahoma last year. It kept the pace of the dry landscape around us (especially western Oklahoma) and the otherwise-tedious hours going and going VERY well.The intro grips us (again, unlike some like Last Juror) and the story that follows unravels itself nicely.You may read reviewers who were disappointed in the ending but we were not. A knock-'em down stunner ending is always welcome but NOT always needed. It's a shame that so many base a book on the lack of such an ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good fun - just put your credibility on hold","review":"The popular accusation is that Grisham doesn't cut it like he once did a decade or more ago, and while that's probably true, if this was a debut novel by an unknown writer my guess is that it would be hailed as a triumph and great things would be forecast for his future. I thought this was simply a fascinating story very well told, casting an insight into the monumentally litigious world that is Corporate America, Inc. Of course, Grisham is always at his most convincing in and around the courtroom, and in this tale I was happy not to analyse its accuracy or authenticity and instead just enjoy the wild ride.For the record, I think this is one of Grisham's best efforts of recent years, in particular for entertainment value."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn. No suspense. None.","review":"Could this book be any more boring? Okay, possibly there's some mildly interesting information about mass tort litigation in the United States, but that's about it.There was no suspense about what was going to happen in the end. We all knew Clay Carter's greed and profligate spending would bear a hefty price tag at the end. It did. We knew he'd get the girl. He did.I'm a fan of Grisham's earlier works (\\"Skipping Christmas\\" excepted, of course), but this book comes nowhere close to the level of the others. I kept waiting for something interesting or unexpected to change the course of the story, but it never did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"Were we supposed to LIKE Clay? What about Ridley or Rebecca?Characters came and vanished from the plot like ghosts.The aspects of the story line that were developed (the trial in Arizona or Rebecca's marriage, for example) were predictable and concluded in a paragraph.I should have known better to pick up this book when my 16 year old (a huge early Grisham fan} couldn't get through 3 chapters of this one.Don't waste your money--based on the descriptions of the \\"high life\\" in this book--John Grisham doesn't need it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Riveting to the last page!","review":"I picked up this book because the title was so nifty and I found that it was a page-turner.

I even have an autographed copy of \\"The Client.\\" \\"The King of Torts\\" - no mystery, no redeeming qualities in characters, no intrigue - the most boring book I've read in years.

An interesting case presents itself to a young lawyer. However, you continue to read and you feel as if there is about to be an interesting plot twist. The only surprise is that it never comes. There is also little if any development of the main character, which there was certainly room for. The book can be read in a minimum anount of time and was at least partially enjoyable during the flight in which I read it. I would wait for the paperback or borrow it. It is not worth the price of the hardcover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Entirely Predictable!","review":"I was disappointed in this book since I thought that it was going to be one of his great legal thrillers with some sort of twist at the end. This book started out really well but halfway through it became entirely predictable. It's like Grisham started the book in his usual style and then got bored and took off for a holiday and let someone else finish it for him. Maybe he should take a much longer holiday!"},{"rating":"1","title":"the skipping stone","review":"We read it because it is Grisham...like a skipping stone. Nothing was developed. It skipped through plot and informed us that possibly our math wasn't as good as it should be. It skipped through characters...Like they were are in the shade waiting for something to happen.In fact, many characters left the book after making their money only to return to save the day and the main character. Yuck, skip it or maybe borrow but do not buy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked the first time...","review":"This is more a moral fable than a thriller... Easy to read, you finish it very fast but not 'cause of the fast pace but because the plot is very very easy. In fact the book has three episodes very similar one to the other: once you've read the first one, the other ones are variations on the same topic, making the terrain ready for the big and very predictable crash of the main character since the tenth page. At the end, you don't have the sensation of having pass through a great and creative plot, but a soft ride in some park: just above plain boring, enough to be finished and take another novel without a second thought about this one. \\"The firm\\" or \\"The client\\" or \\"The jury\\" are very far away now."},{"rating":"1","title":"More predictable than his other works","review":"The King of Torts starts out with a compelling story about a lawyer who is determined to be his own man, but quickly falls into a predictable tale of compromising your ethics to make a fast buck. The last 200 or so pages predictably depict the rise and fall of a greedy personal injury lawyer on a mass scale. I kept reading waiting for the twist that Grisham often puts in his novels, but was left wanting in the end. I really enjoyed his earlier works, including the non-legal ones, and hope that Grisham once again takes a chance in his writing with twists and turns to keep the reader interested."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Impressed","review":"I've read many Grisham novels and this is by far the poorest entry.

This may have been my last Grisham."},{"rating":"1","title":"King of Disappointment!","review":"I had great hopes through the first 2/3 of the book - but couldn't believe or excuse the wrap! I love to read, so it's not often that I want to send a book back and ask for a complete refund but the King of Torts isn't even worth the paperback price let alone the hardcover I purchased.John Grisham abandoned the book mid-way through.The King of Torts is a King of Disappointments. This book is one I would never recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Quick Read","review":"After making young inexperienced lawyers the heros of his novels in the past, Grisham finally sticks it to greedy, blood-sucking trial lawyers. He does a great job of exposing the fraud that goes on in the mass tort field today. Although a work of fiction, there is a lot of truth to many of the points he makes including the fact that there really is an organized group of trial lawyers who meet to discuss who to bring down next. These people are what gives the profession such a bad reputation. I think a lot of these \\"mass tort\\" lawyers ought to be investigated for insider trading and unethical legal practices. They are ruining corporations and costing us all money. And no, I'm not a CEO or anything; just your average citizen that sees what's going on out there in our ever-increasing litigious society."},{"rating":"1","title":"King of Torts-John Grisham lets down his readers","review":"King of Torts does not rise to the level of a well thought out and written story line that has made John Grisham one of my favorite authors.

I was dissapointed. The story drags, and you tend to get really tired of it. If you have no interest in law, then you may find this book boring. The story is very predictable, and comes off as just a moral lesson. Clay Carter who starts off as the good and humble guy, gets greedy. He pays a huge price for his greed. and then gets back with the love of his life at the end. Not one of my favorite books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grisham just spit this one out to make an extra buck","review":"Young lawyer lucks out, gets rich, gets greedy, learns lesson.

Hardly to the standard I expected from this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining but predictable","review":"Being a fellow Mississippian, I am a fan of Grisholm's and actually like the real life portrayal of the law industry that Grishom always gives his readers. If nothing else, this book makes you think about the real life issues of tort and of all the reasons you hear about industry, pharmaceutical companies,and businesses yelling for tort reform. Tort Reform has been a HOT issue in Mississippi during the past couple of legislative sessions. With this and John Grishom's imaginative way with words, I think this one is a best seller and a great one for a movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite a disappointment","review":"I have read all of Grisham's books, and I'm generally a big fan. This one, however, had few redeeming features. The lead character was weak, and not very likable. The plot was contrived and full of holes. The romance was tepid at best. It felt like Grisham had an ax to grind against class action suits and the lawyers who file them. He got so caught up in this that he never got around to character development or telling a good story. Save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than Grisham's most recent works","review":"In this book, the hero starts out as your typical Grisham protagonist - young hard working lawyer, toiling away in the Office of the Public Defender in DC. In a twist, however, our hero, Clay Carter, grabs at the brass ring and jumps into the sleazy world of mass tort litigation. His ethics are questionable, his motive is greed, and his rationality vanishes. He spends money like mad, selling out his clients in the process.You don't like the guy for most of the book, a point that is driven home by Grisham time and time again. I won't give away the ending here, but I'm glad Grisham didn't turn things around all rosy and happy - that would not have been realistic.The book is a quick and easy read. I enjoyed it more than I have more of Grisham's recent efforts. It's not as good as his early works (Time to a Kill and The Firm) so I can't give it five stars. Four will have to do."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Disappointed","review":"We listened to this book on tape during a very long drive across the country. That is the good part. It was better than random FM or AM stations. I was very disappointed in the lack of conclusion. It was as though his time was up and he quit writing. Morality tale? The main character ... had a few million flowing around him .... Not like he was a pauper or back to OPD. Characters were dropped off and not resolved. Story lines were abandoned. Sure this is a wonderful morality tale. Don't fall for the Grisham hype again."},{"rating":"1","title":"King of torts","review":"Among his most recent disappointments King of Torts is quite reasonable but in no way near the quality of books which John Grisham has written in the distant past. The start of the book is good but the end is abrupt. I suspected halfway in the book that what if the hero gets beaten up badly buy a grieved client and the book ends. And exactly that happened. I wonder what has happen to this talented and used to be entertaining writer. I am glad that I did not pay for this book, got it as a gift."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure [doo-doo]","review":"Not only is the plot stupid (a shady character tips a lawyer off who proceeds to roll the dice and hopes his mega-suits settle) but the main character completely violates the main rule of fiction - he is so greedy and evil that you hope he goes down in flames. By virtue of the fact that he's the main character, and therefore ought to be sympathetic, his final come-uppance is deeply flawed. He doesn't pay for his crimes and his redeeming vlues are so meager you can't help but feel that the time spent reading this has been wholly wasted. It's time to send Grisham to Iraq."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the beef","review":"Like many of Grisham's recent works, this one disappointed mightly. The first 3/4 of the work was interesting although many questions were left unanswered. The ending is where I really felt disappointed and betrayed. It's as though he's writing to a certain page count and suddenly realized he only has a few pages left and so abruptly cuts to the end. I thoroughly enjoyed his earlier books which were well developed all the way through but his more recent efforts have displayed a tendency to just throw out some ending to meet either a page count limit or a publisher's deadline. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK. Use the copy from your local library if you want to read it. One can only hope that this once interesting author will put more effort into his future efforts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Alright.. not great","review":"I read this one when it came out, and in comparison to Grishams others this one falls behind.

I thought that it could not get worse from The Summons, but again, it has.The story had no real direction, and I could not figure out the moral of the story.

Rich beyond his wildest dreams, Clay goes from civil servant hack to a Gulfstream riding hot shot in mere months.the story is an excellent ride of suspense and intrique ~ of love lost and love gained and a scintillating morality play not be missed.. a great read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Long and drawn out","review":"I have liked Grisham's stuff depsite the archetypal characters and sometimes hackneyed storylines... that's part of the allure for me of reading Grisham. I was expecting a mystery or a thriller, etc but this book just dragged on and on... It was a boring lesson in morality and an attempt to document the decline of a tort lawyer. I kept expecting a mystery but instead got a boring tale of excess, greed, and torts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really weak.","review":"The subject matter is compelling and interested me, but Mr. Grisham should have limited his scope (and page count) to an Op-Ed piece or a magazine article. There is simply no story here. None. You keep turning the pages waiting for something to happen -- surely this character will have an antagonist of some sort other than (or in addition to) the obvious one, himself. But no.This \\"novel\\" functions as a diatribe against greedy trial lawyers, much of which I agree with, but it's not a story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I love the way Grisham writes. His characters are wonderful. However, I was really disappointed in this book. Like most people, I have a very busy life. Finding time to read an entire novel is such a hard thing for me to do. So I was very sad to see the 'hero', Clay,be such a greedy, cliche character. It somehow was made even worse by his tragic end, even though I suppose he deserved it. I would just like to read something a bit more uplifting - like Clay learns his lesson, but comes out with at least some dignity and money. The last Grisham book I read, Painted House, had an ending that also left me feeling empty, like there should be more to it. So I guess when I find a few precious moments to read, my next book will not be authored by John Grisham."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a let down","review":"With the exception of a look into the greed which propels the mass tort litigation system in American jurisprudence, this book offered little for the serious legal thriller fan like myself. It lacked suspense and excitement and contained far too many boring characters. Not even the protagonist, Clay Carter presented as a strong and fully developed character. I was hopeful that this book would mark a return to vintage Grisham as exhibited by the plot and characterisation in The Firm and The Client, for example.Once again I felt short-changed when I was finished reading this novel as I have with the last several Grisham legal thrillers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save 4 hours of your life!","review":"This is another book that the publishing industry has marketed to make money. Grisham has done much better. While the book is a quick read, it does nothing to engage the reader. Grisham creates characters whose actions are not only unbelievable but also unlikeable. There is no reason for the events that they find themselves entangled. Ensuing chapters read like a blow by blow a year in the life of a tort laywer. No lasting impressions and no redeeming qualities to this work. Save 4 hours of your life!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Same old same old","review":"I am a long time fan of Grisham. I have read all of his law-based books. I have noticed a downward slide in his recent work. The earlier works have good plot twists and sometimes a surprise ending. Lately, the books have tended to end a little ambigiously or downright dull. This book is no exception. Good idea, neat plot line, but the character development is lacking. Some characters are developed and then set aside. When I finished this book last night, having stayed up late to do so, I was left with a strong sense of disappointment. Grisham fans beware. Not sure if I'd recommend this to anyone. Sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"No characters to like!","review":"John Grisham always does such a good job of fleshing out characters. So much so that the protagonists have their faults and the antagonists seems plausible. Here, the main character, Clay, just didn't appeal to me at all. I seemed to be rooting against him. There was no one to root for. I know every book doesn't need those things but Grisham's novels usually do. Oh well, they all can't be gems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading!!","review":"I picked up this book based on the back cover, which describes the book as the tale of one drug gone bad and some vigilante lawyer justice. However, that storyline is quickly dropped in favour of a get rich scheme. The lawyer is picked up and turned into a money making machine, outfitted with a convincing office and staff. But then they set to work on some compeltely unrelated case and it all comes crashing down with the espionage and the illegal and blah blah blah.I know this is the way of John Grisham novels, but the back cover is so off in tone one really wonders if the same book is being described. In any case, the book is pretty boring and lackluster."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drag... Drag... Drag... Where is the content?","review":"Grisham is a good writer, yet...This story lacks action. It drags on without much happening. One can easily rewrite the whole book in ten pages. To make this a better book, more twists could have been added."},{"rating":"1","title":"King of Predictability","review":"Uninspired,Predictable. Probably written during commercial breaks of Law and Order (the commercials are better than this book) Seemingly well past his prime, The Runaway Jury and The Partner were Grisham's last decent efforts. The Summons,The Testament,The Brethren have all been weak. I'm through with Grisham, until Multiple reviewers convince me otherwise well after his next release. If you've never read Grisham please do yourself a favor and read A Time to Kill,The Firm,The Pelican Brief,The Client."},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical Grisham","review":"Typical Grisham book-Young lawyer against the world-makes money-loses it-sails away.....however, easy reading for those who don't read often."},{"rating":"1","title":"another #1for JG?","review":"I believe if Grisham wrote a book on the proper way to hold your fork while eating, that it would go to the top of the bestseller list. I for one do not understand it. Grisham uses his public popularity to not only put his political views on display (like Tom Clancy), but also his morality views. If the writing were of a higher quality I might see how his books go to #1, but his last 4 (exculding Skipping Christmas) were dogs. I mean if an unknown author took this stuff to a publisher there is no way it would ever get put in print. Anyway The King of Torts lacked suspense, believeability, and was a bore to read. I am glad I borrowed it."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's the point -- this book is a waste of time","review":"I read through this whole book waiting for it to get good... it never did! I thought there was going to be some twist that made all of the foolishness worthwhile -- there wasn't! Obviously this was a cheap grab by the publisher and author to cash in before the Grisham franchise goes away completely. Bah!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING","review":"I have been a fan of Mr. Grisham since his first novel. But this one was not worth reading. The characters are one dimensional (not even good enough to be called two dimensional) the story in flat and uninspired. There is VERY little dialog beween the characters, rather most of the story is written in the third person. I was surprised that the price had a...discount sticker on it when I bought it. Now, I know why and it was overpriced even with the discount!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very bad for Grisham - predictable to the max","review":"If you don't know how this is going to end half way through the book, you might want to get your head examined. While it's an interesting premise, the ups, downs and ending are very obvious from early in the book.This book isn't about a single case, it's about a series of them. None gets developed well enough to keep you interested.Overall, a poor showing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give me a break","review":"Oh no...this is surly not the great John Grisham who wrote this book. Come on. What is going on here. This book is full of trash. Aint written by the Grisham who wrote The Client. Dont waste your money folks."},{"rating":"1","title":"YAWN","review":"I normally love John Grisham's books but I'm having a hard time with this one. I am more than 1/2 way through & it's killing me to continue reading it. It's very boring and that is highly unusual for Grisham's work. Unfortunately for me, I am the type of person who HAS to finish a book...no matter how good (or bad) it is. Please let the misery end!"},{"rating":"1","title":"a waste of effort","review":"What is good about the book: the information it gives on all the players involved in mass tort legislation -- defendants, litigants, and the attorneys. If Grisham's goal was to reduce the likelihood of people signing on with frivolous mass torts, he convinced me; I have received solicitations to join in on three different mas torts in the past few months, and now refuse to do anything to help those attorneys and their ilk make a fortune while making a mountain out of a molehill.However, I think Aesop's story of greed was more effective, succinct, and interesting. As far as entertainment goes, this book is a loser. I kept waiting for the plot to thicken, and it never happened. I think Grisham is riding on his own coattails."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY Disappointing","review":"If you would like to read this book, don't buy it....borrow it from a friend.I gave it 2 stars because I learned quite a lot about class action suits. However, other than that it is not worth it.Major problem: No character development, and most notably for the main character, although others in the book are just as badly developed, or should I say not developed at all.I would not say this is one of Grisham's best...but I would definitely say it's one of his worst."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy and Enjoyable read. Quick","review":"\\"King of Torts\\" is an easy read! The plot is fairly predictable, actually very predictable. This novel reminds me of a horse-race; whereby, the novel is quick out of the gates but falls short of full-speed-ahead at the finality. Grisholm is remarkable at capturing the reader's attention with subterfuge and an enticing plot.The main characters are fully developed and the story will keep you engaged to the end. Moreover, the end was too predictable, so one-star short of Five-r.An enjoyable and easy read, but don't expect too much deviation from the basic plot. Worth the read, since it's quick."},{"rating":"1","title":"LIES!","review":"Grisham goes on for who knows how many pages telling us that this dude is the king of torts, but anyone who's familiar with the academic literature on tort law knows this is a lie. What's even more annoying is that Grisham lacks the courage to argue straighforwardly that this guy is the king of torts; rather, he puts his weak argument in novel form, thereby using a gimmick of medium to obfuscate his fallacious message. That said, I think Grisham should win the National Book Award this year, on the condition that he accept his award naked, save for a Santa hat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting story line...... Needed more though","review":"I've read a bunch of Grisham's novel, not all of them, and this was ok. I found the story line to be rather interesting and learned a lot how the tort system works. Yet, my main problem with this book is that Grisham seemed to start a dilemma with the main character and then it was quickly resolved and onto a new problem. I felt a lot of this book was rushed and it could have gotten into more detail. I also noticed that many of his newer works seem to to be almost exactly the same length in pages. I am wondering if he has to meet a page limit and a lot gets cut out of the finished product.Overall I think this was a decent work but still doesn't live up to his very early works. Also, after reading the Summons, a lot of the info regarding torts was discussed in The Summons and it seemed like a copy and paste job was done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Time to Fish or Cut Bait","review":"I started reading Mr. Grisham's books when they first came out and enjoyed them. I was happy that a new author had arrived. Gradually, however, I noticed the plots getting slimmer and slimmer and even skipped a few of his books. I went back to reading him with A Painted House and enjoyed it very much. The King of Torts was my next choice and I feel taken advantage of by this trite, cynical novel. I did not like his derogatory references to fat people and \\"bimbos\\". I realize he was trying to speak for the main character but when it isn't dialogue it frequently is taken for the author's views."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"This book does nothing to engage the reader. The main character is so undeveloped that the reader does not care what his outcome is. Each chapter is basically a repeat of the one before it. My advice is to skip it, even when it is published in paperback."},{"rating":"1","title":"False advertisement","review":"Imagine for a minute if you will, reading a inside jacket of a book, which states \\"As he digs into the background of his client, Clay stumbles on a conspiracy too horrible to believe..\\" Okay, my first impression was this is interesting...okay let me summarize the book, Lawyer, by the name of Clay, gets a client he didn't like...wants to dump client...meets with a guy by the name of Max Pace...offers him a get rich scheme...somewhere in between is Clay's woman, who marries a guy she doesn't like...in the end Clay loses all his money....gets his lady back and moves out of the States..There is not conspiracy...no thrill...no suspense...basically the book is lame...the only reason I read up to anywhere was because I was still waiting on the \\"Conspiracy too horrible to believe...\\" which never materialized and frankly I think it was just to get fans of Grisham to buy the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could not finish","review":"This book was very trite. Got about half way through and gave up. Have read several of authors books and this is worst yet. Pretty sure I have given up on him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fable better told with Fisherman, his wife & Magic Fish","review":"I tried to keep an open mind. After all, this guy's sold millions of books. But this story is just the old Fisherman, his greedy wife and the magic fish fable, wrapped in lawyer's clothes. The fable though had better characterization, more tension and a more satisfying plot development. Man! I did find it interesting that this protagonist is a victim of the wealth that he hasn't really earned -- Does Grisham feel the same way? Does he feel guilty making so much money for a story that is so poorly told? None of the characters are engaging, interesting or complex. Please give me some ambiguity! And some description of what the character looks like! Minor tags attached to characters do not make them less cartoonish. Such a disappointment. It devolves into a catalogue of rich men's toys. Who cared about any of the characters? And the plot twists were entirely \\"Random, even more than usual\\" as the Tarvon deaths were portrayed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful Grisham","review":"This book was a HUGE disappointment. I could care less about the title character and there were loose ends galore at the end. Grisham is just pumping out books to fulfill his contract and gone is the writer that gave us The Firm. Borrow it but DO NOT buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment for a Big Grisham Fan!","review":"I was so excited to see Grisham was back in the legal forum with his latest book, but this was rather disappointing. I finally gave up hope when 90% of the book was read that there was no twist, no exciting turn of events, no scandal. Just a predictable \\"day in the life\\" story of a fast rising tort lawyer.Grisham still writes in a fast paced witty way & always manages to spin the perfect compelling character. That was the only saving grace.Bottom Line: Don't expect too much and you might not be disappointed. This is NOT \\"The Firm\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Starts out good but tanks out in the end","review":"I have read almost all of Grisham's Books but I was disappointed in this one. What could have been a great book turned out to be a flop. What was he thinking this time???"},{"rating":"1","title":"Grisham must have wrote this over a long weekend","review":"Having read all previous works by the author, this is one of his weakest. In short, the rise and fall of young lawyer Clay Carter. Unlike previous works, this is definitely not one of Grisham's classic page turners. No surprises, plot twists, etc.Like I said, this is something Grisham can write in his sleep - Let's hope the next book takes him back to his old form."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Book You Just CAN put down!","review":"The writer of The Painted House, A Time to Kill, and Skipping Christmas shouldn't have wasted his time on this one. It is not a page-turner and it is a book you just CAN put down. I am a fan of Grisham and he has talent that he is squandering on books like this. It was dull; the characters were stilted; the style is a dull narrative... I could go on, but as I said, I am a fan of Grisham. I hope he does better next time. I know he can. I am sure the book will make money, but I don't believe Grisham is all-Clay! Save your money and your time. That way you will avoid disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull","review":"I found this book to be dull. The first half was filled with math...I kept waiting for something to happen. Not much did except reading about how multi millionaires spend their money. I guess it would be called a happy ending when it finally came, however, it left a few unanswered questions. For instance, why didn't the author resurrect the one gal( a 17 year old prostitute), who couldn't be found at the start of the book, and add her to the suspense? Not as good as some of the others."},{"rating":"1","title":"You can see the ending from miles away","review":"The title character is poorly drawn and oblivious. On the one hand he has the integrity to stand up to potential in laws, but no spine when it comes to a wild get rich quick scheme. Wildly unbelievable, with the twists telegraphed. Save yourself the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worthy of Grisham","review":"This is not one of Grisham's better works. He tends to write well and so it is worth reading; but, it is sooooo predictible."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE!!!","review":"This was the first John Grisham novel I read and I expected more from what I have heard about John Grisham. The plot was horrible and it just dragged on to the predictable and rushed end. Do not even bother with this piece of trash that got accidentally published. I wish I could give this novel zero stars but I cannot. Blah!!! I will use this book for starting a fire in my fireplace. Awful. Disgusting. Horrible. What was Doubleday thinking? So much for \\"commercial publishers only publish good novels!\\" FILTH!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Grisham can do better.","review":"I have read all of John Grisham's novels so picking up this one was natural for me. I wish I hadn't.The story really never goes anywhere. Clay, A poor lawyer, gets rich, and then it appears that he is getting in trouble with the FBI, but that goes nowhere. Then he loses all of his money. That is pretty much the entire story line. Sprinkeled into this is Clay's desire to rekindle his old relationship with his now ex Rebecca and his hatred for her parents. She shows up about 30 pages from the end of the book and they are back together. This does nothing to add to the plot.I found myself hoping that Clay would get tied up in a court battle for his insider trading which would have set up a good courtroom drama for Grisham to write to.I don't know if Grisham has lost it, or his editors tore his original apart and ended up with this sorry novel. Regardless, I will hesitate with Grisham's next effort appears on the bookstore shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grisham is getting sloppy","review":"The same book by any other author's name might have never made it to the bookstores. It is implausible, lacks depth both in terms of characters and plot and is, above all, sloppy. It gives the impression of a job half-done to meet a deadline. Although it reads easily there is an empty aftertaste and a question \\"what was that about\\". I think Grisham should choose another nom de plume and start over again as his name is slowly becoming a liability."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of his better works","review":"Seems as if people either loved or hated this one. I'm one of those who liked it a lot. It's not his best work, but i think it's in the top 4. It's great to see him focus on a law novel again, as opposed to a novel about a man who happens to be a lawyer (\\"Summons\\"). It hooked me from the beginning, and he does a good job of making Clay the hero, then the conflicted hero, then the villain, then the somewhat redeemed villain. <SPOILER>......It's also nice to see Grisham actually have some positive romantic results for the protagonist."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice return","review":"I was worried that after The Brethren and The Summons we were starting to see a pattern of decline in Grisham's writing. Like most, this was not my first Grisham thriller and I remain a fan of his novels.I was pleasantly surprised by the King of Torts. The protagonist, Clay Carter, defies the easy to embrace and formulaic characters we were starting to see too often. His complex motivations and behaviors make for a interesting read that challenges the reader to consider their own ethical dilemmas.I'm not certain if it was by writing more in-depth character studies like A Painted House that caused this change but hopefully we can expect more of the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another chapter","review":"I was intrigued by the book. Always good characters and lots of story-lines. Morals are laid out, people changed, money rules all. Even some flaky romance. Mr. Grisham doesn't let you down in this one. I admit the end had me wanting more. All fans of the author and new ones in the waiting should pick it up. Look forward to his next one."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst book I couldnt finish","review":"I only regret having to give this book one star. It was awful. I've read all of Grisham's books, my favorite being A Time to Kill, and they're all fairly readable, nothing too taxing on the brain, you know, light stuff and that's ok sometimes. ... I couldn't even finish it. I'm glad I work in a library and don't have to buy books, but I used my job to get this book before anyone else and I'm sorry I wasted my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"The King of Torts","review":"I cannot believe I bought this book. What a disappointment. The story line is weak; Grisham seems to be more interested in mentioning high dollar brand names than telling a story. It is extremely disapopointing and very boring. I skim read it in about two hours (and that was too much wasted time). If I read another Grisham, and I've read them all so far, it will definitely be the paper back version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Time (and Money)","review":"This book was extremely disappointing. You keep waiting for something interesting to happen, but you're left waiting... There are way too many events that seem to happen because the author had to fill the pages with something. The characters and the plot are very weak. This is definitely one of Grisham's poorer outputs."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is B O R I N G (and I'm sad to say it!)","review":"I'm sorry to say that this book is SO boring. It's chapter after chapter of numbers associated with 3 large cases. I have PURCHASED and listened to (I am a voracious audio book listener) EVERY John Grisham book and this one was incredibly BORING. As I came home tonight I almost laughed as I sat in my car shaking my head at how much I didn't care about the characters because there ARE no characters. But I will always buy Grisham - maybe this is one miss out of many hits."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Courtroom Thriller, Without Courtroom or Thrills","review":"It's an interesting notion: follow a young lawyer's climb up the ladder of civil litigation and his subsequent fall. Too bad Grisham's Clay Carter merely coasts along.There are no stirring courtroom scenes: all the action takes place on cell phones between lawyers. There's no mystery during investigation. There's simply no investigation; a mysterious source provides everything he needs. Clay never questions the man's motives. He never questions the origin of his information. To be honest, he doesn't do much of anything. His career is handed to him, his demise mostly the result of unforseeable events. People come into his life, and most leave with barely a blip.Grisham scratches the potential of civil suits, but doesn't dig deep enough to shed much light on the topic. He implies dark secrets, but nobody bothers to search them out. This book isn't bad, just bland."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grisham is Clay","review":"As many reviewers have pointed out, Grisham is churning out books for the money.This novel is a didactic treatise on the need for tort reform with flat characters that no one can sympathize or empathize with. Like his last few legal \\"thrillers\\", and I use the term loosely, they seem told plots rather than moving character driven stories like A Painted House. A Painted House shows he can write. King of Torts shows he can make money."},{"rating":"1","title":"I won't buy Grisham anymore after this one","review":"Can I give this book less than 1 star?I've been losing faith in John Grisham as an author for awhile, but have continued to buy his books because some of them (Runaway Jury) are great reads. The King of Torts, however, has convinced me not to waste my money anymore. The book has no character development, a plot that is 20 years past its prime, and no conclusion of any interest. The whole time I was reading the book, I kept waiting for something - anything! - of interest to happen. I was sorely disappointed.Grisham also lets his readers down by failing to do any research into the Washington, D.C. public defenders office (or any other public defenders office). As Grisham admits in his author's note, the \\"OPD\\" portrayed in the book is wholly fictionalized because Grisham was too lazy to do any real research or fact checking. If Grisham can't waste his time finding out what a real public defenders office is like, then why should we waste our time on his book?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother With This One","review":"I was excited to read this book because I have enjoyed all of John Grisham's previous novels. However, the novel disappointed me after the first couple of chapters.The story starts off in one direction (Clay Carter assigned to defend an apparently random murder case), but immediately changes tracks when a new character is plopped in without explanation or justification.Grisham begins a tangent with the new character (Max Pace) which ends up being the rest of the book. Storylines that were presented in the first few pages do not get wrapped up until the end, and even then, unsatisfactorily.Frequently throughout the novel, Grisham throws in random events or developments that do not fit well with the story and are not credible.I plugged through the novel, hoping for a reversal back to the original story (the one Grisham had started in the first 10 pages), but it never came. A big disappointment, if you're keen to read a novel by John Grisham, try one of his earlier ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth reading","review":"I have read many of Grisham's books, but this one was so bad. This could have been the most predictable books I have ever read. The main character starts off poor, gets rich, and then loses everything; however, the problem with the story is, you don't even care what happens to him. If I had access to any other books when I read this, I would have put it down so fast. Grisham hasn't written a good book since 'The Partner'."},{"rating":"1","title":"I want my money back...","review":"To be honest, I felt the need to purchase King of Torts after overhearing a co-worker boast of a excellent read. To say I was sadly mistaken is an understatement. Perhaps I have read one too many lawyer novels (or perhaps I am just bored with someone feeding me jargon and pretending its a book)lately but it seems like this book lost any meaning after the first chapter. Honestly, in the beginning I thought there would be a bigger investment in the whole drug mess. To be frank, the only reason I finished this book was a slim hope that the main character would actually redeem his morals. I mean the beginning of the book goes on about his detest of his girlfriend's parents lifestyle and his lack of care for it. By the end he is a bigger sell out with a plane to boot. Honestly, he shows no character nor character development... truely this is a waste of my time as I prefer books that actually challenge the reader.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to usual standards","review":"I was pretty disappointed with this Grisham novel.

Lazily plotted; characters popping up cconveniently to bridge plot points and then disappearing; ridiculous, sloppy \\"resolution\\"; utterly unbelievable, even by Grisham standards. Just to show how quickly and slipshod this book was cranked out, the author picture is one of JG scowling at a book signing for his next book. Save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ultimately a Dissertation on the American Dream","review":"What would you do if you were offered a chance to make $15 million dollars in less than 6 months? Even if it meant doing something that made you feel uncomfortable. This is what John Grisham addresses in his tort filled dissertation on the idea of the American Dream.The main character is surprisingly sympathetic. I had compassion for him and I could see how I could be him. Through the course of the novel he changes as greed and a lack of love take over. What can save him?I also found this entertaining to read given my experience with the world of torts. Grisham again is on key, even not somewhat over the top (just a little though) about what large tort involves.If you enjoy John Grisham you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Political Message","review":"I thought this book was poorly written.

Why spend the time reading about a pathetic under-achiever who is given the golden goose. I didn't care about him from the start and it never got better. The characters are boring and, the plot line predictable and very tired. I didn't even finish the book. Don't start it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Like the King of Torts, Grisham should give the money back","review":"It has been some time since I've read a Grisham book, partly because they have consistently declined in writing style and plot. So I decided to try him again. My mistake. Like the books protaginist, Grisham ripped us off by making this a best seller based on his past success. Not based on this book with its poorly developed main characters. Each was a stereotype with no demension. The plot disappeared quickly and became predictable. This book is not worth reading on the beach. Skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical Grisham","review":"The book is typical Grisham and an easy read...It appears that Mr. Grisham has abandoned his roots as the Plaintiff's attorney for the \\"average Joe\\" in small southern town, \\"Oxford, Miss,\\" and that he is now more comfortable being in bed with big business and the insurance industry. The book pure fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and Predictable","review":"I read this book on holiday. The ending was completely predictable by about page 50. I was bored and struggled to finish this low grade book. NOT one of his better books!"},{"rating":"1","title":"thumbs down","review":"The other reviews can give you the necessary information about the plot. As another commentary on the plot, however, I was greatly disappointed. My husband and I both read the book and both kept hoping that there would be some redeeming plot twist. I thought, \\"Surely it can't just be a tiresome repetition about the main character's increasing lust for power and money?\\" But alas, it was just that. And then suddenly it just seems to end with a quick, neat, wrap-up."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little disappointing Grisham book","review":"I am a long time fan of John Grisham, I read all of his legal thrillers and this one might be the one I least enjoyed. The story line and characters in the book is so unreal.There were so many money making opportunities for Clay Carter at the beginning and so many bad things happened to him at the end at the same time is just not real.I enjoyed Grisham's early writings, lately has been a little disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Somewhat laborious reading but interesting.","review":"It took some time to finish this boot, but it was interesting, and I think it gave me a little background about the legal shenanigans that may be involved in torts law."},{"rating":"2","title":"enthralling reading","review":"I am new to Grisham novels, so I can't compare this with his other works. I will say that I found this to be a real page-turner though. It's interesting to imagine what it must be like to become so rich overnight, and not too hard to see that the main character is in for some trouble. Grisham does a really good job of developing characters, and while you may not always identify with them or condone their behavior, it's not too hard to empathize once in a while. Anyway, I found this to be very enjoyable and worthwhile, and based on my opinion of this book I will certainly read some others by Grisham in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"From the previews, I was expecting something along the lines of \\"The Rainmaker\\". Little man fighting a huge corporation. It turned out differently. The plot is pretty simple, the main character starts out with an almost minimum wage salary, makes millions, then loses it. Everything else is just filler. THis book had the potential for a WHOLE lot more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lowest of the Low","review":"I am sick of this very ordinary lawyer making millions by posing as a writer. I've read most of Grisham's books, but he lost my respect long ago. My wife brought \\"Kink\\" of Torts home from the library, so I'm not out the money. Because Grisham is one of the ten most influential people in the publishing industry, his money talks, and his publishers continue to create small mountains of his books at B&N entrances. This idiocy continues because enough readers are suckers for inane plots with shallow characterization and absolutely horrible endings. If you have any self-respect, you'll pass on John Grisham entirely and read a book by a writer with real talent and story-telling ability."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't even wait for the video","review":"I have read all Grisham's book's and this is by far the worst. What a let-down. Unlike his other legal thrillers there is no character to root for, unless you pick Tequila Watson! Whom I hoped Clay Carter would go back and try to rescue somehow. If any author could have swung a 'save' for Tequila I thought Grisham would have been the man. Sorry I wasted my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Copout\\"","review":"John Grisham should stop trying to meet his publisher's demands and take some time to write a good book; I'm sure he is capable of writing something other than a \\"Hollywood-type\\" book (like hoping to get a screenplay bid - worse he may already have it?) I think it's time that Grisham, Patterson, et al. stop cranking out lousy books. In defense of the book, it was interesting to see how class action suits are put together. Sorry John, please go back and write a great book - I'm sure you are capable of it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"King of Warts","review":"This is the last Grisham I am going to read. It is bad. It is poorly written. It is dull. It has no character you care about. I feel that Grisham started as a writer who had some depth and made it fun to read thrillers while learning a bit about law. However, this book dedicated to greed by both the protagonist and the author is the end. Sorry guys. This is the last one for this kid."},{"rating":"1","title":"The book without a story.","review":"I like to listen to books in the car, and I usually pick something trashy yet entertaining. Grisham almost always fits the bill. Unfortunately, while building this new by-the-numbers courtroom-lawyerdrama, he left out the numbers. Like it was a tumor, anything resembling a plot has been sliced out of the book. It just rambles along, resembling nothing so much as a drunk, stumbling down the street, mutterng incoherently about how things used to be. It's a book without a story, and the mindless entertainment Grisham used to be so dependable on producing has been reduced to simply mindless. I had more fun tossing the CDs to the dog like frisbees than I did listening to them. Yuck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Without the name Grisham, no one would have published it","review":"This book is not only an example of the depths to which an attorney will sink to make money, it is an example of what a one time good author will do just to pump out one more book for his money-making machine. I won't be buying anymore of Mr. Grisham's books. Too bad, some of his work is excellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kings of [Fools]","review":"We are the kings.We are the [fools]. The automated buyers of Grisham. ... This book is so predictable, so uncreative and so dull, that I wish I had spent the 4 hours on the golf course instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good, page-turning novel, but not much depth.","review":"Although John Grisham's The King of Torts is a well written novel with an interesting plot and equally entertaining subplots, some readers may not have a 'satisfied' feeling once finished with it, owing to the fact that the story does not have any significant twist, as Grisham best books traditionally do.If you are a long time Grisham fan, then you will not be entirely disappointed with Torts, but if this is your first Grisham novel, go for something older."},{"rating":"1","title":"Formulaic Disapointment","review":"It's too good to be true. The King of Torts is being set up from the beginning. He has an escapist ride to the top of the heap, but crashes and burns one set of values and has another set ready for the inevitable end. Too much like \\"The Firm.\\" To Grisham's credit it is quickly paced so you can finish this dog and find something with more substance."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste!","review":"This book has no plot (except lawyer bashing), no believable charaters and an ending that reminds one of the Lone Ranger riding off into the sunset. One of the worst books I've read in years. Boring, not objective and not realistic. I only finished it because I was SURE that Grisham (whose other books I've liked) must have - at a minimum - included some interesting twist at the end. What did I get? NOTHING! Waste of time, waste of money, waste of paper. The entire book could (and should) have been condensed to one paragraph about the greed of lawyers. The End."},{"rating":"1","title":"I finally just gave up","review":"Are you sure John Grisham wrote this book? It was so unlike his other books. It was so boring I started skipping pages to get to the \\"good part\\". Trust me - there isn't a \\"good part\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was this book about???","review":"I have read almost all of Grisham's books and have thoroughly enjoyed them. I started King of Torts expecting to have a good read. His stories do follow a formula, but it's usually interesting: good lawyer, bad lawyers, someone running for their life, and lots of money. As usual, his engaging style kept me turning pages, but I kept wondering when the plot was going to go somewhere. I could not believe it when I finished and realized that was all there was. So many story points headed in possibly exciting directions and not one of them panned out. I would say this book was a good first half of a novel. Unfortunately, it never comes to a climax or resolution. It's like telling a joke and forgeting the punchline. I was very disappointed. Was the whole thing about the evils of rapid wealth? If so, even that point was poorly made. I can't believe this got published. I hope Grisham puts a little more into his future works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely NOT Grisham's Best","review":"This definitely wasn't John Grisham's greatest novel. He touches on a bunch of different cases for Carter but I don't feel as though the novel was ever really pulled together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Someting is missing","review":"This book has a preety good storyline but I often found myself falling asleep while reading it. It doesn't have any action or suspense like the early Grisham's books had. He just keeps getting worse with every novel. If you are interested in reading John Grisham don't read this one, read his early stuff like The Firm, The Client, or A time to Kill. Skip this one though. Clay Carter is a very believable character but he is not exciting enough, he is just a very boring character who starts out small lawyer with no real hopes or dreams. Then through a lawsuit he makes millions, gets greedy, and the he ends up bankrupt. That's what the whole novel is about."},{"rating":"1","title":"not bad...but not the best","review":"I was quite excited to pick up the new Grisham book, but must admit I was disappointed in what I read. I found the book, on the whole, predictable and dry, and while I normally read straight throuogh his books this one I put down halfway through and then only idly picked it up again to finish. In my opinion, it wasn't quite up to snuff and not really worth the read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Credibility","review":"Highly improbable and not worth the effort. Begs for a sequel with a solid comeback such that the first novel makes sense."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poor to rich in less time then you think","review":"This is a great novel, on an average public defender that likes being average, but sooon finds himself being more then just average. I really enjoyed this novel as I do every John Grisham novel. With the detail, and a smoothness I just can't explain. A must read, for anyone dreaming of a little more then normal life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grisham's worst, no questions","review":"I won't even get into the boring, predictable and ultimately pointless story. Suffice it to say that a lead character with shaky morals and no redeemable qualities makes for a pretty uninvolving read. A new low for a once great author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed again","review":"I have been a long time fan of John Grisham but the last few books that I've read of his, King of Torts included, have just seemed like he got tired of writing and ended it. One of the things I always liked about Grisham was his ability to come up with twists and unexpected endings that were totally unpredictable. King of Torts was very entertaining up to the last few chapters of the book but the ending was a huge letdown."},{"rating":"1","title":"A TIME AND MONEY-WASTER","review":"Thin premise, weak plot line, poor character development, and a lousy ending. Young and gullible lawyer trades his ethics for big bucks but eventually sees the light. Boy leaves girl and goes through trials, then boy gets the same girl he didn't want in the first place. Ho-hum. Don't waste your time. It's clear to me, considering \\"King of Torts\\" and the boredom of his \\"Skipping Christmas,\\" that Grisham has written himself out. (Why didn't I give it a '1', you might ask. Because I did read it all the way through, and because I did learn something about the modern practice of class action law. Were the learnings worth my time? In my opinion, no.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull","review":"Grisham usually delivers quick, easy, and enjoyable reads, but this book fails to hold the reader's attention past chapter eleven. At that point, the book becomes incredibly boring and difficult to finish. Don't waste time or money on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Grisham","review":"King of Torts brought back memories of the older Grisham books. I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Grisham has a way with his characters that allow you to visualize them so well. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Enough, already","review":"I had promised not to buy any more Grisham books, then a friend brought me a gift. As I started reading, I had a strong desire to hit the title character. As I continued, I wanted to hit the author. Totally unrealistic, shallow to no character development, completely forseeable and criss-crossed with technical errors. And from this he makes a living!"},{"rating":"1","title":"King of Torts","review":"I read an interview of Grisham wherein he said he did not expect all his books to be bestsellers. I suspect he was referring to the \\"King of Torts.\\" I think he already knew this book was way below the expectations that people have when they pick up one of his books.A young, struggling lawyer is offered a way to make a lot of money. He makes a lot of money, becomes entangled in the method of which he made it, loses a lot of money and nothing happens.Characters are shallow, save your money and time. A verrrry boring book.A shame when authors take advantage of their name and ability to sell books and put out a less than adequate effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy this book, it's as good as it gets","review":"If you are a Grisham's fan, buy this book and you'll not regret.

This was one of his better ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"The King of Torts","review":"Painfully predictable! Sorry, but although I've been a huge fan of Grisham's books in the past this one was unbearable. Only read through to the end in the hope that I might be wrong. Characters one dimensional - set in stone sterotypes - the leggy dumb money hungry blonde, the poor little rich girl, lawyers with no morals etc. As a result you feel nothing for any of the characters. Slightly more readable than a Mills and Boon book, but only just."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not Grisham !","review":"I'm really a big Grisham fan and have read all of his books.

A previous review hit the nail on the head. Utter formulaic crap. It is the book version of network TV programming. A hastily created outline fleshed out with gloss and flash and at no time a shred of human character development of any depth. I was intrigued by the promise of the cover jackets' description about \\"a conspiracy too horrible to believe\\". I kept waiting and waiting for the \\"conspiracy\\", which turns out to be the concept that big corp pharmaceuticals actually rush unproven drugs to market for profit. Wow, gosh, really?

However, this book was pretty bland. I kept expecting something significant to happen-or at least a drastic twist in events, and that never came. The book exhausts the word \\"million\\", and revolves around getting insider information, and spending way too much money. Unfortunately, that is pretty much all that happens in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"How could this be called a thriller?","review":"If you don't care about manipulative, greedy, lawyers, you'll be hard pressed to care about this \\"hero\\". Character development starts out well, and fizzles into shallow stereotypes. The plot, initially engaging, drops into a predictable \\"when will he lose all the money?\\" and \\"will he stop sleeping with the model to get back with his married ex-girlfriend?\\". In a phrase, who cares? Definitely NOT Grisham's best, or even most mediocre, work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grisham - The king of the great start","review":"Grisham's novels always start out great, but end up leaving me vaguely dissatisfied. The King of Torts was no exception. The first half of this book is some of his best writing yet, the second half isn't even worth reading. It's as if the author just gave up half way through. I do not recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Tort-uous Trip","review":"A frustrated 30-year old public defender, intimidated by his girl friend's rich parents, opts to chase the big bucks offered by a shady character representing a major pharmaceutical company as a tort (class action) lawyer. Millions of dollars, yachts, a Gulfstream, a trophy model and 17 months later his bubble crashes and bankruptcy completes the circle. Grisham has an ax to grind and over 450 pages, he manages to savage the tort system. Unfortunately, the chartacters are merely pawns in forwarding his editorial trip, and the reader suffers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grisham Gave Up!","review":"This is by far the WORST Grisham book I've ever read (and I've read them all). Just when I think I might get a big surprise ending, I just get an ending. That's all. The plot never came full circle...characters were introduced in the beginning and played up, then never reappeared....it's as if Grisham just gave up in the middle of the book. Since I'm a devoted Grisham reader, I'll try again, but if the next one bites the dust, he won't get a third chance."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the way to go","review":"Napalm Death is a traditional thrashing, lashing death metal band. The songs on their other CDs almost sounded one-dimensional and repetitive. The songs sounded as if they had spent 5 minutes on them, the writers not taking their time, totally tearing in each song.

Not kid's stuff. I think the animation is also crude, but it's an old movie.Don't get me wrong, I love Disney movies but this is a movie I will not totally like. I absolutely love Bambi and all the other animal films, and the modern princess movies. I'm sorry if I sound unfair, but this movie gives me the creeps. My little cousin hides it under all the other DVDs. But I have to admit, the bonus stuff were great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good story but poor format","review":"Buyers be aware, this format of DVD does not fit to your HDTV (with black bar on the sides).Instead, this is for the old TV built 10 years ago. So do not expect good viewing experiences."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME! The perfect combo DVD Blu Ray package for everyone.","review":"This is great comes with DVD and Blu Ray disks. We loved all the little extras like the commericals from the 50's and 60's, Audio Commentary with Walt Disney. Of course the muisic video of \\"Someday My Prince Will Come\\", and the Dwarf Mine game was really cool. My sons said they could really imagine being really in the mine with the Dwarfs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snow White","review":"I have not ordered this item. I will not order this item. I almost did, until I took a second look at the price. This item is so overpriced, that it will not become a part of my Disney collection. I can't believe Disney would charge this much for a Blu-ray disc. I give the movie 5 stars, but the packaging and cost bring it down to a 2. Sorry Disney."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why So Expensive?","review":"I assume this is the newly released Diamond Edition. The price is too high. And why is Amazon not selling it direct?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Movie Classic!!","review":"Of course, nothing beats a great Disney movie classic!! You can't go wrong in purchasing this classic as a DVD for your collection! It's good versus evil and we all know that good prevails over evil. On this DVD version, however, there are some facts, features, etc., that you do not get with the original VHS movie plus there is a great game that kids will enjoy playing. My daughter loves the movie & enjoys the game!!Nothing can really discribe this movie other than it is a classic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"PERFECT Disney in every way","review":"This DVD is perfection out of the entire Disney lineup. Tons of extras, incredible digital remastering of a 50+ year old print, the whole package is simply fantastic. A must for anyone who loves Disney or Snow White in particular."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maddie's Favorite","review":"After watching Snow White no less than EIGHTEEN TIMES with my 20 month old I feel as if I am somewhat of an exprert. Disney has outdone themselves with this masterpiece of a film. The story is greatly known, although the message that this sends to young women may need some interference from mom and dad but ths movie is timeless in it's good vs evil themes and true love.The DVD extras are quite fun: visit Snow White through the years. Play Dopey's mine game (well this is a bit dull for adults but the little one loved it), a \\"Hi-Ho\\" sing along. There is also Barbra Striesand belting out \\"someday My Prince Will Come\\". This is a great DVD to add to your collection and one that will get much play."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"I recently received the Diamond Edition of Snow White, and I all I can say is \\"Amazing\\". The quality of the picture with the diamond edition is flawless. I also like that it has bonus features that I enjoyed sharing with my children. This is a great movie to own for yourself, or give as a gift with the holidays around the corner. A timeless classic to say the least, and one worth watching over and over again!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for a family with small children","review":"As a mother's perspective I must say that my children were very entertained as they saw this movie. Not only once but they played it 3 times the day that it arrived. The musicals were very entertaining. The quality of the movie was really nice and crisp. Only downside for me is that I don't like my children to see witchcraft even if it is a fairy tale(when the queen is making the potion and puts it in the apple). Just my thoughts..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"Anything Disney/Pixar makes is a wonderful, enjoyable movie for the wholefamily to watch together or just alone. Quality material, great stories chosenfrom our childhood and exciting to watch again as adults. Out takes are hilarious."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"My girls have been waiting for four years to watch all the princesses in one night. When it came time to play the movie the tracking was horrible and would not adjust with my tracking controls. The color jumps from B&W to Color constantly, and the tape jumps scenes. My girls were very disappointed and I would like to mail it back to them and get my money back. No exchanges no replacements."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent service!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"We had excellent service from this vendor and are well satisfied. Thank you so much."},{"rating":"2","title":"snow white the movie that started it all!","review":"I just recieved my copy of this dvd set and it was worth every penny and arrived quickly. It was beautifully remastered. It looks and sounds much better than my vhs copy. I now have a complete collection of the disney princess collection on dvd and I'm soooo happy about it! Thanks amazon for having available all these out of print titles. I loooooove this website!"},{"rating":"2","title":"family fun","review":"This is one of the best children stories I have ever seen no matter how many times i see it.My son is 3yrs old and he had never seen it before he wants to watch it all the time.He also has taken it to his daycare for the children there to watch.Every child should have this movie.Even my husband enjoys watching it with me and my son it is truly a family movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Platinum edition sets platinum standards of excellence.","review":"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (chosen by horror novelist Ramsey Campbell as the most terrifying movie he has ever seen, well everyone as at least on traumatic Disney viewing experience in their youth - for me it's Bambi) set the foundation upon which ALL of Disney's follow up animated features would be built. Any fan of Disney, or animated movies in general, will see this as a required addition to their libraries.The almost limitless 'immersive' DVD features will take months to watch and allow people a rare look into the creative process of mounting such a technically challenging project (the first of its kind) as this.The film itself looks flawless, no speck, no grain, no fading, the colors just as bright and vibrant today as they were in 1937. It is a mint condition presentation of a platinum standard film that set the mold. Not only highly recommended, but, as I said, a required addition to any film buff's library."},{"rating":"1","title":"False Advertising","review":"When I purchased this product it did not mention the DVD was entirely in Korean. I can't even watch it. What a waste of money. I will never use this seller again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disney's Limited Issue: Dumbest. Idea. Ever.","review":"Disney. Listen up. You make movies for children. People have children who didn't have them before. Those children grow up and aren't children anymore. Are your DVDs only for the people who happen to have children during the period you choose to sell them?When this movie was released, I didn't have a child. I didn't buy Snow White. Now that she is getting to the age that she might enjoy it THE MOVIE ISN'T AVAILABLE! I WANT to buy Snow White, but I CAN'T buy Snow White. By the time you decide to re-release it SHE WILL BE TOO OLD TO ENJOY IT! I WON'T buy Snow White.This idea of limited issue of children's movies has to be the dumbest idea...ever.EDIT: I found a copy on eBay. I don't know if it's legitimate (there are a *lot* of obvious fakes available) and, frankly, I don't really care."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic to love forever","review":"What's not to love with this classic Disney Award Winner? The updated visual content has made the picture look brand new and bright. The witch is scarier than ever and the dwarfs more adorable. The extra DVD is great for those who don't have a blue-ray although it is gorgeous and crisp and clear on both, but especially the blue ray. I am not much for all the tricks with Blue Ray but I guess if you are, you will enjoy the features. Worth every penny and then some! A treasure to keep and share!"},{"rating":"1","title":"late and scratched","review":"I was very disappointed with this Amazon shopping experience. Not only did this video take weeks to arrive, and then only after contacting the seller, it was damaged. My daughter couldn't wait to see Snow White and unfortunately the scratched DVD skipped 5 minutes into the movie. I am so disappointed and upset that I spent 35 dollars for a movie we will never see!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Devastated","review":"The film will not run. 1: Title 'Show White'appears on screen but cannot be accessed in any way. 2: Then there is 'clip' that do open but is useless. 3: Does not open either. At the right side is an icon that does nothing but indicate that it is Dolby sound.The film just does not operate!"},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointed","review":"The movie was billed as in excellent condition, but it gets stuck at the same point every time and is almost impossible to continue on. We always miss part of the movie when we do finally get it to play again and it takes a lot of time. I definitely wouldn't buy like this again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Second try ....","review":"This DVD purchase was a disappointment since the DVD would not play. My son informed me and I informed the sender. A second DVD would not play either and the store offered a refund. Lesson learned: DON'T BUY DVDS FROM AMAZON.COM."},{"rating":"1","title":"These are now PIRATED COPIES!!","review":"Let me tell everyone. All of the movies that are not being made anymore are now selling as PIRATED COPIES!! You cannot get an original Lion King, Snow White, Little Mermaid, Aladdin, Beauty and the Beast.....The sellers will tell you that they are original and factory sealed. But just check for the SECURITY SEAL. It is GONE!! There is no security seal on any of these. And the \\"paperwork\\" is all copied. The video quality is very poor. The originals are put into \\"flip page\\" cases, but the copies have the DVDs on the sides of the case, facing each other.THESE ARE PIRATED COPIES AND SOME OF THESE SELLERS DON'T EVEN KNOW IT. That's what makes it harder to report them. They are genuinely nice people and didn't mean to sell a copy. They really think it's an original. So, NO, I haven't reported anyone...just letting everyone know through this review."},{"rating":"1","title":"one of the creepiest movies ever","review":"I'm sorry, but Snow White (along with the Wizard of Oz) has always creeped me out. All the bells and whistles of this admittedly amazing DVD version only add to my creep-out factor. My daughter and her little friends enjoy this movie. Alas, I never will."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Happy Movie","review":"Buy this one for your kids, They'll love the Disney magic and songs. Adults will like it too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Movie - Blu Ray won't play on Pioneer BDP-121","review":"I've been reading that people have been having trouble playing the Blu Ray version on some older Blue Ray player models. It won't work on my Pioneer BDP-121, even when I updated it to the latest firmware (Version 9080400).Your 3 year old daughter isn't going to care if it's on DVD or Blu Ray or even VHS. She wants to watch Snow White and wants to watch it NOW NOW NOW. I just thank my lucky stars that the DVD version came with the package, I was able to play it without any problems.I'm giving 1 star for the non-functioning Blu-Ray disk. Eleventy million stars for the movie itself.Sooo.... skip the Blu Ray, especially if you have a Pioneer BDP-121, and stick with the tried and true DVD format.-Derrick"},{"rating":"1","title":"little disappointing","review":"When i received the Snow White DVD in the mail, my daughter wanted to watch it right away. Unfortunately, when we tried to play it in the living room, all we got was a lot of noise from the machine and \\"Disk Error\\" on the screen. Needless to say I was not very happy. We tried it in the DVD player in my bedroom and it does work in there although the entire time it plays you can hear the disk inside the machine. Since I dont want to have to let my daughter in my room every time she want to watch Snow White, I will probably be buying another copy and hoping for the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Remastering of a Disney Classic","review":"The Snow White on Blu-Ray looks fantastic. A remastering of a classic... not much to say if you've seen Snow White. I love that it comes with a DVD copy as well. This is great so that you can play on the DVD player in the car for the kids, while still having blu-ray quality at home. Definitely worth adding to your movie collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"blu-ray, hoo-ray!","review":"Well, I suppose the only downfall of my prchase has been the fact that there is not a digital copy of the movie, as some recent productions have released. Now, don't get me wrong, I am truly thrilled to possess a copy of this animated masterpiece, but such geeky goodies would make my purchace all the better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Walt Disney does it yet again.","review":"Snow White is a film that has been released numerous times on various formats. So after awhile you have to stop and wonder, is it possible for them to come up with anything new. Well it's Disney, and the answer is yes. Yet again Disney has put another top notch release. This set is packed with great bonus features. One that stands out is Snow White Returns where Disney found old storyboards for what could have been a possible sequel. We may never know. But the real star of this release is the picture quality. Making it's first appearance on Blu-ray, Snow White looks absolutely amazing. I purchased Snow White back when it first hit VHS and again when it first came out on DVD and dare I say that it looks even better now, than when it was first released in theaters over 70 years ago. They say you can't improve upon perfection, well someone forgot to tell that to Walt Disney. After watching Snow White I can only wait in anticipation for their next home video release."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning.","review":"We already had the VHS version. The DVD is stunning. Our system is a progressive scan DVD and HD rear projection, and this DVD shows incredibly well. The kids have been singing 'hi-ho' for days."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disk does not work.","review":"We received Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs DVD and it is incompatible with our Panasonic DVD player. We've never had this problem before with any other DVD. The Snow White disk works in our computer and another player in our office, but not in the DVD player that we have at home. Consequently, we haven't been able to view the movie with our child."},{"rating":"1","title":"BOYCOTT NEOMARK","review":"The disk I received from Neomark through Amazon is faulty. It won't play on my Blu-Ray machine. It won't play on my computer. I'd never had a new disk that wouldn't play so I complained to Amazon. Amazon sent my complaint to Neomark. I didn't hear from the company. A few weeks later I again complained to Amazon. Again Amazon referred my complaint to Neomark. Again no response. So I complained again to Amazon. Amazon essentially stated that the problem is not theirs but is between me and Neomark. Obviously, I am disappointed with Amazon for not backing up a product sold through its website. As for Neomark, if the company even exists on planet Earth, I will never again buy another product from them. So I'm stuck with a bad disk that I have no choice but to trash. Now, I will always avoid buying products from outside sellers through Amazon. I could get burned again anytime. I suggest you consider my advice and do the same, especially with Neomark also known as Blackmark."},{"rating":"1","title":"Este disco apesta !!","review":"Compré este disco blu ray y me llevo una gran sorpresa al escuchar el doblaje en español !!!

In fact, I think Snow White was the first movie I ever saw. It's a pretty good movie, considering it's age (1937). The animation is top-notch as is the voice acting.

My niece is very happy and satisfied with this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"The most annoying voice in Disney history.","review":"I am an avid Disney fan, but that doesn't mean I love all of them, and Snow White is one that I will never like. It is average when Snow White remains silent, but when she talks I must admit to cringing. I give it two stars for the animal characters (I always liked the turtle) and Grumpy (the rest of the Dwarfs kind of freak me out). Also another thing that annoys me is that Snow White falls in love with the Prince after meeting him for two seconds (and kissing a bird) at a well, I don't think they even exchanged one real word, Cinderella had more contact than that with her Prince and that was pretty minimal. It really is the worst of the Princess movies, which I feel is too bad because it was the first and I really wish that I could like it, but I really can't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs","review":"I ordered the DVD (Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs) back on September 20th. An e-mail sent to me on September 25th stating that it was to arrive between Oct. 2nd and Oct. 20th from something called \\"theworkhog\\". I have e-mailed them and asked where it was and to let me know when it would arrive. It is already paid for and nothing has yet to come of it. Now I want to know where it is and when am I going to receive it. I have no way to give an actual review of this as the reasons I have already stated. Now I want you to investigate this and get back to me. \\"theworkhog\\" seems to be a very irresponsible company and could care less about the customers they deal with.

The savings are not worth the hassle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent product but points off for damages done to packaging","review":"Highly recommended for fans of Disney's Snow White. I got this side primarily because of the bonus contents - book and pin set and the beautifully designed box. The box is cardboard and the richness of the feel is from the printed velvet-like fabric that was attached over the box. It would have been better if this is actually wood. On the other hand, the effect may not be as nice as a velvet feel.Unfortunately, i would give it less than 5 points because the inner platform was torn in area. I do not think that this is a result of shipping. I think this is more a result of careless packaging when in the factory since the external wrapping are all in stellar condition. It is sad, a blight on a otherwise good product.If the inner platform have used the same cardboard/velvet combination, i suppose this may be avoided"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ahhh The Barbra Streissand song is soooo horrid","review":"I am not even a Barbra-hater...

Because of Disney's stupid limited release policy, generations of children will not be able to purchase certain DVDs. Snow White was released in 2001 and put in the \\"vault\\" in 2002. A child born later than 2002 will not see Snow White on DVD in a store for atleast a decade. So much for experiencing Snow White in the magical years. The nimrods who came up with this anti-consumer policy need to be put in a vault. DISNEY wake up! Release ALL the Disney classic movies on DVD and keep them in stores.

I was not a big fan of Snow White and The Seven Dwarfs when I first saw it, but watching everything on the dvd I have a big appreciation for what Disney did. I actuall watched the dvd and it is absoultely fantastic. Plus the Remastering of The Film and Audio tracks are first rate and it looks like it just came out yesterday. That's how good it looks. But before you run to the store to buy it rent it first and just watch the movie then buy it and watch the special features.

Luckily, I found out how to get it in English without the subtitles. Choose the third cloud on the bottom of the first menu screen. Then choose the 2nd option under the first heading and finally choose the 4th option under the second heading. It will take you down to a cloud at the bottom (the left-hand side); choose this one.

Snow White's PQ and AQ are just awesome on this transfer. Perfect way to present to your little ones or older crowd who may have seen the film many of times. Watching this transfer of the film on a good HD set up with surround is just a totally new experience. Remember the aspect ratio is not the typical 16:9 so you'll have bars on each side of the screen, although Disney has put some thought into it and you can enable a feature that replaces the plain black bars with pictures that blend into the movie. Can't go wrong with this one. Disney, keep them coming!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Something for Everyone","review":"I love this version of this movie! It's awesome that you can watch DVD and Blu-Ray.

For once, the home video department at Disney doesn't fail us.Both discs included allow you to fully understand the process behind making Snow White. Areas like the Abandoned Concepts, Deleted Scenes, and the Camera Tests are all fasinating. The archival radio recordings and trailers too are a great look at the past.I do have to note that some of the extras glorify Disney (the company) maybe a little much. The \\"Disney Through the Decades\\" extra is wasted, what with Jodi Benson and Ming-Na telling us how great it is that Disney has their own hockey team and such.But dispite these flaws, Snow White is still a must own disc. The film still holds as a classic, and the extras are definately worth checking out. There may be better DVDs, but I honestly can't think of any off the top of my head."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must-have for your Disney DVD collection","review":"Snow White was one of my favorite Disney movies as a child, so I was thrilled to get the DVD.

They film has been remastered and has never looked or sounded better. We previously had Snow White on VHS and the difference between the two is astounding.In case you haven't seen Snow White, I have to tell you to beware as it is quite violent. I watched it with my daughter and I was shocked at how much more violent it was than I remembered it. The Wicked Witch orders the hunter to kill Snow White and cut out her heart. There is also a seen in which the hunter is standing behind Snow White with a knife, in position to stab her. So, this may not be the best movie to watch with your little one. You might want to watch it first and fast forward through the scary parts when watching with a child."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Combo Pack","review":"As a mom of 4 young children I was excited to hear that this movie was coming back out of the vault. I wanted to share this movie with my kids. I enjoy buying and collecting the Disney Movies, so it seemed only natural to add Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. My daughters; ages 2 and 8, and my son; age 6, enjoyed this movie. I liked the fact that it came with the regular DVD of the movie, an addiotional DVD with bonus features, and also a BluRay Disc of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.We enjoyed some of the bonus features as well; my kids liked watching the sneek peak of 'The Princess and the Frog', as well as a music video and a sing a long song of Hiegh Ho. There is also a commentary done by Walt Disney himself (prerecorded years back) and some interesting backstage viewing of Walt Disney's Studio.All in all, we are enjoying this DVD and would recommend it to others that have waited for the return of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs to share with their families."},{"rating":"2","title":"Snow White DVD","review":"I received this DVD fast and it was in great shape, just like it said.

It's pretty sharp and up to the Disney Blu-Ray standards. It makes a great movie all the more great. Not only is the picture improved, but so is the sound, and so is the regular DVD.....so you get a lot of bang for your buck here.The story is \\"cute\\" because of the seven dwarfs.

Tried to put it in a few weeks ago, which is now about 10 months later and we all sat through it. I forgot how cute of a movie this was. My kids are really into all the different animals now and they kept saying look at all the animals and the princess. I think the classics are just as popular now as they were back when we were children, we just have to introduce them to our children and they will actually watch them and enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great gift...for someone that collect's such things!","review":"It is a good purchase. Cute plush toys of all the dwarfs and includes the DVD/Blu-ray combo. I was really only disappointed that the discs came in a DVD casing rather than the smaller Blu-ray disc casing.

Definately can see the restoration results. I'm not sure however why there are two discs. All the same bonus features that are on disc 1 are also on disc 2. Maybe there are things for the kids that I didn't explore further... Either way, of course this is an amazing movie, especially considering when it was made. I just wasn't impressed with anything besides the movie itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little scary","review":"I thought that my three year old granddaughter would love this movie because she is so into all of the Disney Princess thing.

Such a take!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Purchase","review":"The movie is great - although I do think - only MY opinion - the tape was duped - but irregardless we wanted it for the children to watch - not to keep as a future \\"investment\\" or anything else. We bought it strictly for entertainment purposes. I say I think it was duped because every 10 minutes or so a video recorder icon comes up on the right hand screen and the inside of the video - where the DVD's are - is not at all like the other Disney Videos we have bought directly from the store. Would I buy from the seller again - yes I would because as I said - we buy them strictly for entertainment.

Kenny Dorham, one of the American innovators of afro-cuban jazz, really comes through with some great cuts on this album. Backed by fantastic sidemen like the masterful J.J. Johnson on trombone, the first half of the album really grooves. Unfortunately, the \\"b-side\\" of the album is generally uninteresting, moderate mainstream jazz. While the first half is laden with latin rythms and interesting and complex horn harmonies, the second half of the album basically moves on autopilot. All in all though, this is a very cool album that is a must have for any Kenny Dorham fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Durable!","review":"Bought this as a present for my father-in-law.

While the movie is highly entertaining and well acted please keep in mind it is a movie. Some facts are to be found but much license has been taken with the facts for story sake. For one Hendrickje Stoffels, engaged as his housekeeper about 1649 some 7 years after the death of his wife. I.E. they never met and there for Rembrandt could not have been tried for adultry, another error. Those are only two, but as I said IT'S A MOVIE not a history lesson. The DVD shows the age of the movie, some effort has been made to improve inage quality and sound but there still are a few hard cuts and signs of it's age. Well worth watching if you like art or you're just an old movie junkie. I would give it 5 stars but I'm taking one due to the historical errors and no extras on the DVD other than trailers."},{"rating":"2","title":"rembrandt","review":"very quick delivery of an old favorite of mine in vhs along with the closed caption of which i need to watch my movies. great condition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laughton great by any name","review":"An excellent performance by Laughton/lanchester on the life and times of Rembrandt.

I generally listen to stuff a little lighter than ATG, like In Flames, Dark Tranquillity, Children of Bodom, Arch Enemy, Amorphis, but Slaughter of the Soul is just better than any other cd I've ever heard. Other landmark SDM albums of 95- The Jester Race, The Gallery and Storm of the Light's Bane (what did Hypocrisy put out that year...). All of which are fantastic, SotS beats them all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly overrated...more like 2.5 stars.","review":"After they peaked with \\"Terminal Spirit Disease\\", ATG decided to strip down their sound. This is their most popular release because it is their most melodic and accessible. Gone are the progressive compositions and what is left are recycled riffs put into a quasi-thrash metal form. It sort of sucks that their last album sounds like a rushed attempt to get more fans and, in the process, sacrificing their originality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Charlatanism","review":"This is a ripoff. Progressive death metal band At the Gates replaced the creativity at the core of their music with predictable rock n roll harmony, stitched it into speed metal and shoved it back into the remains of their sound.

The reason they broke up is that they felt that they could never create a better album than Slaughter of The Soul. If you hear it, you will understand the reasoning behind their decision. If you like it hard and you like it fast, this album is for you. And if you like guitar harmonies and ripping meldoic riffs, this is the best example of it you will ever find. As a musician who owns over 350 albums, I can honestly say that this is one of my very favorites. If you don't have it, order it now, right now.

You must know that this album was released two years Before Soilwork's: Steelbath Suicide and CoB's: Something Wild. ATG paved the way for bands like Soilwork, and continue to have an impact on extreme metal more than 10 years they disbanded."},{"rating":"2","title":"great melodic blackened death metal","review":"In '95 this type of music in the metal scene was fairly rare so that alone ought to give this album 5 stars. It's fast, it's aggressive, it's melodic and the vocals are more of a shriek then a death metal growl which already wins points for some. It's sort of like Dissection but with better production and a little more thrash to it then black metal. If you like old \\"In Flames\\" or even mid 90's \\"Opeth\\" you'd probably like this, just don't expect long drawn out acoustic melodies or clear vocals because this is straight up metal through and through.

Even though many other swedish bands released great albums during this time (1 example- inflames- \\"whoracle\\") slaughter of the soul was the epitome of catchy riffs and metal brutality blended into one. No wonder so many bands play off them as much as they do. If you like metalcore get this and know where your favorite bands got the ideas for their riffs.PS- \\"franky\\", i find it interesting that you only review death metal albums and come nowhere close to albums by the bands you so adamantly praise.

Easy to-listen-to melodic riffage, occasional solos, and acoustic breakdowns keep the album interesting. The lyrics are also understandable; as far as the lyrical content goes, you can't really look for much here, but if you're looking for deep messages in death metal you should probably rethink your music taste.This should be the first (and if you're like me, only) album that you should purchase by At The Gates. It's a very far cry from their previous albums, which I found had a rather annoying vocal style, and whiny, poorly recorded solos.If you like In Flames, The Black Dahlia Murder, or Dark Tranquility, then you have probably listened to this album already. If you haven't, you've been missing out. Anybody who enjoys afformentioned groups, or is a general fan of death metal/melodic death metal should look into buying this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmmm...","review":"Hmmm...I don't think much of this.

If anything, this book shows that the revisionist history books which have branded Tsar Nicholas as a \\"tyrant\\" and \\"evil man\\" are wrong--dead wrong.

The problem was that the disc was scratched and pitted to the point where at about halfway through the film my DVD/Blu-Ray player just refused to play on. And it wasn't as though I'd played the DVD several times, and the disc had gotten scratched and pitted as a result of carelessness in use and/or storage.

Watching this movie, it becomes evident just how great Hitchcock is, even 60 years after being made, it still is more entertaining and thoughtful than most other movies.

Nazi oppression and Jewish victimization has been immortalized in such movies like this and Schindler's List that few facts even remain in some people's minds. Instead people get their history from half fact and half Hollywood fairytale from movies like this. It has led to an obsession of sorts with germans and hitlet and german jews and the holocaust . . . read a book sold on here called the Holocaust Industry. . . this movie is definitely explained in that book.

Would recommend to others!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential Hitchcock","review":"Apart from being one of Alfred Hitchcock's genuine masterworks, \\"Notorious\\" (1946) represents Cary Grant's strongest dramatic performance. His portrayal of counterspy Devlin remains so emotionally cold and dark that it leaves no room for his traditional humor. Ben Hecht's detailed screenplay depicts Hitchcock's cruelest romance. Devlin emerges as an unsympathetic sadist who seduces and manipulates Alicia (Ingrid Bergman), an alcoholic nymphomaniac, into helping the U.S. Government obtain secrets by marrying the Nazi spy Sebastian (Claude Rains), who actually loves her more than Devlin does. With the inspired casting of Bergman and Rains, the love triangle in \\"Notorious\\" is similar to \\"Casablanca.\\" However, there is no stirring display of patriotism or sentimentality. Furthermore, Hitchcock was the only filmmaker to strip Grant of his protective charm - and never again would the actor venture into such uncertain, disturbing territory."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good","review":"Notorious is both a love story and a thriller: the story of Alicia Huberman (Ingrid Bergman), a woman of a \\"certain reputation\\" and daughter of a convicted Nazi traitor, who's recruited by T.R. Devlin (Cary Grant) to serve as a spy in Brazil. Despite the strong feelings that arise between Huberman and Devlin (and what a gorgeous couple Bergman and Grant make), she gets more and more involved with the man she's supposed to spy--a relationship that threatens not only Alicia's relationship with Devlin, but also her life. The end is suspenseful, and the film is set in a very believable (although fake) Rio de Janeiro."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easy to read but not enough fine print","review":"This book was too much of an overview for me.

Saying that, There really was no need for this concert to be released [A real live one and A real dead one were released very shortly before this one!]. Bruce Dickinson was on his way out of the band when this concert took place which can probably explain why he sounds so laughably bad at times on this cd. As always, The band plays its music well, But, No matter how good the music sounds on this cd, It's almost always marred by Dickinson's surprisingly weak vocals. A few songs [''The number of the beast'', ''Bring your daughter to the slaughter'', and ''Be quick or be dead''] work out pretty decent, But to put it clearly, Bruce Dickinson ruined this concert with what is arguably his worst performance ever recorded. This cd is much too overpriced and is not even worth the $20-$25 it takes to get this cd.

Shame on SanDisk for not doing their homework and shame on Palm for letting SanDisk use their trademark without verifying that the product actually is \\"Designed for Palm Handhelds\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works with the Casio EX-M1 -- with a catch","review":"I bought the SanDisk 128MB SD card for use with my new Casio EX-M1 digital camera. Popped it in and immediately ran into problems -- the camera wouldn't recognize that the card was empty after formatting.A quick call to Casio customer support solved the problem. The camera ships with the 1.00 firmware. In order to work with SanDisk's 128MB card, the 1.01 firmware is needed. After downloading the updated firmware, the card worked immediately.I'm now quite pleased with the card's performance. It works as advertised and the expansion from the camera's built-in 12 MB to 128 MB is quite dramatic. I can now store about 160 fine resolution pictures at full-size. What more can you ask of a memory card?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Would be great if it worked","review":"I started using these cards a few months ago. Bought two of them. They were a lot cheaper than those from Lexar, Simple, etc. However, you get what you pay for.I first found out how bad these cards are when I bought a Sharp Zaurus. Apparently Sandisk does something funky in the hardware on these cards that keeps them from behaving like everyone else's cards. Whatever they have done keeps it from working on the Zaurus.While looking through some other products here , I am now seeing that they are not working on things such as the Toshiba e740 (which I also own). The card seemed to work on mine, but only half way. I had been attributing problems to the PC2002 OS on it. Turns out I was a bit mistaken.So, if you can get this card to work in your device, good luck to you. If you can't, get rid of the card and buy something from another manufacturer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, cheap memory for your camera or PDA","review":"I use one of these memory modules in my Toshiba E740, and it works flawlessly. Sandisk memory is also usually cheaper than many of the other brands, which makes it a excellent value."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great!","review":"I am using this memory card for my Panasonic digital camera. So far, it's working fine for me. Good price compared to other brands."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Year and then...","review":"I bought the 128MB Sandisk SD card for use with my Concord Eye-Q camera. It works great. I dropped it in, and the camera immediately recognized it, transferred two pix to it that were in internal memory, and told me that I have 171 pix remaining.I was in Myanmar (Burma) in September and October taking pictures. Suddenly, ie. without warning, the SD card began refusing access and could not even be reformatted. I understand it has a five year warranty, so I will be checking it out and will update this review after doing so.Of course the price of SD memory is falling so fast, it turned out to be cheaper just to replace the card."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works FINE with Toshiba PDR 330 digital cameras","review":"The other two reviewers with a Toshiba PDR-3300 camera are having problems. I wonder if they took the time to visit the Toshiba website. There you can download and install a firmware upgrade to the camera that takes it from 1.02 to 1.04. This update fixes problems with the large capacity Sandisk cards. I could take 8 pictures with the included 8 meg memory card. With this 128 meg card I can take over 150 at full size. The transfer rate is incredible. I see no reason to go with a more expensive brand. Recommended for this camera after the upgrade."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can only use 20 meg of storage on my Audiovox Maestro ppc","review":"Can only store about 20 meg then it will claim that storage is full.

I tried calling Euro Pro and they keep me on hold for 10 minutes and hang up on me. The website is non-existent and I have tried every vaccuum cleaner store (including online).

When I bought the vacuum it was on sale (first red flag) at Best Buy. Going back to get replacement bags, they still had the item on their computer but no one knew nothin' about no replacement bags. The search, which continued through many stores and myriad websites led me to conclude I was sunk. Then my partner checked Amazon for their reviews and my fears were solidified, it was a dead end and I was left, pardon the pun, holding the bag. I implore Amazon not to sell these anymore, but it's still here. Oh well, we tried!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good vacuum at all","review":"This vacuum has only a few good things going for it. It has good suction (but only the nozzle, not with the head attached), it has retractable cord button, and is very portable. The bad parts are that it has very poor suction with the attachments, the attachment (singular, since it only came with the head) is horrible for carpet and either sucks the carpet and gets stuck or does not pick anything up at all. This vacuum is only good for vacuuming corners and small spaces with the hose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Badly outdated","review":"Normally, I am a faithful LP travel guide user, the books have always been helpul for trips I have taken in the past. On a 3 week trip through Germany in May-June 2006, I used the Germany LP and was unpleasantly suprised time after time at the outdated or just plain incorrect information in the book. Not little things like prices, which always go up, but major problems like listings for buses to the airport in Berlin, that I discovered after much searching, had been discontinued two years ago. This type of thing happened repeatedly. At the end of the trip I actually felt cheated and as if I had wasted my money, and worse, valuable time depending on information provided in this purchase. The only thing it ended up being good for was finding hotel listigs to make reservations with during the planning stages. I don't have another guide to suggest instead, but leaving basic transportation info outdated for so long is just negligent. I'm going to to try Rough Guide next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective","review":"On first use would not hold air. Brought it on vacation and could not use.

Recommended to any rock fan, this cd rocks from start to finish with awesome live tracks. I feel that Ozzy's best solo moments and songs were during the Randy Rhoads era and unfortunately it was way too brief."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest live CD ever","review":"I think this is one of the greatest live CDs ever recorded. Unlike some of Ozzy's later live albums, his voice still sounds freash. This is the only live CD I am aware of that has the late, the great, Randy Rhoads on it. His improvements on the Blizzered of Ozz songs and the Diary of a Madman songs are brillient. The Black Sabbath covers show that Randy Rhoads can reproduce, and greatly improve Tony Iommi's songs. This CD holds the best recordings of, Paraniod, Crazy Train, I Don't Know, Sucide Sulotion, Dee, and Mr. Crowly. This was my first Ozzy CD, and I feel that it was a great place to start."},{"rating":"2","title":"Guitar Legend doing what he does best","review":"Randy Rhoads is totally amazing on this album. Any music fan will enjoy this album, it shows this man's true talent. The Mr. Crowley solos are totally amazing, just hear how smoothly he plays these solos. The Tribute live version of all these songs are a lot better than the studio version. A piece of musical history and a must buy for any music fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Randy Roads is the worst guitarist ever!","review":"My friend David told me to check out this album for some tr00 guitar playing. I found the tape in a junkshop for 50 cents so I bought it without hesitation. Wow, was this bad or what! Total disappointment. The guitar playing was just the same boring shredding and overly-long solos again and again for an hour. Weak. Check out \\"St. Anger\\", \\"All The Right Reasons\\", \\"Metal Machine Music\\" or \\"American Idiot\\" for some facemelting solos from true fretboard masters!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Deliberate Rip-off","review":"I just bought the Ozzie Osbourne/Randy Rhoades CD and what a deliberate rip-off. Naturally I was expecting \\"Crazy Train\\" and \\"Flying High Again\\" studio version. But no! Instead they pass off this poorly recorded live stuff as a \\"Tribute\\" to Randy Rhoades! And they can't say it wasn't deliberate either. Nowhere on the cover does the work \\"Live\\" appear, nor are the times for the songs listed. I mean that way the customer might notice that where the time for the original was say 4:31 and the time on this CD was 7:02, and realize something was fishy. I did notice the words \\"Reissue\\" and \\"Remastering from original masters.\\" So to say this was not a deliberate attempt to deceive the buyer is, I feel, being disingenuous."},{"rating":"2","title":"Randy Rhoads Tribute","review":"Had it once before, loved it, broke it, had to replace it. Fantastic CD, great price, excellent service. Very pleased with purchase. When something happens to this one, I will purchase another one. One of my favorite CD's ever........."},{"rating":"2","title":"RRR","review":"Randy Rhoads. Not his best performance, and this is not the best sound quality (Ozzy cleaned up the vox a bit), but a definite must-have for any RR fan. The unaccompanied solo on Suicide Solution is worth the price of the disc.Having said that, the sound quality on The King Biscuit Flour Hour was more true to the live sound, and captured RR on a better night, and I believe was recorded closer to March 19th 1982. I wish I had that cassette now that I taped off the radio back in 1982...Anyway, no one will ever sound like this again. All of Ozzy's guitarists since then DO NOT COMPARE. Hats off to Jake, Zakk for trying. Ozzy's writing since then does not compare. RR's was a special style and sound that cannot be imitated. My number one reason for picking up guitar."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiational","review":"I purchased this book for my brother who has been battling Hodgkins Disease for the past five years.

What's often said of Byas, that at certain (faster) tempi his playing collapses, is simply untrue of this recording. True, most of the selections in this album are medium grooves, but the occasional faster gait doesn't leave Byas gasping for breath. And his sound! Chocolate. A chocolate tenor saxophone.At first, the Coleman Hawkins' influence is almost overbearing. But, with continued listening, Byas' own idiosyncrasies surface; some of his long tones and subtle adjustments of sound mark him as different from Hawk and also reveal, to this listener's ears, the reason Sonny Rollins always listed Byas as one of his favorites.Five stars for the music, four for the album (cd) because it's so darned short. But worth the outrageous price, what with original cover art and fine remastering. Cheers."},{"rating":"2","title":"compellingly surprising","review":"This book was a surprise,just when you think you know the plot it changes.The character of Dana reminded me of many women I've known.

The microwave interferes with voice quality very badly. Voice often has echo on other end of call. It loses contact with the base frequently at very short ranges (within my house). It registers a lot of erroneous entries in the caller id call log. Especially when you allow a call waiting to ring thru. The answering machine is cumbersome to review and delete messages.

Not everyone can move poetry in one language into another. This is true of the Iliad, certainly true the the myriad mistranslations of the Bible.

The Iliad and the Bible have suffered greatly at the hands of hacks and those who intentionally want to 'improve' the text. Please include the translator when presenting classic works.

A bloodbath at Troy and yet we see after each battle the men, their lives and their losses.The most surprising thing I learned was the involvement the gods of Olympia played in the story!It was a most fascinating read and I recommend it highly for those who want a window into the ancient world of gods, monsters, war and heroes."},{"rating":"2","title":"As expected.","review":"It is a bit more flimsy than I was hoping it will be.

I'm 6'5 and still cannot get the top over the heater. It's so snug, and the zipper doesn't go all the way up, so it tears on the wingnuts on top of the heater.If you are using the hearter, it's probably cold outside.

After taking it appear and replacing a series I parts (an additional 25% of the original price),the product now works. There was no response from the vendor when emailed my Amazon.

Even though we tied the center area - the wind still worked right through the material and caused both of our units to crash to the ground ....damaging both unit tops horribly. We immediately took off both covers. (Plan on having 2 people there to take on & off as they are very difficult and awkward to work with). Needless to say I'm disappointed to return both covers at an 80% return, pay the return shipping, AND have to deal with dented patio covers to boot. So bummed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good cover","review":"Other reviewers complain about how hard it is to put this cover on and off. I agree, but I don't think it's the cover manufacturer's fault.

I do not recommend this cover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Duralast Cover (Black) Does Not Fit Fire Sense Heaters","review":"This review is specific to the \\"Duralast Cover (Black)\\" option available for purchase. I purchased this cover thnking it was actually a better version of the \\"black\\" cover since it's MSRP was $10 higher. It turns out, the Duralast cover is just a cheap, vinyl cover that looks more like a black tarp than a cover. It is not felt lined, nor will it fit Fire Sense Heaters. The cover top diameter is a bit too small to fit over the heater and even if it did, the cover does not reach the ground.Do Not Buy this option by mistake. I ordered the \\"black\\" cover and it fit my heater like a glove. The \\"Duralast Cover (Black)\\" is a waste of money!!! Fortunately, Amazon took it back with no issues.

It is definitely a two person job, but worth every dollar."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even worth looking at!!!","review":"Of all the great items that I've purchased through Amazon, this has to be the absolute worst!From a completely inept design to the poor quality of materials, this patio heater cover is a waste of your money.The top fails to accommodate the diameter of my heater cover (36\\"), making it extremely difficult to install. The top cap feature on my patio heater nearly pierced the cover (I needed to position a piece of rubber between the heater cap and the cover to prevent this).On the second use (the design is sooo poorly conceived), the thin vinyl material separated from the top of the zipper, rendering the cover too damaged to return.My only consolation is the fact that it didn't cost more than $30.Money totally wasted - but proving the adage \\"you get what you pay for\\"!Save yourself the aggravation - don't buy this product!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"durable","review":"This is a replacement for a cover we had used for 2 years.

This song definitely defines Polanco since it's about a woman who wastes a man's time about being in love with him. Not only that, but the \\"Mambo\\" is ridiculously phat.Overall, we have a new star in town!!

It all starts when Nicola Sparks, an orphan, goes to live with the Bartolomew's. SHe already has her heart set on Lord Sebastian Bartolomew, for whom she wants to marry. But Nathaniel Sheridan, her friend Eleanor's elder brother, warns her that Lord Sebastian is not all he seems. So Nicola does a little investigating. When her uncle, the Grouser (as Nicola and Eleanor call him), wants to run a train through her home, the abbey, and his son, The Milkstop (as Nicola and Eleanor call him) offers a proposal of marriage to Nicola. Then Nicola searches around Lord Sebastian's dad's desk and finds more papers about the railway. Will she marry Lord Sebastian, her idea of the GOD, and let the railway pass or follow her heart? Read the book to find out! I highly recommend it! If you love Meg Cabot or the Princess Diaries read the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A bad impersonation of Jane Austen -- but not without merit","review":"I would label this as a poor man's Jane Austen, or more accurately: an introduction to Ms. Austen's works for young women.The story is surprisingly captivating and the novel takes an unexpected more adventerous turn towards the end as Nicola unravels a dangerous plot for industrial progress.Ms. Cabot has already proved herself able to enthrall the hearts of young women all over the world with her bestselling Princess Diaries series and this Avon True Romance is no exception. It will introduce teens (and younger) to the language of the time and prepare them for more intense works by authors who wrote about the time period (see Charlotte Bronte, Ann Radcliffe, Fanny Burney, Emily Bronte, Ms. Oliphant, Maria Edgeworth, Anne Bronte, and Jane Austen).All in all, it was a fun read but the tacky cover art is an abomination to such an otherwise decent novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprise!","review":"This book surprised me because Meg Cabot generally writes more modern themed books. That is one of the reasons I got it, to see if Cabot wrote another excellent book. I was happy to see that she had! Nicola and the Viscount is about an orphan girl named Nicola who lives in the late 1800s. She is madly in love with a gentleman named Lord Sebastian Bartholomew. When she learns that Lord Sebastian isn't quite who she thought he was, she doesn't know what to do.This book was nicely written and the story was good, but it lacked excitement. Everything just happens to fit into place perfectly, when she is in danger there just happens to be somebody there to save her. Theres no feeling of, \\"OMG whats going to happen next!\\" like there is in most of Cabots books.Luckily, that is my only complaint! Another great book by Cabot!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Cabot's Best, but Not Bad Either","review":"Being a huge fan of Cabot's other books (The Princess Diaries, 1-800-Where-R-U, and the Mediator - both written under pseudonames), I was tempted to check this one out too. It isn't as great as her other books, because of it's setting (1810, London) it lacks Meg's funny, pointed sarcasm.Nicola Sparks is an orphan, but she thinks it's okay (because she never met her parents, she can't feel as bad about missing them, as she puts it). Her and her best friend Elenor both think Lord Sebastian \\"The God\\" is dashing, and Nicola gets to meet him during a stay at his familys house. Soon enough, Nicola and Sebastian are head over heels in love. But Nathaniel, Elenor's brother, feels that he's up to no good, and tells Nicola so. Even though she doesn't believe him, she checks things out for herself, and sure enough, he isn't who she thought he was.This book's good, but I recommend The Princess Diaries or When Lightning Strikes more than this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Standing the test of time","review":"This is with out doubt a wonderfull example of this work.The musical ideas and phraseing are great.If you want only one recording of this work this is the one , spoken from a horn player."},{"rating":"2","title":"My First Dennis' CD","review":"As Dennis' fan, every single CD he left for us worth a 5-stars! As compared with his recording on other media, e.g. cass.tape, I don't really like the \\"digitized\\" sound. I wish they could make CD that has the SAME sound recorded on tape. Till then, I will keep all Dennis' CD as my private collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Of course it's great- it's Dennis Brain!","review":"If I had to sum up Brain's playing on this cd with only a few choice words they would be clean, effortless, and musically rich. A non horn player listening to this disk could easily wonder how people complain about the horn being such a difficult instrument to play well. Dennis Brain truly pushes all of the difficulties of the horn aside and instead puts only wonderful musicality in its place. Brain was definitely a man in complete control of his instrument, and made it sing like no other. If you're thinking about taking up the horn after listening to this album, don't be fooled- it isn't as gloriously easy as this master virtuoso makes it sound!"},{"rating":"1","title":"You can get this same CD with more on it remastered for less","review":"Even though I am in love with this CD, I don't really understand why you'd buy it. The same CD was rereleased by EMI Classics but with an additional 3 tracks - Hindemith's Konzertmusik for Brass and Strings. Also, that CD is cheaper, so I would recommend taking that route."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heresy to say, but this mono-era classic has been surpassed","review":"Rather than saying that Dennis Brain was the greatest horn player of all time, I prfer to think that he began the age of superstar horn players. In their later recordings of Strauss's two virtuosic concertos, Barry Tuckwell and David Pyatt sound much more exciting than Brain, who also isn't helped by EMI's dated mono sound and the foursquare conducting of Sawallisch. Brain gives us a definitve reading of the Hindemith concerto, but this work hasn't exaclty caught on in the repertoire. I keep Brain's elegeant performances around as a Golden Age memento of a very appealing musician whose early death sealed his lasting reputation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uh, boooring.","review":"I have 3 kids under 5.

I bought this album a while ago and it has some really good songs. I don't understand much that she's singing, but I like the melodies and she has a great voice.The album starts with the song \\"Un giorno disumano\\", a very good song, which is followed by a number of egually good songs. Track number six, \\"Peccato Originale\\" is a nice, slow song, followed by the faster \\"Ti spezzo il cuore\\". Number nine, \\"Dimmi dimmelo\\" and eleven, \\"Sola\\" are not quite as good as the other songs, but they are absolutely not bad. There are actually no bad songs on this album.This is indeed a very good album. It has a great singer, great songs with a great sound.

Hemingway was already a popular novelist. Helen Hayes makes Gary Cooper a star in this movie. Adolph Menjou as the friend who misunderstands their love is very good as well. The first world war as seen from the eyes of lovers, becomes a new more romantic war where the horrors of bombs and poison gas and tanks take the back burner. Tragedy in it's most classic of forms..young lovers."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 star out of 4","review":"The Bottom Line:This terrible adaptation of Hemingway's novel misses the point entirely (***spoiler*** it literally ends with Gary Cooper holding Helen Hayes in his arms and intoning \\"Peace!

If you have read the book, don't waste your time watching the movie. The movie (in its 90 min format) is very one dimensional, concentrating only on the romance between Catherine and Frederick. The ending is even different which is unacceptable. Take my advice and read the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"This movie although well ascted in absolutely no way compares to the book. Personaley I fell that in making the book into a movie way to much liberty was taken concerning the plot and storyline."},{"rating":"2","title":"3-star film, 4-star package","review":"My only criticism of the movie is that it's an oversentimental, star-driven adaptation of the novel. Hemingway's muscular prose was obviously compromised to create a more box-office-friendly Hollywood war romance, which in my book puts \\"Farewell\\" in the \\"potboiler\\" category, but not lethally so. That said, I think Image's transfer, while flawed (as most 70-plus-year-old films are), is more than acceptable, allowing us to appreciate Charles Lang's impressive, Oscar-winning cinematography with few limitations. It's also worth mentioning that Image's version restores some lost footage--several minutes' worth, I believe. So, all in all, not the greatest film of the 1930s, to be sure, but the DVD is well worth the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware the Hollywood Classics version","review":"The Hollywood Classics version of this DVD is very poorly done. Look at the cover! They put \\"Cary Grant\\" as an actor on the bottom left! They seem to have put even less effort into making the video and sound quality acceptable. They include a sheet stuck into the DVD case explaining how to make the sound quality tolerable, but it didn't help me much. The video is very poor as well. Get a different version if you must, but not the Hollywood Classics version at any price. It is unwatchable."},{"rating":"1","title":"No, No, No.","review":"This is a VERY poor dvd. I planned on using it for a class and was totally disappointed. The sound does not sync with the picture and the image is poorly digitized.

I have not seen any other editions, but this one was terrible, not only in picture as is most often the case with many old movies, but the sound was also appalling. I cannot even give a decent review of the movie, as the conversation was not audible most of the time (cackling) and there were way too many dust grains and scratches, making the process of 'enjoying' this film very strenuous.I suggest patience, hoping for better negatives/blueprints to be found (if available) that will merit the movie some justice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grey De Lisle - a diamond in the rough.","review":"If you are looking for a true country sound, this is it.

But that only adds to the fun of it. I not only love good music, which Ms. De Lisle more than provides, but I am also a cartoon buff.

It's pure emotion. I would recommend it for anyone looking to hear something other than the overly polished fare that NWSDM has become.This is pure underground/cult stuff!The reason I won't give it 5 stars, however, is because I need an album to be absolutely masterful (i.e. perfect) to be as such.I was a little dissappointed that my copy did not come with lyrics, althoguh the rest of the booklet looks great.Perhaps the CD version comes with lyrics though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute, funny, magical read.","review":"I have to start by saying I LOVED this book.

Suffice to say, stay away from this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Embarrasing to watch.","review":"I have to disagree with the reviews above and say that I watched this movie on dvd having watched it as a kid twenty years ago. Unfortunately I couldn't find anything about this film I remember enjoying. It's a cross between The Blob, The Thing and a really crap detective movie. Moriarty's character is pretty smooth but the film culminates in a farce reminicent of an 80's kiddy movie. This film is definetly not for intelligent adults and you'll lose interest halfway through I guarantee it. No suspense, few laughs, and way to hokey to watch twice. If you love this movie you need to get out more."},{"rating":"1","title":"A B-movie with a little more substance","review":"Michael Moriarity is my hero! He is just one of the coolest actors in my opinion. He has done such great B-movies as this, Q, and It's Alive 3: Island of the Alive. How awesome is he?? Anyways, I think that this movie was hilarious! I think a lot of people take this movie too seriously, thinking that it is going to be your typical movie. But you shouldn't because not only is this a B-movie, but IT IS supposed to be funny. My favorite part is when \\"the stuff\\" started bubbeling out of the ground and that old hick guy just starts eating it. Who would do that?? I just started laughing by butt off when that happened. So if you watch this movie, just sit back and enjoy it for what it's worth, don't be too critical on it.What I learned from The Stuff: Dairy products are evil!

It looks allover as if it were made quickly and on the cheap.The good reviews come from folk who, IMO, are using their own power of imagination to fill in the cracks in the storyline and acting.

Outside of that, Vorpsi's habits of unfocused lenses and lighting so dim as to leave little for the camera really do nothing for me.

This is sort of the appex of what was started with 'First Circle' and then somewhat brought to fruition with 'Still Life (talking).' This is just wonderful from begining to end. 'Have You Heard' has become the opening theme for all of Pat's live work with the group. It replaced 'Phase Dance' which was the Metheny staple for years. Highlights on the cd include Have You Heard, Spring Ain't Here, 5-5-7, Beat 70, Slip Away and, Letter From Home. Everyone gives their best performance and Pedro Aznar is fantastic.

Pat and Lyle's collaboration on Have You Heard sets the pace for an up tempo exploration of alternate blues mixed with just enough fusion to keep it honest.

I don't know how it got out of the studio with that mix - it's muddy and the background singers and band sound as veiled and muted as though I were hearing them through a closed door. The first time I played it I felt the disc had to be defectve - I cleaned and replayed it all the way through and came to the conclusion it was just a lousy production.

It just doesn't do it for me. All the elements are up to date, but the story, cuts, and flow are not much to hold you. As a Heavy Metal Fan it is worth while to see. I would not recomend it to anyone otherwise. It is just a little less interesting than episodic Animé"},{"rating":"1","title":"A vain attempt.","review":"Like my title suggests this movie is a vain attempt to take credit from the first movie to sell sub-par music to a new generation of viewers. The first Heavy Metal obviously had some thought put into the scenes and the pace of the story line. The artistry was phenomanal in the first movie, much better than the mish mosh of computer graphics and hand drawn animation in Heavy Metal 2000. The first movie made sure the music reinforced and enhanced whatever scene was being played, the second, well the music really did not add much if anything at all the movie. To sum up...boring plot, no imagination, and a sound track to not die for. My advice? Use the DVD as a coaster and read a good Frank Herbert novel instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"the animation is good but the music....","review":"todays metal almost has no listenership, why? it has so little melody, gone in this movie are good melodic metal songs from 80's bands who could sing, instead we get the awful thrash metal that helped make metal one of the least popular types of music on the planet. sure people like the old stuff but todays metal is sucko mostly so by using that type of thrash junk in this they insured few could sit through the movie. I liked the story but you had to suffer through the music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable","review":"I remember that the original was a bunch of loosely connected stories. This one tells one tale, not too badly, but also too interested in including specific elements that had to be part of the movie's image more than letting the story flow. Of these \\"required\\" elements, it of course had to be science fiction, there had to be a lot of violence, plus completely gratuitous nudity featuring totally buff women with improbable breasts. I like that a lot of effort was made to tell a whole story, but it looks like a bunch of producers got together, figured out the lowest common denominator for their audience, and dished out standard movie fare for them, cafeteria-style. With the same resources, they could have taken the \\"Final Fantasy\\" route, at least plot-wise, but chose the easy road."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very special.","review":"This film is better than the original Heavy Metal, which is not saying much. The animation is far superior, the story admittedly stronger. However, many of the characters, including the heroie, are absolutely mean. Julie is a strong character, yes. But does strong necessarily mean hard? Her sister is much more likable. I hope Julie Strain is nothing like her character. Also, there is too much gore.

Such is the case with this movie, which is complete garbage. The animation is a slight improvement over the original, but most of the time, it is just goofy to look at(the \\"surprise\\" villan in the final scene for example). This is nothing more than a gory, porno movie with all of the necessary ingredients that make porno movies: lame characters, absurd action scenes, and a ridiculous \\"plot.\\" And i've heard better music in some video games than in this movie.

I was and still am a great fan of the first film. HM2K is a big disappointment for me. Instead of offering some of today's best sci-fi writers an opportunity to contribute a compilation of short stories for the new film, the film makers went with a poorly developed feature length tale that is as predictable and boring as a merry-go-round at the county fare. Despite the aid of modern computers the animation lacks in style and detail as compared with the original film. Even the music is poor this time around! The first film was a successful attempt to translate the style of the magazine to the big screen.

It's not science fiction, it's stupid fiction. The best thing about Heavy Metal 2000 is the over-the-top cover art on the DVD.Here's the plot: guy finds green rock and becomes cartoonishly evil, kills a world where a buxom chick lives, chick teams up with an annoying sidekick, final showdown at a temple, some demon guy who we don't even know betrays the chick, the chick beats the bad guy and the demon 'plot twist' insertion.Michael Ironside does the 1-dimensional evil guy for his paycheck, Julie Strain can't act period, and the rest are nobodys in nobody roles.

The key to this album is to approach it with a sense of humour; there is a degree of appropriate respect shown to the Bach material, but once you realise that the superficially \\"hokey\\" treatment given to the Jesu Joy of Man's Desiring theme on \\"Precious Joy\\" is a colossal musical joke rather than a serious attempt, it really does give you an understanding of the reality behind the rather straight-laced image of the MJQ"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous Album!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I have to up-date my review!

If you're looking for like swinging jazz with a lot of blues influence, and melow classical melodies with a little jazz feel and tingy percussion instruments, then you'll love this album, just like I do.

I began to fill the organizer with diapers, and other light changing supplies and the changer kept sagging lower and lower. The \\"shelves\\" are a great idea but all of them slump forward.

When I put it together, the base for the wipes area was loose in the box and I had a very difficult time putting it in. Also, once it was hung, and still empty, it did not look anything like the picture. All the pockets (especially the wipes pocket) were sagging to the front. I loaded the diaper stacker area thinking that the weight might straighten it out, but it did not. I put in the wipes warmer on top and it sagged even more forward. It was very dangerous as I bumped it walking past it and everything else I had put in the pockets fell out... including the wipes warmer. :-(I didn't buy it from Amazon.com, but don't waste your money here or at any other store on this.

We were thinking maybe it was missing cardboard in the walls, nope, all there, just a sad sad little piece of crap organizer.

I should have read the reviews first. Simply have no idea and would be so curious to know how a company could create something like this and sell it - if they simply made a prototype and tried to put a box of wipes in the top part they would immediately see it doesn't hold it!?...

Zero stars!","review":"I purchased this diaper organizer to hang on my Delta Luv changing table, because there was no storage space on top. I had high hopes for it--Munchkin products are usually high in quality. However, the cloth on this organizer sags. When I tried to fill it with my wipes box, baby powder, and lotion--as shown in the picture--the pockets tipped forward and everything fell out. I wouldn't want a toddler getting near this organizer! A much safer option is the plastic \\"Diaper Depot\\" by Prince Lionheart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible quality","review":"This product is a great idea in theory, and it was just what I needed. But the construction is very very poor. The shelves don't stay horizontal once you start putting items.

Unless you have a changing station (or crib, wherever you want to hang it) that has slits or slots able to hold it - the velcro will NOT hold it well. And the \\"shelves\\" are a bit insecure. It's a great idea, but just didn't pan out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I don't know why any company would want to put their name on this product. It is so flimsy and saggy and if I could give it zero stars I would - this piece of junk was immediately returned to the store. I bought it to hang on the side of our pack n play since we use it a lot for diaper changes and I wanted more storage space for things like qtips, thermometer, cloth diaper supplies, etc. It held diapers ok but if you put wipes on top as shown in the pic, the whole thing sags and the wipe container falls out easily. The side pockets also do not hold up. So you are better off just getting a diaper stacker since thats about all it is good for. I attached it to the pack n play with the adhesive velcro that was included in the box. The adhesive held up better than the velcro did...it un-velcroed (for lack of better term) within 5 minutes of me hanging it up and putting stuff in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasn't for me","review":"I tried every which way to mount this organizer. I tried the loops, the velcro, and the straps. No matter what I tried, the organizer didn't keep its shape. The wipe container was normal size, but the whole thing sagged from the weight, and the shelves just kept slanting so stuff fell out. The only thing that stayed in were the diapers, but I was hoping to fit a little of everything in it. I finally gave up and got a dresser top organizer which was much easier for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"High hopes, low outcome","review":"I saw this product at the store and thought it was an awesome solution for saving space. It was the last one on the shelf, and I walked out of there feeling so lucky to have bought it. I love finding ways to organize anything and so I couldn't wait to get home and try it out. Munchkin, you disappoint me! It's a great concept, but awful in execution. The whole thing tips forward, the diapers don't stack well, the fabric started to fray, and I hadn't even used the thing yet. I thought mounting it to the wall would be a good solution for the tipping issue, but it didn't help, and it's quite the eyesore. I am not exaggerating when I say this is the worst product I've bought for my baby so far. In short, don't waste your money or time on this product, it doesn't even deserve one star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flimsy...doesn't hold up well...Picture is misleading!","review":"I purchased this organizer since it was the same one my sister used and I didn't know of any others. I liked how it looked in the picture, sitting up straight against the changing table holding all the diaper changing needs. However, that picture is very misleading. This organizer sags and leans forward to the point that if you even put half a package of diapers in it the diapers start falling out, if you push down too hard while closing the wipes container the velcro gives out and it falls to the floor...if its that easy to make it come loose I imagine that it will fall the first time my daughter pulls on it. I eventually tied mine with ribbon to help hold it up but it still sags so bad that I'm now shopping for something more sturdy. This was a total waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flinsy... can't fill all of the compartments because it will FALL DOWN!","review":"Just as the title states... with a package of diapers in the diaper stacker and a few baby washes, the velcro on this item comes apart and the item falls down. Useless, in my opinion, to organize anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"zero stars","review":"This is a horrible product and the picture should be pulled for false advertising. When you set it up the whole thing sags. The baby wipe containers will not stay in the top pocket 1)because of the sagging and 2)because the pocket is so huge. The pockets on the side of the diaper wipes are virtually useless because of the sag. If the bottom is more than half way filled with disposable diapers the organizer gets so heavy. If you dont have bars on your changing table you need to use the provided stick on velcro straps, but if the organizer gets too heavy it will pull on the glue and come off. In the end I found myself with a half full organizer resting on the ground (because the straps pulled off), wipes on the changing table (because it wouldnt stay in the organizer) and a long line of sticky glue on my changing table because the organizer pulled off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"Like most of the reviews, the shelves tilt and the products I keep on it keep sliding off.

It was all down hill from there.He jokes about President Bush, and for as much as I can't stand Bush, hasn't it been overdone by now (or politics in general for that matter)? And then there's the baby jokes, which even though cliche', are usually still a bit funny.

However, this performace will be burned forever into my mind as a comedy atrocity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Comedy Central, listen up","review":"Patton Oswalt is funny and my two stars is not because of his performance. It's because of Comedy Central mangling the DVD version.The show was originally broadcast on Comedy Central, and as such it was cut down to about 40 minutes so it could fill a one-hour time slot with commercials.The DVD has the original show, and then in the bonus section, it has \\"deleted scenes,\\" which are the parts of the full-length concert that were cut for time.So, you can watch the time-edited show, or you can watch the out-of-context segments that were taken out. But what you can't do, and what I have to think any chimpanzee able to use sign language would know you would want to do, is see the original full-length show in its entirety.So, cheers for Patton, boos for CC.

I am in the other camp where I listen to it architecturally, i.e. the line, the phrasing, the implied counterpoint, &c., and let the emotions sink in later. In this sense this recording is not successful. You cannot doubt Perlman's technique and tone, but his very free take on phrasing and rhythm means the implied counterpoint is distorted and weakened, and the musical structure is obscured. Perlman's uniformly sweet and rich tone also means he does not distinguish among the independent voices of the implied counterpoint, and instead runs them together. The vibrato which he uses throughout also softens the musical phrasing as the articulations cannot be as sharp. The performances sounds very much like how the cadenzas of 19th century violin concertos are played, which does not happen to jive with my ideas of Bach."},{"rating":"1","title":"Credible performance, mediocre recording...","review":"A good performance but nothing to get excited about...really mediocre recording -- sounds as though it was either recorded in a large hallway or with a lot of added reverb...particularly annoying is Perlman's bow noise -- almost every stroke starts with an annoying \\"crunch\\"...better recording and performance from Szeyng."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perlman's Interp is truly divine!","review":"Wow!

It's relatively amusing, though the medicine show scenes tend to be far too long, killing any pace the movie might have built up.

It is no wonder that White is considered--by the worthy, literate critics, at least--the finest gay writer in America. I would modify that to say he is one of the finest writers (gay or otherwise) in the world today. This book cronicles the life of ABOS from shortly after that book leaves off through the Stonewall riots in New York in June of 1969. The narrator's growth is evident from the end of the last novel through the end of this one. This is one of the most important works by one of our most important writers; White is the nearest writer to Proust to write since, though minus the cork-lined apartment and with quite a few more social graces."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Satisfying Addition","review":"The Beautiful Room is Empty by Edmund White is a wonderful additon to the inspired A Boy's Own Story. It is not exactly a sequel but it does loosely form the middle in a semi-autobiographical trilogy (between A Boy's Own Story and A Farewll Symphony). All can be read and enjoyed on their own but also fit together smoothly to take the reader through different times in the life of a gay man. This volume takes the reader from the repressive fifties into the time of Stonewall as the main character grows from a young man in the midwestern college into a gay urbanite going to the gym. The growth of the narrator is more honest and well written than in many gay novels and will resonate with the reader with painful or humourous , at different times, recognition whether he grew up in that era or not. It is a fine novel that plays all the right notes."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointment","review":"i have seen this episode before and it is my favorite of the whole series so you can imagine my disappointment when i downloaded it and all it did was skip and stop every 5 to 10 seconds the entire episode. it was very irritating and made it impossible to follow the dialogue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Season Two: More and More Snores","review":"Even when they regularly borrow material from the Simpsons, the laughs are few and far between on South Park.

But, the second season DVD set is a step down, because the entire disc 3 has no introductions whatsoever. The episodes are great, but c'mon those intros were the real reason why people buy these right? Well, basically this season is a look into the world of the relationship between beastiality and literacy, and gay cowboys eating pudding.I love South Park and I can't wait for season 3, and 4, and 5, and 6, and 7, and so on and so forth."},{"rating":"2","title":"South Park Season 2 DVD","review":"The episodes are all great.

I always wondered why there was no commentary for the film then heard Matt and Trey were upset with Paramount and didn't do it out of spite.

David Pack is NOWEHERE to be found on this CD. In my personal opinion, David Pack WAS Ambrosia. While Joe Puerta's vocals sound fine, it might as well be Tony Bennett singing \\"Holdin' on\\". That song, \\"Biggest part\\", \\"You're the only woman\\", cry out for his distinctive voice. When did he divorce himself from the group? It's like the Beatles without John Lennon. If accuracy is not important, you'll love the CD. If you're looking for the sound of classic Ambrosia, you'd better stick with the Anthology album, or one of their others. My 2 cents."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should Have Been Kept a Secret","review":"I am being a bit too harsh with the title to my review, but I really did not enjoy this short (but it seems so, so long) story.

I would have been completely lost if it were not for the helpful introduction written by Albert Guerard. I read the introduction after reading the story, and it shed a lot of light on the book. Though I did not enjoy the book, I am impressed with the man behind the book- I cannot believe that English is his second language. He also has an impressive personal life history- it seems as if he has experienced everything he writes about, this adds value to his works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uninteresting and Dreadful","review":"I'm sorry, but this book is much too full of description and symbolism. If you juxtapose it to other short stories, I'm sure you will notice the negative difference. My advice is: Do not buy this book!! Find another one - you will enjoy it more!

I am a very intelligent critic of the performing arts and let me tell you, this is absolutely disgusting. If you put John Mayer and Dave Mathews band along with \\"Gabriel's Groove\\", i am sure you will see the exact similarity that makes this band not individualists but people trying to form a band out of something that has already been made.

Well guess what bud, if you keep pursuing this career, maybe he's right.The sound is almost Dave Mathew's Band-esque, only worse. Maybe if you seperate each instrument and played them as solos it would make sense, but the correlation and fit between them is... it isn't.I'm sorry that you spent whatever money you did developing the band and burning cds in your basement.

My mom sang the praises of her smaller shark, and I decided to purchase one. After a few minutes it overheats and is useless.

Amazingly enough, the SECOND one does the same thing. I called the Euro-Pro folks and they said the machine was overheating and the filter needed to be cleaned out. Well, folks, even after cleaning it out, washing it with clean water adn then letting it dry for 24 hours---- it STILL shut itself off. This machine is AWFUL! I will be returning this item.

However, this vacuum cleaner will shut itself off after only 10 minutes of use. To re-start it I have to turn off, un-plug, and wait 45 minutes to start it up again. I have spoken to others who have had this same problem and tried to send it to the company for repairs under the warranty. It would cost them more to ship it than the vacuum cost in the first place. It's a terrible product, so do not waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Waste Your Money","review":"Too bad they don't give you a negative star rating to choose from. This vaccum worked great for about the first month. After that it cuts off after vaccuming one room. I am about ready to throw in the lake! I would take it back to Foley's and tell them what a bad product they are selling but it has been too long. I kept fooling around washing the filters, letting them dry (which takes almost two days for them to dry!) and trying to vaccum again thinking it would get better, after all it wasn't a cheap cleaner. It does however pick up massive amounts of carpet deodrizer (you know that white powder you sprinkle on the floor)that my son's Oreck leaves behind. But after a couple of minutes it cuts off from being hot and filters clogged, so what good is that? I will just throw it in the dumpster because if I give it away, that person might become so frustrated they may throw it at me through my window!!

When it is working, it is wonderful. But that's the rub. It simply doesn't work very long. It has an emergency overheating shutoff. So you don't get to do too much vacuuming before it quits. My advice is to try something else. It is annoying feature and there is no way to judge how long it will work. This Shark bit me bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hunk o' junk","review":"This was the best thing since sliced bread for about 4 months. Then it entered a slow and steady decline.

I wish we had done better research."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Vacuum ever!!","review":"I have had this vacuum for a couple of years now, and it has been completely un-usable from the start. It shuts down after 1 or 2 rooms, and you have to wait a few hours. Cleaning it is a pain, as you have to take the cannister completely apart and dust is in everything. I will only purchase a bag type vacuum in the future, bagless is just not worth the hassle, and this Shark Pursuit is an extreemly poor design."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY Poor Suction - Especially if you Have Pets","review":"I purchased this vacuum after returning 2 Bissell Clean View II units where the beater bar locked up and melted. Although this vacuum has not had that problem, it is relatively WORTHLESS for basic vacuuming. I wonder if the folks at Euro-Pro even attempted to vacuum pet hair or anything else with it? You have to pass over something 3, 4 or 5 times to pick up visible debris - can you imagine what it is leaving behind deep in the carpet? The ONLY nice feature is the ability to turn off the beater bar when you are using the tool attachment, which I should add works like a tool attachment should. I have owned this vacuum for about 6 months, and plan on DONATING it to someone who doesn't have a vacuum, as this unit is better then not having one at all!

Buy a dyson instead.","review":"Every aspect of this cleaner is cheap and worthless. It doesn't pick up nearly the same amount as other cleaners and has quickly been falling apart since I bought it.- The brush head mechanism broke after 5 months.- The lightbulb on the front broke after a week.- The hose popped out of the main body.- Stretching the hose even slightly causes the unit to topple over. It's extremely dangerous and scary to have the whole unit come crashing down on wooden floors. Thankfully it missed me whilst I was crouching to get under the sofa.There's a reason why this cleaner is so cheap. A quick inspection instore would have taught me to avoid this piece of junk.*UPDATE - 8/4/05*My machine has now devloped the overheating problem and has just switched off like the other reviewers describe.

It has great suction at first, but it quickly weakens as the filters clog up. At most I can only vacuum two rooms without having to empty the canister. Emptying the canister is always a mess, trying to remove dust from three filters is very unpleasant. The belts have weakened and can hardly rotate the brushes, it overheats constantly and can taken up to several hours to cool down, and the smell...what is that smell that lingers in the air after I vacuum? I have kept the vacuum cleaner too long and now I can't return it.

When it shuts off you have to clean ALL the filters which include two filters outside the canister and three inside the canister. After that you have to wait ONE HOUR for it to cool down. This is the cleaning cycle you have to adapt to work with this HORRIBLE vacuum cleaner. So plan on a whole day to vacuum your rugs. Also when you clean the filters, dust gets everywhere. This vacuum also needs to be dusted to keep it clean.... It is a piece of expensive JUNK. I replaced it with a Hoover Tempo bag vacuum.

I own three dogs who shed terribly and this machine gets it all up! It also gets the fine dust particles out of my carpeting and that's the stuff that causes carpet to wear faster. As I saw stated by another reviewer, you DO have to empty it after each use... sometimes several times during use depending on how dirty the carpet is, but hey, think of how much of that dirt you'd be carrying around in your old sweeper bag and blowing air out through each time you run it!

The engineering is superb and the St. Louis Symphony is certainly in its prime. Get this CD - even if only for \\"Adagio.\\" The other tunes on here are amazing as well...Medea is fabulous, as is his 2nd essay, a wonderful piece in its heroic subtlety - Slatkin conveys magnificent interpretations - subtle but effective in the presentation of Barber's music.

They stayed with me, so when I so them in paperback recently, I picked them up. Well, they read just as well the second time, more than ten years later, as an adult. What I really enjoy about these is the way the author draws metaphors and comparisons between two things that only exist in her books, yet the metaphor works, you have a picture in your mind, you know what she means. Highly enjoyable, but the ending was not as I remembered--my memory must have rewritten the ending in the 12 or so years since I first read the trilogy.

I highly recommend everyone read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Aeriel and Irrylath","review":"I came across this book while scanning the bookshelves in my local library. since i had a lot of books, i decided i wouldnt read the dark angel, so i left it on the shelf but for the weirdest reason i came back and and took it and later on signed it out. i started reading it when i came home i found it very interesting and and later on finished it and loved it. meredith a. pirce sure know how to weave an invisible web of imagination around her readers! but to say i was very dissapointed and then miraculously i found out that there was another two books that continued the story of the DARKANGEL...so i went to the library right after and i finished the amazing trilogy full of bliss and sadness, in less than 2 days. not to say that i found irrylath strikingly handsome! hehehe..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Young Adult","review":"By reading the description of this book, I had no idea it was for young adults.

For young adult, I though the array of characters was pretty cool and the storyline itself was interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!!","review":"This book was wonderfully written and I could not put it down! If you are looking for a book with action, fantasy, and a little romance this is the perfect book for you! I am looking forward to reading the whole Darkangel Trilogy."},{"rating":"2","title":"a brilliant book about fantasy and evil passions","review":"I read this book back in seventh grade when I bought it at a library auction, I lost the book in a move and have been trying ever since to find it, im so happy i did, it amazes me how reading it 12 years later, it still has the same effects it did back then. The dark angel is a gripping book that keeps you hoping and doesnt leave you wanting. two days ago I discovered it was a trilogy, so I cant wait to read the others!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Read this in th 80's","review":"I first came across this book years ago; before all this vampire genre came about. I was in elementary school in the 80's and this was a book I came across in the young-adult section of our local library. I read it and loved the story. I checked it out at least 4 more times that I remember. As a young reader I was captivated by the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"like something from a forgotten dream","review":"Aeriel is taken by the Darkangel and forced to serve his thirteen undead, wraith wives until he finds his fourteenth so that he may joins his six brothers and take over the world. Under his intoxicating spell, but needing to stop him, Aeriel--persuaded by a mage--journeys to find the key to the Darkangel's undoing. Masterfully written, deeply beautiful and imaginative, this clever and unpredictable retelling of Beauty and the Beast was more than one of the best fantasy novels I've read in a long time. It was like a dream from long ago that I'd forgotten. Grade: A+"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Beautiful, Captivating Book","review":"I was intrigued by the picture of the hardcover version (yes, I freely admit I judge books by their covers), but I picked up the book and looked at it three times before I finally read it. I was astonished when I did.It was an incredible book! Pierce's ideas were fresh and untainted by the steriotypical idea of fantasy that has pervaded most modern writers. Her characters were all unique, believable and captivating."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIFIED by the ending","review":"This is a beautifully written fairy tale that teaches young girls to stick by evil, animal and women abusing men because there may be that \\"small spark of good\\"...and even die for them if necessary. I cannot believe how horrifying the end is. THINK PEOPLE. Just because someone writes something amazingly well does not mean that the message is a good one. Enough of this beauty and the beast trash. Too many women in this world are sticking by \\"monsters\\", waiting for that little, tiny spark of good to surface. What a shame that this much talent was used to foster such a dangerous, tired message."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great....but utterly AWFUL!","review":"The book starts off slow and ends abruptly. The plot inches along slowly, but the language and the characters enticing you to read more...until finally you're at the end...and that's it. The end is short and sloppy. After I read this book I was very angry that a book could be left in such a place...so many loose ends. How was that done again? - She did WHAT? Very sloppy...but the story its self demands to be read. If you can stand your own anger at the ending...the book is decent enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"dry and monotoneous story line","review":"This book is terribly over rated, not at all worth 5 stars! The only appealing thing was the darkangel, him and his looks. Aeriel was unbelievably common, nothing interesting about her. A simple book for simple minds."},{"rating":"1","title":"As deadly as having your soul sucked dry...","review":"Upon reading the positive reviews I borrowed a copy of this book, for I am a fan of Amelia Atwater-Rhodes's fantasy novels. Sigh. What can I say? The plotline is so predictable that I wondered if Aeriel has terribly weak logic to not see Darkangel IS the Prince Irrylath Dirna drowned in the lake. She is not very likable, the story is oddly bland and lacks in real action, drama, and passion. I suggest reading Amelia Atwater-Rhodes' \\"Hawksong\\" to get more kicks than this dry thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why did I buy this?","review":"It SOUNDED promising, but this book is one of the most boring things I've ever read. There is no emotion, the plot is frustratingly simple, and it's hard to deciede who's stupider- Ariel (a bland, unlikable character we are supposed to believe suddenly becomes a \\"strong\\"-but equally boring and stupid-woman in less than ten pages), or the author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Close my eyes and....","review":"I close my eyes and I can remember the many dark, seductive moments from this book.I must have read this book about 12-14 years ago but I can still remember moments from the protagonists life when she meets the dark angel and is taken to his home.This book had a profound effect on my childhood including some other books that I had read.I can visualize this book and the characters from the book because the story was written in such a magical way that I was so drawn to it.As a child, I didn't have funds to buy books and I had borrowed the trilogy from the library. After all these years, I still remembered this book so I decided to purchase it online last year to add to my book collection.I will plan to re-read it.A trilogy that I highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"My 15 y.o. thought this was a great book. She recommends it for the older teen and young adult."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well-written but superficial...","review":"I was perhaps expecting too much from this book, but it has such a cult status that I went in expecting it to be appealing on an adult level. There's no question that it's beautifully written, and the Darkangel, his castle and brides well-described; the problem is the heroine. Aerial is a perfect fairy-tale heroine--in fact, like Cinderella or Snow White, she is just flat-out perfect. No wryness, no irony, no flaws, and no sense of humor; no explanation how she got to be so darn brave and loveable; where other women fail, she succeeds just 'cause she's so completely *good*. There's no backstory and no depth to her. Little kids might find her appealing, but compared to the heroines of Martha Wells or even Tamora Pierce, she is flat & uninteresting; definitely unengaging for the adult reader. (Maybe she gains another dimension or two in the next books; I didn't care enough to keep going.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"I really enjoyed the adventure!","review":"I consider my self a Vampyre fan, and when I choose this novel, at fisrt time, I did think that it was a novel about demons or vampyres. But while I was reading it, I was surprised with the intense suspense and adventure found. Is my first time with a Pierce's novel, and I recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stand-out first in a trilogy","review":"It's the first in a trilogy, but it can actually stand alone quite well. In fact, I found the story arc was thinning in some places by the end of the third book, which was inevitable, but not necessarily satistfying. This is the best of the series, though. Nevertheless, all of the books were quite absorbing. Pierce knows how to tell a good tale. It's never failed to impress me that she managed to do something different and beautiful with the vampire genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great trilogy","review":"I loved this trilogy! Not just for young adults.The first one was the best, in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"I almost never give anything five stars.","review":"Pierce's \\"Firebringer\\" trilogy was written for kids. So...when I read this book (and its two sequels), I was expecting to read a kid's story. Instead, I was amazed by the depth of \\"The Darkangel.\\"To the person who couldn't get past Pierce's style of description: The spinning wheel made yarn out of emotions. Aeriel was surprised that she was spinning anything-and the yarn that she was spinning was made from her own feeling of surprise. Does that help any? (Pierce's storytelling voice is, indeed, a little strange...but that just means that you have to pay attention to the details!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea poorly executed.","review":"I have tried most presentation pointing devices on the market. The Phaser is better than some because it has a trackball instead of a minature joystick or hatswitch. But the Phaser appears to be built very cheaply. It uses mechanical rollers instead of optical technology, and the rollers, which are attached to flimsy little bent wires, easily lose contact with the ball. Perhaps I got a lemon. I returned mine and bought a Gyration Ultra."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be careful, get the GME322R, not the GME321R","review":"The remote is beautiful, but I could not plug the receiver into my (less than 1 year old) laptop. I was able to plug it into my desktop computer, which is 2 years old. The GME321R has a PS-2 receiver, my laptop is not compatible with it. Apparently the GME322R does have the USB receiver, with a PS-2 adapter included. The laser is very strong. I am now eagerly awaiting the arrival of the GME322R model :). The description of the GME321R does not explicitly state that it is not USB-compatible, so be careful to chose the correct model for your system."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny but not really riddles","review":"This is really more of a joke book.

It was so refreshing because I'm sick of the bland [material] thats comming out over here in the UK at the moment. Hayden gives something new, not because he;s completly original in his sound, just because he's different to whats comming out now. This album is very different to the gruge raw sound of his first album. I believe that he has grown as a songwriter. His voice may at first be an obstacle but I think it complements his sound. He's with no doubt a great musician. This album is definitely a must for anyone who enjoys honest lyrics about life. The country/rock sound is amazing throughout. My personal favourites are \\"All in one move\\", \\"carried away\\", \\"dynamite walls\\". The album has a few songs that are a little weak. There are times when his music makes you want to slit your wrists but there are times when his music really helps with the [stuff] life throws at you. Excellent album, a must for any true 'music' fan!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bland, Boring","review":"I bought this CD based upon a cross-link to this page and the rave reviews of Hayden's fans. I regret my decision, not because the music is bad, but because it is tedious and the guy's voice is limited.Once again, the fans of a no-name musician have stuffed the ballot box to make it appear that he is the Christ. If you're not already a fan, better to spend your time and money elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"short, concise, accurate and fun!","review":"Alterman presents a well researched and documented book complete with analysis that attempts to explain why Springsteen's art motivates others to take direct action in their own respective communities. The book seems to suggest that Springsteen is providing a soundtrack for the idealism that the pundits have told us died in earlier years. Sprinsteen reminds us that we aren't alone struggling in the wilderness for the things that matter; that there is a communitiy of people out there who are working toward better lives in their own neighborhoods and there is something to this idea that there is power and redemption to be found in rock-n-roll; but let us not forget, through it all, the politics and ideas of community aside, there was an 11th commandment; \\"Let it rock\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great niche book","review":"I heard from a friend that Alterman's \\"Ain't No Sin...\\" was a book about Bruce's political and social relevance (something that was done with, I should say, somewhat better results in \\"Tramps Like Us\\"). Coming from this perspective, its shortcomings are not great and Alterman is an astute observer."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is a terrific read.","review":"This book helps the reader understand why Bruce Springsteen's music has lasted. Alterman explains Springsteen has grown up -- an how his music has changed and grown with him. It's a terrific, well-written read."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Conscience of America","review":"Eric Alterman, a Springsteen fan himself, writes with insight and sympathy for Bruce Springsteen, a man who, despite his wealth and success, is still trying to figure himself out and be honest to his core values. Springsteen is trying to be the conscience of America while also it's best concert entertainer backed by the best band in the land. No mean task! No wonder he's such a perfectionist. As other books have implied, Eric Alterman leaves me feeling that Bruce makes all of his fans better for helping them keep in touch with the better angels of their nature. This book will only increase the reader's appreciation for Bruce Springsteen, the man and his art."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent, quick-read for all Bruce fans","review":"I was excited when I learned on the internet that this book was going to be released. Eric Alterman does a great job gathering an enormous amount of information, which he uses to put the reader in the room with Bruce. From the John Hammond audition, to the many late nights in the studio trying to perfect an album, to the night Mr. Alterman got to meet his hero, the reader is right in the middle of it all. Along with this, Alterman sprinkles in personal stories of sacrificing anything to get to see Bruce in concert. Any true fan knows what he is talking about and can relate to his love of Springsteen and his music. The book was so well written that it will cause me to research other things that Alterman has done. Feel free to send me your comments, or if you want a Bruce fan to chat with."},{"rating":"2","title":"The real Bruce is everything we hoped for...","review":"\\"If a body catch a body comin' through the rye\\" Holden Caulfield would have loved Bruce Springsteen. He's no phony (to us or himself) and Alterman captures that so well.Bruce has the same frailties that we have, which endears him all the more. My parents died several years ago and the home we grew up in was sold. I found myself driving out of my way to go past the old home without really knowing why. Alterman gives an insight into Bruce having the same unconscious habit that has given me something to think about regarding my own past.I could not put this book down. There is a lot of human insight in this book that non-fans could even connect with. Alterman knows his subject. It's a great story and my next book is a letdown already."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Much Alterman","review":"Agreed - it does read like a term paper. Not sure if it was over-edited and any potentially interesting stuff was taking out, or if it wasn't touched and too much about the author was left in (who cares if his family didn't like him going to the No Nukes concerts on Yom Kippur?). Alterman is a professional, and this reads like a college paper. Quoting other journalists (especially Griel Marcus) is just lazy, and quoting from the songs is amateurish. Most unforgivable line: \\"changes made uptown and the big man joined the band\\" to cover Clarence Clemmons joining the E Street Band permanently. It made my skin crawl. Don't waste your time unless you don't know anything about Springsteen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very weak.","review":"THe writer is a gifted one, but the book is weak. It should have been longer. This is HARDLY the definitive Bruce biography. This has yet to be written...Anyway, it's a fast reading that will give you a general portrait of his career.But, one observation about his defense of the total commercialism of the BORN IN THE USA album: I like the BORN IN THE USA album. But, if the video for DANCING IN THE DARK is not a total sell out, well, I don't know what a sell out is anymore.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing New","review":"This book reads like an 11th grade term paper. Nothing new -- just repeating information gleaned from other sources. Thankfully it's short, so I didn't waste too much time on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretentious -- unlike Springsteen","review":"This is a useless piece of thumbsucking in which the author rambles on as he attempts to cash in on a great artist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Born To Bow","review":"Eric Alterman and Bruce have one thing in common. They both worship the ground Bruce walks on. Eric, and fans like him, that bow at the altar of Bruce need to get a life. The idea that Bruce or Eric have a \\"cultural impact\\" is just nonsense. Bruce is a talented songwriter and performer and it pretty much ends right there. Making him the focal point of ones life will rob you of time. If Bruce has a message in his songs it's about movement in life and growing up so why can't fans just take the advice he offers and let it rest already."},{"rating":"2","title":"great white light but bulb burns out.","review":"This bulb (purple) emits a much whiter light than the other xenon bulb (blue). Only problem is that these burn out more often, I've gone thru two pairs in one year.

You'll look at the last page number and wonder where the authors put all that great stuff in a book of such ordinary length. Unabashadly self-congratulatory in its theme of humanity's superiority over all other species, largely due to the average human's refusal to give up in the face of pain or adversity."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed not up to usual standards","review":"The two produced a work far below what they normally write.

I had no idea who he was but was attracted by the cover and the title and, if I'm honest, Eric Hobsbawm's preface. This is the best-written and most educative history of our country and its wars that I've ever read. I finished school over a year ago and have been travelling the world. This amazing history taught me more than I'd ever learnt at NYU. This book should be on every history reading list. I'm not saying that I expect everyone to agree with its arguments, but simply in the interests of diversity and freedom of thought.

The Lyrical content is \\"Based on the idea of a global conspiracy by a powerful secret society\\"(to quote the inside of the booklet). Yep, It's a concept album. But all the tracks are great by themselves, too. But to get the full effect you need to hear it all.:DKai Hansen is an awesome guitarist, all the songs have great riffs and solos.

It is seldom on television, and I cannot understand why. Burnt Offerings is not your ordinary horror film with ghosts and gore or expensive special effects, but a psychological thriller that keeps you asking questions long after the closing credits role. If you want to see an average haunted house flick rent Amityville Horror or Poltergiest but if you want to be terrified by the horrifying image of a hearse driven by the angel of death, played by the creepy Anthony James or a wave pool that would drown any Baywatch lifeguard or an old mansion that transforms itself to its original state with every drop of blood that is shed by its inhabitants, you must watch Burnt Offerings."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Guaranteed Scare","review":"Despite the show of typical 1970s horror film cheesiness, this film is by far the best haunted house movie I have ever seen. They just don't make atmospheric thrillers anymore. Curtis' typical settings and atmosphere really come through here, and the wonderful score really tingle your spine. One word of caution: if you watch this alone, locked up, you're guaranteed to look behind your back for someone coming to get you. Daytime or nighttime!

The hearse driver would be enough for me to start packing.The movie does throw some creepyness at you and the movie score will stay with you,even the final scene.Dan Curtis,who went on later to direct War&Rememberance series handles the camera well with great up close facial shots but not enough to make it rememberable.

While the book is not exhaustive, that is, it does not carry ALL of Schubert's lieder, or ALL of Schumann's lieder, or ALL of Fauré's songs, etc ... in the classical literature, still there are a great many songs and their translations ... of the literature most often chosen by voice teachers for young singers to learn. The book is useful in that it not only gives a word-for-word translation, but also, where needed, the best \\"sense\\" of the poetry in English as well. If you sing classical song literature in Italian, German and French, then this book and its companion, (Part 2) are essential resources to have.

Even Pink Floyd's Nick Mason has so much admiration for this guy that he once said \\"I like his style\\". This album has some fine moments though not as striking and catchy compared to his earlier albums. This album is very diverse in musical style some songs are queer, balladry, whimsical, nostalgic etc. If you are expecting simple pop songs that can be sung easily like Elton John, you are mistaken Wyatt is totally the opposite very complex but comprehensible. Some songs will get your attention and if it did it will get stuck in your mind and plays endlessly but others will come in passing the reason for a 4 star rating. All songs here require active and repeated listening. If you enjoy Kevin Ayers, Syd Barrett and Daevid Allen, Wyatt comes far more superior than them and a sure delight."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW","review":"This is such a genuine performance.

I felt that, although this book is well written, it is over-appreciated, if you will.The book lacks storyline, and, although it is written exactly for that, it does get tedious towards the hundred and fiftieth page where there is still no plot.On the other hand, the book is incredibly nostalgic. It really is fantastic to read and then suddenly remeber similar childhood antics.Also, the book is driven by the emotions felt by Paddy as his world changes, which is marvellous to find as this is the only factor that kept me reading all the way through."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moving and Entertatining","review":"I was very annoyed to find that some people feel this book has no plot. The plot is clearly building up a believable, often amusing, and constantly entertaining image of childhood, which can then be shattered due to the family rift that occurs towards the end. A semi-autobiography, this book touches on the element of childhood that so many people have forgotten. A clear, beautfiul, amusing, and moving portrait of Irish childhood. Being Irish myself, I find no difficulties comprehending the language, and am dismayed that others presume the Irish author should change his vocabulary for the benefit of his American readers. The Irish words will be at least obvious to any intelligent reader. A favourite book of mine...."},{"rating":"2","title":"twas intriguing","review":"Roddy Doyle did a fantastic job on the not so easy task of getting inside a young boy's head in the novel Paddy Clarke HaHaHa. I really enjoyed this book because i was able to make strong connections between my childhood characteristics and Paddy's. It was very interesting to see Paddy's relationships with different people in his life and how he dealt with the hradships that were thrown at him. Paddy also evolved alot as a person throughout this book. He learned alot about himself through his relations with others and become a more conscious young man, a very old 10 yr old. Overall, Paddy Clarke was a very intriuging book, although it was solw in some parts. I do believe that in order to really enjoy this reading you must have a very imaginative and playfull mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"A brilliant journey into the mind of a child","review":"By far Roddy Doyle's greatest novel to date, this brilliantly written, subtly plotted recreation fo childhood well deserved the Booker Prize. It remains the most truly insightfull book I have ever read. Previous reveiws have bemoaned the apparent lack of plot. This seems to suggest that they simply didn't read it all. There is a very strong plot going right through the novel, only it doesn'y take center stage, simply because the narrator - a 10 year old boy - fails to understand what is really happening around him until the very close of the novel, when his innocence is brought to an abrupt end... To say you should read this book is an understatement - you simply must read this book. A masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get Past the Format and Enjoy the Story!","review":"This is a story about 10 year old Patrick Clarke, his family and friends. The entire book is totally stream of conscious from Paddy's point of view. The boys in his crew terrorize Barrytown and each other! He also picks on his younger brother Francis - calling him Sinbad. Paddy's parents fight a lot and we find out, in the end, that the title of the book comes from his father's deserting the family and the boys chanting \\"Paddy Clarke, ha ha ha, he has no da, ha ha ha.\\"The book is truly entertaining - there is no question on that end. It is also extremely hard to read in any broken-up setting (commuting, a little each night, etc.) because there are no chapters, no breaks and no natural flow to the plot. This also helps the credibility level as 10 year olds really act and talk like this. The insight might be lacking, but it frees the mind to imagine background to the characters as well as a future for each of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"We're only little boys for a litte while","review":"I was unprepared for the strength of this book. After the light-hearted, hilarious yet at most bittersweet previous Doyle works such as The Commitments and The Van, I was assuming that this book would continue in that vein. Instead, what I found was the maturation of an incredibly gifted writer, one who demonstrates his newfound maturity by reverting to that most basic of human creatures, the ten-yeard-old boy; our curiosity was balanced only by our inability to be impressed, and our cruelty was neither a sign of mental illness nor primal instincts geared towards pack advancement, but simply a continuation of our attempts to fill those sponge-like little minds.The final chapter left me breathless. I finished the book, found my wife, handed her the book and said \\"This is what it was like to have been a little boy.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a compelling read. The naysayers are right.","review":"This is a well-written book about a young boy in Ireland, but I'm about 137 pages into it and I'm struggling to finish. Doyle's quality prose isn't enough to keep you interested in Paddy Clarke's story, which is told from the first-person perspective of the boy himself. There's just never enough insight into the boy to really care. If you want to read a bunch of vignettes from a boy's point of view, knock yourself out, but know what you're getting.This is the fourth Roddy Doyle book I've read and frankly it is his least engaging. \\"The Van\\" is one of the funniest books I've encountered and I'm going to steer you towards that. Also, if you've got the stomach for it, you might want to check out Irvine Welsh's \\"Filth.\\" It's not for the squeamish, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Committed readers technical bliss.","review":"\\"paddy clarke ha ha ha\\" achieved the Booker Prize (1993) for obvious reasons. Technically it is brilliant; the subject matter is conveyed in an appropriate form. The disjointed approach mirrors that of an actual child. This fact make the reading much more interesting, as the story is not in a straight line through time.However, while this may be faultless, the story is definitely for a hard core reader. So don't try to read this book without 'warming up' first with a simpler more easy publication. Something chronological. Nevertheless, if you are ready for the challenge and you are a keen reader this is definitely something you should read. Even if it is just to say that you have read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ending left me hanging","review":"Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha deserves four stars for its great description of a child who, through experience, grows faster than his age. Doyle did an exceptional job of capturing the life of a ten year old. The book is written in a ten year old's \\"voice\\" including short sentences and many vingnettes. But it feels as if you are right there with Paddy, observing the same things, from fighting with his friends to watching his parents fight.I enjoyed reading this book but I have to say the ending although well written, was a short stop. It left me feeling incomplete, wondering what would've happened next. At the same time, Doyle did conclude the story at an interesting place that worked and that I liked but left me not knowing what to do next."},{"rating":"2","title":"heart-rending, funny, read it and weep.","review":"Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha is one of the sweetest and most true-to-life books I have had the pleasure to read in a very long time.

I recommend this book to everyone. It is truly incredible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply a wonderful story","review":"I am seldom disappointed with Mr. Doyle's books. It is very clear why this book was an award winner. How Mr. Doyle manages to take on the voice of a 10 year old boy and to remember the feelings, the things that are so intensely important to a 10 year old, the irrational fears, the careless days, the petty rivalries. This book is really a testament to his creativity, originality and his lovely wit.

It was refreshing to read the stream of consciesness style of writing.

A great book","review":"I just finished Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha, and I am basking in the glow of this remarkably entertaining story, which Roddy Doyle somehow conjured up from his childhood memories. What's most impressive, I think, is how Doyle captures the voice of a 10-year-old boy so authentically. It's not what the boys do so much as the logic and reasoning that ring true, especially when Paddy makes the stupid mistakes that come with being 10 years old. The funny bits are great, and the family drama is small, quiet and emotionally powerful.

As previously discussed in other reviews the plot for this one is actually carried out pretty well. I found myself liking it more because of what her character was dealing with while pursuing this killer. It causes her to pretty much lose it in more ways than one. I don't like telling the plot of the movie, because it gives away too much for me. I like to be surprised and see where the movie takes you.The Alphabet Killer takes you on a nice ride and for the most part keeps your interest throughout primarily because of the actors/actresses that encompass the movie itself. They make it more than attention worthy and at the very least worthy of a weekend renting by anyone to see what its really all about. Not quite a 5 star movie but totally better than some of the other movie offerings i've seen in the past few months."},{"rating":"1","title":"The alphabet killer","review":"I gave it a 2 star rating because it didn't really get into the killings. I lived in Rochester, NY back then. It all happened around the time my daughter was born. I knew a uncle to one of the girls. Yes, to this date they have not found the killer. It had the whole city in such a state that people from all walks of life were afraid for thier children.

I've seen all the Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Tru Calling, Dollhouse. She is a great actress. But this movie was very interesting and had many twists and turns. It has a very interesting story line, I think you will enjoy it. It arrived quickly and was still factory sealed with the sticker across the top. I would recommend adding this to your collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eliza Dushku with some weird neurological disease","review":"This movie might have been crafted into, at least, a fairly conventional cops & serial killer movie, but fails. It's a waste of a pretty decent supporting cast, including Timothy Hutton, who doesn't appear to get the kind and quality of work he deserves. There are many problems, including a silly answer to the whodunnit that you can see coming up the street way, way early. And then, once revealed, the plot gets even worse. Most problematic, I'm afraid, is Eliza Dushku's performance. Actors talk about how hard it is to \\"do crazy\\" and this is as glaring an example I know of how NOT to portray a person with mental illness. She's got all kinds of weird tics and an arm that seems to always be threatening to go Dr. Strangelove on her. I'd diagnose any number of neurological illnesses before the schizophrenia which is supposed to be her affliction. Her hallucinations are straight out of The Ring. Avoid this stinker."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME","review":"I thought this movie was terrible. I really liked Wrong Turn but this was completely different. VERY BORING!

It's the type of movie you wonder why they even bothered to base on a real event. Clearly the writer had somewhere else they wanted to go. Why didn't they just go there without the \\"based on true events\\" tag. Not worth the time it takes to watch it.

This might have made sense if I had been stoned, but to me it had no real value at all and if the reason you rented the movie was to see Eliza Dushku topless, then you best be quick about it. This movie was supposed to be based on the true story of the double initial killings in Rochester, NY. Not my cup of tea for sure, but then you may just like it, who knows."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eliza Dushka fan","review":"The story plot seemed a little lame.

For those who don't know already, it's been years since Jim Davis, the original creator of the character, has penned the strip. Twenty five years ago, this strip was often hilarious. Today, the strip shows all the signs of pathetic design by committee. About as unfunny as it gets. The movie is marginally -- only marginally -- better."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good story","review":"The weird CGI cat did throw this film off just a tad but over all I thought that they captured the spirit of Garfield."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missed the mark","review":"I think that most movies for kids that are really good also can appeal to adults with their humor. I think this movie missed out on that on both targets. It just wasn't that funny. Bill Murray who I usually like just didn't get the job done but that might be just the material that he was working with. After Nemo and some other kid movies that I found hilarious I had high expectations for this one knowing Murray was doing Garfield. It fell short on every level."},{"rating":"2","title":"MEOOW","review":"I love the way Garfield made his debut on the big screen.While long time fans will miss Lorenzo Music, Bill Murray was a great choice and does an excllent job of making the fat cat the loveable feline we all have come to love.A fun movie, great for the Kids..and even some of the ah, Bigger kids."},{"rating":"1","title":"are you all idiots?","review":"this is the kind of movie that makes a man frown upon his own society. it is one thing to assume that people like silly, computer-animated characters in a real world situation, it is quite another to force this kind of bullship on a country that is already suffering in other ways. please stop supporting this kind of garbage and use your dollar as a vote."},{"rating":"1","title":"By far the stupidest movie of 2004","review":"I hate this movie.

I've been a Garfield fan ever since I was a kid, and I was delighted by this film.Sure, it has come a few years late, and I can quite understand the complaints that Garfield is presented out of character (i.e. far too active), but it does not stop the humor and spirit of the old cat.Bill Murray's voice has always perfectly suited Garfield, and in this movie a series of innocent yet hilarious gags will have you laughing away. As the story progresses, we are introduced to a bunch of likeable characters and old fashioned nasty children's villains. Throughout the movie Garfield keeps us smiling, and the effects on Garfield himself are well done.In these days where most films are almost obliged to contain either plenty of violence or plenty of \`adult' humor, it's nice to have a break. Garfield is a good old fashioned style kids film that will also appeal to adults like me. Don't expect too much, just enjoy the laughs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Product Placement Hell","review":"I might watch this movie again, not because its good though.

I honestly believe I could count over 50 blatant product placements in this movie. I mean blatant too, like extended views of Wendy's advertisements on the TV and long zoom ins on Jon's Macintosh.

I was dissapointed. Odie was a real dog--which actually it still worked out ok in the movie. Also, John (the owner) didn't look like the owner in the cartoon series. In the cartoon series, John had glasses etc. I don't know, I had the certain picture of what he was supposed to look like in my mind. Garfield looked like Garfield which I guess is the main thing. The plot was somewhat like Toy Story.I'll have to give credit though. It seemd that Garfield looked and acted like Garfield which I was happy about that.I did enjoy the fact that Garfield acted and said things that would remind of the cartoon series like his \\"I hate mondays\\" or some of his other lines.Over all, I give this movie 2 stars because of the lack of making it look like the orginial."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was terrible, even for a talking animal movie!","review":"This movie was terrible and probably one of the worst movies ever. I had one or two odd giggles but besides that it is just boring and all my friends agree with me. It was short and I love the comics but it is one of the worst things I have ever seen hands down. People may have liked it but I was expecting a little bit more. Even my eight year old cousin, who is a kid hated it.

The funniest part was when Garfield accidently destroyed the owner's living room!! (I forgot the owner's name.) The people that didn't care for it were; my Mom and Andrew. Tho everyone thought Garfield looked like a real cat! I wanna see it again, tho my Mom said no. I'm buying the DVD when it comes out.

Well...a storyline would have helped too but seeing an animated Garfield in a real environment just ruined it for me. It wasn't believable for one second. And when they would hold him it looked like they were holding nothing at all. He's supposed to be this obese cat and they don't even try to act like they're holding something heavy. The best part of the movie was seeing Odie dance. And I only enjoyed the first 15 seconds of that. The rest of the movie is trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"A great movie; except for the fact that it was awful","review":"This movie, in my opinion, was only commendable for its memorable comments by Garfield; because otherwise the plot was rather repugnant, the movie completely ignored the nature of the comic strip, and the voice of Bill Murray for Garfield wasn't quite as good as the voice of past Garfield speaker Lorenzo Music. An unnecessary swear word was blasted near the beginning of the movie, which would have been okay if the movie had not been intended for a relatively young audience. Additionally negative is that Garfield's sayings concerning an \\"astronaut game\\" venture into the corny side, and that a collar that electrifies a certain man gets a bit too harsh for humor. Conclusively, I would recommend this film to all fans of lame-o plots and movies that do not properly follow their origins."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok, not as funny as I thought it would be.","review":"It wasn't as funny as I thought it would be, but it was clever and I liked the adventure concept."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garfield--a dissapointment","review":"I didn't expect it to be any better than the old garfield cartoon series.

I know it was rated PG but I thought Garfield of all characters was going to be okay for him to watch. I knew it was bad when my four year old started to count how many times they said stupid. I am not a strict parent when it comes to movie watching but I also don't like my two litte one's going around saying stupid, butt, damn and ass. All of these words were present in this movie. I don't know why the character Garfield had to say stupid, idiot and other mean things. It's a character for kids young and old....we don't need all of our children learning this disrespectful behavior. Parents can still enjoy a kids movie without having horrible language."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Much Catnip....","review":"First off, I'm a die-hard \\"Garfield\\" fan. Thus, I'm speaking of the comic strip series and the hit cartoon show (along with the Christmas special and others). Seeing how Garfield did so well in the 80's and early 90's, this movie feels a bit dated.Since CGI is creeping around everywhere in movies now, I'd say it somewhat resembles Garfield. A weird look, but it works. I would been much happier if either the whole film was animated or all the characters other than Garfield were CGI (especially Odie!). The CGI Garfield and real Odie (and real Jon, etc.) just didn't work for me. Work in an mediocre story, and well, you have another great cartoon pasttime get caught up in the Hollywood shuffle.Die-hard fans should avoid this film. New comers, I suggest getting one of Garfield books (like \\"In Dog Years I'd Be Dead : Garfield at 25\\") or cartoon collections on DVD.

The Jen Love Hewitt and Breckin Meyer look as though they're trying to obtain any sort of romantic chemistry but ultimately fail. Even the jokes fail in the long run. The kids in the theater didn't even find most of the movie appealing. The only life raft in this stinker of a movie is the dog playing Odie. He got the most laughs and captured the hearts of the kids with his big eyes and constant physical jokes (basically being pushed off chairs and jumping on its hind legs).Though I must say Bill Murray did capture the correct tone of wry humor and sarcasm for the role of Garfield."},{"rating":"1","title":"this movie stunk hard","review":"this movie was so horrible. the commercials made is look good. on tv they only showed the parts that were 2 year old funny. it stunk. it wasn't funny. it had bad acting. don't buy this mediocre hunk of junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE MOVIE!!!!","review":"This is my LEAST favorite movie EVER.

The plot was mishmash of other plots, with the most obvious part taken directly from \\"Toy Story 2\\" (which did the rescue-a-friend bit infinitely better).

The jokes fall flat, Nermal's voice is all wrong, and what happens between Jon and Liz is... well, let me put it this way. What would you think if Charlie Brown were to talk to the little red-haired girl, of if Schroeder gave Lucy a present on Beethoven's birthday? Such things are just not supposed to be!The only good thing about this movie was being able to look at Jennifer Love Hewitt walking around in some rather short, tight dresses.The kids in the audience seemed to be enjoying themselves enough, but they enjoyed the \\"Gone Nutty\\" short that preceded the feature a *lot* more.

That was my first mistake. In the whole movie, I only snickered once. Usually I'm laughing my a** off at the comics, so that in itself was disappointing.Also, there was virtually no paralell between the strip and the movie. In the strip, Jon originally had a roommate and Odie was the roommate's dog. The roommate was faded out but Odie stayed. In the movie, however, Odie was a present from Liz, the vet. In the strip, Liz never passes up a chance to insult Jon; in the movie she's sweet-as-pie (gag). In the strip, Jon's dorkiness is endearing; in the movie he's just naive. The list goes on and on.All in all, I am sorry I paid the $5 to rent this, but glad I didn't spend the $20 to purchase it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring.","review":"I hated this film. This movie is bad, but being a Garfield fan for a long time, I had to give it a try. The story (if you can call it that) is basically a plot for Garfield to rescue Odie who has been dog napped and to get into funny situations. Garfield has some very funny lines (down dumb dog) and gets into some very funny situations and Bill Murray was terrific as the voice with just the right adjustments here and there to be funny. Other than that the story is just enough to hold together the \\"plot\\", the human acting is painful (Breckin Meyer & Jennifer Love Hewitt need to fire their agents) and the dialogue is corny. Also I thought they should have made Jon the loser with women that he is in the comic strip and Odie should have been a CGI character as well. Overall its not a masterpiece of film, but if you go in knowing what to expect it is funny at times. This movie is for Garfield fans and parents who want to take their kids to a family film."},{"rating":"1","title":"When CGI goes too far","review":"I love Garfield the cat.

I don't know what is more offensive the fact that Garfield and Odie looks nothing like their newspaper counterparts or that the only big name actor in this movie is Bill Murray as Garfield. Bill Murray better have received a big check for this clunker of a film. Breckin Meyer as Jon Arbuckle? John is tall, lanky and dorky looking. Breckin is short and doesn't look nowhere near as nerdy looking as the Jim Davis' creation. And Jennifer Love Hewitt as Garfield's vet Liz is laughable.

There wasn't much of a story to hold my interest: A mousy widow hooks up with a returned scoundrel for one season for an affair. I expected to enjoy stimulating backs-and-forths between the two main characters and was disappointed to find them totally unmatched. The widow never really evolved from mousy to an interesting rounded person and the scoundrel never became the kind of alpha male romance hero that you would root for and sigh over. His smacking her bottom scene didn't excite me in the least, I am not much for physical abuse even if it supposed to be \\"sexy.\\" There is a time and place for this kind of thing but I don't think a mainstream historical romance novel is.

Sexual language: strong/erotic."},{"rating":"1","title":"A hot book with a good plot...but boring characters","review":"I really wanted to like this book. It's definitely readable, but the characters were somewhat flat. The best characterization was done on Julian, the villain. Also, I couldn't believe that Merriam would indulge in the kind of sex that she indulged in with Drake then continue to say, \\"Oh my!\\" every time she had an orgasm and remain so...child-like throughout the book.Perhaps I shouldn't have read this book right after Elizabeth Hoyt's \\"The Raven Prince\\" which will put many books in the shade this season."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved A Lady's Pleasure","review":"If you love hot, fun, wonderful Victorian era romance, you are going to love Renee Bernard.

She then drops the near dead fox off at his den and walks away as if it were a throw away toy.

It's definitely for any R&B lover and especially those that lovvvve slow jams like me. There's not one song on this album that I don't think people could relate to. It's a (...) soothing album. My personal favorites are Oooh Ahhh, Picture Yo' Body, First Cum First Serve, How 'Bout It, and Don't Miss a Good Thing. And if you're lucky like me, then you heard the remix to Ooh Ahh which is MAJOR!!!!

I bought this album (on cassette tape) when it was first released, I was a budding jazz guitarist in my first or second year of a Jazz Performance degree and almost 20 years later it is still an inspired benchmark of jazz musicianship and musicality by which all other jazz performances should be measured.Essential listening for all!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jazz perfection...a classic","review":"If you don't like this album, you don't like jazz.

And yes, I noticed the \\"flaw\\" right toward the end too - on the VI/7 chord moving to the II/7 chord - but I don't think it took away from the performance. It is no big deal, and might just add to the intensity of the resolution.

Ms Kanno delves into both middle-eastern melodies and heavy-metal guitars for inspiration on this disc. As such, with such varied musical roots, the disc is everything we've come to expect from her and includes some phenomenal surprises along the way. The only \\"song\\" I didn't like on the disc is the first cut, \\"24 Hour Open\\" which is just a bunch of gun-fire over a screaming crowd. It fit the opening sequence of the film, but it just doesn't work, reproduced in audio-only.Unfortunately, this version of the disc is noticeably missing two songs. \\"Ask DNA\\", which is the opening titles track, and an imminently hummable tune, and \\"Cosmic Dare (Pretty with a pistol)\\" which is heard as Faye is flying over the city in her ship at the beginning of the movie. These two songs were available on a mini-disc that was included on the original pressing of the movie OST. ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Awesome","review":"I've never regretted buying a Cowboy Bebop CD.

About 45 minutes through, watching with a friend who also enjoys films mocking the business world, we both gave up. THe film appears to be only inside one or two rooms of extremely dull white walls, the main characters are so tense and fed up that one feeels that one really is at work.I know this review is probably unfair, after reading others' reviews, but I want to put it out there: I watch a lot of foreign and odd films with great patience, yet this one I could not manage.Was it me, my mood, who knows?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Movie for the eggheads","review":"I think von Trier is proud of this film stylistically.

Anyway there is here and there a joke which made me laugh in the movie. It seems like Trier likes to dig beyond the surface of modern man. In this film the scene is corporate Denmark.

A set up perhaps similar to something about mary.But instead of trying to get laughs - the film spends most of its time trying to be sincere and emotionally deep and believable. I gues the film tries to be a romantic comedy. Unfortunately, all the action is between the rivals, the chick doesnt get enough screen time (she seems kinda bland and nice), plus the initial romance is never really established. SO the emotional heart of the film is missing.

The authors are college professors, and the book is written towards a reader that is some weird combination of a college student that doesn't know anything about computer languages and a professional that does. It takes a *long* time to get to the meat of describing anything useful, and never really makes me feel like it's explaining anything in recognition of my being a skilled professional. It's like a CNN news anchor explaining what an array is. *Yawn*. I've put this book down after 7 chapters of mind-numbing drivel. And please spare me the history lessons about Algol.

After some more bad customer service, I finally got to a supervisor and told him that this was perhaps the worst \\"customer service\\" I'd ever experienced, and that this was my first and last day with Cingular.

The side buttons that control the ring settings of the phone are active even when the phone is closed, and sometimes the settings will get unintentionally changed while the phone is in my pocket or bag.

Each time a problem has come up (buttons didn't work, display stops working, phone answered the call on its own (while sitting on the desktop), etc.), the service has been tremendously awful (1 hr on the phone) and my only viable option is to receive another refurbished phone. The company tells me the replacements are \\"reconditioned\\" and suggested I contact Motorolla. Even after clearly articulating I was dissatified with the quality of the phone and service, my request for a refund and/or different phone at their cost was denied.

They sold me a recalled phone and required me to sign up for 2 years of service.Two months later, I was told it was recalled and they offered to send me another (refurbished) phone. I told them I wanted to be credited for the phone cost which they refused. So they sent me another cell phone (V600). The new one is missing part of its front cover casing.I called Cingular and they said the only choice was to to send another phone, cancel the service ($200) or buy a new phone for whatever I pay out of pocket.This is unacceptable.

It started out pretty good, but since it's one of those thin romance novels, it has to skip to the falling in love part too quick. It's like they met one day and were in love the next.

Suddenly he's in Hell - then he's at Jesus' feet - then he's back on earth. Considering what a rare opportunity it is to go to Hell and live to tell about it, I was hoping for more information.Regardless, I hope he's wrong. I can't imagine a God who would place his mortal children on earth for 70-100 earth years & then banish them to the Hell described for eternity. So basically the theory holds - the old lady down the road who never hurt a fly & left all her money to charity when she died is burning in a wretched pit of fire forever because she didn't become a christian.

The only problem with all of this is that he prefaced all of his experiences with the Bible verse, and they were written verbatum. The author's style leaves each encounter to be questioned. Throughout the book I kept asking myself, \\"why is he using verses he knows then describing it as his own experience?\\" It all sounds like a guy who wanted to write a book the could change someone's religious views, but had nothing else to bring to the table except a made up story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, I don't trust the author's story.

The author of this book either has a vivid imagination, fantastic dreams (nightmares) or just wants to make money selling books. If you believe in a place (Hell) where people go simply because they do not believe in Jesus and will be tormented forever because of this then obviously you must believe that God is more of a tyrant than Hitler ever was. If God is love as the Bible points out there is no way anybody could have this experience. This has got to be the most misinterpreted subject in the Bible.

There's no way to prove it, or disprove it. It just sickens me how Christianity needs these scare tactics to lure people into the fold. God needs an adversary. God needs the threat of hell. If there were no punishment for not following him, why would you? It's like if you go into a bank with a glock handgun and hold it up to the teller and demand money. Now she will give you money because she doesn't want any bodily harm. Try going into the bank and demanding money without any weapons.

Now, this book is complete trash, that's true, but I'm afraid that I place no more or less believability in it than the Bible itself. After all, they are both just a story, and nobody REALLY knows if they are true or not, until they die.

I wished the author would of just told his story of what he experienced instead of adding \\"preaching\\" along the way or stories he's heard to compare to what he was going through. Also, adding scripture and quotes in the middle of his experience just makes it seem like his story is created or made up according to Bible quotes. Don't get me wrong, I believe what the Bible says but feel it could have been added in the end of the Chapter so the story is more fluid and not broken up. I think Hell is something alot of people have not taken alot of time to think about or believe it is actually real, this book does make you think and I certainly want to take every measure to not end up there.Not sure if I believe this happened but that doesn't really matter, what does matter is believing in God and living to His Word."},{"rating":"1","title":"Epic, just epic!","review":"This must be, quite simply, the most epically stupid and hence also the most epically entertaining bunch of reviews in the history of Amazon.

Bill Weises' description of his time in hell went beyond anythingimaginable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awakening!","review":"This is the most spiritually awakening book I have read in a very long time. We hear so much about God's love and we are ever grateful and trusting in Him because of that undying, faithful love but when one experiences what Bill Wiese experienced it is almost beyond words. He wrote this so well that I felt as though I was walking through hell with him. It touched my soul in the way that we must pray for the lost and reminds me of God's words He wants that \\"none would perish but all would have everlasting life in Him\\". Wonderful reading.

It changed my mind completely about worrying about trivial matters, and set my focus on eternity, for once you are in eternity, you cannot turn back. Hell is too long and too much suffering to be wrong.

Last time I checked, you can get the New Testament for free!"},{"rating":"2","title":"23 Minutes in Hell","review":"This book draws attention to what the Bible/God says about Hell. Hell is a real, horrible place for all who reject Jesus Christ and the salvation he provided for mankind by dieing on the cross for our sins. He went to hell for us and suffered so we don't have to. Bill Wiese's experience lines up with the Word of God. It is an awesome book and I recommend it for everyone that has not yet confessed Jesus as their Lord and Savior. It's also great for the person who is \\"saved\\" because you will appreciate and be so much more grateful for your salvation through Jesus Christ. Those who believe in Jesus as their Lord and Savior don't have to fear hell but those who reject Christ need to seriously think about where they want to spend their eternity. This book will definitely help you make a wise and educated choice. My prayer is that you will \\"Choose Life\\" through Jesus Christ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fizzle","review":"The title was intriguing. However the book was not. I have no problem with the belief in Hell. I think its there. I did not get a sense of it from this read. The second half was quite laborious.

That said, there are aspects (despite his quoting from scripture and theologians) that don't ring true from my reading, and the reliance on KJV quotes undercuts the supporting scriptures -- KJV is hardly a reliable translation no mattter how much I enjoy the sound of the KJV. All in all, worth a look if one is so inclined."},{"rating":"1","title":"propaganda","review":"Not only is it unoriginal (have any of you ever read any decent literature, Dante maybe?), it is uninspired.

If it is true as this author says that God sent him to hell so he can experience it to tell others why then does people have to pay to hear the message God wants them to hear? What this means is chances of a homeless person on the street being able to get this message are slim to none.

I am a Christian , but had never thought of Hell in such a grafic and scary term. I mean I knew it was a terrible place I did not want to go or want anyone else to go , but never imagined it was this terrible. This man is very humble and gives all accounts to what the Bible says. After having been to such a place , why on earth would he lie and take the chance of God's rebuke on his life. NO, I do belive his account, anyway he is not pointing to himself all through the book. He is pointing to Gods word and what it says.This has really given me a greater burden to share The Gospel and to do it as often as I can and quickly. So many Bible prophecies are to this day ,coming to pass the Lord could return at any moment . We who are of Jesus must be ready and share while there is still time.God Bless this man for writing this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Biblical at all.","review":"I am sorry I purchased this. I discovered later that this was not a \\"real\\" experience of hell from God. The Bible is clear that those on earth are given only His Word concerning hell - and that is sufficient - and does not pick out people to \\"test\\" it out. You can't go until you are there for eternity. God has already told us.As earnest as this author may have been when he wrote this book, he has been deluded into thinking it was real. It was nothing more than a nightmare. This audio book is destined for the trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"What?","review":"Obviously because he says that he went to hell in an out-of-body experience makes it absolutely true despite the fact that nobody can confirm or deny that it actually happened."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sacreligious","review":"Although I am no Bible scholar or theologian after only reading the first few pages of this book I could tell it was one of the most Biblicaly inaccurate books ever published. I find it ironic that on the night he compares the So. CA sunset to being heaven on earth he has an \\"experience\\" taking him to hell. Maybe he just drove to far and ended up in Nevada? I think he has baked his brain in the So CA desert to long and I can't believe people would believe Jesus would use a realator to deliver His message that can be found in any Bible.

It really opens your eyes and makes you appreciate The Lord's love and forgiveness of our sins."},{"rating":"2","title":"hmm..","review":"I, like the person under me, also finished this book in two sittings. This book will make you think. Many times while reading it, I was a bit skeptical as to if it was just a dream, or if it really happened to this man. I have to remind myself that with God all things are possible. However, there are false teachers in the world, so we have to read books such as this with discernment. But overall, the guy seemed pretty believable. And even if it's not real(which I kinda doubt..), I'd still suggest picking up this book. It's a quick read, and pretty interesting. You'll have to make your own conclusion on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beyond pathetic: Laughable","review":"This book should really be classified as a children's book. The only question I have is whether it belongs in the fairy tale category or ghost stories. The fact that an adult could produce such nonsense is pathetic, but even more pathetic is the fact that some people can take such things as these seriously:\\"After seeing these grotesque and deformed creatures with their jagged scales, bumps and twisted limbs, smelling their putrid, rotting odors and seeing the thick, smoke-filled atmosphere, I longed for my life back.\\"Well Bill, thanks for the many laughs. I hope you never find your sanity back when you finally wake up from this dream. I do not know what you smoked or drank that night but hell, what a 23 minutes trip!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a NEAR DEATH EXPERIENCE","review":"The author did not have a documented near death experience (NDE). A documented NDE means that a doctor pronounced or verified this person was legally dead or had died and was revived. How else can you scientifically prove to the reader the experience was real? There are other writers who have had documented \\"NDE\\" and have unbiased stories to tell about the hell experience. This author quotes scripture A LOT and how it relates to his hell or really bad dream. I personally do not believe his story. I feel I wasted my money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing but a research paper on The Bible","review":"This book is awful! I was expecting far more than a research paper on The Bible.

I'm an opened minded person and I love reading about people's personal experiences at certain particularly important moments of their lives, but this book is beyond what any \\"grounded\\" individual can accept as being even partially true!In fact, at the moment of a traumatic event, the human spirit and mind becomes instictive and does not begin to formulate ideas and recollect images and events until it has registered and understood its surroundings, none of which can occur in less than 23 minutes.I think that I would have had a better experience reading this if the author was upfront and honestly classified this as a work of fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally unbiblical","review":"It seems like Mr. Weise bought into pop culture portrayals of hell when fabricating his \\"experience\\". The hell he describes in his book is not the same hell that is described in the Bible. I also question why God would choose him to see hell in order to witness to the world, which undermines the absolute authority of the Bible as the final revelation. Either he had some sort of lucid dream or he is lying. Good intentions aside, I do not recommned this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"supernatural nonsense","review":"This book is pure dreck. I don't know if the author had a bad nightmare or just concocted the whole thing out of his imagination, but in having this published he's preying on the fears of naive and simple minds. Shameful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Janet","review":"I was very moved by this story. I agree with the author in that you don't have to believe his story. He states it is not whether you believe his story but do you KNOW for certain what will happen to you when you die. Having said that, I found the story haunting. Not because I don't know where I will be for eternity, I do know I will be in heaven as a born again Christian. What has stayed with me is what am I doing to help others make an eternal choice. The description in this book is not for the faint of heart especially if you are a Christian. If you are not, you may find it simply entertaining. But, one day, you will remember what you read and your agony will be fourfold as a result. I would recommend this book followed by the book Heaven Is For Real, a young child's story of being taken up to heaven during surgery. The two together will stay with you for a very long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"The first half of the book","review":"The first half of the book, he tells of his experience. I started to read some other reviews, but decided not to. Whether this man has an insightful imagination or this happened for real, I cannot distinguish. But, what I can affirm is some of his wording when he talks with God and how God answers him. I know this to be true. God answers before we get the question completely out. This man's claim sounds enough far fetched that it could be from God, for he works in ways in the bible that sounds illogical. One instance the walls falling down with sounds and yelling, and the walls drive themselves down into the earth instead of falling over. I think the unsaved should listen closely and repent, as for the church goers who lacks belief, I hope you're saved as well, for if one reads the bible they will find records of this man's account closely rendered as the same or close parallels."},{"rating":"2","title":"23 minutes in Hell book","review":"The book was very interesting and for a nonbeliever it should wake them up to the fact that it is a terrible place without our Lord."},{"rating":"2","title":"23 Minutes in Hell","review":"We hear a great deal about Heaven but not much about Hell.

Not only concerning the reality of hell and the lake of fire as the ultimate, eternal destiny of those who do not know Jesus as Lord--but it is also clear, that no one has ever (or could ever) return from that place and have opportunity to describe it to others.Anyone who claims to have actually been to either heaven or hell, and offers a detailed description of either place, is either mistaking a vision or dream for reality or just plain being deceptive. And thus, their 'testimony' actually detracts from the credibility of the Bible.

Say I have a piece of paper and I throw it into a fire, that piece of paper will burn until it is burned up. It is the effect of the fire that is eternal, NOT the burning. Gods heart aches over each soul that chooses a life away from Him.

Unfortunately, the author believes every word he wrote as true and tells people the experience he supposedly had is true. Such public statements make him either delusional or a fraud. Of course, we all have to take his word for it, and believe him. This book serves 2 purposes. First, it reinforces devout Christians (of course not any other religion) of the rightness of their absolute unsubstantiated faith.

Much, in fact, too much of the book is spent describing the architecture of Mont St.-Michel. That's fine if you like that sort of thing, but I did not decide to read this book for that purpose. I decided to read this book because I thought/expected (judging from the title anyway) a story of some sort was going to unfold before my eyes. I was absolutely wrong! There is some antagonism between the characters that initially makes you think the \\"story\\" is leading up to something, but it's not.

Also featuring a confusing metafictional plot, flat humor, and mostly bad acting. \\"Return\\" is yet another slasher-movie-about-slasher-movies. There were several of them made during the eighties, most of which now claim to have been the inspiration for \\"Scream.\\" None of them were as good as that movie, however, and \\"Return\\" is no exception. Although the movie has its moments -- a scene of a cop creeping down a murky hallway whereabouts the killer may be lurking is tense -- there aren't enough of them to sustain the proceedings. If you watch just to see Clooney and McCormick, be forewarned that the former gets bumped off early (first, in fact), and despite a valiant effort McCormick's cop who gets turned on by all the carnage is a joke that just doesn't work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"Horrible, to say the least.

He's irreverent almost to a fault. If you're at all insulted by an in-your-face review of life as he sees it, Bill Maher will make you gasp. To his credit, he's usually cuttingly on target and his wit and facial \\"verbiage\\" must be heard AND seen to be appreciated. He pushes his comedy to the limit and spares no one. I loved this DVD. My only reason for giving it four rather than five stars was that he seemed a little forced at times and not as comfortable with his delivery as I expected. Perhaps that's because most of my exposure to Maher has been on his TV shows, where he interacts with other notables and plays off either their intelligence and wit or their stupidity. If you enjoy a great verbal punch, watch this guy put on his discerning mental gloves and start throwing jabs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best stand-up comedian alive today!!!","review":"I saw this show when it aired on HBO and really enjoyed it. Maher had noticeably stepped it up a few notches compared to his must-see weekly show Realtime, and I didn't think it could get any better... then I saw him live last month in person for the first time. Spending two solid hours with a room full of refreshingly sane people with a great sense of humor was absolutely priceless. I've never laughed so hard and often or clapped as vigorously, and I was one of the better behaved people in the audience. I wouldn't exactly take medical advice from Bill, but he's got just about everything else figured out. If you ever get the chance, see his act in person.

The cast is variable: Clara Petrella, the \\"Duse of Opera\\", was somewhat miscast as this operas vulnerable heroine. Her voice is too mature and forceful and her attempts at characterization don't come off. She was much better portraying \\"fallen women\\" such as Nedda and Manon Lescaut. Ferruccio Tagliavini still had full control of his beautiful pianissimo and he uses it to great effect at the beginning of the love duet. At times, however, he seems to be stressed by Angelo Questa's brisk tempi. The real star of this recording is Giuseppe Taddei. He captures the essence of Sharpless and is able to scale his sizeable voice down for the intimate letter scene with Butterfly.While there is much to recommend this recording, this opera's success depends on it's heroine and, unfortunately, Petrella falls somewhat short of the mark."},{"rating":"2","title":"podra solo?","review":"El album de solista de vicentico es casi una obra maestra,aunquetiene un parecido a \\"la marcha del golazo solitario\\".No se puede evitar creer por un segundo que son ellos,ya que vicentico compuso muchos de los exitos de lfc.este album se denota por su percusion.Y guitarras marcadas, cosas que no se escuchaban en lfc.Dejo el ska,la rebeldia de lfc.Y se aprecia un vicentico mas bolerista, pasivo.Un vicentico como el de \\"basta de llamarme asi\\" ,\\"el roble\\" o \\"saco azul\\" aunque tiene sus mambos es un disco suave dejando ver el vicentico que no se conocio mucho en sus años con lfc.Pero con el mismo sabor y energia que estando al frente de lfc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Transported to Scotland","review":"First happened on Sir Walker when cruising on YouTube.

In short, 'Parallel Universe' delivers strongly. The first disc of remixes is absolutely superb, as is the second disc of six new songs. This is perhaps one of the best remix CD's ever created!

If Schwarzkopf and Merriman lack an italianate-ness of sound (a long-stading quibble about this recording in some circles), they sing well, and the interplay among ALL the singers in this most conversational of operas is lively and specific.

Why is it lesbian fiction should contain contempt for males? Are all lesbians male hating radicals. Well, none of the ones I know personally are, but to much lesbian fiction, erotic or otherwise, seems to portray this.

It's just my opinion, that's all"},{"rating":"2","title":"What a debate! I like that!","review":"Really, I never saw such a disagreeing about a record; there are only one-star or five-star reviews. Well, I bought Song X a year ago at Bonn (I payed less! Why is it so expensive in the USA?), an I didn't like it so much at first, but the longer I listened to it, the more I liked it. I won't give five stars because there are still some details I dislike, mainly the guitar synthesizer which always sounds the same (and I don't think it is an interesting sound) and that Coleman focuses so much on high notes. But Charlie Haden's bass playing is very creative, and Jack DeJohnette is one of the best drummers in the world. \\"Endangered Species\\" is so wild that you'd hardly think of Pat Metheny if you only know his PM Group recordings. It's a pity that he didn't conserve more of the style Ornette seems to have provoked him to play."},{"rating":"2","title":"song x","review":"I don't know of any other artists that could produce a free jazz album this good, particularly since Ornette Coleman originally DEFINED the standards and techniques of free playing. Pat Metheny proves an astute student who prods and encourages Ornette with some of his most melodic and alternatively ferocious playing in twenty years. This is a landmark release for both artist. With a subtle adjustment to the established criteria of harmony and melody, Ornette's theory of harmolodics makes what appear to be wild and incomprehensible structural deviations into flowing improvisations with more angular and dynamic ranges hitherto understood as possible. And what a band! Everyone pushes and paces themselves with a fever. This is truly one album that soars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love It Or Hate It ... There Is No Middle Ground","review":"As with quite a few of the other Amazon reviews of this album, I'm a fan of much of Pat Metheny's work but not this particular project.I've tried several times to get into this record and failed dismally every time.It really is a \\"Love It Or Hate It\\" record.

The picture is about as good as it would be on an average vhs tape, but the sound is sometimes muffled, sometimes echoing--so much so in parts that it sounds as if they just played the film in a big room and recorded the soundtrack with the mic on a cheap boombox. But the movie itself is very good.And to make up for the sound quality, this DVD offers an episode of Bronson's 1950's TV show, \\"Man with a Camera,\\" unavailable anywhere else (for now).So, for [price range], yes.

The words to this song/story are so engaging, they are the things that naturally catch a child's eye and ear-- windshield wipers, bus doors, baby's crying, parents shushing! My son initially enjoyed the whole book. Then, about 15 months, did not want to hear the part about the baby crying! Then resumed liking the whole book but more due to the details in the pictures. The illustrations are superb. Again, it is everything that captures a young toddlers exploration of their world--closed umbrellas opening upon raindrops falling, hands waving, money being exchanged, letters being mailed, how noise (horns, crying, hushing) can startle, capture attention, and calm. My son has pointed out the smallest details in this book...the bus being empty and full, the bus sign, the market produce, etc. I love Raffi's CD's and this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very cute book","review":"My son loves this book.

I haven't been able to read it without singing it! However, I did not care for the illustrations in this version. The style was fine - soft colors in a European city - but the content was disappointing. For example, there is a young girl with a very sour expression, sticking her tongue out at her mother and other passengers. Yuck. In addition, the baby on the bus appears to lose the pacifier in her mouth during the \\"up and down\\" and cries until Mama gives her a bottle. Shouldn't Mama be nursing her baby? With so many excellent books out there, I would skip this one and sing the song with your little one while spinning your hands around, jumping up and down, and acting out the song."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just great","review":"Excelente reloj.

But also, most men do want to step away from the unconvential, and same shaped watches. For Fossil, they've made some of the most definitive styled watches on the market. This one which feels more like a armband is actually surprising. It is convient to place on the wrist, and handles very well with the setup. I found the watch to really work very well, without any faults. What I was hoping for was the face to feel a lot more stylish. I just wasn't used to a oblong rectangle shape. I like usually the more convient rectangle face, but it does take a time to get used to. Still, if you're looking for a nice watch, try this one from Fossil.

The author's widow was deeply upset by the underhanded and cowardly introduction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written and tiring","review":"After a while, the book became the same old, same old. Whores, prostitutes, gamblers, thieves, and miscreants dot the pages. There is nothing very uplifting in the book, which makes me wonder exactly why he wrote it, other than perhaps to purge his soul of what he experienced as a child.I didn't find anything even close to the noble struggle of people in bad circumstances rising above those circumstances to become fully human in the face of wretchedness. In addition, his distaste for Christians, while honest and honestly come by (the Catholics in this book are reprehensible characters) comes out in spades.While it paints a vivid picture of the squallor of NYC at the turn of the last century, after a while all the badness gets tiring to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Taking the hype out of history","review":"This eminently readable book is a refreshing account of the events leading up to, and during, the colonial rebellion that was subsequently labelled \\"The War of Independence\\".

Having been force-fed the polarized view of the political structures of the 18th century, to find an account that points out that the rebellion was ultimately an entirely British affair, fuelled largely by greed and opportunism, is completely foreign to them.This sort of book is very important because it does not pander to the blinkered, flag-waving, Hallmark version of that period of history, but injects a much-needed reality check in case we run away with the idea that the USA was a perfect creation from that point onwards (it was 100 years behind Britain in banning slavery, for example)."},{"rating":"1","title":"The British still don't understand","review":"I was profoundly disappointed by this book. I had hoped that the book would contain insight into the thinking of members the British government about the colonies and the Revolution. Instead, I was told how the Revolutionaries were a bunch of paranoids who whined about nothing in particular and who really didn't have it bad at all under British rule. Hibbert makes no attempt to understand the ideological origins of American Revolutionary thought or the historical significance of the American Revolution and Revolutionists such as Washington, Adams, Mason, and Jefferson.

Of course things are never as shiny as one remembers them, but it is a solid book. As with many books, there are ideas and themes that I didn't recognize when reading this with a child - questions about government, war, freedom, the ethics of revenge and redemption.

This is a long book and it may seem a little daunting to finish it, but it is divided into short chapters. Readers can turn to any chapter and not feel lost at all.

The basic moves are the same, however, and Sera does a brilliant job at warming up the body and forcing the hips and the thighs to work - frankly, the 30-minute warm up is enough to do me in - ha! Asthetically, it would have been nice for the other three girls to smile as much as Sera did - but then again, I can't say I'm much of a smiler when I am working out as hard as I was. ;-)It's a good workout DVD for those who don't want to run the same belly dance DVDs over and over again. I would recommend it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great warmup, beautiful combos","review":"Sera guides you through a truly warming warmup and stretches, then does some great combos, with funky fusion moves that are really different and beautiful. Her solo performance is also beautiful. Her style is genuinely happy without being cloyingly cheerful, and so is very enjoyable.My only quibble is that the music doesn't always line up with the dance, as they were recorded separately.

The reason for ordering the test kit was to quantify and confirm what my nose and eyes told me.

I'd recommend using it with a Zune dock so any risk of damage is reduced.The car adapter was extremely flimsy and fell apart after being left in the glove box when not used.Overall if you need a quick fix and a spare Zune cable it's not to bad in that regard.

Her voice has matured considerably while the music business transformed from classic soul to hip-hop, and therefore, this gem was overlooked. If the song \\"Nobody\\" had been released during her prime, it is no doubt that it would have headed towards the upper regions of the charts. In fact, there is not a single bad cut on the cd. \\"Kiss Of a Stranger\\" is a stand out with its jazz leanings. And the cd overall focuses on ballads which is where Ms. Howard excels. Finally free of what the studio executives have tried to mold her into for years, this is her best and finest work. It was also nominated in the Best Traditional R&B album losing to Glady Knight, another true soul singer."},{"rating":"2","title":"SuPerDeLuXe","review":"I love the voice of Miki very much.

It's such a pity to have a talent like Howard wasted on such bland material and poor production. And Miki gives a lack-luster performance on every song, a far cry from the soul-stirring performances on her 80's Atlantic CDs.I know Howard has had many personal problems over the past several years. Hopefully, she will come to her senses and go with another record company who will team her with far more qualified songwriters and producers and we can once again hear the Miki Howard we all remember and loved from the 80's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excelent","review":"Las canciones son interpretadas excelentemente por alejandro, no pueden ser comparadas con las originales, son un estilo diferente, las canciones son en vivo y en el palacio de bellas artes, y eso las hace diferentes a las originales.El primer cd es buenisimo, pero el segundo esta excelente, si te gusta la musica mexicana y la quieres escuchar no solo en pedas, adquiere este cd, en el tiangas o donde quieras. muy recomendable"},{"rating":"2","title":"the best singer","review":"Alejandro Fernandez is the best singer in Mexico right now, es el mejor cantante de ranchero que hay, bueno afortunadamente contamos con la presencia de vicente fernandez todavia, pero cantantes contemporaneos, alejandro es el mejor y este disco es una prueba de ello, me gustaria que existiera el dvd de este concierto en bellas artes, I\`d love that this concert in bellas artes will be available someday"},{"rating":"1","title":"where is it?","review":"I cannot review what I never recieved even if I was charged for it.

This may not seem like a problem at first, but for those of us that don't have photographic memories, constantly flipping from the front of the book to the back of the book is a real pain. It really becomes a problem in some of the more hectic situations in the game. Other than the map/walkthrough thing, this is a really well-done guide. If you can get past it's one flaw, then I definitely suggest you go and get this guide."},{"rating":"2","title":"Be prepared...read this book.","review":"Don't get frustrated when you read this book. As you read it you will either think that you need to start church all over again or that it is impossible to do the things he asks. Malphurs is simply pointing out the things that will help make a healthy church and that it might take time...in fact it will take time either with a new church or an established church.

Advanced Strategic Planning does little more than lay out the basics of strategic planning; issues of greater consequence are left untouched. Dealing with entropy in an organization is a serious issue that Malphurs seems to believe goes away if one's vision/goals/strategy are rightly aligned. I was disappointed with this book. Better to wait for Post-Advanced Strategic Planning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Treatment of Strategic Planning for Churches","review":"I've read some of the negative reviews listed for this title, and I must strongly disagree. Malphurs' work here is the best treatment of strategic planning for churches I have found to date. In place of the term \\"advanced\\" in the title, a better word would be \\"comprehensive.\\" Nonetheless, Malphurs here provides a handbook addressing church planning that is unrivaled today in breadth and insight.As a pastor of twenty years, I wish this book had been available when I first started in ministry. I hope this title is now offered in many seminaries, because its content would be a gold mine for young, soon-to-be church leaders. Pastors, church staff members, and lay leaders, this volume is a must-have. In my opinion, it is required reading for anyone involved in church leadership."},{"rating":"2","title":"They were NOT amused - but, I was!","review":"My goodness - don't be put off by the title.

Very entertaining, very tongue in cheek. Great beach reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointing","review":"The author develops a series of ideas about ethical and moral issues in a very shallow unsystematic way.

Well, her sound is distinctive, though at times you might be reminded of Gloria Estefan, Patty Smythe, or Marcia Ball. Besides great vocals, this CD is full of great songwriting (Carolyne wrote many of the songs by herself, and co-wrote the others), fine arrangements, and nice instrumentation.Some of my favorite tracks are \\"In the Rain,\\" \\"Tired of Me,\\" and \\"Till the Next Time.\\" Those are the ones stuck in my head since I bought the CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is the bomb !","review":"This book deals with everyday life situations such as racisim and trying to get out of poverty.

The fact that they all were worried more about the money and what they wanted to do with thier share instead of being concerned for the grandmother and her wishes.

She does not have as many lines as Mama, Ruth, or Walter, but you can tell that the storyline of the play revolves around her. This book is touching, but certainly never borring.

For the money it is a good buy considering you are getting a knife and multitool for close to the price of a multitool alone. The one-handed opening action on the knife was a bit sticky to start, but works well after a bit of practice. I found the knife to be fairly dull out of the box, but nothing a good sharpener won't fix. I also like the locking mechanism on the knife from a safety standpoint, but you better not be a fingernail biter if you ever plan to get it closed again since it takes a strong fingernail to push down on the release mechanism. The pliers on the multitool are excellent and spring loaded to stay in the open position when at rest. Again, I found the other tools on the Clutch a bit difficult to pull out without a good fingernail. Luckily I am not a \\"nervous\\" person so I did okay, but be warned if you are.

Bookchin & Schumacher succeed not only in piecing the history of SV40 research together to create a coherent narrative, but I had no trouble following their abstracts of the scientific research.The only thing that bugs me about their approach was how they consistently fell back on stereotypes to characterize the players involved. Sabin and Salk are both characterized as \\"bad guys,\\" which can get pretty old after several chapters. The book would have been better to leave the reader to discern the characters of the men and women by their actions. Equally annoying was the presentation of Michele Carbone as an Italian racial stereotype. It did not improve my read of the book to be subjected to such nuggets as how Carbone has a capuccino every day at 10:30.

He goes on to reference Washington D.C., The Smithsonian, Sam Vaughn, Virgil himself and other things that have nothing to do with the actual work; this creates a meaningless time-void/warp within work. In the preface/introduction, Slavitt boosts of his trailblazing taking-of-liberties; this is just self-congradulatory. His justification for distorting it all was to get school kids to read it.

They are both in their 90's and as feisty and loving as can be. In a book full of wisdom, humor, and yes, recipes, there is a lingering sense of mortality as both bubbes tell their tales and wonder when death will claim them.

I was expecting an Audubon-style reference book, but got a simpler, very brief, nothing new, thin, magazine-sized tickler. I've heard good things about Stokes, but this book wasn't a winner. Was looking for more details about plantlife, positioning of shrubs, feeders, bird baths, landscaping etc, but book consisted more of bios on birds with a little bird-feeding info. at the beginning of the book.

But wow, was I not disappointed. In fact I think this is even better. It's just absolutely brilliant. In fact I get quite upset when an episode comes to an end because we have to wait a whole week before we find out what happens next. We're obviously behind in the U.K. with the series, but I don't mind. I have to restrain myself though not to 'peek' via Google by venturing across the 'pond' to see what happens in the weeks ahead. Long may it continue..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Video on Demand is perfect!","review":"I must express my extreme satisfaction with Amazon's Video on Demand (VOD). Thanks to VOD, I was able to catch the entire 1st season of the 2010 V series, all at just $1.99 per episode. I know what you're thinking: why not just catch the missed episodes for free on abc.com. Well, if you don't catch the missed episodes within a certian period of time, they are no longer on the abc website for viewing. This was the case with me. How happy I was to see that Amazon had the VOD for the V Season 1 series. The quality of VOD is wonderful! No buffering like you would experience with youtube, and the picture quality was superb - crisp clear picture (and this was the regular mode, not HD mode).As far as the V 2010 Season 1: Only the best series on network TV today!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The new V series.","review":"I'm loving the new V. Anna is wickedly deceptive while being sexy at the same time. Father Jack reminds everyone of their humanity. Ryan shows what a V with emotions is like. Hobbes brings everyone in focus while adding humor. Erika makes tough choices and tries to protect her son. Lisa is pretty and innocent as she grows more emotional. Erika's son reminds everyone of their youth and choices to be made. The suspense and story lines are keeping up with today's world. Everything seems more believable. I strongly recommend people watch this show. I think it's better than the original, especially the special effects."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Remaking of V","review":"All I have to say is that I love it, love it, and totally love this re-imaging of the original series \\"V\\" that was brought out in the early 80s! The re-imaging is dark, scary, and the plot is strong, and the actor, and actresses are totally into their parts. I place this remake of the show right up there with the re-imaging of Battlestar Galactic. It's that good in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Promising Sci-Fi Series","review":"I thought this got off to a good start. The hook here is that the public is for the most part completely deluded by these beautiful aliens carrying gifts (think of the Trojan Horse updated) while only a few suspect that they are covering up their real looks and intended deeds. The beauty factor, the free medical care and cures, the free gadgets and gifts, this all opens up some interesting story lines about people's weaknesses. I think this series will either get really, really good from this point forward or it will get terribly cliched and go straight down the tubes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tragedy","review":"This show had so much promise. Sure some of the characters were dreadful in dialogue. Yes, you could tell things were off to a slow start. But when the V first hit Earth it's all very exciting. Then the show was thrown into a pile of trash, and is generally not worth watching. I recommend watching the series until the V introduce themselves on the giant undership screens, then hit your foot with a hammer, and save yourself the time of watching anything further."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow and Lack Content","review":"I've watched every episodes but the show still has not got to the point. The old 80's one is about WWII Nazi invasion. District 9 is about an actual event in Africa. Independent Day is about unity. The old Star Trek is about Plato and Shakespeare. The new Star Trek is about Freud and Young. (I am just making this up.) This is 2010. What is this new V? It seems to me that the writers haven't figured out what story they want to tell yet. The entire season one is like a Beta version. Nothing is set. I feel like they want to try out what rating they can get from this brand before ABC can give them a ok to go all out. So far, I feel like they want to call their book \\"V\\" but they haven't come up with a thesis of this book yet.So, the CG is very very good but season one doesn't have any meat IMO.I hope season two start to pick up some pace."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just another recap.","review":"4 shows then a long wait. when I got the email that a new show was in my unbox I rushed to download it only to find this sorry excuse of a show."},{"rating":"1","title":"No closed captioning.

I missed the beginning of the Episode 2 Season 2 and decided to watch it online as usual when i come to find out that they removed it and now you have to pay to amazon in order to watch. I think it is just a dirty move to make money. I will try to watch it on TV but i still think that this was a bad move from ABC. Most of their shows are always free watch on demand online.Really disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor writing causes the show to drag","review":"As a household of sci-fi fans, we tried several times to get into this show. but it is incredibly boring, despite the potential. Nothing ever seems to happen. There's no suspense, no surprise, no twists, nothing scratches the surface. Their attempts at plot twists are ho-hum, and I've never once found myself thinking \\"I wonder what will happen next?\\" because I know that every time I tune in, three things will be true: 1) The Visitors are evil (blatantly so; no shades of gray here), 2) They're trying to lull humanity into a false sense of security, and 3) There is a resistance. Everything else just feels like it was thrown in to have something happen, but it really doesn't have any relevance to what's going on.The acting is pretty good but you really can't connect with any of the characters. There's nothing there to relate to, nothing to grab you and suck you in."},{"rating":"2","title":"V: The Complete First Season","review":"My husband and I actually like this series.

They have been thrown in from your poor crime drama 101 school. Jeez doesnt anyone have a new idea anymore!? I actually feel kind of bad because 2 of the actors from the movie SERENITY (a very good and fairly fresh Sci-Fi movie) Morena Baccarin and Alan Tudyk are in it so I had some hope for it. They are the only reason why I am giving it 2 stars instead of 1.The original was very good for a TV miniseries but this is just bad... cheaply and brainlessly created. If you are a true Sci-Fi fan avoid this and just rewatch the original. However ... If you like CSI and other conveniently sculpted weekly crime dramas this may be your cup of tea."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW. best show on TV","review":"This is the only series that I HAVE to watch, I would like to personally thank the writers for doing such an incredible job. There could not be a more perfect actress for the role of the mother V than Morena Baccarin. I am hooked on this show"},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply a poorly written story.","review":"The story of V does not adapt well. The dialogue is at parts very boring. The teenage love interest is very, well dry and stereotypical of a teenage drama. The teenage drama often detracts from the main story line. It tries to create a 24 sense of urgency at times, but fails. I could explain more, but bottom line there are far better choices out there. Season two barely made it from being canceled. Do not expect a third season."},{"rating":"2","title":"excillerating, captivating and frustrating.","review":"This book was one that I finished in one night. I couldn't put it down, the action, the drama, and it was all true. It made me feel angry and upset that young girls were living a life that had no future. Growing up in Canada I was not faced with gangs in school or in my neighborhood but this book made me realize that gang activity is everywhere, it just depends on whether you turn your head to the violence or open up and see it for what it is. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to join a gang or is just interested in the subject, it is a true to life horror story which shouldn't be missed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pop culture, sociology, and razorblade wielding chicks","review":"From the opening scene, I was hooked. The earth shaking stories of girls and women in the hardest life. Sikes has an eye for detail and excellent foccus in her narative. From razor blades hidden in mouths to dead beat dads, its an important study in sociology and in human pop culture. Read it twice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it and I'm not even finished","review":"This book is one of the most engrossing books I've read in a long time. Rarely do I come across a book that keeps me up so that I don't want to sleep! I'm not even finished yet but can't wait to get to the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Realistic Depiction of Girls in Trouble","review":"I found this book haunting in its realism and its effect has stayed with me. Sikes obviously got immersed in the lives of these teenagers and cares about them. She also makes it clear that the authorities do not. I found it provoking that most anti-gang social services are directed at boys. It made me feel that there is a lot we should be doing to intervene and make the opportunities for inner-city girls better. I would recommend the book to anyone interested in social commmentary or the lives of women."},{"rating":"2","title":"8 Stars for 8 Ball","review":"As someone who's had no personal experience with female ganglife, I was shocked to learn of the horror and sadness that these chicks face everyday. Sike's interviews reveal in a heartfelt and sympathetic manner a part of American culture that few understand. Each lady gangsters' fantastic but true stories read like a novel. By the end, I could better understand their plight. People from any background, as long as they have a heart, will love this book.Nathaniel (New York)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent peek inside female gangs","review":"I loved reading this book! I felt it was very detailed and informative on expressing the activities and mentalities of females who are involved in the gang lifestyle. I highly recommend this book!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"There is nothing insightful in this book.Gini Sikes basically tells the stories of a few women who made bad choices and then blamed everyone but themselves for the outcomes of those choices.The book bogs down only a quarter of the way through it and never recovers.It is monotonous and tough to get to the end.I would probably rather listen to a scratched Wham CD or eat a huge bowl of brussel sprouts than have to read this again.Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"were they pulling her leg?","review":"First and foremost,the chick on the cover looks like Divine in \\"Desparate Living\\". Second, I never felt like Gini Sikes got a real feel for her topic - she reminded the reader repeatedly of her strong education and solid middle class upbringing, and i always got the sense that these 8 ball chicks and the male gang members were trying to impress her with their badness, and were exaggerating their stories incredibly. Sikes never seemed to know what was truth and what was hyperbole. with a topic like this, you at lest have to have a pretty good idea. Her bad girls were not clearly and vividly drawn, and her bad boys were down right one dimensional.The lack of realism was astonishing. Very, very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wildly mediocre","review":"I thought I was going to love this album based on the singles \\"Fill Me In\\" and \\"Seven Days\\". Friends in the UK were raving about Craig David, particularly his 2-step track \\"Re-Wind\\" and I was eagerly awaiting the US release of his album. Little did I know that \\"Re-Wind\\" is a limpid mess and the rest of the album is padded with lowest-common-denominator fill-in-the-blank faux-soul. Nothing else on the album evokes the passion or bounce of the two lead singles. It's a shame; had the other tracks even been half as good, this would have been a decent album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy It","review":"At last this album gets an offical release in America, and about time too.From the opening track Fill Me In to the last track Rewind its easy to see why he has had huge suces in the Uk and the rest of Europe. Born To Do It contains loads of excellent songs like Fill Me In (number 1 in the UK), 7 Days (number 1 in the UK), Walking Away (top 5 in the UK), Rendevous (top 10 in the UK and one of my favourite tracks), Booty Mann and Last Night. Craig has managed to produce the perfect debut album that many people like and have congratulated him on.

Craig David, however, does not. I find the melodies boring and repetitive and some of the lyrics are unintelligible. After a couple of songs it becomes painful to listen! The worst album of the year so far? Quite possibly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow! Born to Ruin It!","review":"WOW! Another One-Hit-Wonder! Craig David has done an amazing job of taking a great song like \\"Fill Me In\\" and adding on 13 other \\"songs\\" that don't do anything but pull this album to the floor. The 2-step (UK Garage) styles shown in \\"Fill Me In\\" are unique, but never repeated, and the rest of the album is merely half sewn-together wanna-be R&B songs.Another annoying thing that you can notice when listening to this album is how in EVERY SINGLE SONG there is a little muffled \\"craig david\\" just to remind you who made the horrible little ditty that you are wasting your time listening to.I think that this album is a true waste of plastic and paper. had it never been made, i would have saved money, time and the energy that it took me to write this article."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Awful","review":"This kind of rubbish sums up whats wrong with music today.I would love to \\"fill him in\\" on how bad he really is.Avoid at all costs"},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally in the U.S.!","review":"I have loved Craig David since I went to Germany last August.

I didn't know who he was until I went to Las Vegas and heard he was doing a concert and was nominated for a Grammy. I immediately bought tickets for the concert and bought the CD. I knew his hit song \\"Fill Me In\\" before I purchased the CD but I didn't know he was the artist. I fell in love with all of his songs. I especially love \\"Booty Man\\" for its slow sexy rhythms and \\"Once In a Lifetime\\" because I could really relate to the song. I have no complaints about the CD at all except that I wish there were more tracks and i can't wait until his next CD comes out.

I can't get this damn thing out of my mind. I wish I had it this together when I was 20.The man's vocal talents are obvious; he can swing, sing, rap, and flow with considerable ease. What matters at the end of the day, of course, are the songs. On this score, CD gets an 8.5 out of 10 in my book.Craig David already gets Kudos for simply being intelligent enough to recognize that good songwriting is the foundation of the house; his efforts in developing his skills in this area are quite manifest, and it is a beautiful thing to see somebody hungrily training and developing his talent.Then it becomes a matter of execution. The production team on this effort has done a terrific job.The best debut in years, and certainly the best R&B debut since Maxwell's Urban Hang Suite."},{"rating":"2","title":"Craig David CD","review":"I loved to listen to this CD until my granddaughter \\"borrowed\\" it.

If you like R&B/Hip-Hop/Pop or anything like that, I recommend this CD to you. It will be totally worth your $$. His music is unique, and a nice change from the usual stuff that is out right now.

It has so many different types of songs that no two songs neither sound the same nor are truly from the same genre. What is great about this CD is that it does not stick to a certain 14 track R&B formula or a 14 track Dance album. It is a combination of garage, dance, R&B, and even a little hip-hop. I would go so far as saying that this might be the best CD ever released."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fill me in....I was disappointed","review":"I got this CD used, so its not like it was a big loss anyway. I was really a fan of \\"Fill Me In\\" when it came out. I thought the sound was interesting, here is a gorgeous guy who can sing for sure but the rest of the album fell flat on its face. I thought all the songs sounded exactly the same, there was no diverseness in the lyrics, and overall, kind of a snore fest. I ripped a few songs that I liked on to my computer to use to play in a shuffle with other stuff and then I resold it, but listening to this album front to back just isn't happening and it's certainly not worth keeping in my collection. It's far too \\"slow jam\\" style for me, which I do not like in the slightest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is THIS what passes for soul music?!","review":"Somebody please bring back old school for those of us over 40 who would like to buy music, and who are financing the 20-year-olds buying this tripe.

I saw him do a P.A., and, no doubt, the confidence is there, but, as with Robbie Williams, it takes more than confidence to be real innovater. A celebrity, maybe. But I have no interest in these Dido, Coldplay types. It's theatrics and image, and a clever marketing strategy that make's it happen. Those record sales are what has killed off the music biz and allowed braindead entities, who by rights should stick to being lifeguards or working in suntan shops, to just run around thinkin their the dogs bollocks.

With all the hype surrounding it's release I expected something better.It really sounds like standard radio fare and he failed to live up to his potential.He sounds too much like a english Jon B.I am pretty sure this will be a sucessful debut because he has the formula down pat.After the first listen, I hoped maybe It would grow on me but, each time I play It I find myself not being able to listen any whole song.It seems as though he held back In order to get a hit.Anyway, It's a waste of time and a very average cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite talented, if a bit immature","review":"I was first introduced to this album in Europe where Craig David is getting the kind of recognition I believe he deserves. This debut album serves primarily to showcase what David is capable of--a consumate work it is not--but a fantastic first effort, none the less. His \\"smooth as velvet\\" R&B vocals are offset by an unimposing and tasteful rythym track. Great for soft-core R&B fans. If you're all-out crazy about any particular genre of music, this CD is probably not for you. The lyrics generally lean towards triteness; if you're over the \\"let's party\\" phase, you probably won't find much of interest in anything Craig David has to say. I highly anticipate David's sophmore release. I would, however, suggest he bring a little life experience--and a good lyricist--along for the ride."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME!!!","review":"This is an amazing cd.

It's incredible!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the best, but some standout material","review":"When I bought this CD, I didn't know what to expect. I had heard his first single, \\"Fill Me In,\\" and it had grown on me, so I thought I would check it out. After giving it a full listen, I found myself pleasantly surprised. It was actually pretty good although the low points often outweigh the high points when it comes down to it. Tracks like \\"Fill Me In\\" and \\"7 Days\\" are definitely great tracks, but one track had a significant meaning to me that gave this cd a four star rating. That track was \\"Walking Away.\\" I think any person that has ever been fed up with all their relationship problems and cannot find happiness in it no matter what they do should listen to this track. It has some very good advice in the lyrics, just walk away. \\"Once In A Lifetime\\" was pretty good too, but I skip over it occasionally. The rest of the album is forgettable to me, but what is good on this album makes it worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really born to do it","review":"Finally! A musical artist who's lyrics aren't filled with curse words or any degrading remarks to any race or gender, and still his music speaks. His smooth sound, mixed with a little funk creates the perfect record. Though he hails from Great Britain, it hasn't handicapped his ability to plug into American women and what we like: a gentleman's perspective. An exciting twist on the common flavour of most records: his lyrics tell women what men like, and how we please men, not filled completely with arrogant rhymes about how men can be so pleasing to ladies. The music, though strong, doesn't overcompensate his beautiful vocals. A definite must have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smooth, Sexy, Sounds","review":"Each time I listen to this CD I am so glad I purchased it. His voice and his words move me into a very relaxed mood. My favorite songs are 01-Fill Me In- 03- Rendezvous 04- 7 Days 05- Follow Me 08- Last Night 12 Once in a Lifetime. These song will get anyone in to a romantic mood. His lyrics make me want to dance and be romanced - Definately a must have after a long day at work or from class. His music is a mix of upbeat sounds and smooth relaxed melodies. I would recommend this CD -**God Bless America and all the People in the World Trade Center Terrorist Attack**"},{"rating":"2","title":"BORN TO DO IT RIGHT!!!","review":"This is a great album. I liked \\"Fill Me In\\" when I heard the single so I bought the album (less than 2 weeks ago). It was well worth it. Since then, I must have listened to it over 20 times. Craig David has a different sound that many people will find enjoyable. My favorite songs are \\"Rendezvous\\", \\"7 Days\\", \\"Can't Be Messing 'round\\", \\"Follow Me\\", \\"Walking Away\\", etc....I might as well say that all the songs are my favorites. I fell in love with his CD even more when I saw him at SummerStage in Central Park last week. He is even better live; even if you don't dance, you will be bopping your head to the songs. If there were a 10 star rating this review would have it. ** Anyone who buys this CD will enjoy it tremendously, not only for his terrific vocals but also for his creativeness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!!","review":"I thought the CD was one of the best I've ever listened to he's cute and he's got lots of talent, One of the best songs is \\"7 Days.\\" I recommend for everyone to go out and buy this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album!","review":"This is one of the best CD's I got in a long time.

His voice is smooth yet unique, and his style of R&B is one of a kind. The first single \\"Fill Me In\\" is already getting a lot of airplay, but I predict that it will be a HUGE hit in the next month or so. It is my favorite track on the CD, but I also like his ballads and the other dance tunes. This is a great CD to pop in while driving to work or to listen to to make your job less boring. I find myself dancing around through most of the songs because the beats are infectious. I would recommend this CD to any fan of R&B or pop music. You won't be disappointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not good","review":"Completely dissatisfied! First the case was cracked in three different places.

There is a good mix of R&B, garage, and a little hip-hop. His voice is smooth and you can feel the soul in his music. Fill Me In is the best song on his album. Follow Me is the song I like least, although its still enjoyable to listen to. Time to Party has a very steady beat and is very good to dance to. Walking Away is very nice, 'cuz he's walking away from all his troubles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Born To Do It For A Long Time","review":"I am from the UK. Born To Do It has been out for just under 2 yrs now, but I still listen to it every day, no exaguration. every single track is catchy, and there are no album fillers at all on Born To Do It. My personal standout track is You KNow What-a midtempo R&B track, which could just as easily come from the lips of such experienced singers as Usher or 112, showing Craig's maturity at such a young age (18-19 when written). Craig David will have a very hard time topping Born To Do It, but I know he will manage-he IS Born To Do It, remember!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Like the other guy said","review":"I bought it for a dollar at Best Buy.

When will it end? With the help of big name producers, he's churned out a hit album. What a surprise. You can take a virtually untalented person and do the same if you get the right producers. \\"Like I Love You\\" is your typical Michael Jackson impersonation. \\"Cry Me A River\\" would've sounded great with any other vocalist but Justin's whines butcher it. And then you have \\"Rock Your Body\\" which is an annoying cross between Michael Jackson's \\"Rock With You\\" and \\"Too Close\\" by Next but yet no surprise, radio plays it to madness. Yet again, an album proving it's all about a pretty face and the right producers which would be somewhat forgivable if the guy had a decent voice. Please don't buy this.

I don't mind his dancing--which is what he should have stuck to doing all the while, but as a singer, he's a joke.And now's begun hinting at sex........weeeelllll is that JT's attempt to convince me he's a normal hetrosexual?

I will come back to this review in a minute... I have to throw up thinking about them...I am back. I threw up. Thats not disgusting though. Justin Timberlake's lyrics are. I mean, listen to him. His lyrics paint very violent images in my mind. I had nightmares about them. One of the sickest songs on this album, 'I just want to love you',is about a very sick subject that I cant say because I dont want you to throw up like I did. This album is brilliant though.

No one likes justin or cares for him, people I encounter in the younger crowd like Usher more than Justin, and some appreciate michael jackson too as a musician, Justin is a nobody! And if he was really all that and proved to be a mainstay, why did this CD sell barely 3 million copies and only peaked at #2 on Billboard 200 despite all the hype at the time of the release? If he was really all that, he would have sold much more than N Sync's No Strings Attached which is at 11 million copies, it's so obvious.

I don't know about you, but it's certainly not my fault that Justin Timberlake sounds like a barking Chihuahua. His songs were better than they were with N*Sync. I can't believe what happened to him. He used to be singing about good relationships with girls and now he's going into sex, and what's all this [stuff] about \\"I'll have you naked by the end of this song\\"?!

The lyrics on here are totally original and obviously heartfelt. It must have taken the people who wrote them years. I also can't belive how hard Justin is. I'm pretty sure he grew up in Compton or something, because he is just one tough dude. What I wouldn't give to be as \\"pimpin'\\" as he is.

There are a few good songs on here, but nothing that really captures my attention. Senorita has to be one of the stupidest songs I've ever heard. Justin got a big head after his N'Sync departure. His talent was showcased much better back then, although Justin insists that he's so much better off without the rest of the guys and his material is 10 times better.

The first things that somebody associates Justin with are, #1. Pop and bubble gum sweetness. #2. Micheal jackson wannabe. Justin may have been pop with Nsync but he's not anymore. Nsync's last album, celebrity was taking them away from the likes of O-Town and placing them in a space between the pop world and urban music. He may sound a bit like Mike on a song like Nothin' else but he is not a wannabe.Are you going to associate every white male with a high pitched voice with Micheal Jackson?The album was very well crafted, with beats from Timbaland, The Neptunes and the underdogs the album completely rocked. The lyrics were also a big help, there were very daring times like in Right for me (when you took my hand up so calm/ touched it to your cherry lip balm/ a million nasty things went through my mind)The album has taken a few turns from the usual but I would advise you to pick up s copy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Justin: the new Michael?","review":"I am not a fan of pop music because most pop tends to .... However, the boys from N*Sync almost hit something with their last disc, bringing back the style of funky pop, but falling just short of a creative break-through. Justin Timberlake, backed by the boys of the Neptunes, almost breaks that barrier once again, but making a much deeper dent. With his solo debut, Timberlake fashions an excellent blend of hip-hop and pop that harkens back to the pinnacle of the great Michael Jackson's recordings. His tight harmonies and often funky beats bring even the most staunchly anti-pop listener to head bop. High points of the album include the bouncy \\"Right for Me\\", \\"Senorita\\", and the bitter, \\"Cry Me A River.\\" Don't fault the guy for his past, because he may have a very creative future.R.I.Y.L.: Michael Jackson, Stevie Wonder, N*Sync's \\"Pop\\", Musiq, Raphael Saadiq"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Justine to Me!!","review":"This album is not what I expected...in a strange way all the songs seem to relate to Britney...and who cares about there relationship....Justin is so talented and I just expected so much more from him...I must say I am hurt by the outcome of this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"a mixed bag","review":"Justin Timberlake's first solo album is, I have to say, a bit of a dissapointment. There is a few great tracks on this album but they are outwayed by the series of bland and sometimes annoying songs that make up the majority. The tracks that were released as singles, 'Like I love you', 'Cry me a River', and 'Rock your Body' are by far the best on the album, 'Rock your Body' actually being one of the best songs released by any artist in the past months, but unfortunity these tracks are the only highlights on the album. The exception to this is 'Take me Now', a collaberation with superstar Janet Jackson , which is a break from the HUm-Drum of most of the albums non released tracks.Overall, I would have to tell Justin to stick to his boy band day job."},{"rating":"2","title":"JT has got it going on!!!!","review":"Justified is one of the best CD's I have ever heard in my life and it really goes to show how very talented Justin Timberlake is.

This CD should definately help to brak him out of the boy band mode for everyone who hears it and make people take him seriously as a performer and as an artist. To coin a phrase from Revlon, don't hate him because he's beautiful!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money just because you like N'Sync","review":"I am a fan of N'Sync so I thought that I would like this CD, especially when several people compared it to the older stuff by Michael Jackson. WRONG!!! There is one song on the CD that is good but the rest is trash. I don't know where he went wrong with all of the help he had but he should just stick to N'Sync. He has a nice voice but this doesn't work at all. Don't waste your money buying this unless it is a used one and you spend next to nothing, or better yet just buy his single."},{"rating":"2","title":"WoW what an album","review":"Justin was amazing in this album. Very emotional and I just loved his voice. His songs make you want to get up and dance, or even make you burst into tears because you can actually connect to it. This was a great solo album, I have no doubt in my mind that he will make it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Justin Justifies himself with solo debut","review":"Justin Timberlake of Nsync fame released Justified yesterday. I of course bought it. Like I love you spent weeks in my head and I just had to buy the cd. It's nothing like the bubblegum pop that he is internationally known for singing..in fact it is very grown up. The work on this album has more of an urban/r&b/ hip-hop feeling to it. It's cool that Justin was able to do this, and I am certain that his album sales will do well.My favorite songs off of Justified were Senorita, Cry me a River, and Never Again. Never Again is quite \\"moving\\" and I swear that at the end of the track he is crying. Great CD. Go buy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mmm...","review":"Worth pondering for a second, is Justin Timberlake a great singer and performer. Mmmm... I Wonder... NO. No, he is a rip-off, albeit a good one, good enough for people to buy his CD. He is a complete copy of Michael Jackson. But Michael Jackson wrote and performed good music. Justin Timberlake could never come up with classics such as Billy Jean or Thriller, he comes up with stereotypical pop music like everyone else. There's nothing special about this guy, he can't sing, Cry Me A River has some horrible, whiny vocals and occasinonally in some songs he tries to beat box, what a fool! Sure he can dance, but thats the end to his talents. Maybe he'd be better as a dancer in theatre somewhere, but just please not on my TV! Sorry Justin, you're 'good looks' and 'personality' don't fool me, go off and dance somehwere, have I justified my opinion?"},{"rating":"1","title":"what the f.....","review":"this is one of the worst male artists i've EVER heard...he has absolutly no talent....i wish i could rate him a -26 cuz i would....he sounds so much like a girl that when he comes on the radio i think hes britney spears(who i might add sux as well...except for her song Toxic) but i have no clue why any record company would even sign him to their label....he's good if ur 7 or 8 yrs old but if u want REAL music listen to linkin park.....in other words ....JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE SUX!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment","review":"First off let me say that I have been counting down the days until Justified came out. I'm a huge fan of NSYNC and Justin as well, and was looking forward to hearing what he could do on his own. \\"Like I Love You\\" had my hopes up, but when I listened to the CD I was very disappointed, to say the least ... It was all I could do to get through the whole CD, and my recommendation is to listen to some samples before you buy this CD.

Until the Superbowl, with the one and only Janet Jackson (yay...) and the whole 'malfunction', and then we relaized he has issues. Some of his songs I can listen to, but they annoy me so bad. So, one day me and my friend went outside with a pair of goggles and smashed the CD...how good it felt.

With the exception of 3 songs, it's pretty [darn] impressive. I like it. It's apparent that his label invested BIG bucks for top producers and writers--the lyrics are tight--the vocals are tight, and the beats are tighter. You have to look at it from a content perspective, given all of the \\"clone\\" acts we have out here. He has truly redeemed himself from that gimmicky boy-band [stuff]. I'd say that the album probably went platinum, or will soon, provided that more of the better songs are played on air. He has a VERY broad fan base--women of all ethnicities love him, which is more that can be said about a lot of soloists out there because they tend to cater to one type audience--image and music wise. I give it 5 stars-you GO boy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Justified? Wrong Title...","review":"I had an unfortunate opportunity to listen to this album. I gave it a chance. I kept an open mind and I'm sorry but this album is [without merit]. I don't know why he's been getting that much recongnition, he doesn't deserve it. You could easily tell [his style is similar to MJ]. If I wanna hear MJ, I'll listen to the REAL MJ. The Neptunes and Timbaland are overused, and the quality of the album is evidence. The songs go from bad to worse. The same sounds are tiring..."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Justified\\" is NOT worth your money!!","review":"I really liked Justin's single \\"Like I Love You\\" after I saw the music video for it on TV. I thought his \\"new sound\\" was kinda cool. So when his new CD \\"Justified\\" came out, I went out and bought it. Big mistake. It totally [is bad]. It was a total waste of money to purchase that CD. I think that Justin needs to stick with 'N Sync and \\"pop\\" music. It's what he's good at. Hip Hop is just not his thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"very creative, NOT!","review":"Ugh! is all I have to say about this CD. All my friends said it was great, so I actually bought this hunk of junk! That was the biggest music mistake I've ever made, and i've made a few. I think I like about 1 song on this CD, and that's Cry Me A River, and boy, did I! When I found out I blew 15 bucks on this excuse for music!And you know what I can't get over!? How vain he is! There's like 12 pictures of this guy on a hidden poster where the lyrics are supposed to be written! This guy is unbeleivable!I wish I could give him 0 stars!I guess you can shake your but to the beat, but there's not much of a beat. Speaking of wich, I was skimming through the CD to test something, and I was right! In each individual song, they do the same beat over and over and over and over........All the only uncontinuos thing are the lyrics, and they just SUCK.Whew! I'm glad I got that off my chest!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the greatest albums of 2002","review":"Justin Timberlake's debut cd, Justified, is an incredible journey through pop, R&B, and other urban-styled sounds.

He's just an annoying little boy who thinks he's funny when he's not. \\"Don't be scurred!\\" what the hell is that? WHAT A LOSER.

I absolutely adored it!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Total crap","review":"All I have to say is that Justin Timberlake has to die. His singing sucks, the beats are overused and annoying, and he's just a self-centered muthaf***er. He needs to get N-Sync back so they can all be in the same place when I bomb it. Do not waste your money on this pop crap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Can't Stop Listening to this CD!","review":"I was intrigued by Timberlake's solo debut when I saw him singing \\"Like I Love You,\\" on MTV. I liked the beat and wondered what the rest of the cd would be like. When I heard \\"Cry Me a River\\" I was sold. I love this song. I have to say that it is rare for me to enjoy every song on a cd. I usually buy a cd and only listen to three or four of the tracks. That has not been the case with this one. Every song on this cd deserves to be there and holds its own. Timberlake has entertwined many different methods, beats and abilities into this cd. He is a multi-facted artist that I will continue to enjoy as he grows and experiments with his musical and lyrical ability. Dance beats, ballads, and music to work out by are all found within this cd. You know you want it... :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Really Bad!!","review":"Based on all the hype and awards this album received, you would think its a masterpiece, but it's in fact complete and total CRAP!! I've never heard such a bad pop album in my life, it's truly awful to listen to! The only half-decent song is Cry me a River, but even that song is just a lame attempt at publicity at someone else's expense. It was produced for pure shock value, which makes me sick! As for the rest of the album, literally 99.9% of it is crap filler and not even worth a second listen! I'm amazed at how hyped this album has become because it's truly not worth any kind of recognition! Bypass this atrocity at all costs!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE... FOR REAL","review":"ok. this cd was i guess one of the MOST anticipated cd's of 2002. i bought it. i heard it was good. i bought it the day it came out. i heard it. and that was the only time i heard it. i gave it away the next week. it is that bad seriously. like the only good solid song is \\"cry me a river\\". the rest of the album lacks good lyrics and it's like the same thing every song. it's either heartbreak, or oh no there's this girl there that i want. like yea it's really him, but it's just the same thing over and over on those two subjects. i definitely thought it was going to be better. the only songs that i didn't bother listening to that time were \\"cry me a river\\", \\"senorita\\", and \\"rock your body\\". the rest are not as good. like i have no clue why this cd is getting rave reviews when it shouldn't be. i thought justin could do better. look justin it's like this ... boy band or bust!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry I paid money to support this guy...","review":"Sorry to say it, but Justin really doesn't cut it with this album. First off, it makes me wanna be the LAST person in line to ever date him, with the way he slams his ex (Britney) in half the songs! Almost every track is extremely self-centered, boastful and even obnoxious. I've never taken a side in the Justin/Britney situation, but this album sure makes me want to give poor Brit a shoulder to cry on! Justin also considers himself a pimp, as is evident in the never-ending sexual innuendos. Doesn't this guy ever get sick of himself? BOTTOM LINE: J's vocals are good, but his songs are mediocre and his message is [bad]."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forget the hype!","review":"This album just plan sucks! It's such a shame that there was so much hype around Justin at the time that his and Nick Carter's albumNow or Nevercame out that Nick's album didn't sell as well as his. And Nick's album is 10x better! I still listen to it and it came out years ago! Justin is some hip-hop artist wanna be! Nick was true to himelf by doing a combo of rock and pop. People, if you want to hear a better album get Nick's!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Debut","review":"Justin's first solo effort is a great pop record. A lot could have gone wrong, but Justin opts for taking some chances rather than producing formulatic pop songs that his group 'N Sync was known for. Dance jams like \\"Senorita\\" and \\"Rock Your Body\\" blend with the R&B grooves of \\"(And She Said) Take Me Now\\" and the pissed off love song \\"Never Again\\" isn't bad. Justified's a strong first offering."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Second MJ(Michael Jackson)!!!-by Joel","review":"Justin Timberlake finally is not a so irrelevant star in showbiz.[...]he has changed style in everything.But there are some people that still call him ''little girl''.OK,he has vocals of that kind,but by this album we can say he really loves music,and he has a talent on his job,a job that much''singers''changed its meaning,and the production too is very good for an R'n'B debut(Timbaland,Neptunes,etc).Senorita 5/10Like I Love You 10/10What You Got 9/10Take It From Here 4/10Cry Me A River 6/10Rock Your Body 8/10Nothing Else 5/10Last Night 6/10Still On My Brain 7/10Take Me Now 10/10Right For Me 4/10Let's Take A Ride 3/10Never Again 8/10Also,Justin is something like the new MJ,while he rans to the juries.Justin is surely the best choice for everyone who likes R'n'B music.And,remember,Justin has grown up and he shows it!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"justified","review":"Hey Justin fans!I just want to say that i think this album is GREAT!!

I WISH YOU LUCK JAY!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Pleased","review":"The album is actually a lot more than I expected. I love NSYNC But this album shows a lot of different sides to Justin. He still remains true to his Pop status but he blends a little of r&b into it to add a little spice. \\"Take it from here\\" is a great example of that spice. \\"Like I Love You\\" his first single with Clipse adds a little funk to it. Every song is easy to listen to. From up tempo body shaking songs to smooth slow jams. Give him a chance. It's A Great Buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could've been the next Michael Jackson...","review":"I hated N'SYNC, but thought Timberlake could be the new king of POP minus the MJ history of controversy. So I kinda assumed this CD like MJ's Off the Wall, would be distance it self from the group that made him famous.So I thought \\"Justified\\" would be the new \\"Off the Wall\\". In a way it was. Like Off the Wall MJ worked with the top producers, and had some good music, but JT working with Neptunes and Timberland is not going to work, Timberland and Neptunes music sound to much off the same.Timberlake should've work with more experiance producers, not hip-hop producers(not that Im not a fan of hip-hop). JT can be the next MJ and even better(maybe not). But he needs to find a more R&B sound, not hip-hop.For Timberlakes next solo, he should go the \\"Thiller\\" route and do somthing TOTALLY DIFFERENT and sound the good doing it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed in Justified...","review":"When I heard the new single on the radio, I can remember really liking it and immediately going to download it. Since then, I've played \\"Like I Love You\\" probably a hundred times so I was looking forward to hearing the entire album Justified. What I found was pure disappointment...in fact, \\"Like I Love You\\" is probably the only good song on the whole album which makes it very disappointing the single rules the album. Most of the songs sound the same and seem to transport back to a mix of Marvin Gaye and Michael Jackson. The only other track I found on the CD I'll even listen to besides \\"Like I Love You\\" is \\"Nothin Else\\". \\"Nothin Else\\" reminds me of some songs Timbaland produced for Nicole such as \\"This Time I'm Gonna Make Ya Hot\\". All in all, a very disappointing debut from an artist with tons and tons of potential...just stick more to the formula of \\"Like I Love You\\" and the lyrics will shine on the next album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Crap","review":"I love how this album has gone up on Amazon's sales ranking since the superbowl controversy.

Cause he lip synchs. Michael Jackson should get credit for Like I Love Ya- he copies everything about him post 1984. In fact it would be cool to hear MJ do a cover of it. I wanted to throw up when I saw him \\"perform\\" the first cut from the album at the MTV VMA's... but I have too admit that the line \\"You're a good girl and that's what makes me trust ya'. \\" is kind of catchy... enough so that I was singing it to my cat this evening. It's probably a subtle jab at Britney. Like Christina Aguilera he hires rappers on the album that aren't very smooth or articulate in any sense of the word. My reccomendation is to spend the 4.99 on the single if you must but the album itself is not going to get worn out from playing it a thousand times, like with Off The Wall of Thriller if you know what I mean."},{"rating":"1","title":"PLEASE TELL JUSTIN HE IS CAUCASIAN","review":"I am probably the only person who thinks this cd is a waste of time and money. Imagine it, the only songs I liked on it are the ones the were singles and videos. I read somewhere that most of these songs were written for Michael Jackson. That sounds about right, his last album sucked too. Also, has anybody seen the video for \\"I'm loving it\\"?

I can't believe his imagining he's the king of pop and that's far from happening. No singing talent and no character. Stay away from this immitator!

Aren't we all allowed a guilty pleasure here and there? It's great background music with a good beat when cleaning house or getting ready to go out. C'mon people, lighten up!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst CD EVER.","review":"This is possibly the worst CD I have ever listened to. Not only are the songs all on the same subject matter, but I think they use the same 5 chords throughout the whole album. Then again, I do have to give him some credit for breaking the shackles of an even cheesier boy band.Way to go Justin, you improved upon your 'nsync follies - now let's make an album that's not total crap...and please give Michael Jackson back his singing style."},{"rating":"1","title":"Limp Music","review":"Justin banked on his N'Sync fame to garner reputable producers to pump up the funk factor in his new album. After some repeated listenings, one do not take long to surmise that Justin needs some time to produce good music. In \\"Justified\\", he tried his very best to sound infectious funk pop, but the end result is just limp. \\"Rock your body\\" is an attempt to recycle '70s disco beat and fuse it with hip hop. Did he succeed? Hardly."},{"rating":"1","title":"This C.d JUSTIFIED my growing hatred for justin","review":"When it all boils down too it Justin thinks he is tough and black. Now, as the American public should know he is neither of those things. Infact he isn't even a very good singer! The only acceptable reason for buying one of his c.d's would be to make fun of it! Anybody who buys this c.d to actually litsen too it has serious issues!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"An AMAZING album, something for everyone. Like I Love You, Last Night and Rock Your Body will certainly drop a beat and are great cruisin' tunes, but for me the album is all about Justin's break-up with Britney, and the heartfelt lyrics behind Still On My Brain and Never Again - anyone who has ever had their heart broken will understand everything he says. A mature record from a boy with the voice of an angel. BUY."},{"rating":"2","title":"grown up listener","review":"i'm a 23 year old latino male. i listen to dru hill, 112, (slow jams). my girlfriend bought this cd for me because i liked \\"like i love\\", but to tell you the truth i wanted to take it back for the new dru hill cd. i'm glad i opened it, because i bought the dru hill cd the next day, and i like the timberlake album way better. people that are rating this album with 1 or 2 stars are children that don't know how real music sounds like. this is grown up music, if your looking for mindless pop go buy an n*sync album. this is really good r&b.;i am not an n*sync fan, don't own any of their cd's....he's got a bright future. KEEP YOUR HEAD UP JUSTIN!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!","review":"I originally bought this album just for Cry Me A River and the rest of the album wasn't even close to good.

Lol I just recommend you get his sophomore albumFutureSex / LoveSoundswhich is way better than this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"MY EARS WANT TO KILL ME","review":"Yes. My ears want to kill me for listening to such crap. I bought this cd because I actually liked Justin in Nsync. And while I did not expect a rehash of old Nsync material, I expected something that I would enjoy. \\"Like I Love You' made me think I would like this cd but aside from that song the rest of this album is boring, trite, badly sung, badly written, boring, (I know I said that already, but damn, this is one boring album!)Then with the Super Bowl fiasco. That for me cemented my intense dislike for him as a performer. (....)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Deserves No Stars","review":"Oh my gosh, there is so much that is so wrong about this tripe.Justin seems to think he is the Stevie Wonder of the 21st century. Please. He has no soul. He has feeling. His musicianship and showmanship (as displayed on the Grammy awards)are nil.Not quite sure how he won but he did. Then again nobody has ever accused the Grammy awards of being based on talent.If I remember my Grammy history correctly, The Beatles were pretty much overlooked time and time again by the academy.Don't waste your time or money on this garbage. If you insist on picking up a copy...wait about a year and you will find it deeply discounted after Justin's career takes a dive.Awful, awful stuff. It should come packaged with a vomit bag."},{"rating":"1","title":"God help us!","review":"This music is horrible.I think n'sync sounded better.This guy has no hope as a solo artist.This the most useless pop i've ever heard.If there's more to come from this guy then god help us."},{"rating":"1","title":"We need higher standards here","review":"Justin Timberlake, aside from being a drain on society, is also a talentless hack, who desires to be Michael Jackson (an interesting aspiration) and have all his famous friends hide what he really is...a guy whose 15 minutes should have been up long ago. A guy who is way too concerned about image, and sounds like a cat in heat...there, I said it."},{"rating":"2","title":"It will grow on you","review":"If you are an NSync fan and like the first single \\"Like I Love You\\", you might be suprise at this cd. You probably won't like it right from the start since it is not want you are expecting. However, please give it sometime, it will grow on you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different!","review":"This cd is something that you've never heard of coming from Justin. All together this was a really good album. My favorite ballads are : Cry me A River, Like I love you, Rock Your Body, Senorita, and What you got! When you listen to this cd, you cant' help thinking, what did britney do to him?? Cuz it's soo bitter towards her, and his other relationships. It's a decent album, I'm so glad that *NSYNC didnt break up... They are expecting another album, which should be spectacular!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad at all!","review":"I've listened to the CD about 4 times now and I can honestly say it's growing on me. Like I Love You is a great song and is worth buying the album for, but he's put together an album that has a lot of variety and is a lot of fun. My personal favorites are Rock Your Body and (And She Said) Take Me Now as they're both more upbeat songs. Cry Me a River is pretty soulful and is an interesting song since it seems to mirror the ending of a relationship he had with a certain famous pop star. This guy has a lot of talent and I think we'll be seeing a lot more from him over the years. Worth the money to add to your collection!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No way!","review":"The only thing I can say is that some of the songs on his CD are catchy. However, his voice sucks.

All of the songs are great, and Justin has a great voice. I must say that when he does that, \\"Yeah, yeah, yeah!\\" in \\"Like I love you\\", I am very, very annoyed. It sickens me and I think he should DROP that because he sounds like a squirrel that just got run over by a car. Other than that, songs are great, album's worth every penny and it very much deserves 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"I thought it was pretty good","review":"For a first solo c.d.,I thought that justified,was pretty good ,I've seen better but I've seen worse,to me its one of those c.d.'s that you play when you're going through something and you wanna have fun or you just wanna reflect on something.Give it a try, if you are into alternative RnB then this may be the c.d. for you.Much Love."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's OK , I guess...","review":"Well, first off , don't get mad at me, 'cause what I'm about to say was not going to be that good.NSYNC fan and JT fans, sorry.I bought this album because I thought it would maybe sound like nsync's \\"Pop\\", \\"Celebrity\\" etc. But I was totally wrong.

I simple hate this album and I even put it aside of my collection!!! I wasnt going to write this review but I did when I watched the EMAs and listend that he got the best album when \\"stripped\\" was in competition!!

What a good effort and job by justin & his producers. I really liked his first single and some more other songs. Justin is really good as a solo act.

Its hot!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"IF I could i would give ZERO","review":"I know theres a ton of fans of justin timberlake but just face the facts....He's not a good singer...at least not to me. I bought this cd a week ago and ya know how sometimes a cd will eventually grow on you? I tried that. It doesnt work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let's See Who Gets The Credit","review":"Alrighty....the neptunes wrote half the songs and Timbland wrote half the songs. And this guy keeps on singing like a girl, and is getting all the attention because he's from N'Sync. This guy is from the pop teeniebopper music industry, where barely anyone writes their own songs. Now who should get the credit here? I would DEFINITLY give credit to the neptunes and Timbland, get their CD's, theyre excellent songwriters and they make the dopest beats (and not to mention catchy, which is why this album is selling)....but this...ugh. They made the beats catchy, but the fact that this guy is part of the one of fakest teeniebopper boy bands in history turns me away. Get the producers albums if you like the songs, not the album from this guy."},{"rating":"2","title":"INVINCIBLE....Whoops! That title is taken!","review":"If MJ had jettisoned 1/3 of his last album, hooked up with Timbaland and other contemporary hip-hop masters, added his sister Janet on a cut, threw in some funky beats, did some patented \\"screams\\", then he might have had the winner that Timberlake has.I dig the seductive \\"Senorita\\", \\"Take It From Here\\", \\"Rock Your Baby\\" \\"Let's Take A Ride\\", and the slammin' \\"Last Night\\".If Timberlake can maintain this level in his sophomore effort, he may have a career beyond his \\"boyhood\\".He'll do fine as long as he doesn't completely emulate his hero and become a prisoner of his own success."},{"rating":"1","title":"Go Back To NSync","review":"I am totally unimpress with this cd. It sounds like he's trying to be Michael Jackson or something. Also he is using the same tired producers (Neptunes and Timbaland) that everyone and their mother is using. If you want to hear a REAL blue-eyed soul artist, then pick up Remy Shand, Jon B. or Hall and Oates. But not this guy, Justin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most overrated album of 2002!!","review":"All hype, no substance! I don't think I could say it better! As much as I love 'N Sync, Justin's album does not impress me! The songs all sound the same! It's pretty much the same hip-hop R and B beat, but different lyrics! The only songs worth listening to are the hit singles \\"Like I Love You\\", and \\"Cry Me A River\\"! The third single \\"Rock Your Body\\" sounds like a track from Michael Jackson's reject pile! This has got to be the worst album of 2002, as well as most overrated! Go buy Nick Carter's album instead, the most underrated CD of 2002! Even if you don't like all the songs, at least it has variety!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cry Him A River?","review":"Okay Justin, if you are that desperate for us to cry you a river, and you want it that bad, we will. No as a matter of fact, we'll do more than that. We'll cry you an ocean and a sea. Those tears will be from the pure hapiness during and after the time you disappear and die."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mostly Good","review":"I don't know if I particularly care for Justin Timberlake. I bought this album not knowing what to expect. The first ten songs were good, but the last 3 sucked. Here'e how I'll rate the songs.1. Senorita- One of my favorites on the album 9/102. Like I Love You- Good. 6/103. (Oh No)What You Got- I like the beat to this. 6.5/104. Take It From Here- I love this song. 9/105. Cry Me A River- Good revenge song. 8/106. Rock Your Body- I enjoyed this one. 7.5/107. Nothin' Else- He sounds okay here. 6.5/108. Last Night- He sounds like Michael Jackson here. 9.5/109. Still On My Brain- I love the melody on this song. 9/1010. (And She Said)Take Me Now- I like it, but it's not great. 7/1011. Right For Me- I hate this song. 2/1012. Let's Take A Ride- I hate this even more. 1/1013. Never Again- This one's way too whiny. 3/10Justin's more talented than Britney. Overall though, the album wasn't spectacular. It was good.Overall- 7.5/10"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it.","review":"I've been a fan of his since I was 9. And I really enjoyed this album. And I'm happy that he's become such a huge artist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been worse, but not by that much","review":"Words of advice to upcoming male pop singers: Never try to be Michael Jackson because it will not work no matter how hard you try. On this mostly forgettable album, Justin Timberlake tries to emulate MJ, and it is clear that the attempt is pretty unsuccessful. \\"Rock Your Body\\" is catchy and danceable, if vocally insignificant, but that is the only song on this album that is even remotely worth hearing. All in all, definitely not a justifiable masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost 5 years later","review":"Justified was released November 5, 2002. Almost 5 years later and it's still on heavy rotation on my iPod."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Good Debut","review":"Justin Timberlake (FutureSex / LoveSounds) first stormed on the scene with *NSYNC. The group released a number of CDs (N Sync,No Strings Attached,Celebrity) but there was something about Justin that you could just tell screamed solo careeer.So he embarked on his own solo career. This is a very solid debut. The headlining song Cry Me A River is amazing, but the others are no slouch. Especially the tracks Senorita, Like I Love You, Take It From Here, Rock Ya Body, Nothin' Else, and Let's Take a Ride.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Debut Album By Justin!!","review":"A nice cd ..Can't wait until he produces another one..This album shows how Justin is all of Nsync and he can do better by himself and i hope he becomes a really successful solo singer.Well in my opinion the best song is NEVER AGAIN.. If ur an R&B lova u'll Love it too...Other good songs include; Like I Love You and Cry Me A River..This is a good cd by J.T and I recommend it to all Pop Lova'z , Nsync fanz and R&B Lova'z..Music is such a great gift in Life..Peace Y'all!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a great album","review":"Inever doubted that j would make a great album. Every song was co-written by him, and all are reasonably great, personally i dont like \\"serorita\\" or \\"right for me\\", but that is my opinion! Cry me a river is one of the best tracks on the album. and for all you girls that like him more for his looks then his voice then you might be happy with the 24 page pullout poster of him! if you are a jt fan then this is a must have!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good","review":"This music is different from N Sync's music. It's not teeny bopper at all. Honestly, I am a teeny bopper, but Justified is actually okay. It's more hip hop and R&B, which I was afraid of, but it is worth listening to, for the most part. There are some songs that I do skip over, but overall it's not bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good debut for Mr.Timberlake......","review":"Although I'm not much of an R&B fan, I can say that Justin Timberlake's new CD is a pretty good debut. There are a few outstanding songs. Don't expect to hear deep or insightful lyrics though... As the lyrics are somewhat questionable. The production is good and Justin's voice fits every song except #11(Right for me) which sounds horrible. My favorite is #6. It kind of sounds like an old disco song. Which was pretty cool. Of course, \\"Like I love you\\" is a good song. \\"Senorita\\" is a good one along with #3, \\"What you got\\". Justin sounds as if he has found his niche. I haven't heard many NSYNC songs, so I can't compare that with this. Overall, this is a good debut. With mostly good production and ridiculous lyrics at times."},{"rating":"2","title":"J.Timberlake is pretty good!","review":"Justin did it right. I have to admit I'm not a big \\"boy band\\" fan but when Justin's single came out I loved it. I just had to check out the rest of the album. I wouldn't necessarily call it \\"pop\\" in the N'Sync sense - and I guess that's a good thing. I would definitely say that Justin has a lot of spunk, funk, grit, soul, -- hell - it's just good. I'm anxious to see the videos for the songs on this cd.How many songs on the cd were good? Honestly, all of them. I listened to the cd from start to finish. This is going to be my new favorite cd to listen to while I'm cleaning the house, working at my computer, or getting ready to go out on a saturday night with my girlfriends.The thing I like most about the cd is that it's filled with songs you can dance too and sort of make you feel good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally Justified In My Purchase","review":"I was very skeptical about buying this album, I didn't know if it would be too POP for me. But I read a review and took a chance. WOW! I am so glad I bought this album, my friends laughed because he's a pop singer and I'm an older Black woman. They ate their words when I popped it in. The production is clean and nice. If you like Ginuwine, Usher you'll like this album. Favorite cuts: Take It From Here, Rock Your Body (light party jam). Micheal Jackson could have easily made the same album."},{"rating":"2","title":"The torch is passed to Justin!","review":"Justified show us the reason why justin is a star. \\"Justified is one of the best releases of the year. He will definitely be the heir to Micheal Jackson's throne. Justified shows that Justin has taken hip hop and r&b to the next level. Songs like \\"Senorita\\" and \\"Cry me a river\\" are definitely buzz worthy.This album is a souful success. Play that funky music white boy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This album is atrocious","review":"Nothing about this album is original, nothing stands out above what anybody else is doing, it has no depth. Now tell me, if Justin Timberlake wasn't decent looking, would you still buy this CD? The answer is no, because the album is selling discs off 100% sex appeal and over-budgeted music videos. Run from this CD or people like me will lock you up for destroying the world of music."},{"rating":"1","title":"... poser?","review":"please, just do yourself a favor and buy a Michael Jackson album, ANY Michael Jackson album. that is who Timberlake is trying to be so why go with the poser when you can just get the real thing? Justin Timberlake is like a cheap Xerox copy of Michael Jackson. yea he looks/sounds kinda like him (more like an impersonator), but in black & white with most of the quality being lost in the photocopying process."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much more mature than Nsync!","review":"Justin has gone solo and grown into a mature singer, better than the bubblegum pop of NSync. He has put together many great pop and r&b and funky songs. Some people compare him to Michael Jackson but there is a bit of Micheal in everyone's songs. Justin is a very talented singer and performer."},{"rating":"1","title":"......Just Buy The Singles, The Rest Is Crap","review":"I wanted to believe the hype. Awards for this and that...but this CD is full of fillers. Geez, what a coincidence....all the good songs are singles...the rest are badly produced along with cheesy lyrics.Like I Love You, Cry Me a River, Rock Your Body, Senorita and Take It From Here (not a single, but should be) are awesome....but don't waste your money on the whole CD.I'm Lovin' ItWorthy Of"},{"rating":"1","title":"No longer NSYNC with todays youth","review":"Justin Timberflake tries to establish himself as a man capable of standing on his own.

'Justified' was a bit sassy but it certainly wasn't enough to 'justify' a purchase. ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"An OK debut start","review":"This is an OK debut start.If Timberlake wasn't a name before this CD, then this album would have never sold what it did.Mar my words....

A lousy attempt at trying to emulate the king of pop/r&b. I don't mind the songs cry me a river and rock your body, and the janet duet(which is the only reason I bothered buying this CD) but justin isn't talented at all as a solo artist, JC is much more talented and edgy, justin is just a chipmunk screaming for attention and ndefinitely never worth my money again."},{"rating":"1","title":"This album SUCKS!","review":"and I'm not joking. there's like 1 good song on it, the rest are trash. he sounds like a pre-teen girl when he sings and his songs suck. throw this in the garbage, along with his career!"},{"rating":"1","title":"UGH!","review":"Ew!

Just goes to prove that you don't need to be talented to make it in this industry anymore (look at William Hung; heh heh). All you have to do is either a) look like a supermodel or b) have a pathetic sob story to make people feel sorry for you. The media's cruel these days. Don't waste your money on this garbage. If you NEED to spend your money on a cd, buy a nice Dead Kennedys album, Ella Fitzgerald, or even a Clay Aiken album. None of those people are pathetic supermodel/sob stories, so support the real artists and shunt this guy to the side.THANK YOU!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I like ''Rock Your Body\\"...I have only heard three songs...","review":"I have only heard three songs, and it seems like it should be a good album. To me, if a cd has at least two great songs nowadays, it's good to me. The two songs \\"Cry Me A River\\" and \\"Rock Your Body\\" are GREAT songs. \\"Cry Me A River\\" is an R&B tempo song that gets playes on BET so it, thankfully, is accepted, and it gets played on a Hip-hop/R&B dominated radio station.\\"Rock Your Body\\" grew on me and it's a disco/R&B classic! I hope that BET and this Hip-hop station play this song. The featured women and Justin sound beautiful together.Look out for \\"Rock Your Body\\"!Learn to like what YOU like (as long it isn't hateful) and I bet that more of you will like it.I fully recommend it just for those two songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"not all that","review":"Justin and the Neptunes and Timbaland admitted to listening to michael jackson's off the wall CD for 2 weeks straight while recording this album at the same time, but the only songs well done are cry me a river, take me now and rock your body though someone else should have sang them and they sound no different from already existing songs from as early as off the wall to as late as brandy or aaliyah or some other r&b artist. Justin ripped off r&b that has been around for years and some stupid justin fans on this board have the nerve to call him original, it's unbelievable. and they don't realize that by doing that they are discrediting black musicians and songwriters who enhanced the r&b genre, and this album is full of neptunes and timbaland who are also black. I give THEM the credit not justin."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT HAPPENED?","review":"Justin was always one of the most talented guys in *NSYNC. He could dance very well, and vocally he could hit notes some guys will never be able to hit. I personally never had a crush on him, like some girls, but I didn't exactly dislike him.When Justin came out with this CD, I was kind of \\"So what?\\" about it. Then I saw part of the music video for \\"Rock Your Body\\". Sure, it had cool music, and a neat video, but the lyrics were so trashy! I was rather surprised. \\"Cry Me A River\\" was okay, but a little too slow for my liking.After all I've seen, and after all I've heard, Justin Timberlake is garbage. He's a disgusting man who needs to be rescued from the sleez he's become.I recommend these not only talented, but cleaner singers:Jonny LangClay Aiken"},{"rating":"1","title":"Is he over yet?","review":"When NSYNC burst onto the pop scene I always just dismissed them as a cheap knockoff of the Backstreet Boys, who did it better and first. A few years later the infinitely more talented BSB have fizzled out yet we are still subjected to the clones' inane offerings. Here La Timberlake breaks out on her own...well if you consider ripping off tired ole Michael Jackson tunes as \\"breaking out.\\" Jackson himself is nothing more than a joke in the pop world which begs the question, why bother ripping off his songs and moves? I won't bother getting into the racist subtext that underlines Timberlake and her career, that should be perfectly clear whenever she rips off the Human Beatbox from The Fat Boys. \\"Cry Me A River\\" is just plain meretricious! If I hear it one more time on the radio, I'm going to shove an icepick in my ear.

He could have done a lot better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as bad as I thought","review":"Justified was actually a great club album, and the vocals were not lacking either.

The more I listen to this album the more I think that JT might actually have a long-term career post-NSYNC, in time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Um...no.","review":"Whoever said that this CD had MJ/80's retro quality...lied. Whoever said that half the songs on the album sound like one endless song...was right and deserves a trophy :D I must admit, the songs are catchy and infectious when you first listen to the CD. But truthfully, the CD makes Justin sound like a droning whiner with hopelessly shallow love songs and weird club hits. The best song on the CD, lyrics and music combined, is probably Justin's single \\"Cry Me A River\\"; although the song itself isn't totally spectacular (and was played to DEATH!!!), it is the most emotionally charged and true-sounding song on the album. The rest of it just sounds like a pre-teen's imaginings of what love, romance, sex, and clubbing *must* be like. \\"Still On My Brain\\" has a pretty sound, music-wise, but the lyrics are uninspired. Some of the other songs on the CD are okay but lack substance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Justin's CD Rocks!!!","review":"I think that justin timberlake did a great job with his first solo cd!! I think it set him apart from all the other artists who have left their group to make a effort at solo stardom!

This is a MUST buy!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Justified!","review":"I just got this album today, I was wanting it alot of times before and so I bought it today. Justin's debut album is good! His music is abit different, from when he was in the *NSYNC group but I still like him. I love the song \\"Never again\\" the song Never again sounds like about him and Britney braking up. I also like the songs Like I love you and Cry me a river, but on my opinion I like the remixes better to the song Cry me a river. Anyways, if your an *NSYNC or Justin fan (Like me!) I recommend you buy Justin's new CD. I'm sure you'll love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Good Stuff!","review":"Ok...if you have read my other reviews...well if you haven't then I mostly write for R&B albums and Rap albums. This time I was like I will give JT a listen because I heard of all his collabo's with the Neptunes on this album.I expected this cd to have a Pop sound to it. But was I surprised when I popped this cd in my cd changer. Very, Very, good stuff. Folks I am serious. This is coming from a black male that listen's to Underground rap and Eastcoast rap.I actually really liked this cd. But.......there is always a but.......The Neptunes kinda make the production sound the same on some of the songs. And Timberland's productions.....well some of them.......are just mediocre and just don't go with the style of JT.Overall good cd. I read reviews that JT might be the next MJ......well not really but he sounds like MJ a lot. I don't know if that is bad or not but I am all for it. MJ is whack anyway so we need a newer MJ sound. Peace!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing...Songs","review":"In my opinion, i think that Justified is a great CD. It's my favorite right now and I listen to a lot. I think ha has really separated himself from the whole pop thing he had going with Nsync. Not that it's bad but I like the fact he did his own thing and is good at it. Even though he does kinda sound like MJ, it's ok I like him too. But overall I give it 100%.

The only unique sounding song was \\"Senorita\\". Don't care for Justin Timberlake personally and the SuperBowl and a few incidents afterwards has made me lose more respect for him as a person but musically, he has potential but he really needs to get his own identity instead of trying to be the \\"white\\" M.J."},{"rating":"2","title":"Impressed","review":"I was never a fan of N'Sync, but I am definitely a fan of Justin Timberlake's. Justin has soul and it shows on this CD. His talent and the talent of his production team is apparent.If he can follow up \\"Justified\\" with something just as hot, he'll be around for a while. My personal favorites are \\"I'll Take It From Here\\" and \\"Let's Take a Ride\\".Consider this CD highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice try","review":"True, his songs are danceable and catchy but they are basically for people who like to dance in groups, kind of like those zombies in Jacko's Thriller video.

However upon listening to this album, my leap from the band wagon just seemed to be easier.After working in a record store for 2 years and having this album shoved down my throat day in day out since its release, my contempt has only grown.I find this album to be offensive, (to music, mostly), overplayed and over gratified. I think this album has no depth, or anything that makes you want to stay up all night listening to it, unless you're on drugs, or horribly drunk and wanting to \\"get it on\\" with your ugly roommate.However I do give props to JT for successfully ripping off everything Michel Jackson has ever done, and some how claiming it for his own.And, I do have to admit the one song with male/female parts makes me jump around and dance like an idiot (providing I'm one drugs or booze)."},{"rating":"1","title":"stupid me","review":"Damn the media and my subceptibility to it. I bought this CD since I liked 'Cry me a River' and it was one of two songs I liked. Also, I loved Christina A.'s CD so much that I thought they had to be on the same wavelength. They're NOT. I stopped listening to this CD when JT's says \\" Better have you naked by the end of this song\\" what??? that's the best you can do? Did it ever occur to him that the song with Janet Jackson would work better as a slow jam? A week later I gave it to a 12 year old girl who loves it.

He is a great entertainer and singer. Some of my favorite songs are: take it from here, like i love you, cry me a river, still on my brain, rock your body, and right for me..In this record you are going to expect a pop sound like nsync. but it is far from that.. It is pure r and b. And all the people who says he is copying michael jackson and that he is gay are just jealous. Yes, he is white and singing soul music but he really has raw talent..You should buy the album.. It is 100 percent worth it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste!","review":"Now,I never bought this album, but I used to have to listen to it in dance class every week for about 5 months. All Justin does is get his songs way over played and fools little kids and pathetic teenagers.

Don't hate me 'cause I have good taste in music. It's not that I don't like pop ( I'm a major Play fan, which has got to be the cutest, most cuddly bubblegum pop there is.)it's just this should be classified under Miccellaneos(I'm sure I spelled that wrong)."},{"rating":"1","title":"C'mon people!!!","review":"This cd is not that good! I do respect the fact that this one-time boy band member decided to work with some great producers for a more mature sound. However, when you really think about it, Justin is simply a product. Anybody with a decent voice can work with top notch producers and create a hit. That's a no-brainer. I actually lost respect for the guy when he stated that his top cds for 2003 were 5O cent and Jay Z. I expected some more eclectic listening for someone who claims to have grown up with soul around his house. Where are the influential artists that inspired this album. He simply let the producers take over. His musical choices only confirmed what I had thought already - he's a product. Why do we elevate these people to such heights? For really great soul/r&b artists, listen to Sade or Jill Scott. These two \\"artists\\" are actively involved in the music they put out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly Justified","review":"\\"Justified\\" is Justin Timberlake's solo debut apart from 'N Sync. He teams up with producers The Neptunes in this monumental pop album. For the first time in his career, he wrote every song. Such immense album quality places him with legends Stevie Wonder, Michael Jackson, Al Green, and more. He received five Grammy nominations for 2003, including Album of the Year. Other collaborations: Brian McKnight, Clipse, and Janet Jackson, add extra music flavor in the perfect spots. Timberlake's combination of pop, dance, modern R&B, and ole skool R&B offers a piece of music history that has been missing for a long time. His voice in every single is amazing. Such talents prove that he's much more than a sex symbol. He also proves that he'll be around for many more years. \\"Justified\\" is a great album for everyone. Many will be enlightened. Hopefully, he releases another solo project sometime."},{"rating":"1","title":"What? He only won two grammies","review":"The only reason he won those grammies was because first he was overhyped and second was put into a category with older singers like Johnny Cash and Peter Zevon, people who don't appeal to the typical demographic and audience these days. He had it easy. He didnt deserve to win. And since when did he win 5 grammies...The reviewer below me must be what 11 or 12 year old teenybopper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spayed cats sound better than this!","review":"Justin you are jealous of all the attention Clay Aiken gets.

I write this as he tweets (and teases) of his next project. It's been 6 years since he brought sexy back and 10 years since Justified debuted.

My favorite - \\"Rock you Body\\"!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Why not? It's fun!","review":"You know what? This cd is actually pretty good! I mean, it's totally pop - fun & upbeat. Nothing too serious and if you're past high school age (like me) I guess it's amusingly nostalgic in places. Wear my jacket baby?! Too funny...

I had very little idea of what to expect from him. I just have to say that Justin is so smart and creative. He picked the right people to collaborate with and came up with some of the most creative sounds i've ever heard. He captured the emotions he was feeling and poured them into the songs. You can hear what he was going through, and understand how he felt. The beats are crazy! The record company should make all the fast songs singles for the clubs, cause people would go wild dancing to those beats. I couldnt have asked for more in a cd. It's awesome! yee-haw Texas girls rock!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD is not bad","review":"I have not really listened to this CD that much but all his singles are very good.

Well luckly there is Justin Timberlake from *Nsync to be found with his new album Justified. He is a good singer and has very good songs without *Nsync, but I wish they were back together.

It is pretty good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Here's A Little Secret","review":"For you youngsters, the riff from \\"Cry Me A River\\" is a rip off of a Led Zeppelin tune very poorly executed.

I guess this is what is meant by Bottom of the Barrel. Senorita has to be one of the most stupid songs especially at the end when he has the guys sing one part and the girls sing another, that was just plain stupid. Rock Your Body sounds like a Michael Jackson rip of song and Cry Me A River is just one of those typical ballads to get a song on the billboard charts and maintain a career. I suggest not buying this."},{"rating":"1","title":"this is one bad cd! (bad meaning lousy)","review":"Am I the only one that thinks this cd is boring?

This book puts a seemingly new-age spin on old-fashioned beliefs, namely that men need some enticement to remain interested in their \\"woman\\" and in maintaining a monogamous relationship. Although I enjoyed some of Marianne's early books, this one is a big disappointment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What was the point of this book?","review":"\\"Enchanted Love\\" lacks clarity. She was so entangled in her flowery expression of words that she must have forgotten the point she was trying to make. This book is confusing more than it is enlightening.In the book she talked about the difference between men and women. How men usually don't lie, unless women proves we're hysterical in the light of truth. Hello! Since when are we responsible for how others behave? If that is the case, women definitely need to do the \\"right\\" thing to get men to behave the \\"right\\" way. It sounds like manipulation, but she calls it a dance.The two stars are for the prayers in the book. It's about the only part that is worth reading. I wouldn't recommend anyone to waste their time on this book.

From jaguars, venomous snakes and crocodiles down to the relentless flies and chiggers that inhabit these inhospitable environs there is never a dull moment. His escapades with the head-hunting tribes of the rainforest are charged with excitement.Again, how much of this is actually credible is not my place to say. However, the book will keep you on the edge of your seat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic tales of the Amazon","review":"As a past explorer of the Amazon, covering much of the same territory in the early '70's, I enjoyed this novel whether fiction or not.

Bill Morgan, served under Major Leonard Clark, author, during Operation Canary when a small group of OSS personnel were flown to Formosa at the end of WWII to accept the surrender of General Ando and his 400,000 Japanese troops. My brother had the highest regard for Major Clark. When Major Clark went back to China, my brother took over command of Operation Canary. Major Clark invited my brother to join him in his exploration activities after WWII but he was unable to join him because of family responsibilities. Nevertheless, he maintained contact with Len Clark up to Len's untimely death in the upper Amazon as a result of two arrows in his back. Clark was a great explorer and author.

I've found exactly three companies online that sell replacements, and I ordered from all of them. Somewhere between a day and two months later, though, they all emailed back and said they couldn't get the bags.

Please believe other reviewers when they call this book pedantic and recommend that Ms. Tisdale find herself a better editor.Once you've plowed through this book, I can't imagine that you'll put yourself through it again. Borrow it from the library, or, at least, don't pay full price."},{"rating":"1","title":"More questions than answers","review":"Sallie Tisdale starts off well, but never manages to answer the many questions she poses about food. In the end the book reads as an extended whinge. The introduction is basically the book, the rest is too often just extended repetition. The bibliography is especially light on credible historical sources,yet the history of food is often her subject. After a short time, Tisdale's glib assumption that she,her family,and her attitudes to food are the norm for all Americans passes from being ridiculous to being insulting. There are better books on the subject, notably \\"Fast Food Nation\\" and \\"The Primal Feast.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"She needs an editor and some cheese with her whine....","review":"I knew I would be in trouble when she repeated exactly the same quote from a cookbook only 6 pages apart. Still, I dutifully slogged through this book and came away disgusted and bored. She raises a few good points in the book, but those gems were obscured by her 300+ page diatribe against everything involving food. I got the sense that she doesn't particularly enjoy eating and can't consume even a bite of food without feeling either guilt or anger. And this book really has no sense of what it's supposed to be -- did she mean it to be a memoir? A social critique? Or just therapy for herself? Too bad this was actually nominated for a Beard award. It shows that food writing has a long way to go."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tossed Salad & Scrambled Eggs","review":"This book was not at all what I expected based on the BOMC blurb. It is more an erudite treatise than a popular cultural commentary. It is an arcane essay on anthropological, sociological, and philosophical aspects of food & food choices. The author says in the Introduction that \\"For many years, I've been a Zen Buddhist, and in many ways this is a matter of going against the tide of larger cultural forces around me.\\" The viewpoint flavors this endeavour. I give this book one big yawn. Now, hand over the Chalupa!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wretched, pedantic and boring as heck","review":"Tisdale is a hack at best and nothing she writes has much to do with life in general. She writes as if she's bothered with the process, less a critic and more a condescending harridan with a lot of words at her disposal. She certainly needs an editor but from what I gather, she's too difficult to be bothered. Bullheaded, opinionated and obstinate..she is definitely a bore. I would recommend any other book about food except this one. She should stick with what she thinks she knows: pretending to be a bisexual and being a bad parent."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Long Whine","review":"Frankly, I gave up a third of the way through. The author sneers at American food, American food tastes, and American versions of ethnic food. Boy, has she got attitude!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT the \\"best thing I ever read\\"","review":"We've all been told \\"never judge a book by its cover\\", and sadly that is true here. Based on the title, I was expecting (and hoping for) a book like Laurie Colwin's \\"Home Cooking\\", but I was sadly disappointed. Like many other reviewers, I only finished about half of the book because I was very tired of the author's whining. I kept waiting for the good part where she told us about the best thing(s) she ever tasted, but she wasn't writing a food memoir. I'm not really sure what she was writing about; all I got out of it was a disjointed collection of complaints and unintelligible thoughts about fusion, fisheries, and Zen Buddhism."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Point?","review":"What is Sallie Tisdale trying to say with this book? I read the entire book over the course of 3 months (small portions) and I never discovered \\"the secret of food.\\" This book is over 311 pages of disconnected musings. Each musing is well-written but there isn't a coherent whole. Its more like a coherent hole. A second helping? No thank you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Occasionally interesting but she needs an editor!","review":"While there are some interesting bits in this work, the author truly needed an editor who could organize the material. The book lacks focus and the author couldn't seem to decide what she wanted to write. Is this a memoir? Is this a work of gastronomic history? Is this a study of some aspects of American popular culture? It was not at all clear to me after a few days of laborious reading why this book was written."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book leaves a bitter sour taste.","review":"I was disappointed.I was looking forward to be informed and entertained about food, in a fond and celebrative way as implied by the title. Perish the thought! Although the contents and insights are worthy and well researched, it is also preachy and constantly harks back to the \\"good ole days\\". Worse, it has a patronising attitude about American food habits / culture and a paranoid view, e.g. in chapter about white flour, a conspiracy theory about how consumers have been manipulated by the industry, well and good if she has a lively captivating style of writing. Instead, the overall impression is dry, dreary and remote; I gave up after reading a third of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreary and lonely","review":"Instead of being a charming food memoir, Tisdale takes the reader on a dreary deathmarch through her own unending guilt over her abandonment of her glorious hippie co-op past. One gets the feeling that all of the lights in her emotional life have been dimmed by the overhanging cloud of her loneliness for those brown rice and tofu days. I wanted to stop half way through, but came upon one of the only nuggets of intriguing and insightful writing where she discusses her own relationship to food and dieting. Encouraged, I pressed on, but now wish I hadn't so that I could have been spared her assault on every cook from James Beard to Julia Child to anyone who might dare cook anything without spelt and unpasteurized Portland goat milk!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bruns Masters Bloch","review":"Peter Bruns, a young Berliner and a devotee of JS Bach, has earned his reputation as an ardent cellist. On this CD, he is solidly accompanied by Roglit Ishay at the piano in an eloquent performance of Ernest Bloch's \\"Meditations Hebraiques.\\" The composer conceived some of his most poignant melodies in these interpretations of his \\"enigmatic Jewish soul\\" and Bruns draws highly evocative sounds from his instrument, built by the master Carlo Tanoni in Vienna in 1730. Bloch and the two performing artists then merge the sonorities of Jewish spirituality with a display of baroque technique in a fitting tribute to Bach, via three suites for unaccompanied cello. In the concluding selection, Ms. Ishay joins Mr. Bruns for \\"Three Pictures of Chassidic Life - Contrition, Improvisation, and Rejoicing.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent read!","review":"This book was very down to earth, a very easy and entertaining read.

And if you're already in derby, it'll just make you even more glad you're part of the movement!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved This!!","review":"Finding books on the sport of Roller Derby is hard. I was thrilled to read this and could not put it down! I finished it in less than a day. It had a fun section on how to choose a Derby Name (of course I read this right after name submissions) and I learned why so many leagues are \\"by the skater, for the skater!\\" I had never considered what it would be like to be in a league where the board wasn't as concerned with our safety as our board is. I appreciate how much hard work went into forming my league and I am so grateful to the girls that paved the way.Thank you so much Melicious! You entertained me and made me learn something at the same time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Informative Read","review":"I bought this book just before buying a pair of beginner skates and deciding that roller derby might be just what I want to do.I wanted a firsthand account of starting derby out of nowhere from newbie to veteran.More or less, this is what I got. The fresh meat part wasn't as thorough as I'd hoped, but it was still nice to get some insight.The writing is fun and light, and its an easy read to just keep turning the page, turning the page. Melicious has a great sense of humor and really adds personality to the book (as if it could possibly be lacking when its about derby girls!!)I totally reccomend the book, and as a plus it comes with a lot of pics and some background on how the flat track derby league was started.I also reccomend watching \\"Hell on Wheels\\" to understand the work and trials that the original derby gal's overcame in order for the sport to bew what it is today."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book ROCKS","review":"Not only does this book explain the neat history of derby and the even neater story of the author's rise to derby stardom, it gives the reader a wicked personal boost. Melicious' positive attitude is refreshing and infectious. It's high time we have a strong, smart, and savvy role model who proves that women of all ages and all backgrounds can excel both on and off the track. The perfect gift for your friends, moms, kids, etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Derby is Back","review":"This is a great book for the derby queen or rollernovice. A good look into the sport that works to educate about the derby and dispel myths that rollergirls are somehow akin to WWE \\"wrestlers.\\" It gets a little heavy on the play by play if you don't know the Texas team, but still a must read for every derby girl, fan, or interested civilian."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rollergirl Dreams","review":"I am SO glad I bought this book. I did not hold out high hopes for a really quality read, but the writing is very entertaining. I'm looking forward to getting Melicious' autograph at the book signing this weekend at the Minnesota RollerGirls bout!MNRG pimping aside, this book is fun and entertaining. It's great for derby fans and non-fans alike, because it's an engaging, easy read that provides a great look into a totally wicked sport."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strong opener...","review":"... and then it kindof goes nowhere terribly interesting.I should probably have read a few more reviews before getting this one. A quick flip through would have revealed that most of the five star ratings come from fellow Derby skaters and fans, and, sure, I can see how this would be a great read for them.But once the successful formation of the new league has been covered, the book wallows around in mundane details that weren't really of very much interest to the average civilian. Pre-game playlists? Favorite rollergirl names? Different personae? Eh.This ain't Friday Night Lights. More's the pity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"While Melicious' book does provide some insight into the modern roller derby revival, \\"Totally True\\" it's not.

The facts that she did select reflect this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I heard the track \\"Lisa Told Me\\" on Mojo Magazine's punk sampler CD and was thoroughly impressed. The aforementioned song is a feedback-laden, rhythmic piece of punk perfection! Not pop at all, but definitely musical. I bought the disc based on this single track...and I think I made a mistake.

(The sounds are great too--very clear so there's no mistaking what they are!) She's educational since little ones can care for her by feeding her and changing her removable diaper. She's exclusive for her color (a kind of almost neon fuscia with bright magenta, pink, and white hair) and she comes with a fabric head band.

The author, a food historian, draws on her many experiences traveling through the continent in this collection of recipes. The recipes are authentic and tasty, and many of them are quite easy to prepare. However, I found a few of them a little unrealistic (such as frying slices of four small eggplants in a single tablespoon of olive oil without so much as soaking them in saltwater first), leaving me wondering to what extent Harris had actually tested the recipes. Nonetheless, overall the book contains many exciting recipes and would make a welcome addition to the library of any adventurous cook."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea, laughable recipes","review":"I read through this book for fun. As an African, many of the recipes have, well, quite obviously not been made by the author but instead garnered from others, errors and all. Which is why she suggests that Nigerians make eba with palm oil... ah. no, no they don't... I doubt they actually incorporate the oil into cassava... not sure how that would work... these and other little quirks made the book funny in a laughable kind of way, but not practical... or accurate really. I do appreciate the idea, and hope a real African who has lived on the continent can make a good cookbook showing different recipes from all over the continent (as herculean a task as that would be) Also, lots of typos... not sure how that's possible in a cookbook...but it happened. Long story short, this is a good book to impress your friends with if you're not African and want to show how diverse your interests are. If you are African, this is a good book to have a laugh at with other Africans."},{"rating":"2","title":"off da chain","review":"Kim Waters, Maysa and crew, beautiful, I love this cd, I've listened to it everyday.

When you read Jack and Kelly's entries, it is mostly a \\"this is what I remember happening and this is how I felt,\\" but with Aimee, she rants on and on with her opinions. She may say that she feels her family is making fools of themselves by doing this show, but I don't think any less of them, and I actually can say that I admire how they've survived all these tragedies.

The main character runs like he's in quicksand. The handling of the cars is like driving a tank. I also hate what they did to my favorite city -- they doubled the number of lanes on each road, for example, in the West Village, they made every street a four-lane highway. I mean, it's just ridiculous --- to the developers: put away the map of NYC, and go back to LA where you think fighting dragons is \\"true crime\\".

In the begginig theres this whole test thing learning how to punch and drive which was just a wast of time. It has some concepts of GTA like taking the people car's although in this game he's a cop himself,so he's exactly stealing the car. By the time you get through those crowded streets on the slow cars to the robber or rapist you already lost. I give it a 2 just because of the graphics if the graphics sucked it would be a -1.

The entire book evolves around her vocation, unbelievable though it is from the 'get-go', and how she 'chooses' it over the love of her life (a taste of which we are given in a very few pages at the end of the book).Our hero is more sympathetic yet more inept.

If it were possible to give NEGATIVE stars, this effort (of lack there of) should be in the double-digits."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good pack","review":"Well, I've looked and looked at numerous backpacks, while trying to find one for my daughter. I currently own this pack (found it on ebay and bought it) didn't know anything about backpacks or hiking, I've had it on three trips already and it's very comfortable, except I did a fifteen miler with it loaded up...probably fifty pounds, after this trip my shoulders hurt a bit, but I think it was due to the weight. I've had two buckles break though. But all in all, a very good pack for the money! And am actually considering buying this same one for my daughter.Pros: Comfortable, easy access to your stuff, hydration bladder compartment, lots of straps and compartments, price.Cons: Buckles and clips could be stronger, top compartment flops around unless cinched tight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it","review":"Very disappointing! The product is over priced for the lack of quality in materials used for construction. This pack was used for a six day trip and was not packed to capacity. It was used to go from the car trunk to the hostel and from the hostel back to the car trunk. Before six days was up, one of the main shoulder straps ripped (essential component to a working backpack) and two of the zippers stopped working. Had this bag been used for true backpacking and I didn't have the luxury of using a car for transporting my needed supplies, I would really be upset."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is a GEM !!!","review":"Among the reasons why it is so immensely valuable includes the fact that NOT everyone will resonate with the approach taken by Esther Hicks or Joe Vitale (or any other author for that matter). The \\"attracting abundance\\" message reaches different people from different directions. The one constant truth is that everyone needs to receive and internalize the teachings Mr. Doyle presents. Is one book covering the subject \\"better\\" than another? How can any one individual decide that for you? Of course they can't. And neither can I. You can though. I found Bob Doyle's treatment of this subject absolutely perfect and suited to MY needs. You may also, you may not. At 16 or so dollars you can afford to find out for yourself - and then pass the book on to someone you care about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"Reading this book was like drinking warm diet coke--flat and artifically sweet. Really just a rehash of the Abraham Hicks/Law of Attraction materials, this books fails to motivate or inspire. Between the plugs for the author's internet program and audio products there is just flat prose. Even the sample meditation is uninspired.The law of attraction has been addressed countless times and this book adds nothing to the mix. If you are seeking a thorough understanding of the law of attraction and techniques to assist you in its mastery, you would be better served by works by other authors, including Esther and Jerry Hicks, Lynn Grabhorn, Michael Losier and Joe Vitale. Avoid this tired retread."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recommend this book","review":"I think this book was well worth the money. It's well-written, easy to understand, and is a quick read. Sure, there are other Law of Attraction books out there--and he gives you a link to eight of his recommendations. I've read a few books on the Law of Attraction and they all have their own mix to add to the pot, so you pull what you need from each one. He also includes an Experiential Meditation for you to record yourself to play back daily which I found helpful. He basically gives you all the tools you need, then it's up to you to put them to use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book emphasising action steps and hurdles","review":"This is a good book on the law of attraction. It takes the material in \\"The Secret\\" to the level of practical application. The author emphasizes the action steps needed to use the law of attraction. He has also dedicated a section on answering questions one might have on using the laws described. I think this book is a must read for anyone starting out on using the law of attraction."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lot of value","review":"Above average insight in this material, which is presented in a fairly straightforward manner.

The book helped inform us of the day-to-day activities of Jesus, and helped us sense his heart as he connected with the people around him. Some of the characters are not actually mentioned in the Bible, but Margaret brought them into the story to make it more real. We better understood the attitudes of various types of people who had contact with Jesus or heard him. We felt that we were over-hearing his close conversations with his heavenly father, and even comments from the unseen angels who were present during all the events of Jesus' life. We would recommend this book for people who have never really read the Bible or for those who want a comprehensive understanding of who Jesus is and what he did while he walked in sandals on the earth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This book was very disappointing to me because I was expecting something substantial and this is just a tiny little book of really short poems.

I loved how well it showed the thoughts of an 11 yo boy becoming a man, looking up to his father, learning from and working side by side his father.

It is nasty, aggressive, and at the same time, very melodic. I can not stop listening to this disc. I think that its his best work to date. If you are a fan of his \\"Extreme\\" work in particular, BUY THIS CD!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT","review":"I can't stop listening to this disc, Nuno's guitar has never sounded better.

It's a shame that he can't shake off the Extreme connection, even years after he's left the band.

Although I enjoyed his last album Schizophonic a little bit more, that's not to say that this disc is not good. Far, far from it. Every song is very good, with a few that are truly amazing, such as \\"All Automatic\\", \\"The Air that you Breathe\\", and my favorite \\"Love Is a Cigarette\\", which boasts a monster guitar solo.

So you what to know about the final weeks of the Petersburg Campaign during the War Bewteen the States. This book gives an in-depth picture of what General Lee had described the previous year as \\"a mere matter of time.\\" The piece is well-documented, which you would expect from the head of the park (the author) where the Federal forces broke through Confederate lines. And there are lots of good maps to follow the action. But, in my opinion, the prose is VERY pedestrian, resulting in a narrative lacking any sense of drama, and therefore is far less than an exciting read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent maps, boring read","review":"I did not have any histories on this last phase of the Petersburg campaign, so I picked up this study. The maps are decent---the best part of the book. However, what just puts me to sleep is Greene's prose. Better take some appropriate medication prior to cracking this one if you want to stay awake! The facts about the campaign and battle are there, but, in my opinion, the read is as dry as dust. This, in turn, renders the book a bore for this reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, a great book on the final days of Petersburg!","review":"Excellent book! If you've liked Gordon Rhea's books on the Overland Campaign then you'll want to add this to your collection. Wilson Greene writes that the final battles of the Petersburg Campaign were not the \\"done deals\\" as most Civil War students seem to think. Even though we know the eventual outcome, the story itself is very suspenseful. Even the footnotes provide valuable information on modern day roads and other books I might have overlooked. The book is filled with details,(including many excellent maps), but never bogs down. I've lived in the Petersburg area for several years and this book has given me a new found appreciation for the area and its history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatness itself - and out of print!","review":"There must be some thing grossly wrong with the classical music world these days.Friedrich Gulda's Beethoven Diabelli Variations is a definitive recording of this work.Maurizio Pollini's version on DG comes really close; but close as it may, it never surpasses Gulda's in the most important aspect. Which?Idiomaticity.Friedrich Gulda grew up with the Viennesse school, whereas Pollini grew up with the Italian maestros. Gulda's is Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven, Schubert. Pollini's is Rossini, Bellini, Verdi, Puccini.What relevance has this to this work? Well, self-evident.Beethoven drawn many folklore and Mozartian materials into this piece. Some variations are borrowed and modified from Mozart's operas. Just compare Gulda's with Pollini's.Then as a matter of pianism, the two are really quite on par with each other.

The music has remained as scintilating throughout most of his career. However, this record is by far his best. Gone are the silly metal riffs. He's closer to goth again, and from what I can tell, his new work does not find favor with the goffs or mansonites as they've come to be called. They look like they tried to be goths but just had fun with mommy's makeup kit, smearing it all over their faces. I'd abandoned Manson for a time, not because the music was particularly bad but because his fans were perceived as unrefined and nothing you'd want to be associated with. I don't mind hard music, but I do mind the kinds of people generally attracted to it. With a move to more articulate music, Manson is in the right direction"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"god is no(w)here\\"","review":"\\"...I like almost every tune on this album because the songs are so original.

This album is no exception. In this album, he takes a more melodic, glam-oriented approach. This should not discourage fans of ANTICHRIST SUPERSTAR. Songs like \\"Rock is Dead\\" and \\"Mechanical Animals\\" still have that hard-driving, guitar-based approach that ANTICHRIST fans have come to love. However, because of its melodic glam flavor, it's guaranteed to attract a new audience of fans to Marilyn Manson's unprecedented talent. I'd recommend this to anyone, even those who've never listened to Marilyn Manson before."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crazy, unselfish usefulness of a divine entity called music.","review":"An absoulte fantastic raw metal sounding album.

Out of all of his songs I've only liked 2, Beautiful People and Dope Show. Dope Shope, I gotta admit is pretty darn good. It's just Marylin Manson that ticks me off. Why does he act so stupid, I mean people that follow his example take drugs or are probably going to end up taking drugs and/or do stuff that is or already did mess up their lives.

If you've always thought Marilyn Manson was a bit too much, this is the album for you. The thing that always kept my generation glued to Manson wasn't the antics, the devil, or the shock value (despite popular belief). It was the sheer musical emotion, and the way lyrics like \\"just a boy, just a little f***ing boy, I can never be a man\\" and \\"You never ever believed in me, I am your tournaquit\\" seemed to echo the feelings we were struggling with.Unless you're a fashion designer, a make-up artist for a movie studio, or a heroin addict stripped of all feeling whatsoever, chances are Marilyn Manson won't say that much that anyone could ever identify with on this release. And as far as cutting edge musicianship.... well, no.Highlghts Rock is Better Than Dead* Great Big White World Low LightsPretty much everything else having anything to do with this album, the tour that follows, or any artwork herein."},{"rating":"1","title":"Average sell-out rock and roll...","review":"Manson's \\"Mechanical Animals\\" is a fair follow-up to his \\"Antichrist Superstar.\\" The album does lack musical talent.

It has a completely different sound than AntiChrist Superstar. No Manson screaming, no pounding guitars...the beats are recycled 80's type techno. Where's the Manson of old? No raw energy on this. It all sounds too musical. Marilyn Manson got millions of fans with AntiChrist Superstar. Great album. Diehard Manson fans won't believe what they are hearing when they get this. It's a totally new sound, and other than Dope Show, there's nothing worth listening to. And that's coming from a longtime Manson fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"close, but no cigar","review":"what's sad about this cd is that brian warner might have had a chance at actually creating a band with talent had he not decided to go the way he has, creating a falsified image of his ideals with a girl's name, weird clothes and promoting himself as an individual while encouraging a cult following. His music is interesting in some asp-ects but talk about wasted potential. He's capitalising on the american teenager's need to be different, an iconolast, an original.

When I heard this album I nearly died of complete disgust. He says that this album is his post inauguration and that he's found where his compromise between the extremes of his soul. Well if it is I guess I won't be buying anymore Marilyn Manson albums. If anything needs to be found it should be Brian Warner, the boy who just loved rock and roll. I think he actually thinks he's his stage name, Marilyn Manson. Before he makes anymore music he needs to find himself because even if Marilyn Manson has come out of his worm stage and gotten his wings, his soul, Brian Warner, is long gone and now feeding the worms."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad","review":"This is sad. Case in point: The excerpt from the Los Angeles Times excerpt was intended as a compliment. It states that this album displays \\"(gasp) human emotion,\\" as if this is some great accomplishment for a musician. The fact that Marilyn Manson finally is displaying a shred of emotion is nothing to praise. It's what music is all about! And let's look for a second at the emotions he is diplaying: hate, jealousy, hopelessness, anger, vengeful thoughts, and rejection of God. Wow, this guy is some great artist, isn't he?The second part of the LA Times excerpt says that this album \\"drips with the seedy sexuality and plush velvet feel that's been absent from 1990s rock.\\" And again, this is supposed to be complimentary to the album?? As if we need more seediness in our music today."},{"rating":"1","title":"You don't have to be a Christian to hate Marilyn Manson.","review":"I know grunge was a reactionary movement, and had to die sooner or later. But hasn't it taught us a few things? Like \\"wearing red jumpsuits with sequins really isn't that cool\\"? This album heralds the return of glam. It is a load of the most prodigious tripe I've ever heard. Sometimes his lyrics seem intriguing, but on closer analysis they all seem to be about selling out, which is pretty corny, and a bit rich coming from this darling of MTV. Manson's excuse for his sensationalism and ludicrous clothing is that he is trying to \\"make people think\\". He comments on commercial by being \\"faker than fake\\". Well it isn't. It's just fake."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best cd","review":"In my opion, This is one of the best cds I have ever had. There is a something for everyone in this.

I would encourge anyone thinking about buying anything by Marilyn Manson, to get this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Uh, yeah...","review":"This album kinda had me worried when I borrowed it off a friend to have a listen before i bought it. There was a strange mix of bowie-style sounds, hard rock, and some old-fashioned depressing tunes. I gotta say, i didn't like what i heard. However, being a Manson fan, i still bought the album anyway. Now, a almost a year on, it remains one of my favourite albums of all time.If you're new to Marilyn Manson, a tatster of his music, this album IS NOT for you. get Antichrist Superstar, or, even better, Holywood [*****]. But, if you like Bowie, if you're a Manson fan, or if you're a fan of strange music, get it now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mar1lyn Man5on has outdone himself, and is better than ever.","review":"Marilyn Manson has a new theme for his new albums. The songs are incredible! They talk about the ills of society and of celebrity in a truthful, explicit manner. This is something hardcore Manson fans will want to listen to for themselves!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not half bad, not half good either","review":"Marilyn Manson reminds you of that famous quote--was it H.L. Mencken who said it?--\\"Never underestimate the stupidity of the American public.\\" Let's add to that, \\"especially the stupidity of American teenagers.\\" Manson's industrial-terror stuff was really tedious, but at this point in the game the man really should get his own tunes. If it's David Bowie you want then, for God's sake, buy Ziggy Stardust. Pissing off Christian America is hardly an accomplishment, either. Gay America does that easily enough, and for reasons that are far more important and meaningful."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Luv Mechanical Animals especially \\"The Dope Show\\"","review":"I luv Marilyn Manson for a long time. I didn't like him at first until one of my friends got me hooked and I now that is what we listen to at parties and if I could rate any higher I would give it a ten!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning:","review":"This is a well written book that will probably help if you have a child that is mildly challenging. If you know or suspect your child has oppositional defiant disorder, get professional help."},{"rating":"1","title":"More of the same","review":"This book is the same as everything else that Dr. Barkley has written. There is nothing new here. It is all negative. \\"Your kid is a monster\\" attitude. Give him drugs and he will be fine. Don't waste your money. I want something more positive and helpful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good starter book","review":"This is a good book to read. It gives good pointers in helping children who are defiant."},{"rating":"2","title":"A well balanced approach","review":"Russ Barkley has a good sense of how children behave and why, which allows him to develop good strategies for helping children learn how to be compliant. I really appreciate that he first teaches the parents/care providers, to catch the child being good and working on increasing the frequency of those observations. He then has one focus on how to target behaviors that need modification and goes through how to set up a clear system of expectations and consequences. The use of a token system allows a visual for the child to monitor his/her progress. All of us do better if we have something to work for, even a paycheck, so providing a list of incentives/rewards for children struggling to behave is no different.Parents, teachers, and othe childccare providers will all benefit from learning these techniques in the order that he has presented them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a big hit in our household","review":"This is just another rehashing of the same old reward and punishment doctrine. There's little new or fresh here...in fact, the strategies in this book actually made things worse. Not the book to read if you're looking for real help with a child who hasn't responded to traditional \\"good discipline.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Needed this a long time ago....","review":"Very insightful, informative, and direct. I am encouraged by the content. I have not completely read the book yet, as I am practicing while I read but am very encouraged."},{"rating":"1","title":"Look for something else.","review":"This has terrible motion blur in fast-moving scenes (or even medium-speed scenes), due to its high 12ms pixel response time. It is also very difficult to see detail in low-lit scenes, due to its 800:1 contrast ratio. In dark scenes, distinguishing what is going on is impossible. This TV was a huge disappointment. After doing much research, I have learned that you need 8ms or lower pixel response time to avoid motion blur on LCDs and contrast ratio at least 10,000:1 (recommended). Try to look for those two features (among others) when choosing an HDTV. This particular Sharp model is very basic. You could find better quality for your money with a different HDTV."},{"rating":"1","title":"SHARP LCD TV, LC-32SH20U","review":"I bought this model in Sept. 2006 and within 18 months it started to fail upon power up. After several tries it would finally become functional. The screen posts a \\"please wait\\" message. Now, after a little over 27 months it is permantly in-operable. The same message is on the screen. While this tv has a nice screen, good resolution, etc. it is worthless when it won't come on. Poor reliability!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality, poor service","review":"I bought a sharp lcd tv from j& r in new york last Jan, after a year and half, when powering on the tv, sometimes works, sometimes not. after unplug in, wait for a while and plug back, worked for a couple months. Send it to service center to checkup, was told that the lcd control board needs to be replaced. when request to get back the replaced lcd control board, was told that sharp does not give back the replaced board, it has to be shipped back, otherwise, you have to pay additional fee to get back the replaced board.. it's rather strange to hear such a lousy policy from any vendor..But, if you do want to get a sharp, better get a long long warranty.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating","review":"First of all, my 7 year-old was VERY revved up about this! She is a complete Potter-nut, and was looking forward to trying this on her brand new Wii. Well, it was hard. The game starts with the death-eater attack in the underground walkway from the movie, before you have any clue how to fight them. After repeated attempts, we settled on waving our arm/controller vehemntly in the air and pushing buttons, and that worked. Then you are brought to Sirius Black and friends, and are made to practice different tasks, which works, kinda, but it's all very.. imprecise. Then you start walking around the school, at which point we were tired of it all, and just moved around to get the feel for things. We have to give it and ourselves more time learning it all, but the games I've played before have been more intuitive. Frustrating that what must surely be the target audience, finds it too difficult."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying playability","review":"Vastly inferior to the HBP game. Tough to even move or inspect anything with Ron and Hermione constantly in the way. Constant nagging to complete the current task makes the mute button your best friend. Only the Gobstone and Wizard Chess games are truly fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like many others, full of refined sugar","review":"I bought this for my daughter who is suffering with malabsorption. She gains weight on this formula but due to loads of corn syrup solids (refined sugar), her temperament was very poor and her eczema was also exacerbated on this formula. I find it shocking that so many infant formulas on the market contain such awful ingredients."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Stuff","review":"Daughter diagnosed with Failture to Thrive. This is the only thing that is working. Too bad insurance doesn't pay a dime to cover this medically necessitated formula"},{"rating":"1","title":"no good for babies with eczema","review":"My son has severe eczema and I tried many different formulas. I was told by a good friend that elecare was a really good product and should try it. My son's eczema got WORSE.. I spent alot of money with no results. If your child has eczema this product may not work for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a MUST HAVE CD!","review":"I normally don't listen to rap, but this caught my attention on the radio stations, and after really listening to the words, and the beats, I simply had to have it. The Artist sends a realistic message to all children of their father's love and determination to be with them. It also had a lot of upbeat tunes. My favorites are, \\"It's Nothin\\", and \\"Sweetlife\\". I listen to them at work. They especially pick me up when I'm working long hours. Overall, it's one of the best CD's I've purchased this year!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap Quality. Chairs Not As Pictured","review":"These Chairs are pictured as Arrowback Chairs but what is shipped is a substitute. The chairs are cheaply made and they shorted me the hardware for the 4th chair. Rough paint not smooth as they should be. . Look closely and you'll see some spots where wood shows thru paint. Moshya Home Furniture does not return phone calls or answer phone. Amazon's A-Z team also will not speak to customer 1 on 1. My research shows Moshya Home Furniture has issues with other customers as well.Also the seat is thin not formed for comefort. Feels like sitting on a thick piece of plywood..I kid you not. Anyone know where I can buy a GOOD quality set of Windsor Arrowback chairs ?
