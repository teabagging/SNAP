My head hurts","review":"Well, I'm very happy about two things, 1) it was free, 2) it was only an hour long.Any John Lennon fan would find this hurtful. Why would they release this? My favourite part has to be the horrible music that fills the soundtrack because they couldn't afford Beatles or Lennon music. Worst of all is the band trying to recreate a song that they only know the title of. Well they don't create anything good. They think that \\"In Spite of all the Danger\\" is a John Lennon song, but anyone who owns the Beatles Anthology can tell you that it's a McCartney/Harrison composition... which was not lost and is widely available on that CD collection! They spend a third of the time talking about the arse who killed Lennon, but if you're going to do a documentry on this blow hole, perhaps use some compassion and make an interesting film about mental illness.

I have seen the press conferences where Helen Thomas closes the session. She certainly had a lot of experience with the various Presidents. However, the jokes were few and far between. In fact, Ms. Thomas seems fixated with herself.She often included less than humorous interactions with her and the various Presidents (Bush I's dog and her as an example). She also seems partisan to the Democrats than Republicans. At the end, I had far too few instances of humor in this book.This is not a great read. It seems as if it is just an additional book from the leftovers of her first book. Look elsewhere for memories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Book","review":"This isn't a book - just a bunch of somehwhat biased anecdotes strung together. Helen must have needed the money.

Real people, real houses - not impossible to live with Architectural Digest layouts. One of the few books I have seen that shows everyday (almost - these are sort of trendy ie bohemians of the title) people in their own homes. Ms. Bestor includes not only Silver Lake but the surrounding areas like Atwater and Echo Park to give a glimpse of the entire area. As for the inclusion of shops and restaurants that Mr. Burgundy so disliked - this is the world Ms. Bestor knows and has included in her book of Silverlake so the reader can acknowledge Silver Lake as a whole, not just a series of houses. If that (famed architectural houses) is what you want buy a book on Neutra or Schindler. If you want a taste of the real Silver Lake, but this. PS - I don't know any of these people so my review has no hidden motive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice book","review":"Graphically interesting and architecturally significant picture book.The line drawings are whimsical and enhance the overall idea of the book...which is that modern architecture in a warm climate creates this unique, warm and intertesting environment. This book illustrates the warmth, charm and social connected-ness of modern architecture given a self-selecting artistic, creative community. It is the antipode to so many of the dreary, static, and people-less coffee table books on modern architecture. The author's friends seem to be the kind of people you see in Dwell magazine, casual and style-conscious, but not obviously pretentious. This book is much better than Dwell, because the emphasis is more on improvised-rehab of modern dwellings, than Dwell's push to sell so many new Modern commodities, products, and style."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bohemian Modern: Loads of pleasing photos","review":"The book offers a great visual journey into the BOHOMO style"},{"rating":"1","title":"Theres got to be something better.","review":"While this product works, it is cheaply made. Construction is all plastic and it seems to be crudely molded at that. It is very heavy for use on a handheld video camera. Don't let the 20 watt rating fool you. It is very bright, so my subjects often complained about the glare. Sturdiness is a word that can't be used with this product. I dropped it on the floor while trying to attach it to my camera and the case popped open and the light bulb broke rendering it useless. Part of the fault is the clumsy method for securing this thing to the light shoe. There has to be a better way than the screw-type fastener they use.I'm going to give the 3-watt SL-9 a try and forget about this thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Item","review":"If your a lover of Batman and Robin Collectibles then you have to add this to your collection.

Thanks for your help on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good, but not great","review":"'Gin' Sanders gives some good advice in this book but there is also alot of fluff and just plain nonsense about why one should eat healthy. For instance she continually writes about how certain foods and ways of eating are 'tacky'. While that may be true, real data on the health benefits of the French diet is probably more helpful than being judgemental. I would recommend Clower's The Fat Fallacy over this."},{"rating":"2","title":"better than the french fads","review":"This book is so much better than most of the \\"french\\" diets out now. It basically follows the same principles, eat whatever you want in moderation, minus the condescending \\"french\\" attitude.

Even her section of how to eat chocolate is strangely reminisant of Will Clower's (The Fat Fallacy) Chocolate Eating Lessons concept.She makes umpteen references to the French and how they eat -- which I am sure she got from French Women Don't Get Fat.She isn't sure which book she is writing - her Wear More Cashmere book or this one. This book has a few too many references to the Cashmere book not to feel like an advertisement for it. The exercise portion isn't very practical -- unless you have a pool, a dance partner, fencing studio or horse stabled nearby.

As Katrina was just getting to the point where she was realizing her feelings for Raf, he brought home an old flame (who turned out to be a flicker). Normally, when it's not about us, women can clearly see that if a man had wanted to marry his ex, he would have jumped at the first opportunity or waited until the end of time.

If I had known about the brakes ahead of time, I would have paid more and purchased a different bike that was safer for my child."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective and maybe dangerous: bent front fork & sketchy brakes","review":"I decided to risk the packaging issues reported by other buyers. The box showed up with one corner torn and a few punctures on the sides but nothing appears to be missing.I set out to assemble the bike and noticed that the front fork seems bent together and the wheel hub will not fit in the drop outs. With steel, I would hope I can bend it open enough to accept the wheel but I'm frustrated. There were also a few small defects in the paint that seemed to be factory issues.I anticipate that the brakes could be dangerous. The tension spring is very loosely seated in the caliper. When I tested it, it popped out of the brake. As a result, I expect the spring to detach while riding and make braking difficult. Since there's no coaster brake, this could be dangerous for a child, who's likely to be riding their first bike.I hope to update this review if I can address the fork issue but I would encourage parents to stay away from this bike."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get the CD from RebeccaHelmer.com.

It seems that the authors tried to present Romania from a subjective Hungarian point of view. Ideas like \\"the great Magyar cities of Targu Mures, Cluj and Oradea\\" or \\"the largely Hungarian Csango and Szekelyfold regions\\" not only that should have been avoided but the historic true must have been presented. These ideas basically question the Romanian authority over this land. There are cities/regions in Romania inhabited by Magyars or hungarians minorities but that does not mean that you can label a city/region as being Magyar. The Magyars or Huns did not build these cities or originally own the land. They migrated here. Can you name Leeds as \\"the great Pakistani city? What about Marseilles: \\"the great Moroccan city\\"?

Of course, I love Jane Porter's story, but this edition is definitely poor. My 12 year old daughter has enjoyed our Scribner's Illustrated edition and was looking for a birthday present for a friend. Since the Scribner's is no longer in print we thought perhaps this would do (the price was right). However, for $18, I was really disappointed. The text is so poorly printed that it is hard to read in some places. The tops of some letters are cut off. Others are, randomly, either very faint or very boldly printed.

If you're looking for a good biography, you won't find it here. What you will find in this book is plenty of fluff and flattery. The message is repetitious - Macfadden was an early 20th century version of Abraham Lincoln - a self-made man who raised himself from humble beginnings to greatness. The purpose of this biography and the others was to convince the public that Macfadden would be a great choice for president - the office which he aspired to hold, but never had a chance of winning. The book is interesting from the stand point of being a propaganda piece."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not sure what audience this book is for.","review":"This book was fair.

This book has the feel of a rough draft. The chapters don't flow in a logical order and you have to spend way too much time in the first few chapters flipping to chapters near the end to accomplish anything. Most of the step-by-step instructions are wrong and missing critical information. The humor, which is the hallmark of the series, is contrived and pathetic. In my opinion, this book was written by the author for a quick buck and accepted by IDG to plug a gap in their market. The only reason I gave this book 2 stars is because it does come with an excellent companion CD.

It's only a matter of time before these guys become HUGE!My favorite tracks are: Walk Away, Historypeats, Find The Words, Time And Time AgainSo be sure not to skip this release or you'll be missing out on some great music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh So Good","review":"The first time I ever heard of Mad at Gravity was on a radio show late at night. As soon as I heard the song Walk Away I was hooked. I went out and bought the album from a cd store around midnight after I heard the song, I was just that impressed. It seems I've been waiting for a band with Mad at Gravity's raw power for an eternity. Everything is perfect from the deep, powerful lyrics which are excellently delivered to the dynamic guitar parts. I remember hearing the song Say It and thinking, wow, just wow.The bottom line is, I havent heard an album this good since Relationship of Command by At The Drive In. But to my hearts dismay, I found out Mad at Gravity broke up just as I got into them. Its just a shame that such a new and talented band had to seperate. But dont let that stop you from owning this album, or youll be kicking yourself later."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Yourself a Favor and Stay Away!!!!!","review":"I really don't see anything good about this band. Sure the songs are sort of catchy and sort of good, but really there is no distinction between them and any other band. The guitar parts sound generic, the vocals average, and the lyrics get lost in the middle. I've seen this band live, as an opener for Jerry Cantrell and I was in a virtual hell living through 12 of these bland and uninteresting songs.Do yourself a favor and pick up the 30 Seconds to Mars CD - if you want to here originality, talent, soaring vocals, and some of the most melodiously crafted songs, all written by one man give that one your money. You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"careful, its not origional","review":"I am amazed at these early 5 star reviews. There is an album called \\"Make Yourself\\" by Incubus. It did what a lot of bands are trying to do right now because they want in on the action. It frustrates me how this album mimics Hoobastank which mimics Incubus soo well. Are you guys eating the same food out there in CALI? Why the few stars?1. no creativity, the song structures are very simple and predictable.2. I found \\"walk away\\" to be magnificant acoustic and it pails as a studio track. Its a 3 star song while all the others are 2's and 1's.3. the lyrics are conversation and thoughtless...\\"check your intent\\" \\"would you laugh or would you fall to pieces?\\" I think they are laughing at me for buying their album personally.4. there are better similar albums out there IMO that just came out! hint: audiovent, our lady peacebuy Faith No More first, then pick up the photo-copies.Sorry guys, I really wanted to like this CD, but I don't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Careers for introverts are obviously very limited","review":"I was extremely disappointed with this book. There are only SEVEN careers mentioned!! Now, I KNOW there are more career choices than that for introverts. Plus, a few of the ones listed (writer, artist) are extremely difficult to make a decent living out of. Let me save you some money and time; the careers listed are writer, artist, freelance researcher, computer professional, security guard, forest ranger, and mail carrier. If none of these appeal to you, don't even bother with the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"too limited, disappointing","review":"This book only gives a few limited ideas for careers and those careers are typically low-paying jobs. Maybe one is supposed to extrapolate other career ideas from the few listed. Several choices that I thought would be included are not even mentioned in passing, such as scientist & librarian. And some of the choices have a very narrow context. Artisan is a good idea, but there are very few places to do this.This book was very disappointing. Maybe someone else will write a better version."},{"rating":"1","title":"you forgot another one","review":"I work as a dishwasher and i bet i make more than the average writer/artist. i keep my back to everyone and pretty much amloved by all because i never complain. i just work and go home.depending on restaurant and city you can do pretty well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Professional hitman left off list","review":"Did we need a book for this? I've thumbed this book in mild, introverted amusement a couple of times, but really, it doesn't tell you anything you can't find on a website out there.It could be that half the people you work with at your job are, in fact, introverts, and they're doing whatever you're doing. It's not a disease, and people can adapt.And frankly, it's all fine and good to say 'be a writer' or 'be an artist', but that hardly helps as these are professions one rarely can plan out with any certainty unless they are in the service of something other than yourself.A couple of professions are suspiciously missing, though I guess they have their reasons. Professional mercenary might be good (if you're into that sort of thing) or professional hitman, since that seems like an area you can have plenty of alone time as you trail a potential target or intimidate witnesses.Surprisingly, truck driver is missing, though mail service is included. Go figure."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have, best recording of Princess Ida","review":"This is a must have. Though lacking the dialogue it isn't missing a thing. The music is all beautiful and recorded well with the exception of King Gama in the first scene when he sings, \\"perhaps if you address the lady\\" it sounds distant. But this is one of Gilbert and Sullivans greatest works especially Sullivans. Some of his most unique and breathtaking music is in this opera.

I like that this one is clear but the divides between the compartments are open on the bottom so the shoes can slip around between the different compartments which defeats the whole purpose. I wish the bottoms of the dividers were attached to the bottom of the chest and the plastic was a little more sturdy. The design is good but the execution and material is very poor. I use it but regularly find my shoes mixes in all together and less than organized."},{"rating":"2","title":"Functional but not the best construction","review":"Having read about the lack of sturdiness in this product before hand, I am really careful when I use it and all is well. However, I wish the dividers were a little stiffer. This can be solved by keeping your shoes in the shoe boxes before putting them in the organizer though. It certainly works as a great under bed storage for my shoes though.

It is great for the youngest to oldest elementary students and is a nice reference book to have when curriculum needs a pick-me-up. I needed to read most of the text to get a foundation behind the lessons suggested, but it was a quick read. Now I can flip through in a few minutes to find a lesson idea that fits my need. Students need more movement with less seat work and this book will help get everyone in motion!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Uneven and poor sound","review":"This is one of the worst Christmas collections I've come across. Most of the older songs sound like they were extracted from old, worn-out, nth-generation television and film soundtracks, and the newer songs... well, what are The Miracles and that odd, synthesizer/drum machine Drifters song doing on the same CD with old Bing Crosby and Gene Autrey tracks?? It makes no sense.I don't remember how I got hold of this - I hope I didn't pay for it. I don't think it's worth even a penny. Just awful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the price","review":"I bought this at a great sale price and I'm very happy with the product. It only has two aluminum poles and it goes up very fast. The fly keeps it dry when it rains. There is enough room for two twin matresses side by side but not much more. I expect it would fit a queen mattress well with room on the side or base for luggage. Very lightweight! The fly design is fantastic for keeping items outside the tent sheltered from incliment weather. Don't forget a ground cloth or tarp though. This doesn't come with one. Only problem I had was the stitching in one pocket that holds the pole came loose hence the pole slid through and back out. I jury-rigged it on the site, and restitched it when I came home. Aside from that, its a very good product!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pack size","review":"For anyone curious about the pack size of the tent, I emailed Eureka and was told 6\\" x 24\\"I rate only 1 star b/c I have not purchased yet.

Three people can sleep in it, but I've found it best for 2 people because then there's still room for all of your stuff (or a dog. lol). I've used it for 3 years, and it never disappoints. I've been in one good thunderstorm in it, and it did great and didn't leak at all. It's very easy to set up, (especially when you arrive at your site after dark). It vents really well, but best if you face the vented side into the wind. Just don't forget to open out the little cross vent (with the \\"!\\") on the other side. The inside pockets are really handy, and I think you can get a \\"net\\" that you can hang from above for more storage."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't waste your time","review":"This film is like a poor middle school production. The lighting, acting, and writing were horrendous. The story of a boring man whose only claim to preaching is a literal and unenthusiastic interpretation. It is a stereotype of people who think they can read the Bible anyway they want to. I wouldn't bother showing this film -- if it can be called one -- to my dog. It would inspire a believer of Jesus to become an atheist. I would ask for my money back, but then I would have to let people who know my real name know that I purchased it.

It is beautiful wood, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kensington CD Cleaner Leaves Scratches On CDs","review":"The circular disc inside the unit that cleans the cd has a very thin and narrow strip of cloth attached to foam on it. Even the least amount of pressure when cleaning a cd will leave scratches on the cd. This is because the cloth/foam piece is easily pushed inside the plastic circle, and that plastic on the circle ends up touching the cd and scratching it while you are cleaning it. I recommend using cd cleaners that have wide and thick cleaning pads that cannot be pushed into the object holding it. I've also noticed that the wider pads clean the cds better and don't get dirty/worn out as quickly as the thin, narrow ones do. My personal favorite is the Scotch Disc Cleaner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Emmylou Harris & Carl Jackson Memories","review":"As an avid Emmylou Harris fan, I feel deceived.

Based on the negative reviews, I had some concern about the appearance of the fountain and the amount of noise it might make. After actually buying and setting it up, I am quite satisfied with the fountain. It is more solid-feeling than I expected, was easy to set up, runs quietly, and actually looks nice. The box included plenty of smooth rocks, which I have supplemented with some rocks and shells from the beach. As noted in other reviews, it is a one-sided fountain, i.e. it is intended to be viewed from one side-- this works quite well on a shelf or against a wall, but might not work so well on a table where it could be viewed from all sides. A couple of minor issues: to adjust the pump speed, you have to take out all the rocks and slates to reach the pump. And, I have not (yet) had to clean it, but again, will have to take everything out to do so. Overall, this purchase exceeded my expectations for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"HoMedics WFL-ROC Envirascape Illuminated Rock Garden Relaxation Fountain","review":"I have been using this water fountain for over 3 months and really loved it.

This water fountain satisfies my requirements. So for that matter, I don't care if it was made of plastic or steel. the assembly was simpble. When in operation, the unit is totally quiet.

When I took it out of the box and had all of the peices it was obvious that it was cheaply made because one of the pieces was already broken. I finally glued it together and put it together and turned it on when I realized how loud the motor was. I left and came back about and hour later and there was water everywhere! The bottom level/slate thing splashes water out and there is a big puddle when it is done. Becuse of it constanly splashing water out, it runs out of water very quickly and needs to be refilled often. Another thing is that the light in the fountian dosn't have a seperate switch so if you want to go to bed with it on you have to have the light on while you are trying to go to sleep. I ended up completly taking the light out (which was a hassle) and with all of the other problems on top of that, I finally threw it out. I would strongly recomend finding a different product to buy instead of this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"lovely rock waterfall","review":"I simply love this little rock waterfall.

I wish I could have opened it before purchase!The base is the cheapest plastic I've ever seen and is so flimsy that I question its ability to hold water. What looked like an attractive pseudo-metal base would not have been acceptable as a dog dish: mold marks were evident and were not lined up, the untrimmed edges were ragged and sharp, and none of its colors are found in nature. Overall the effect was disgusting.The fountain was returned immediately so I cannot attest to its \\"calming\\" sound or flow rate. Considering what came out of the box, it could not have been good.

It wasn't noisy when I had it on the middle pump setting. Also, when positioned just right, it looked less cheap and flimsy.However, it's a little annoying to put together and a bunch of the rocks fall through to the bottom.If that was all I would have gave it three or possibly four for being decent while under $20. However, when the motor just flat out died in less than four weeks of only using it three hours a day, I got completely annoyed by the thing.I think they should have at least made the motor better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money...","review":"I have to agree with the people who said this is very cheap. I had an old fountain which the pump went on, it was a beautiful pottery bowl with beautiful smooth stones in it. This one look nice from the image but when I got it home i found it to be VERY cheaply made. The water needs to be refilled all the time because the reservoir is so small. The slate stones feel almost plastic and do not go all the way around. They are barely strong enough to hold up the small stones that come with it. The water flow is very low even on the highest setting.

No matter how I arranged the rocks. Works nothing like the picture. The bottom rim isn't wide enough to avoid any spillage. The pump is weak. You can hear the the sound of the water, but it just works nothing like a few trickles here and there.

It had a bit about the car, and a few interesting pages of historical overview of what the main players (Tojeiro, Shelby, and AC) were up to before the Cobra project.The problem is that once the book got to what should be the meat of the story, it devolved to a \\"this person drove that car is this race, and experienced blah blah blah DNF\\".While I realize that the Shelby's whole motivation was to go racing, I was expecting a more reasonable balance between information about the car and the races.There were a few redeeming characteristics of the book. A few interesting photographs of the frames, some assembly line photos, and assembly-line information about all the orginal Cobras.Bottom line, get this book if you are interested in the racing history.

The characters were so real and down to earth, when I got to the end of the book, I just wanted more and more. The next day I went out and got me a tatoo of a butterfly on my right shoulder. I recommend this book to all my friends. July cannot get here fast enough for Liar Liar."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheaters! Definitely worth reading!","review":"This is the first book I've ever read by Eric Jerome Dickey. It won't be the last! Cheaters is one of the must funny and romantic books I've ever read. The characters were real and exciting. Every chapter was a surprise that kept me wanting to read even more. I ready 75% of the book in one night and had finished the entire book by the following day. Stephan and Chante, the two main characters, were really well defined characters. I love the way he brought them all together. I was a bit surprised by the ending, but non the less pleased. If the rest of Mr. Dickey's books are like this one, I look forward to reading them all!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A EXCELLENT BOOK FROM AN EXCELLENT AUTHOR....","review":"Cheaters by Eric Jerome Dickey is the first novel I read of his and I am glad to say it lived past my expectations... The novel was wondefully written. The characters jumped right off the page with its carefully woven situations.

The story seemed off to a slow start and did'nt begin to get really good until almost the end. So Eric, if you read these reviews you might want to think about a 'Cheaters II'??...Maybe...huh...huh...maybe? I for one would really enjoy that. In this age of people being so in a hurry, I can appreciate a writer who takes his/her time to entertain me for my hard earned $17.-$20. You're one of those authors that you don't have to read a review and then decide if you should buy the book. When a new one comes out you just go and get it, because you know it's going to be good. To me that says a lot. Keep up the good work."},{"rating":"2","title":"move over E. Lynn I am about to start cheating","review":"Real characters that I could relate to both male and female.

It is one the best books I ever read. The author makes you think you are a fly on the wall in each sentence and description of the book.

I disagreed with the author's note that read \\"Did ya see the word FICTION on the cover?\\" because he should have said it was a fairy tale. The characters and their actions were totaly unbelieveable...especially the women that were depicted.

I WENT ON A WEEKEND GETAWAY WITH A FEW OF MY GIRLFRIENDS AND I READ THE BOOK MOST OF THE WEEKEND. I WAS SO ENGROSSED IN MY BOOK THAT ONE OF MY GIRLFRIENDS STARTED READING IT WHEN I TOOK BRAKES. ON OUR WAY HOME FROM OUR GETAWAY I HAD TO DRIVE FOR 2-1/2 HOURS. MY GIRLFRIEND STARTED READING MY BOOK AND WHEN WE MADE IT BACK HOME SHE DID NOT WANT TO GIVE THE BOOK BACK. ALSO, I WENT TO ERIC'S BOOK SIGNING IN SAN FRANCISCO SO MY BOOK IS AUTOGRAPHED BY ERIC WHICH MAKES IT IS VERY SPECIAL.

None of the jokes seem contrived; they are fresh and wickedly funny. I am grateful that such an author exists to provide escapism from our safe and predictable worlds, to a world like that of Stephan, Chante, Tammy, and Darnell. Funny lines aside, I see that Eric is progressively honing his craft, getting more astounding with each novel, carving out his own niche, and creating a following perhaps rivaled by few. He deserves all the accolades (oops, along with his editor, agent, publicist, grandmother, people who make No-Doz, Bill Gates and/or Steve Jobs, Hewlett Packard, FedEx, AOL, the unemployment office, God, the girls in the balcony, etc.). Keep typing away EJD, and we will laugh, enjoy, and marvel at your works for years to come."},{"rating":"1","title":"How about Sleepers!","review":"This is the first book that I have read by Eric Dickey.

I am an avid reader and this was the first book of his that I had read and the first book that I have ever read twice. Since Cheater's I have been reading all of his work. I THINK I'M IN LOVE! The story line was amazing and I loved how he threw in spats of comedy \\"somebody get me some pants!\\" Not only did I laugh but I cried a little too, I learned a lot about myself and others.

Outstanding!!","review":"Eric provides yet another successful and very real tale of black love. This book is wonderfully written. It puts you in the life of each character. I can not wait for the next novel. I have read each one of his novels and he is without a doubt, a talent to watch out for and support completely! The love scenes are so full of imagination and passion, coupled with the fact that they are from a man's perspective, makes for an awesome \\"out of body\\" experience in erotica and passionate romance. Eric, I hope you read this review..because you need to know you are a magnificent model for all black men in the art of passion.

The e-mail informed me that Eric Jerome Dickey was coming out with a new book in July. Needless to say, I am a big fan of his work, and I anxiously waited for the book to come out and the day it came out I brought it. The book was GREAT!!!. When I picked it up I couldn't put it down.

Great book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not his best","review":"Eric has horrible ending for all his books. I love his books, but they are all starting to sound alike."},{"rating":"2","title":"4 Out Of 5 Stars","review":"I picked up this book as soon as I had put down Milk in My Coffee. I read Between Lovers awhile back. I love the book because it gives you a little insight on the way men think. It also gives you insight on why sometimes women change. My favorite character was Chante, mostly because I was feeling the way she looked at life. My less favorite character was Karen.An issue that Dickey brought up was one that I don't often read about. He brought the issue up through Darnell. People who I talked to felt that Darnell was wrong for doing what he did, but I felt him. People change.The book doesn't get a perfect five because like the others I have read by him, he gives too much details for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good book","review":"Great story from start to finish. Loved it! Has love passion & some very good highlighted passages. Going to load up on more books by Eric Jerome Dickey"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good","review":"At this point I've read five out of the eight novels written by Eric Jerome Dickey. This one isn't my favorite, but it's a solid book. I liked how he told the story from the perspective of several different characters, however this one is a little formulaic to me since he does the character change thing in two other novels that I've read (Liar's Game, Friends and Lovers).Still, this is a good book. It has some great life lessons for people who think that they are \\"players\\". It gives women a realistic peek into the lives of cheating men.My personal favorites by Dickey (thus far) are Between Lovers and (my ultimate favorite) The Other Woman. I look forward to future novels by Dickey. He's definitely one of my favorite writers."},{"rating":"2","title":"FAV. BOOK","review":"Eric Jerome Dickey has did it again. Cheaters is a must have for the year. I love this book, i know it like the back of my hand. I've read it five times already and steady reading it. I've shared this book with all my family and friends. They love it as well, I loved Chante she was the best character of them all. She was very realistic she reminded me of my aunt. So everyone this a book you should have on your book shelf.

This book had trust, distrust, loyalty, commitment, and everything else in a relationship. This book expressions that not only men cheat, but women too. It's a great example of how life and relationship is in a real world. In CHEATERS Eric Jerome Dickey paints a sassy, sexy portiat of men, women, and modern morals__in a high-spirited roller-coaster ride of a novel about the risks and rewards of falling in love.NIcholett J. 5th PROSSER H.S"},{"rating":"2","title":"Home sick for LA freeways and plent of drama in my life.","review":"When I started reading Cheaters, women would walk up to me out of the blue, just to tell me how much they enjoyed the book I was reading. I was in the first few chapters, and really didn't quite understand why my reading was being disrupted by others. Well...I am hear to say, Jerome has got it going on! I plan to read each and every book he has written, in order. This book gave me reasons to re-visualize the commute I once had just to find, keep, and have love, sex, or anytype of relationship while living in Palmdale, CA. Most of all I appreciate the insight Jerome has given to his book from a Black Man's point of view."},{"rating":"2","title":"EJD just keeps it real","review":"From the moment I read Milk in my coffee, I was ready for Cheaters and EJD delivers..

Eric Jerome Dickey has won me over as fan, lock, stock and barrel. I've read each of his works and I have yet to be dissatisfied. They're such page-turners, I've finished within four days of picking them up. He brings the characters to life like I've never seen....So much, that I miss them once I have finished reading. I simply love his work!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book was the awesome!","review":"Mr. Dickey you have outdone yourself with this book. I can totally relate with the charaters in this book. Can't wait till your next bestseller comes out.

I hope that Mr. Dickey continues to write books of this caliber!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable!!!","review":"I have read all of Eric Jerome Dickey's books. He continues to develop his skill as a writer, and \\"Cheaters\\" is no exception. The characters are well developed, and one can easily relate to them. I highly recommend, it is a good read!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"YOU GOT ME HOOKED!","review":"EJD - you've truly outdone yaself on this one. I have read all of your books to date except liar's game. I really like all the characters, and your descriptions of the locales were great. Made me feel like i was in LA. Loved the characters, as they were easy to relate with. I liked how you let Stephan and Chante deal with their past loves, and relationships, and i was also \\"hollering\\" and \\"laughing\\" when reading certain scenes in this book. Loved the sexy erotic scenes, and just loved who your characters did things that really surprised me. So, i'd suggest anyone read your books. You take relationships and take them apart dissect them, and get to the bare bone issues. That's what i like about all of your stories. So, to the bookstore i'll go to get liar's game, and then exhale."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeps going and going...","review":"I picked up this book because I had read the other EJD books and hadnt read one in a while. If I didnt have to go to work, I probably would not have dropped the book because it reads very fast.He does a great job with the characters and one can readily identify with the characters and their struggles. The characters go through what many go through though in different degrees, from Chante who struggles with defining what she wants from a relationship and with who to Darnell who in his typical male behaviour does not voice his concerns with his wife until it is too late. The book also shows how guys in general tend to cover for themselves when they \\"play\\" women in their relationships and how women (a la Karen and Chante) seem to compete for the same pool of men often leading to petty jealousies and back stabbing attitudes.I finished the book yesterday and bought his new book Liar's Game today and I hope that proves to be a good read as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"If this book was not meant to be taken too seriously then the author has done quite well. Otherwise I found the main characters shallow and boring. I also felt that the sexual encounters described in practically every chapter obscured a poor story line and plot. In short, this book is for people who like soap operas or a quick light read at the beach."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easily Dickey's best book! IMO","review":"I've read five novels by EJD. I started with Friends & Lovers which was really good. But this one is his best effort. Mainly because of the way each character is drawn out to look at each of their lives and make a choice to change. Parts of the book to me were touching(and it didn't even involve the main two characters). That's also a great thing about the book. The fact that his side characters have stories of their own. Friends and Lovers did that too, but not on the scale in this book. And in the conclusion, the book does flip on you, but if you know the value of never letting your dreams go, it will all make sense."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Couldn't put it down\\".","review":"Eric Jerome Dickey's characters literally come to life on each and every page. Family, friends, lovers, relationships, sex...........this book covers it all, and in an intelligent, thought-provoking manner for the ongoing Mars vs. Venus dialogue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"Eric Jerome Dickey has done it again. He is the man. I think the book does a fantastic job of describing the circles in which many run in. Another great thing about the book is that it shows typical white collar people doing what many think is reserved for the young and ghetto. It breaks down that stereotype. The brotha is a great writer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT!!!","review":"EJ, has done it again!!! This book is a MUST read and I could not put it down until I finished.

I had a friend give me the book Friends and Lovers, read that in a day, went to the book store and purhcased the others. I cannot wait till his next one is out. What an inspiration. His characters touched me and will forever live with me. Eric, Thank you so much for sharing your talent. Keep it up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dickey is the Best","review":"This was an excellent book. I just could not put it down.

The author has been very successful at developing at least one character in such a way that the reader can relate and have a sense of understandiing the character down to its core. In all of Mr. Dickey's books he has had the uncanny knack for making me feel that his characters are people that I know and love and work with everyday. For that reason and that reason alone, Mr. Dickey's books will always be read by me.This book in particular dealt with the issue of infidelity but it also dealt with the consequences of infidelity, as well as some explanations as to why people cheat.Without giving too much of the book away I wanted to say that I liked the explanation of why the men treat. Our children do indeed learn from us. Another character suffered from strange nightmares and Mr. Dickey gave an interesting explanation for the cause of the nightmares.All in all, a very good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scan-du-lus","review":"This book kept me up all night turning pages. Eric Jerome Dickey does not disappoint, again. I really enjoyed this book. The things the characters did in this book had me laughing and trippin. The author manages to always give you both sides of the story, so you never get the impression that he is more for one side or the other. Both women and men do wrong and are wronged. The characters are complex, down to earth and all have facets in their personalities that we all can relate to. This is a great book and if you like this one, be sure to check out all his other books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Book, Addictive Reading!","review":"This book was very interesting. I have read all of EJD's books. All of them were equally as absorbing. Once begun, one would not want to put the book down. I could not wait to finish. Some parts I did find to be somewhat predictable, but yet it was so well put together, it was still more than worth reading. I recommend all of EJD's books to anyone. You will be utterly consumed with the desire to complete each one."},{"rating":"2","title":"WHY DID IT HAVE TO END?","review":"I absolutely LOVED this book. This is his best work, so far! PLEASE DON'T MAKE US WAIT SO LONG FOR YOUR NEXT BOOK!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The book was extremely realistic,I loved the characters.","review":"Mr. Dickey has once again outdone himself. I found myself so involved with this book that I forgot about othe aspects of life. I knew the people in the book they were my friends. EJD has captured the african american dating game and turned it into an art form. The characters jump out the pages at you and are in your living room, car or baathtub wherever you prefer to read. Big ups to my man eric for this sensational novel. Im anxiously awaiting number 5. To any men or women who have been involved with anyone this id diffently one to pick up."},{"rating":"2","title":"ERIC'S THE MAN","review":"I love Eric's writing style.

This book is a classic. And even though I know whats going to happen, the part of Tammy locking herself in the bathroom singing, always bring tears to my eyes.That was true love.I know someone like every character in this book. After reading it, you find yourself wondering what happened to the relationships as if the characters are real.Eric really out did himself with this one.Great book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved it!","review":"This book is not what I expected, it was better. It was so good that I didn't want it to end! Dickey is an excellent storyteller and he wove a seamless tale of friendship, heartache, and conflicted emotions -- the stuff of real life interpersonal relationships. In this cast of characters, the author has included a couple of \\"dogs\\", a vamp, a nag, a wannabe militant, a frustrated lawyer/writer and an artsy tpe.I enjoyed this book a lot more than \\"Sister, Sister\\" because the characters are more sympathetic. I also liked the fact that the author didn't come up with fairy tale ending. He spins an interesting tale about folks looking for love (or lust) and the consequences of of bad choices."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book...I could hardly put it down","review":"I just got finished reading \\"Cheaters\\" today and I am sad that the book ended. This book was attached to my hip for 2 weeks. Every chance I got, I would pick it up and read it. At work, I'd sneak it from out of my purse and put it in the middle of some work papers and act as if I was reading work material. I love the way Eric could write from a woman and a man's view. The characters felt very real and I also really related to the book because I grew up in the area where the characters were from and I could identify with the places that they went to. For instance, the restaurant-club called \\"Shelly's.\\" This book is definitely a must read. After work, I went to the mall and picked up the book,\\"Sister, Sister.\\" After \\"Cheaters,\\", I knew I had to run and pick up another one of his books!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Magnificant Book","review":"So far of all the EJD books I have read, Cheaters is the best.

As expected for cast iron, it is a bit heavy (a two hander), but the cooking results are excellent with even heating and uniform crispy crust. I am sure we also will use it as a griddle as well as for pizza."},{"rating":"2","title":"Has worked well for me","review":"I've worked hard at seasoning this item, baking it with coconut oil several times. I also find that grilling veggies on it is very good for seasoning (and great for flavoring whatever I cook after the veggies). I do use it on the stovetop sometimes as well as in the oven. I've baked fries on it, which worked well--nice and crispy. The handles are nice so that I can keep a good grip on it. As for pizza--this is fantastic! I love to make pizza at home and this really does great things for the crust--not only is the texture just perfect but the flavor is actually better. YUM!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic pizza pan, griddle, etc","review":"Great pizza pan, and works as a large griddle. I really like the handles on it, it is easy to lift with thick oven mitts. I'm so glad I got this as Christmas present! It makes a great pan for baking biscuits, cookies, pancakes, large amounts of bacon, chinese green onion pancakes (these are like naan, bing), it's really really worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"solid, but heavy","review":"It is solid iron sheet, but it is heavy and takes two hands to left it out of the oven. It also needs to be preheat before cooking a frozen pizza or the bottom doesn't get crisp."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality Pizza Pan!","review":"I owned a pizza stone in the past and was considering getting a new one at some point but then I found this pan. I haven't ever taken the time to research the care of a pizza stone but I know the few I've seen, I don't think they ever saw water. Being a fan of Lodge products, I know they are able to be washed with warm water (no soap), which I like. I have used this pan several times and I'm highly satisfied with the outcome!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great piece of cookware","review":"This cookware is not just great for pizza. I use it to cook dinner rolls and bread too. It may be the cast iron; but rolls, bread and breadsticks get that extra rise that make them melt-in the-mouth good. I bought another square pan for the overflow from my \\"recipe\\" that yields the same results. Did I mention great pizza?"},{"rating":"2","title":"It makes great grilled pizzas!","review":"We put cast iron pizza pan on a Weber kettle grill and let it get hot with burning coal. We then cooked pizzas on it. The crust can be made crispy, if the pizza is left on longer. The smokey flavor from coal adds character to pizzas. The thing probably will out last all of us. Great product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Forget a pizza stone; this is the best!","review":"I used pizza stones for many years but they kept breaking. In fact, I first used a cast-iron Lodge griddle pan after my last stone broke. If only the griddle pan were a bit bigger. Turns out, Lodge makes a pizza pan as well. It should last for decades."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's the bomb!!!","review":"This is one of the best purchases I've made on Amazon, and yes I am a Amazon addict=] It was delivered right on time! I bought this for my parents 30th anniversary and they use it all the time. They love it!The way the cast iron is seasoned helps with more than cooking just pizza! I would recommend this product to ALL my friends!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed with the results...","review":"This pizza pan appears well made from the standpoint that the metal is nice and flat and robust, and the handles are comfortable and such. Unfortunately the claim that it's \\"pre-seasoned\\" and that foods won't tend to stick to it is NOT what I've experienced. What's with the bumpy surface? I've got several older Wagner cast iron pans that are smooth as glass where you place the food and they truly are what I would consider to be non-stick. If you end up buying this make sure you double the recipe each time because half of your food will be left stuck on the pan for you to scrub off later."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to the promise","review":"I ordered this to make \\"Dosha,\\" a flat bread with white rice and Urad lentil. Though I followed he instructions to make it non-sticky, the food was sticking to it and I returned it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pizza or Crepe Pan","review":"I use this for crepes, and it does a great job! evenly distributes heat and makes BIG crepes!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Non stick?","review":"Attempted tortillas on this. Most of them did not stick, though a few did. Also, there is a mark on the pan now. Wiping off with a dry cloth and later with a wet cloth didn't help."},{"rating":"1","title":"To much clean up","review":"The product produces a credible pizza, but no better then the $14.00 bakes square pans.The clean up is to time consuming,the inability to use a soap product is a major problem.When we make pizza it's for a mob scene, atleast five pizzas are made. After we eat I let the Bakers Sq. pans soak in dishwasher detergent and I can clean the up in no time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Soggy pizza crust","review":"I bought this thinking it would make for crispy, yummy pizza crusts. Instead they are soggy and unappetizing. I found myself parbaking on this pan then moving the crust to the pizza stone to finish baking. I've even quit using it for parbaking, and am back to using the $3 Walmart pan.Also the weight of this pan makes it difficult to deal with, plus the fact it has to be handwashed....overall I definitely would not recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding Pizza Pan","review":"I use it to make traditional crust pizza and the crust always has come out just right.I do use a non stick cookig spray before I put the dough on and make my pizza on the pizza pan while I pre heat the oven to 425F/450F and I bake for about 20min.I have done it this way for thin crust and thick crust and I was satisfied with both.I usually make my own dough but I have also tried Pillsbury Pizza Dough and it turned out fine, but I like mine better and it is a lot cheaper to make my ownA lot of the people that have reviewed this pizza pan say that they cut the pizza on the pan and I think that is ok but I don't do this because I think my pizza cutter will get dull and it would be hard to re-sharpen.I so far have not burned the crust on any of the pizzas that I have made, so clean up has always been very easy."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best pizza pan you can buy!","review":"This is the best pan you can buy bar none!I own 3 of these and have tried many other pans and stones. None comes close to producing perfect pizza like this pan does!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best buy in recent years","review":"I really like this pan. I use it to bake bread, cookies, pizza, and potatoes. I've been using this pan more than a year now, and nothing ever got stuck on it. My oven is electric which doesn't generate enough heat from the bottom, and my baked goods tended to be soggy on the bottom, but this pan totally solved the issue. If I have time, I just preheat the pan in the oven long enough to ensure crispy bottom. If I don't have time, I either heat up the pan on my stovetop while I wait for the oven to heat up or bake the food first and finish up on the stovetop. The pan is very versatile. I LOVE this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome pizza pan!","review":"This is by far the best cooking pizza pan I have owned. I'm getting ready to order a second one so that I can cook 2 pizzas in one sitting. 5 stars for this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome for pizza, bacon, pancakes","review":"This is great. For pizza I stack it on top of a pizza stone and pour the kettle full of lump charcoal. Season it with a little bacon grease. No complaints at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"I use this pan for scones as well as pizza. I've used it on a gas grill with great success. Also made socca on it and got quite a nice crispy result. It's heavy and I keep it in my lower oven when not using. Can't go wrong with this for crisp pizza or anything else that fits."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Cast Iron Pizza Pan","review":"This pan creates a nice crisp crust on the bottom of the pizza. I pre-heat the pan in the oven first then slide the pizza onto the pan. It comes out great.And while you eat your piece of pizza the other pieces stay warm while on the pan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Pizza","review":"I began looking for a better way to cook pizza after I purchased a new oven. I was tired of always having burnt crust and barely melted cheese on top. I looked at pizza stones, but realized that I would need to preheat them for nearly an hour before cooking the pizza! Way too long and too much electricity use in my mind. Then I came across this pan from Lodge. I own a medium sized dutch oven by them for cooking in campfires, and it has always been a wonderful thing to have to cook out in the wilderness. Decided I would give it a try, and ordered one. 3 words: best pizza ever! I prefer regular non-crispy crust, and it this pan cooks it wonderfully. The cast iron takes longer to heat, so it is just right for a softer crust, with a properly cooked top.Recommend to anyone that likes softer crust.Also I recommend getting the Lodge polycarbonite scrapers, they make cleanup a breeze!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It does the job","review":"I've used it several times to roast veggies and make pizza.The food comes out as good as my skills allow, and the pan can be cleaned up with a little effort even when food is burned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous pan!!!","review":"I love making homemade pizza and this pan is perfect for that. I use a bread machine to make the dough, then roll it out and bake on this pan. Crusts turn out perfect, crusty outside, chewy inside. Heats evenly and the cast iron is nicely seasoned. A big plus that Lodge products are made in the USA."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best thing ever","review":"This makes the best pizza, hands down. So much easier than dealing with a pizza stone on a wire frame."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this Pizza Pan !","review":"I have other Lodge cast iron products and they are all great. This pizza pan is no exception. Like all Lodge cast iron pans it is simple to use, clean, and keep seasoned. I used this for the first time today to make a few individual pizzas and it was wonderful. Only had to bake at 400 degrees for 15 minutes with ready to use whole grain flatbread round crusts and the cheese was very bubbly and the peperoni was cooked. The crust has a nice semi-crispness.Am glad I replaced my nonstick cookware with Lodge! I have a few classic Farberware stainless pieces but nothing beats the cast iron for stuff like chili, pizza, and cooking at lower temperatures saves energy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes wonderful pizza","review":"For years I'd been using a non-stick pizza pan, but I was concerned about the coating which was slowly wearing off. I tried one of the \\"coddled cook's\\" pizza stones, but found that the crust was always overcooked and the center was always undercooked. I looked around for another solution and discovered the Lodge cast-iron pizza pan. I must admit to having been skeptical of cast iron for making pizza, but there were so many good reviews of this product, I decided to give it a try. Wow! I've made quite a few pizzas on it now and I have to say this makes the best crust ever. It cooks the crust every bit as good as a wood-fired oven at a pizza parlor. The heat is evenly distributed, resulting in a perfectly-cooked crust every time. This is an excellent product for baking your own homemade pizzas. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"This pizza pan is phenomenal! I use it for far more items than just pizza and everything cooks evenly. If you can't decide between this pan and one of those stones that are sold at in-home parties, buy this pan. It will not break or crack and with the handles it is much easier to maneuver."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best thing in the kitchen","review":"I use this as a skillet, griddle, baking sheet, pizza pan, and a few other things. Coat it regularly with a very light coat of oil, and NOTHING will stick to it. Super heavy duty and well made. My stone wear (for the oven) and non-stick (for the stove top) have pretty much been retired by this thing. It will do pretty much anything except cook soup."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great pan, worth every penny! Great quality","review":"Great pan! So many uses... Great for chicken nuggets, grilled cheese, bacon oh, and pizza too! Great quality pan, made in USA!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One word: SUPERB","review":"Best pizza pan by far. And I should know, I've had several, including one of those round stones. Great baking, nonstick and like all cast iron, should last forever. One nice thing is the lip of the pan, no more pizza sauce or cheese spills. If you need one (or two) this is it, you'll never need another one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superior!!!","review":"This pan cooks wonderful pizzas! The iron holds the heat, and uniformly cooks the crust. It is just awesome! Since it is preseasoned, all you need to do is follow the directions, and you will have NONSTICK pizza every time! Remember, do not use soap with cast iron! Hot water is all that is necessary.(and a little vegetable oil rubbed in before cooking)... You will not be disappointed with this pizza pan, and it will last for generations~~literally!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Get this!","review":"When I first bought this, my wife gave me a hard time about it because I was buying a ton of cast iron stuff. This never leaves my oven. I use it like a pizza stone. It is great for roasting veggies, heating pizza, making pizza, making hot sandwiches on artisan bread, it does everything! I even put it on the stovetop to heat soft corn tortillas, and it is perfect for that, too! I love it. After heating up some delivery deep dish pizza today, my wife said, \\"That cast iron pizza pan is the best purchase you've ever made.\\" I cannot recommend this thing enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Ever","review":"I had a Pampered Chef stone for years that finally met its demise.

Probably a returned item as it arrived damaged & the packaging was trashed. The chainring was bent but Dahon made it right with an equal or better crankset. But once it was repaired & tuned up it turned out to be a very good little bike. I use it for car camping. It's not a mountain bike, but the suspension handles just about any road condition, quite comfy.

The microphone is real not some cheesy plastic thing but the unit itself is not well made. The two cassette player doors don't align just right and feel like they could break at any moment. The CD that came with it was scratched and had ... songs on it. The sound quality was fair but not worth the price. I am wondering if the STVG700 model with the monitor built in is any better?

I have read all three and believe all of them have their merits. The 1996 Collier translation, published by Oxford World Classics, is brilliant; however, in saying that, it is very British. The Collier translation,Germinal (Oxford World's Classics), does flow extremely well and, if you don't mind the numerous Britishisms in the translation, you will love this edition. The 2004 Penguin translation by Roger Pearson,Germinal (Penguin Classics), is also brilliant; however, there are numerous editing errors in the text. The translation, again, brilliant, but the editing is horrid. For me, the 1954 translation by Leonard Tancock and published by Penguin,Germinal (Penguin Classics), is absolutely brilliant, and it seems to be more appropriate for the time in which it was written. However, in saying all this, any of these three editions will be excellent reads for anyone interested in Zola."},{"rating":"1","title":"Target Furniture Always Disappoints.","review":"It seems that Target furniture products never quite measure up - sometimes literally.

This new album is horrible. It's plain, boring pop. Britney Spears fans might like it. It's not even good for Pop!It seems on every album, they try a completely different corporate-frat-rock formula, to find one that \\"sticks\\". And again, they disappoint, and remain an embarassment to Philadelphia. The Philly press have always hated them (yes, even the indie papers), and when they're playing live or come up in conversation, around these parts, they're pretty much a joke. And with good reason, trust me.Save yourself the money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What next, electronica?","review":"The Marah sound is gone. As soon as I heard the band was using the same producer who handled Oasis, I became trepidatious. This stuff is OK, it's catchy, and I even found myself humming one of the tunes after listening. That of course was in spite of myself. There was a richness and purity in the previous albums that is simply non-existent here. This is pop sugar at its best. Or worst. The beautiful warm sounds of the acoustic guitars and banjos are gone. Instead we get overly produced, synthesized sounds. Even the vocals are put through effects. At a time like this, we need more purity, not less. So let them have their one hit with Float Away and then disappear into oblivion. All the original fans will be gone by the time they realize they made a mistake. And then, truly they will be able to sing, \\"All of the streets are lonely...\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Perhaps the old rhythm section wrote the lyrics?","review":"I agree with those that admire Marah's decision to do whatever they want to do and, as a fan, I was eager to hear them take on a new sound. And this is not a bad album, but it just lacks any specificity and sounds like so many other, lesser bands. ONe thing that strikes me is how weak the lyrics are compared to the original and surprising work on the first two albums. It would seem that this complexity and energy might be retained whatever the musical directions the band chooses to pursue?"},{"rating":"1","title":"The best CD Oasis never made","review":"An OK CD if you like Oasis. I'm not against a band moving on from it's roots (I loved Wilco's Yankee Hotel Foxtrot) but go somewhere new. It seems like Marah didn't want a new sound, they wanted someone else's sound.

A friend bought it for me, probably thinking because I'm a big fan of Americana and roots-rock that I'd like it... and he was right, except that I love intelligent, beautifully-crafted pop music too. The production is excellent - sounds great and with a lot of punch... and now that I'm about ten years older than the median CD-buying age, I couldn't give a rat's ass if anyone thinks it's cool or not.If anything I would compare this band to a male Aimee Mann.

Marah is (was) the greatest rock band in America (with only two albums to their name) and now this! Whatever this is. Synth pop, I guess. Maybe file this under growth, but growth would imply they were building on their roots-- they aren't. This album has nothing to do with their previous efforts. Also, the songs are weak. A good batch of songs would have diverted me from the new-fangled production, but these songs are utterly wack. Lousy lyrics. Which is such a shame, because their last two albums put them in a lyrical class with Bruce, Lou Reed, and even Townes Van Zandt, and I doubt any rock album ever captured a sense of place like \\"Kids In Philly\\" did for thet great city. So, save your bucks. This one blows monkeys."},{"rating":"1","title":"congrats, Marah, you have acheived mediocrity","review":"I had been a Philly based Marah fan since \\"Let's Cut the crap and hook up later on tonight\\". Everything I liked about them is what they left off this album; a sound that stood out against the cloning of top 40 radio, distinctive vocals and interesting lyrics. It may be the opinion of some that a lot of the local Marah fans were disgruntled by the band's exodus from philly and their departure from the same old sound. Personally, I don't care where they go or what sound they try for: as a music fan, it is apparent to me that they had a sound that evoked motion,emotion and grabbed my attention and now they've got a sound that is about as appealing, interesting and unique as white castle hamburgers. Way to go, boys. At least you're not claiming to represent Philly with this crap."},{"rating":"2","title":"A bridge connecting two cultures","review":"As a Dutch-American cross-cultural trainer I have read the gamut of literature dealing with this subject.

I like the poppy \\"Escape From Dragon House,\\" which feels like a story though I can't understand the words. \\"Hummingbird\\" is beautiful in a simple and unexpected way, acoustic guitar and vocal.

That is why this book is so good -- filled with essays and interviews, it manages to be simultaneously insightful and revolutionary.This work would be a great introduction to the work and politics of Gary Snyder. Even if you dislike, or are unsure of his poetry, I would encourage you to at least check out this book; a knowledge of his poetry is not a prerequisite for enjoying and learning from it.Only one work from this volume, \\"The East West Interview\\" was excerpted in the Gary Snyder Reader that was recently published. So, even if you have that book, there will not be much repetition."},{"rating":"2","title":"JK","review":"Received lots of rough sawn wood from my father-in-law. Debated long and hard over portable vs. full size. Ended up, like the rest of my shop choosing Delta. The unit came delivered in about 10 days on a large pallet. Broke down the little stuff and broke my back getting the unit (took off the motor) down into my basement shop. Once everything was back together I was rewarded with a machine that did exactly what it was supposed to do. I was originally disappointed to see the unit was now made in China (I guess I knew it after reading others reviews) but I can honestly say it seems to be built well. Kind of a pain adjusting in/out feed rollers, but a small price to pay. Works great so far."},{"rating":"2","title":"very nice planer","review":"I picked up this planer in August and have since used it several times preparing wood for many projects. As advertised, it is very heavy and takes a number of hours to set up. Once the machine is assembled and adjusted, it does a wonderful job planing woods. It must be used with a dust collection unit as you will soon be in a mountain of chips! The two speeds are nice - you can buzz through a pile of wood in short order and then finish the boards on the slower setting - although with sharp blades, it is difficult to improve on the finish at the faster setting. The maching and parts were nearly flawless - the only fault I have observed is that one of the screws that fastend the oil gear box leaks a small amount of oil.My experience is that this is a very good quality machine.Bob"},{"rating":"1","title":"Usual Chinese non-quality","review":"I just unpacked my new Delta planer and discovered that it was made in CHINA. Rough castings, and a jammed blade positioning mechanism. The planer is useless in its current state. ... for a useless piece of junk! The whole carriage will not budge. I made the mistake of purchasing a Delta Platinum Unisaw (bowed table that had to be remachined), DJ-20 Jointer (Taiwanese but pretty good machine) and the 22-680K planer all at same time. Had I only known that Delta's quality has gone to the dogs! I will be selling the tablesaw and the planer ASAP and replacing them with General or Powermatic. After waiting 10 years to upgrade my Delta portable planer I am extremely disappointed and can't recommend Delta or its customer non-service."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"Not an album that really rates higher in my books for Starflyer besides Fashion Focus. Very similar to that album, as each song is in itself, it's own entity. Where as Leave Here A Stranger, had each and every song blend to fit in a whole, this album, while cohesive, has every song represent itself as well. Very good rock, very much along the lines of the rock sound acheived on Americana, however, with some weird keyboard lines, hand claps, and noises in general thrown in for good measure. Definitely a great Starflyer album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album, Great Band,","review":"Old is a Great Album, Although most of their albums are...it's very surprising no one really knows about this band... could it be their Christian Rep. excludes them from peoples shelves or word of mouth?

In the end I bought 2 Spydercos, a Salt Saver & a Pacific Salt. Reasons: The blade steel and it suits me. They are tough, reliable & feels real good in my hands. I always believe how a knife/weapon or whatever you meant to use as a personal tool must feel right & safe in your hands. The H1 steel is really a big bonus. It cuts & slices well, easy to maintain (hardly needed at all) and always feel safe when I'm using it. The Samurais have their katanas, the Knights have their broad swords, I have my Spydercos.

The problem is that within two months the dictionary was literally falling apart in my hands. Each week new sections of 50 pages or so would come loose from the binding. Now after 6 months I have a paper binding with a thousand loose pages. I cannot recommend this text.

I'm not going to spend a ridiculous amount of time discussing all of the good and bad points (the other reviews do just fine with that) but there was definitely more good than bad for me. I was entertained and at points way too into the plot - lost some sleep, didn't put the DS down for hours - so there's not too much I can complain about! I will say that, as with any game of this nature, since it is not really replayable, I really wish it had been longer than it was. I think I finished it in 14(ish) hours over the course of 3 or 4 days and when I came to the end, kept hoping a bonus chapter or something would appear. Even so, I am definitely keeping my eye out for future installations of this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally","review":"I've been waiting for this game for a long time. When I saw it at a local store for $19, I whispered to my husband it's what wanted for Christmas.I finished the game in a couple of weeks.Some people are turned off because it's not a fast-paced action game. I can certainly understand this position, but this game is more of an interactive graphic novel than anything else. Once people understand that, maybe they could enjoy it a bit more.I found the game quite refreshing in its presentation. The graphics were beautiful and the story was well-told.

The storyline is interesting enough to keep you playing far longer than you should. Gameplay requires that you hold the DS as you would a book and it is quite a comfortable way to play.

Unfortunately all the effort went into character and story building and almost none into game play. The puzzles are ridiculously simple. You can't go more than two feet before one of the characters engages you in a lengthy dialogue that you can neither skip nor speed up. When you are talking to the characters you are giving the choice of being a jerk or being annoying. During dialogue you are given a choice of questions to ask, but you have to ask all the questions anyway, so what is the point. It's just one way the game makes you feel like you are actually needed to play it. The rest of the game play is so linear that you can't possibly fail. It actually gives you quizes to make sure you've been paying attention. There is no challenge, no fun, and it will give you a headache.

You have to do things very specifically in order to trigger actions and sometimes you can easily overlook items you need in order for the story to progress. The game is also very text heavy, as the driving force behind the story progression is your conversations and interactions with characters.

But I like reading so it's no biggie.Most of the puzzles make sense, although there were a couple of times it took me a while to find a \\"trigger spot\\" that makes an event happen.Replay value is maybe not that great.

The story is completely linear, so even if you go somewhere and do something, like search a laundry cart, you get a different results at different times. This makes it confusing and frustrating. There is no way I could have even ever gotten through this game with out internet walkthrough guides. One time I walked around for like two hours and could not get anyhting to happen. I read the walkthrough and found I was supposed to go find hidden items that were out of view and not there the first time I looked because the story was not there yet. It just seems dumb.

But most of the time on this game you are clicking to go thru the dialogue, there are some puzzle solving involved, but they are pretty simple. Also a lot of the time you need to go to random places to advance the story, example (SPOILER ALERT) at ch 3 you know you are supposed to return a doll to the little girl, but when you go to her room the door doesn't open, well that's because you are supposed to solve this other unrelated puzzle first (the fountain pen) to advance the story, THEN you can go talk to the girl, which makes absolutely no sense.

Talking and talking.... and talking-- and you have to press the darned button after ever sentence!

It's too boring for me. That's why I rate this 2 stars. Hotel Dusk story itself is not as appealing as other games. The conversations between the detective and the others seem to be taking their sweet time which you can not make the conversations go any faster as you would have like. For example: Phoenix Wright is colorful, comedy, and far more entertaining than this game. Forget this one, go for the series of Phoenix Wright games and it'll be worth every penny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly disappointing","review":"As a very 'old' gamer of 47, I'm an old hand at point and click games.

I could feel the edges of the insert, even thought they were the correct size. Is there a Right/Left. Don't know! So I switched them around in my shoes but the results were the same. PAIN PAIN PAIN.

After a hiatus following THE GALLATIN DIVERGENCE, L. Neil Smith has finally returned to his most popular creation, the alternate world first visited over twenty years ago in his classic novel THE PROBABILITY BROACH. As fate would have it, THE AMERICAN ZONE deals specifically with how a truly free society would handle a spate of terrorist attacks. In the wake on 9-11, the issues LNS deals with are incredibly relevant for Americans today. All our favorite characters return, including Lucy Kropotkin and Will Sanders, plus numerous figures from our own world (or similiar realities) appear under different names. Half the fun is realizing which real-world public figure LNS is skewering under another name. As always, there's plenty of action, lots of laughs, and a fine mystery along with the libertarian philosophy. If you can stand to take your freedoms straight, with no chaser, this is the novel for you! Read and enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Win, Lucy & Clarissa meet September 11, Confederacy style!","review":"Detective 'Win' Bear of _Probability Broach_ fame is back, this time tracking down terrorists who have bombed a building in Greater LaPorte, the capitol of alternate America (AKA the Confederacy). What's at stake? Not just bringing the bad guys to justice, but the very character of the Confederacy itself.Writing pre-9/11, Smith shows the Confederacy undergoing the same choice between liberty and security that we see today in America. And security in the form of more government can be very, very seductive....If you'd like a wonderfully entertaining and thought-provoking look at an America that might have been, try this book. Packed with interesting ideas -- it even has a libertarian take on baseball. Warning! This is not for those who dislike the bracing smell of gunpowder, or the consequences of giving up legalistic 'control' over other people's behavior. I loved it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Political agenda poorly disguised as a sequel","review":"This cannot be considered either a science fiction story, or a sequel to the superb \\"Probability Broach.\\" This can only be considered a crass attempt to push a political agenda. The story consists of the main characters being set up, chapter after chapter, to abuse and ridicule various democratic ideologies held by the other, completely undeveloped and haphazardly created, characters. The \\"main\\" plot? Stuff gets blown up.I'm quite willing to listen to L. Neil Smith's political viewpoints provided he tells them with relevence in the framework of a reasonably intelligent, logically consistent science fiction story. Unfortunately, those criteria don't apply here.If you haven't read this and you're looking for a sequel, or have read this and think that you might ever read another L. Neil Smith novel again, you might try either \\"The Nagasaki Vector,\\" or \\"The Gallatin Divergence.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Talking heads and vengance served cold.","review":"I have read almost everything Smith has written, many of which I enjoyed, and I know several of those who he uses as templates for charachters from my days in his circle of friends. I read the book out of curiosity of how he would handle several of those people.I admit a certain perverse pleasure over several of his characterizations of popular figures but the constant drone of his main characters turned talking heads and the petty way he wrote about those he has personal issues with turned me off. I plowed through to the end just to see who else he was going to attack, and to see if I was included in this list.I was sad to find the characters of Win Bear, Lucy, Will and Clarissa turned into talking heads for his personal disputes with those who disagree with him. I sadly must rate this as one of Smiths lesser books and found myself disapointed after such a long wait between novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"libertarian pipe dream","review":"I really did not like this book. I am a libertarian, but I could never under any circumstances see any thing that was written come to pass. I know its a fantasy, but it was so unrealistic and so poorly written. Besides the fantasy, the detective work was boring. It's another book that has the detective floundering around only to have the case dropped in his lap nice and tidy. It seems like he wrote this book in one sitting, probably just after Sept 11.Boring and way over the top, a must not read. And its a shame because I have liked his books in the past."},{"rating":"2","title":"Is beyond Medieval","review":"This book is not a light read.

It looks at the details that people don't want to talk about. Surrogacy is a beautiful way to achieve pregnancy, but there isn't a resource for intended parents on what to expect! This book shows that both intended parents and surrogates are human, flaws and all. It is a great way for perspective people going through surrogacy to get a dialogue started on what to anticipate when going through surrogacy.I would recommend this wholeheartdly. It's truth from the perspective of the intended parents. We've all heard the perspectives of the surrogates, what they go through, the sacrifices they make to help achieve a pregnancy for a wanting couple. But, the people who have suffered loss after loss before they even begin to pursue surrogacy are finally represented in 20 short interesting stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing book!","review":"Surrogacy Was the Way is a wonderful book for anyone who is considering surrogacy, in the middle of a surrogacy, or just wants to know more and be supportive of a surrogacy.

I would highly recommend this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Redundant","review":"I found this book to repeat information over and over while some sections were weak and missed important details. Once I read it I realized that it could have been narrowed down to about 75 pages of valuable information. Also, it has been more difficult to put the author's suggestions into practice, especially since there are no recommendations about where to buy good quality ayervedic herbs. The author also has a section about vitamins and suggests that the readers e-mail him and ask questions about the absorption rates of the vitamins they give their children. I sent him an e-mail a few months ago, and unfortunately, did not get a response. There are other books on this topic that are more comprehensive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brittanicus excellent","review":"I don't know about the other two , but I found the play Brittanicus excellent.

But I guess it was sort of like the movie, boring. Sure, the fun part is getting to use the lightsaber and the force, but it get's a little boring fighting droids all the time. The levels aren't that difficult either. I made it through five in less than an hour, and there are only nine levels total! When I got to fight the Sith, in the final level, I was surprised at how easy it was, given you can go recharge yourself if you run out of energy points. Overall, I was looking for more of a challenging game and it proved to be a little boring. Graphics are pretty cool and so is sword play and sound effects. But there needed to be more levels and it would have been nice to fight people instead of machines. Waiting for a better game from Lucas arts--and a better movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Technical note on the MP3 version","review":"As the CD is out of print (and used copies ridiculously over-priced) I thought I would download the MP3 version. Beware: there are slight fade in/outs on every track & since most of the tracks don't have a clean break it becomes a bit annoying. Amazon was kind enough to refund my money- still a bit of a let down. Ah well.As to the performance: Fricsay leads a nice middle of the road interpretation. No breakneck speeds, nothing quirky. The singers are having one heck of of a time; rolling rrs, smirks in the voice, almost hammy (in a good way), but they have enough sense to let the pathos come through at the right moments. The sound is typical late 50s-60s DG. Bright, boxy & kinda soft in the bass.

It just skips all over.Again, this 2006 edition is not entirely the original version that released in 1994. The \\"remastered\\" version was not supervised by Bill Laswell.

It sounds like early schiz-rock with maybe a little more accessibility from the straight-ahead metal influence mixed in with broader appealing elements, but does not reach near the heights of madness many others have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works perfectly for me","review":"Given some of the reviews, I was initially hesitant about purchasing this. However, it's working like a charm. I have a 1 receiver DirecTV setup with the receiver located in my family room, and then a second TV in our bedroom also wired to the receiver. The receiver came with an infered remote control, so I couldn't change channels on the dish from my bedroom without the direct line of sight. But, I can with no problems with this Jensen. Also, it controls my 15 year old Sony TV like a charm. It works perfectly for my requirements."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"The remote worked fine for my GE TV and Sanyo VCR. It also did about 85% of what I needed it to do for my Harman-Kardon Receiver. The problem that I had with it though, is that it did not work for my RCA CD player or DVD player. I would not recommend this remote."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for the money","review":"Based on the price and a need for RF capability, I thought I'd give this unit a try. It works well with my Quasar TV, Technics CD, JVC VCR, and Jerrold Cable box. It glitched on the Sony DE835 receiver, not being able to switch back to TV mode after switching out. Also, the surround/menu features won't respond. A call to the hotline informed me that this Sony model is not covered so, as someone previously mentioned, it's best to call before purchasing if this is important. Actually I'd blame Sony more than Jensen as they could try for more backward-compatibility when bringing new units to market. Anyway, I wanted to control my tuner and cd player from my outdoor spa and this unit allows me to do that. But I have a direct line of sight to the RF receiver thru a window and I think if it wasn't for this, it wouldn't work as well, or at all. Generally, the RF is limited. All in all, for $30, I'm satisfied."},{"rating":"1","title":"photographer","review":"Extremely dissapointed. Product very incomplete, so as to render it nearly useless.

Not that they aren't supposed to as much as they don't, at least they don't speak of it. Not only does Russell speak of it he gives a good argument for it (it being spirituality and the existence of God). He spends time scientifically describing how we construct our reality and it's philosophical implications then delves into the scientific problems of consciousness finally giving us a wonderful chapter on the meaning of light to our perception of reality.

I've been a student of Ontology for 35 years. Now, Peter Russell has given all Ontology students a bright and radiant perspective to an age old dilemma in the West: What conjuncts Science/God? Another book that broached this topic was produced in 1982, by Satprem. It was published under the title : The Mind of the Cells -- a wonderful book of observations by the Mother,(a primary student of Sri Aurobindo).

The typical 'argument from simplistic credulity' type of exegesis.

Fortunately, I didn't pay full price. I bought the book at a used book store, hoping for a useful guide to sci-fi flicks that I should try to catch when they appear late nights on T.V. But I soon found that many of Henderson's opinions were just the opposite of mine. For instance, he pans movies like Terminator 2 and Aliens, while praising Alien 3, Battle Beyond the Stars, and Tri-Star's Godzilla (failing, by his own admission, to comprehend why Godzilla fans didn't like it). And, as noted by the others below, his criticisms often seemed inconsistent, praising a quality in one film (such as its campiness) that he criticized in another.Of course, that his opinions were different than mine doesn't mean they were wrong.

I should have known I was in trouble when, early in his introduction, he says his basic premise is that 90% of everything is garbage. He then proceeds to demonstrate that view in his reviews. And, despite his know-it-all attitude, I spotted several errors of fact in various reviews, for example, his referring to the Gene Barry character in War of the Worlds as Dr. \\"Clayton\\", as though Clayton were the character's last name. This may seem like a small item, but the author himself continually nitpicks the movies he is reviewing, so turn-about is fair play. I would give the book one star, except for a few insights I found.

I bought a cheapo camera attachment for my pda a while back that took pictures of simalar quality.Although this camera might be usefull for taking pics of items youre putting on Ebay or maybe of houses if youre a real estate agent and don't need big quality pics, you can do better.

This does not sound like the Corps I was in, the events are universally gradiosing, no eyewitnesses are offered, no documentation or supporting data is offered, and there is some jargon that doesn't fit.

Because of this, it casts serious doubt on the remainder of what the author has written. The author titles his book \\"CAP Mot: The story of a Marine Special Forces Unit in Vietnam\\". CAP was never a \\"Special Forces\\" unit. I was in CAP myself and know of whence I speak. Possibly the author, who admittedly states that almost everything comes from his memory, recalls CAP in the fashion that it is written. However, for those who are interested in serious scholarship of the subject, I would recommend they go elsewhere.

At first, my niece's legs were a bit too short to actually kick it, but watching it seemed to keep her happy until she could.And it didn't bother her brother at all since there was no blaring music or other loud battery-powered noises.

The UI is not intuitive, and the grammar both in the text and speech is horrible throughout. Actually, to be fair to the remainder of the product, I gave up after the first two lessons because the poor grammar was too distracting. Perhaps later lessons are in better shape, and I lacked the patience to wade into the product further.

It is hopelessly outdated (most suggestions would have been wrong even in 1983). Even the logic of many suggestions is suspect: author often repeats statement \\"don't become a refugee\\", but also recommends not to fight, but escape instead. Not only that, but he states, that caches are inadequate for longer term life support and suggests to concentrate supplies in the retreat. He advocates bugging in for big city dwellers and recommends to use middle floors in high rises for retreats etc. etc. The only remotely useful suggestions are about dealing with those retreaters, who are reluctant to shoot the attackers. The foundation of most of the suggestions is the author's experience in Africa in 1967, the PLO's methods in Beirut and such. Unbelievable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bibliography? Nonsense","review":"One of the great things about books on this subject is the related material that allows you to go more indepth and make your own decisions after an author has raised the issue. This is a slim book -- light weight in more way than one -- and constantly refers to the apparently deep and provocative bibliography \\"for further reference.\\" Alas, this book has no bibliography which demonstrates a degree of carelessness which makes me question the author's general approach to the subject matter.I would not recommend it as it's superficial in dealing with the concept of retreats at the very best and the very frequent references to the non-existent bibliography suggest that the author was aware there was far more to the subject that the reader of this book is cut off from."},{"rating":"2","title":"Useful and entertaining","review":"Small, easy to read book covering everything you need to know to set up a retreat. At the time it was written, the danger of nuclear war was considered a significant risk which strongly influenced the author's presentation. Many of his points are discussed with entertaining anecdotes, supposedly from his experience.The most important advice in the book are four points he gives in the introduction and repeats at appropriate times throughout the book.First, don't make a target of yourself. Second, no matter how prepared, you cannot effectively fight professional soldiers. Third, which he emphasizes the most in the text, don't ever become a refugee.

When controlling the stereo, I also had to press the volume button about 100 times in rapid succession to get the volume knob to inch up just a bit. It also would \\"forget\\" which mode it was on, meaning I had to press the button for another component and then go back to the one I wanted.Also - REAL bad design.

Roger King provides a brilliant, vivid portrayal of Marcella who maintains a composed, lyrical and witty voice, in the face of her tragedies.The novel illuminates the world of a modern, cosmopolitan sort of immigrant and examines English and American society as it goes to the deeper questions of identity and home.

I was not at all surprised to read in the notes that the score had never actually been written to the piece, but rather, Monk came to the studio with a few ideas and improvised much of the work. The tracks repeat endlessly without any meaningful development. Some of them contain nonsensical dialogue as well, which adds little to the opera's overall effect. Listen to the sample track \\"Ice Demons\\" for a good demonstration of ludicrous and pretentious composition. While I'm not a devoted fan of minimalism in general, I can at least enjoy it on occassion. In my opinion, some minimalist works like \\"Einstein on the Beach\\" by Philip Glass are far more sophisticated than Monk's opera and don't have the aggravating tendency to take themselves too seriously. Monk's overdramatic spiritual nonsense really gets on the nerves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utter garbage","review":"Don't get me wrong. I like some of Meredith Monk's stuff (when she's not on some hallucinogen), but this is going to far. Plot, musical coherence, dramatism, take your pick--unfortunately, none of it is there. Experimentation is all well and good if you can pull it off at least with some minor hint of artistic expression, but Atlas is utterly nonsensical and way too repetitive to be considered a work of art. If, after hearing this, you are still brave enough to give Meredith Monk another try, check out Book of Days. It's much more musically coherent and much easier to grasp. It also, in my opinion, is a much better expression of Monk's continuing search to expand the capabilities of the human voice."},{"rating":"1","title":"power ranger horror","review":"If you are looking for an absolutely horrendous sequel to the Wishmaster this is it.

It does have a strong nutty smell which I don't care for but it didn't bother my husbands sensitive nose so that made it easier to ignore. During the day I put it on after a nice warm shower which helps melt on my skin easier, I actually found myself enjoying it like a mini message :). At night I like to rub it on slowly as I get ready for bed, it's great to use on your feet, then put some cozy socks, don't forget your hands :) I have even used it as a primer for some of my drier eyeshadows. I highly recommend this oh and if you fake tan like myself it give it an extra yellow under tone that looks great!

The shea butter I bought had a weird smell, and was discolored, the shea butter had dark blackish spots all over. Back to the smell, I can't even begin to try and describe the smell, I just remember that it made me want to throw up. Generally, shea butter has a smokey or roasted smell, this shea butter did not.

I'm at a loss as to what it was that I got in the package. Unrefined Shea Butter (which is not what I received) ranges from almost white to a pale yellow, and has a nutty, smoky scent. This \\"shea butter\\" was mustard yellow, melts at body temperature, but smells like cocoa butter! On top of that, the plastic package that I received it in was dirty. If I could do it again, I would spend the few extra bucks to get a real pound of unrefined shea butter from a verified fair trade company. DO NOT BUY THIS STUFF!

Great care was taken in the packaging, and I was surprised to see that the container was actually filled with 1 lb. 6 oz. pieces of raw shea butter nuggets. A bonus of six extra ounces. I have never used raw shea butter before, and would describe using this product like playing with play-doh. I opened the plastic container, took a chunk out, placed it in the palm of one hand, and softened it by using the forefinger of my other hand. Once I got it to the consistancy I prefered, I then began to rub it all over my entire body. I am a diabetic and suffer from severe, intense, itching skin, and immediately felt relief in using this product. It is a bit greasy like real butter, but did not leave an oily residue on my sheets, and I felt wonderful upon waking up this morning.

I could smell it without opening the box. I opened it and there was a greasy plastic bag with what looked like a yellow blob of play doh. It was way more yellow than the picture, but I didn't think anything of it. It smelled worse inside the box and when I opened it I had to hold my breath. I had read that unrefined REAL shea butter has a MILD smell. This was overwhelming. So overwhelming that when I melted it together with beeswax and added many drops of scent oils of lip balms, but you can still smell it. The texture is weirdly sticky and greasy and leaves residue on anything it touches.I wish I had read through the 1 star reviews before purchasing. I read through a few that said it was actually Kpangnan Butter so I googled it. They were ABSOLUTELY right.

After several days I still did not see any result nor improvment. That is when I started to think of the authenticity of this product.

I also use it in my hair as a pre-poo. I absolutely love it! It is not a miracle cure, but it works better and longer than the store bought products I have used for years.I don't recommend using the shea butter alone, the initial smell is a little \\"smoky\\" not sure what else to call it and while it does liquify quickly once it comes into contact with body heat, I like it better smooth.It shipped quickly and was wrapped well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Colorful Art","review":"Used on bathroom window for privacy but to make good use of light.

He tells exactly where all addictions come from, and why all dysfunctional behaviors are merely attempts to keep the current \\"system\\" from being overwhelmed.He tells how to stop resisting personal growth through dysfunctional behaviors, and instead become a \\"witness\\", watching yourself grow. You will experience physical, mental, spiritual, and emotional change, and gain a much greater measure of happiness and peace.It helps you understand yourself, and how you create your own obstacles through resisting growth.

The rest of the family hates Granny and teases Shannon for giving her so much care. Unfortunatly Shannon gets nothing in the will and the family make out like bandits.However Granny received a visit form a salesman promising eternal life. So.....Granny becomes Monster Granny and runs amok in the mansion, slaughtering her family.To say this film is gross and in bad taste is an understatement. Imagine if you will a lovely brunnette niece (a Swedish Bikini Team Model to boot) is giving oral pleasure to her freshly decapitated uncle. Yes folks that and more.Shannon steals the show as she is the hottest B-actress since Shannon Tweed."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Granny is the funniest movie you will EVER see!","review":"Alright, I admit it... I was intrigued by the box, another cheesy horror movie that would have bad gore and failed acting with a somewhat corny but interesting plot.

The on and on ranting about how ugly the granddaughter is, only at the end to have her looking like a playboy centerfold just goes to show, how this movie probably wasn't SUPPOSED to make any sense.I guarantee you will enjoy this movie, because its impossible not to. Your expecting some cheesy B-rate film, but your getting something much much more, its bad... but its good! I LIKE IT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheap Gore Trip","review":"Well, this movie is definitely a first rate B-film as it has all the necessary components: bad acting, horrible make-up/special effects, no plot whatsoever, cheaply attractive women, and tons and tons of GORE! Yes, that is what makes the Granny so entertaining, truthfully. After drinking a magic potion without performing the required \\"Cleansing Ritual\\" and leaving it in direct sunlight, the greedy old grandmother is transformed into a cannibalistic zombie hungry for the flesh and blood of her own family. Unfortunately, it's not scary in any way, shape, or form, but it's definitely filled with laugh after laugh when you realize what a joke this film is. It also features Shannon Whirry (who I honestly don't believe is that attractive) and Heather Elizabeth Parkhurst (who is pretty, but is such a poor actress that her perfomance might rival that of Anna Nicole Smith's in the Naked Gun 33 1/3). Absolutely worth owning for the comedic/gore value."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sometimes It's Not About Horror...","review":"If you watch this movie in hopes of coming across a truly misunderstood horror gem...then you will be terribly disappointed. The acting is weak, the plot is riddled with holes and was obviously thrown together in five minutes, the make-up and effects (if you can call them that) are just plain silly. But still, this movie is worth watching. Why? Heather Elizabeth Parkhurst and Stella Stevens, of course! Gorgeous and seductive, Parkhurst is lovely to look at, and with her cheesy one-liners and badly applied make-up, Stella Stevens is hilarious! Highlights include the wrestling addicted nephew and the \\"Melting scene\\" of Wolfgang the Cat. Seriously."},{"rating":"1","title":"A New Role Model for Hagglers Everywhere!","review":"The term \\"haggler\\", contrary to what most people think when they hear it (\\"one who haggles\\"), has become a great inside joke word to me and my friends. A haggler, to us, is an old frump with an ugly voice, who may or may not make ugly faces and gestures. It developed from characters like the Granny, and old hags that can only be imitated with raspy exaggeration and by plugging your nose. But about the movie.. all I can say is that by all conventional standards, it is truly terrible. Most reviewers have already said that the plot sucks, it has bad acting and bad make-up, etc. The Granny was entertaining, but far from being a good movie. The *ONLY* reason I would recommend this movie to anyone is that it will make you laugh. If you enjoy ridiculous horror movies like me, you won't be disappointed, but don't even think about buying it otherwise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"This little pamphlet is only 45 pages long and costs sixty dollars. It just has some screen shots and is very simplistic. Save your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor","review":"For something like this to work, it must be the highest quality image, full screen, and interesting to look at. This was just junk. I work in video, was trained in video arts when I went to art school, and can tell you that this video is without creativity, without imagination, and it is certainly bad art. If you can find a video called \\"By Design\\" by a company called Colorcalm,you will see what a collection of great video artists are capable of doing. This video has a series of gorgeous and subtle video 'chapters', each one like a beautiful moving abstract painting. I've wanted to buy this for all my friends, but I can't seem to find even one other copy. Meanwhile, save your money on this video. I looked at this for a couple minutes, and then through it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mine fell apart","review":"First, let me qualify by stating that I did not purchase this item through Amazon; but I purchased the exact same brand and item at a retail store as a Christmas gift for a friend. He had it for approximately one week, holding 4 remotes, when a piece fell off. When I picked it up to see what happened, the ENTIRE holder fell apart completely - - it is evidently just glued together. It's too bad, because this is a VERY nice looking item, we really liked the fact that it swiveled on a round base, and it worked great for the one week it held together. Perhaps I got a lemon. I'd say take your chances; maybe you'll get one that's glued together better than the one I purchased."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Bike","review":"This is a good bike for the price of $179.99 with free shipping. The frame is sturdy and the bike overall is well built. The gears were not changing properly and skipped at times which resulted in bike being taken to local shop for a tune-up. Also had the brakes adjusted as part of the tune-up. Bike is much better now and provides a nice ride. The seat was quite hard, but a gel seat cover made things much better. I feel the bike is an excellent entry level bike and fits my need for occasional use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't go wrong with Schwinn","review":"For the price you pay, Schwinn makes some of the best bikes available.

In the end, it is costing me money. Bikes are amazingly complicated machines and difficult to assemble. I failed to tighten the petal sufficiently and it fell off in a week, having ruined a piece of the bike. Price at a bike shop to get it all fixed up--55 dollars. So please, spend the little extra at a bike shop and save yourself both money and frustration.

While it includes day hikes in the first section, the second section is great if you are planning to hike (and camp) for more than one day. Not only does it include trail descriptions, mileage, it also offers advice on how many miles to do per day, etc. I did find one \\"error\\" during the Hazel Mountain day hike section (the mileage in the text doesn't match the mileage in the description) but that's not major.

Unfortunately the best-before date was 18 December last year!. I've heard other reviewers had similar problem. That's a bit shabby of Amazon. I didn't much care for the taste of the coffee either and will end up giving it away. I'm sure Amazon would let me return it for a refund but for a box of coffee, I just haven't got the time to waste. Bad Amazon... maybe perishable foods is not a great idea for an \\"eTaler\\".

Some of it serious, some of it not so serious.\\"The Insider's Guide to the Colleges 2005\\" is one of those to be taken not too seriously. If anything, I would suggest this is a good book to read, when your son or daughter is close to making a decision, and (s)he wants to find confirmation of impressions already made. My son concentrated his college search to colleges in the southern half of Ohio, and having visited a number of them, the descriptions in this book seem on target, in a general \\"gut check\\" kinda way.I certainly would not recommend this book as the most essential book to read when starting off on your college search. But it is a fun, irrevent look at the college scene, and the book should be taken as such, nothing more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Party on...or study on, depending...","review":"So, according to this guide every school must be either...a) A \\"party school\\" where the students are inebriated a greater percentage of the time than they spend in class. It turns out that the tuition and board at these schools are merely cover charges for the four years of parties and jam-band concerts. Chances are you'll miss the majority of your classes due to hangovers, so don't even bother with the academics.orb) A \\"nerd school\\" where the social life is defined by the number of people in your study group.

It's predigested candy for a true Battletech reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unrealistic","review":"This book is a bad joke by an author who seems to suffer from Monty Haul symptoms. He does have some writing skills (hence two stars) but his grip on universe realism is appaling. Omnimechs maintained by mechwarriors with the skills of astechs? Asinine plans by washed up Nova Cats to stealthily strike at the Combine capital? And of course the infamous getaway with two companies worth of Omnimechs. Whoopie...

I've used it on 3 different dogs, including my own and I have to use 2-3 times as much as the other shampoos I use and this stuff costs twice as much already!It does NOT clean the animals very well, and leaves their coats feeling rather greasy and almost sticky (it's also very hard to rinse off--takes forever) I have a 2 year old black lab who is on an excellent diet--holistic raw food and a little grain free dry and she has an exceptionally shiny coat. Well, it does NOT shine since I used this shampoo.

I know the lather is just for us humans, but it lathers up pretty good so I know I've gotten all the soap out during the rinsing stage and my dog's fur doesn't normally lather too well. Also, my dog likes to rub her face and body into stinky things she finds so I'm sure I give her more washings than the vet recommends and this soap is mild so it all works out.

This is the only brand that keeps the odor off of him and makes him fluffy and soft for at least two weeks. I buy the gallon size which lasts me forever.

Great stuff that somehow slipped through the musical cracks. Thanks to Bear Family for a great reissue. I had never would have heard about this if it wasn't for a mention in MOJO magazine last year. Sounded intriguing, so I took a chance on it, before ever hearing a single song. This definitely exceeded my expectations. I thought it would be mostly country or folk, by Jim Ford crosses all sorts of musical genres, even dipping into soul/R&B (a couple of great tunes with Bobby Womack) and pop (one song that Nick Lowe later covered). Several songs that coulda/shoulda been hits. All in all, a very interesting collection.

He saw them as deeper messages delivered to us from our unconscious. He saw them as telling the secrets about ourselves to ourselves and the world that we do not necessarily want to tell. He saw them as acts of aggression and as acts of self- defense. In fact Freud is one of the few theorists of jokes and laughter that the world has had. In my opinion while Freud's understanding of jokes is not exhaustive and all- comprehensive it does illuminate much about a certain kind of humor. And it does teach us something about ourselves which we had not really noticed before Freud taught it to us. Freud himself is of course a source of endless jokes today , but it is not wrong to say that at least some of these jokes should be about his great genius and ability to see and say where others before him did not."},{"rating":"2","title":"So necessary","review":"I don't know how many times I turn to this essay.

Those are the only positives I've seen with this film.I've had much better results shooting Fuji Superia. It's a better film in effectively every regard -- better color, better contrast, and is also cheap.

The liner notes go to great lengths to sell the buyer on the ties that bind the Bach to the 20th century composers but it sounds more like begging than explaining. The Zimmerman, the Hosokawa, Yun, Verese, Holliger and Carter pieces need to be collected together on a series of recordings and the Bach either jettisoned or sequestered. Maybe someday a re-release will save what's good about this series and reduce 6 mediocre CD recordings down to what should be 3. Buy the Bach elsewhere--there are over a dozen great choices."},{"rating":"2","title":"Improved the ride of the truck.","review":"When I first purchased these I was anxious that my truck will now ride like a full ton.

It has a charming, vintage feel...both the books and the illustrations.)\\"Charles was all alone. Charles had no one to sit with him when he ate his dinner. He had no one to wish him pleasant dreams when he went to bed.\\" The illustrations, combined with the words, are nearly enough to make a person cry from the bittersweet loneliness of the little bunny.SPOILER ALERT: Charles goes search of a friend, but has to give up his search when he comes across an injured bird.

Having recently watched it again I was a little cautious about how it would be, so many years later. It's still just as great.

The only legitimate intellectual response to this ludicrous film is laughter. Throwing up, unfortunately, is not an intellectual response.

Not much for the guys here, plus it's questionable how attractive to ladies a leading man can be whose main interest is wearing stockings and prancing around on tip toe. Baryshnikov isn't even good-looking with his surly face. As for the tortured artist angle, we all know that ballet dancers were among the few classes spoilt by the corrupt Soviet system. The plots as thin as Bary's stockings. Anyway, that whole Cold War thing is pretty much outdated and passe nowadays."},{"rating":"2","title":"Baryshnikov dominates","review":"A fairly pedestrian Iron Curtain drama, redeemed by the extraordinary athleticism of Mikhail Baryshnikov. In comparison, Gregory Hines is a bit player. Two highlights - the opening ballet of Le Jeune Homme et La Mort, and the scene in the middle of the film where Baryshnikov dances his rage against the Soviet system to Vysotsky's \\"The Horses\\". All the pain of Russia's tormented history can be heard in Vysotsky's voice. When he died in his early forties, one million people attended his funeral."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Dancing.","review":"Marvellous to be able to see Barishnikov at his best and Hines with his tap dancing is unbelieveable to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh what a night!","review":"Two of the best dancers in their catagory that ever lived. This is a great showcase for that talent. The story line of political power plays was shown from two sides, that of a defected Russian and a disillusioned American. The music by Phil Collins was a bonus that added to the magic. The highlight of this movie was the dance sequence with Mikhail Baryshnikov and Gregory Hines. Beautiful!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A True Classic","review":"I searched a long time for this I had it on a video cassette but could never find it on dvd.

I find that of the hundreds of classical CDs I own, it is one of those I listen to the most. Though both pieces are good, the String Serenade in E is the real gem - it is surely one of the most melodic, charming, and delightful pieces for strings after Mozart's popular Eine Kleine Nachtmusik. The opening moderato movement will undoubtedly cheer you up, whatever your mood. If all you know of Dvorak is the \\"New World symphony, these wonderful chamber pieces are from a wholly different sound world. There is certainly none of the 9th symphony's pathos and grandeur here, just beautiful and charming melody, but without sinking into triviality and banality.Chung and the Vienna Philharmonic establish the perfect tempos for these pieces, which lose something of their charm if played too slowly and lose their melodic spell if played too fast."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable.","review":"Really good performances of those little Dvorak gems.

If you like Local H, Sonic Youth, Nirvana, or early Hole, this is the band for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very useful","review":"I don't find this to be that useful. The only benefit is that it holds the iPod upright (it has a line out feature, but that's not why I purchased it and I won't use that). I assumed (incorrectly) that it came with it's own power cord, so that it would, by itself, charge the iPod. You must purchase a separate plug or use the USB jack that it came with. I wanted an addition means of charging the nano. Had I known that it was just a base, I wouldn't have purchased this item, certainly not for $30.

I thought, \\"Let's see if this thing can stand a little plastic surgery.\\" I bought my husband one of those Dremel drilling tools for Christmas last year, and it works like a charm to drill out the excess plastic. At first there was a small ridge that was making my iPod connect and then disconnect from iTunes - that puppy has got to be completely flush.

I will be supporting other vendors's products. Why not throw in a $2 cable & charge $35 for the package. Think of all the ill will that is generated by the surprise need to go out and get a cable.

This is NOT a martial arts film unless you consider flinging marbles and flicking matches at people martial arts. I thought it was silly. Director Susie Au obviously comes from a music video background. I found the random quick and quirky edits tiring, although they did set up the actors with wonderfully posed portraits throughout. Daniel Wu has an awesome hairdo if you go for that kind of thing. Zhou Xun's Cantonese is quite fetching and ordinarily I could watch her all day long. She's one of the more engaging actresses from China.

Given the price of the toy, the intended use outdoors with children, and what was actually provided, I expected it should all be high to medium quality. The turnbuckle was of such low quality to the point it is unusable.A friend bought this toy earlier and did not report these problems to us, and were happy with it.

The bristles are all intact, and while I've managed to drop it onto our tile bathroom floor on countless occasions, it's also still in one piece. Somehow it also makes brushing easier, allowing me to get a little crazy and start brushing out my wet hair after a shower from the middle / close to the top rather than making progress with the little tangles at the bottom.

I have since switched to another paddle brush that has 100% wood bristles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frayed and Weak","review":"The nylon bristles on this brush are very thin and do not even reach the scalp through my thin hair. I purchased this for my boyfriend who is growing out his thick hair, so it was absolutely useless. The boar bristles are too short and just skim over the top layer of hair. They were also frayed out like an old toothbrush when we received it. Overall, I prefer myConair Professional Full and Mid Size Nylon Cushion Brush Set, Colors may varyto this flimsy thing.

My other Ball drinking mugs say Ball right on the jar, so I didn't realize that plain means plain glass, so they dont look very good. Also there was a note in the box that says,\\"Not suitable for hot beverages.\\" I use my mugs in the microwave to make hot chocolate, but since these say they are not safe, I am afraid that they might explode.

This is not one of the better ones generally and not even one of the better with \\"classical\\" themes. Too many of the selected pieces are not among the most tranquil-evoking works; the choice of guitar arrangements was promising but unfortunately the playing style is so crisp and strident that you have to turn the volume down considerably to achieve any general sense of tranquility in the sounds. Omissions were obvious: no Pachabel's Canon, no Siegfried Idyll, no Peer Gynt, no Scheherazade themes, and only one of the three Gymnopodies. All these and more could have been included within the physical limitations of CDs if just a few of the marginally tranquil selections had been omitted.

For example, they show you how to create a very specific type of navigation bar. However, what if you want to create a tabbed navigation bar (like Amazon's), or a menu bar that doesn't rely on one of Photoshop's preset button \\"styles\\" for it's look? I think this is the kind of book where (hopefully) there is a specific project they've done that you can incororate into your own web site as is. If not, you're probably out of luck. The book doesn't teach you how to create navigation bars, it teaches you how to create their specific navigation bar.

His repertoire included Brahms, Beethoven, of course the Russians, and was known for his ability as an accompanist. This recording, live with the Amsterdam Concertgebouw, is interesting if not one of his best performances. This series of releases on Philips, six in all, did not last long in the catalogue and was not especially well received by critics. I found them all worthy of owning, but unless you're a dedicated collector of Kondrashin's recordings, this is one of the lesser issues. I would recommend it at a fair price, but certainly not at the inflated prices you may find here and there. Save your cash--there are many better Eroicas and many better examples of Kondrashin's superb conducting and musicianship."},{"rating":"1","title":"Made Me Sick","review":"This particular pill was way too much for my system.

I will say though it is easy to carry even without using the strap b/c it is so light. Also, the chair needs to be on a relatively level surface of course or else you are going to sit on an angle.

Its very slow tempo and ethereally beautiful choral harmonies allow me to settle into a tender, peacefully radiant space, and its gentle majesty can bring tears to my eyes. Van Sickle's use of vowel sounds instead of regular lyrics throughout most of the piece creates powerful energy resonances in (and beyond) the body, and when the words finally do come -- \\"Father, Father, I am\\" -- they provide a powerful affirmation of oneness with the divine.

I even tried the \\"Zenith\\" hack mentioned in another review.While the remote was dissapointing, it did have six inputs, and a good indication of which one was selected. Better than the passive 4 input box anyhow?? NO. The audio section was horrid. It clipped badly when fed standard level signals.

It seems this book was written more from the African perspective than the African-American angle, so I find it interesting that Wamba thinks of himself as a \\"black-American\\", not an African.

I felt as if I was left hanging. Mr. Wamba, for the most part, only focused on his and other Africans' negative experiences with African-Americans while barely touching on their positive encounters (which I'm sure there are many) outside of the impression African-American pop-culture has made on African youths. Mr. Wamba fails to fully explain the reasons for the hostility African-Americans and African people have for each other. He only mentions it and gives no intelligent explanation or solution. The author gave us little hope that the gap between African and African-American people will ever be bridged.

Amy's style is easy, clear and has enough breaks in the action to let you catch your breath. I now like to switch off between the beginning and intermediate workout. Some days, I find the \\"easier\\" program harder if I haven't done it in a couple of weeks. One thing I've noticed is that one really gets better at the moves, which are simple but you can feel your hip snaps and thrusts really working. ** I've taken off an inch from my mama belly **"},{"rating":"2","title":"He that hath eyes to see, let him see.","review":"A truly heart-breaking story, the moral of which could not be clearer. Attempting to separate young (or older) gay people from their natural sexuality and to bully them (physically, morally or otherwise) into \\"changing\\" their orientation amounts to psychological, emotional and spiritual abuse, the consequences of which can be catastrophic. Those who do it don't intend to abuse or even realise that they are doing so, but what they are doing remains abuse for all that, and no amount of quoting from the Bible can excuse it.If you are a parent and find it difficult to accept your gay son's or daughter's sexuality, you should read \\"Prayers for Bobby\\"; it may help you to avoid the kind of terrible tragedy that Mary Griffith and her family went through.

Everyone deserves the right to be happy but for some people it takes something bigger for that happiness to become a reality.

Sad but extremely powerful. It is a must read for anyone, especially mothers who are having a difficult time coming to grips with the sexual orientation of their children.The book is well written and detailed.

The author moves quickly and assumes you know your way around a guitar and playing chords. He spends his time where he should, which is on the specifics of the Flamenco technique that are different from standard guitar playing.If you already play guitar of some sort and want a quick way to add a little Flamenco to your repertoire, then this DVD is for you. He goes through several basic Flamenco strumming and picking patterns and through a couple of complete songs. The TAB for the songs is available on the website (password comes with the DVD). This is all many of us want (including myself) and I was very pleased with the DVD. However, if you want a very thorough and methodical Flamenco instruction manual, this is not for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great intro for those who want to explore Flamenco","review":"I've played guitar for years, but never studied Flamenco. Based on the other reviews here I decided to try out this DVD. I'm very glad I did. With a little practice you can learn some very basic Flamenco and add a little spice to your guitar playing.

I am getting Malaguena, and Tarantas and am looking at Solearres. Charles is also easy to follow and good natured. I like that line 'Have it your way\\" or basically you don't have to play these songs by the letter as he said you must do with classical music.

Then why the hell did he write the book! I am sure there are many others who would have at least written an an unbiased look at Zemeckis's films. Also there is alot inaccurate information and quotes from the particular films. It seems like the author was incorrectly remembering the films after seeing them many years before. He feels that because Bob is such a genius at the tech. of film making, then his films must be shallow and have no real meaning. I don't agree with this all. The signatures of Bob's films are that they are full of real heart and overflowing with ideas that make you think.

John would know the scriptures Jesus quotes from.I'm sorry, but I won't seat through this bad sermon questioning God. Our Sovereign God is always right, therefore I trust Him.

Shut up and ask for a lawyer.2. An investigator is most likely lying to you in an attempt to scare you into saying anything.3. Once you say anything, you will tend to keep talking. So don't say anything about anything.4. Be extremely cautious about being coerced into giving consent to a search.5. If a warrant is not produced, tell (don't ask) an investigator to leave.6. When in doubt, see rule 1.That is more than is contained within this book. If you break any of the above rules, you will hinder your defense, And/or you will lead yourself down a path towards arrest.

Every chapter is basically a variation of those two things. Total waste of time, save your money.I bought this book because I heard interesting things about Benson's books. If this is an indication of what his other books are like, then don't bother with any of them. Interviews, Investigations, and Interrogations, is a great idea for a book, but there's no substance.

The point of the book is to teach you how to stay calm if your being asked questions, and how to tell if someone is lying to you and how to get the info you want from someone else. Maybe some people thought they were gonna be able to pull a rabbit out of their hat after reading this book? Get this book and watch Man on Fire shortly afterwards.

Yes, the movies are fun but the novel is so important I'm surprised it isn't required reading for say, senior high school English. The issues it raises and explores include the paradoxical connections between life and birth and death. It examines relationships, the concept of \\"parenting\\", motherhood, sex and procreation. The world of nature and the man-made world, responsibility and knowledge, what makes us human. M.Shelly was only nineteen when she wrote it but she had suffered several miscarriges and the death of her baby by that time. The issues she writes about in Frankenstein must have been haunting her for some time.

Men's Recovery Project is Sam's new band, think Born Against meets synthesizers, feedback, and general insanity. 45 or so songs. The album is actually 10 or so songs, but the album is repeated and remixed a couple times. It's very unique in that way, I tried to pick out my favorite album version, and just found myself liking the whole thing.Definitely a themed album, or concept album. And looks good in my collection. Hard to find, best bet is from Kill Rock Stars, of from Vermiform.com itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Voodoo Book!","review":"This is a great voodoo book.

However, some brief research indicated one of the capacitors had gone bad so I opened the TV and found the bad unit. I searched Amazon for the replacement product and found this item. Even with shipping, it's price was about 1% of the purchase cost of my TV. I found instructions on how to repair and it took me less than an hour to install and put my TV back together. The TV powered on instantly and it is still working perfectly today."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing violinism, but just a bit too fast for my liking","review":"Ashtonishing virtuosity is once again on show here from Gil Shaham, and the end result is very impressive. However, this performance of the D major concerto is just not to my taste. I feel that Abbado and Shaham play just a little too quickly, which robs this concerto of some of its poise, grace and power. Just listen to the orchestral ritornello, one does not get the sense of nobility and strength that I believe is one of the cornerstones of the first movement. Similarly, I think that the adagio loses its beautiful contemplative nature owing to the fast speed to which it is driven. However, it would be churlish to dismiss the recording, but in terms of making the very strongest case for this wonderful work, I would point listeners to Milstein/Steinberg, Mutter/Karajan (preferable to her remake with Masur) or Vengerov/Barenboim."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Amazing Record","review":"Musically and sonically, this album is undeniably enjoyable and trippy - easy to get lost in. It moves from one song to the next like a neo-psychedelic suite; quiet melodies and provocative sonic hooks abound. If you appreciate the sounds of Grandaddy, Mercury Rev and Sparklehorse, you will love this. My only complaint is the vocals. Like those previously mentioned bands, much of the vocals tend to be whispery and nasally - a trend (it seems by a lot of Dave Fridmann-produced bands) that I don't really care for. Other than that minor personal issue - a brilliant and addictive record!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my cup of tea","review":"I was a little disapointed with the book.

I was looking for a glove to protect my hands when doing major construction such as framing, etc. I was intrigued by the claims of dexterity and toughness. I was dissapointed. On one hand these gloves did protect my hands rather well. There toughness left something to be desired. The velcro closure on one glove came off by the third wearing. After 4 weeks on a 400 sq ft addition one of the fingers began to pop out. There name \\"true-grip\\" is slighty mis-leading. I nearly killed one of my workers when my Framing hammer (wooden handle) flew from my hands do to lack of friction. The Kevlar pads are tough but certainly not grippy. I must admit that the Kevlar pads have protected my hands and are very tough. Wish I could say the same about the rest of the glove (seams, thread, etc.) At the price you pay for these you would expect them to be a little more durable and long lasting. I don't think they were meant to be throw aways."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gloves were great the first day..","review":"I got the gloves as a gift and thought they were great.

Day 2 I noticed the forefinger and little finger on the left hand starting to split open and get raggity. By the end of the second day the gloves showed signs of a pair of $2.00 gloves on their last legs. I wore them for a few more days with my forefinger and little pinky sticking out and getting upset about how much these were and decided to write this review.

The case of the power supply was literally melting, and I nearly burned myself picking it up. I am certain it would have caught fire if I left it on for 30 more seconds. What's worse is the fact that this thing seems notorious for its power supply melting and frying HDDs (sometimes catching fire).This goes to show you that you should read reviews even for cheapie purchases.Take a look at the reviews for this on newegg.

However, if you happen to touch the large central menu button (hard to avoid because of its size and central location) it reverses to \\"mouse mode\\" - the two buttons turn to right and left mouse buttons- result the slides will not then advance- if this happens during your presentation- takes some figuring out!THe poor battery life, weak laser and large and wrongly placed menu button make this an undesirable item- coupled with the fact that my first one blew out its circuit after 8 months (4 weeks for replacement and UPS costs)makes it an unrecommendable item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont buy","review":"Worst purchase ever made, full of flaws, buttons don't always response well, double clicking problems, right click problems.

The little plastic \\"feet\\" glued to the bottom to help it glide more smoothly started falling off after 2 days.But I would not be so angry at this product but for the fact that it goes through 1 pair of AAA batteries a week.

Unfortunately it has been made very cheaply and does not work about 15% of the time you are trying to use it and about 25% of the time it will work sporadically so lately I have been opting to use my Touchpad rather than see if it wants to work.

Kensington has released one recently but it's pricey. I placed my NiMh batteries in here (highly recommended) and it works great so far! It's small and compact but a bit heavier than most mice because of batteries. I wouldn't say movement is perfect, but satisfactory. The scroll wheel is fine.The mouse I had before was Logitech's popular blue optical wheel mouse. Targus's mini optical wireless mouse is great for laptop users but it isn't the smoothest mouse in the world.

Sometimes it works fine, but most of the time the tracking is inaccurate, worst than a pad track. Also, throwing the mouse in a bag makes it transmit continuously (buttons pressed), and the batteries run empty soon (few days). I'd return it, but I let more than 30 days pass.

I like the on-off switch, wish my Logitech wireless mouse for my home pc had this feature.Only negative is that the wheel moves more than one \\"wheel click amount\\" for each physcial click, so it scrolls faster and less consistently than it is supposed to.

Now need to find out how to get money back without that plastic packaging, that must be destroyed to get it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I have been working on a history of heavy automatic weapons and their ammunition, which inevitably includes a great deal about aircraft guns. When I saw the advert for this book, I bought it sight unseen. Big mistake. There is virtually nothing about the development of the different types of weapons and what there is has an enormous US bias. What little information there is about non-US equipment is often laughably inaccurate (the one \\"French\\" aircraft of WW2 is - the RAF's Boulton Paul Defiant!). Even the US information is largely in the form of pictures, many of them just showing gun muzzles sticking out of wings or turrets. From my viewpoint, a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading Title","review":"This book does not describe aircraft guns; it supplies a listing of which aircraft used guns of various types, and it gives short descriptions of the aircraft. There are no details about gun installations, problems, or performance in the aircraft listed. Aircraft guns are chosen for definite reasons, but the book does not give any of these reasons.There are many errors in the book. For example, three of the four photo captions on page 28 are incorrect.With its lack of information and simplistic descriptions, the book seems to written for older children. A second edition with errors corrected might be a worthwhile addition to an elementary or junior high school library. It is not worthwhile for a knowledgable adult."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but misses great","review":"I bought the first book this duo wrote (C-Planes) and it was truly excellent. This one did not quite meet that standard. However, my two teenage boys, aviations nuts themselves, did enjoy it very much. It is a good, basic overview of aerial gun warfare, but it doesn't have the depth and detail that I was hoping for. Maybe they coud do a second edition, and get it up to their earlier very high standard!"},{"rating":"1","title":"An unusually poor book from a quality publisher","review":"I was extremely disappointed with what seemed to be a promising idea. There is far too much information on the aircraft (much of it not pertaining to the title topic), and not enough on the guns, their function, and their installation. Photo choices are also often inappropriate for the topic, and there are an unsettling number of typos and omissions. (For instance, the B-47 is listed, but the description makes NO mention of its defensive armament!) In addition, the period before World War II, when many of the precepts of aircraft armament were first developed, is glossed over in far too few pages. No, Schiffer usually produces excellent products, but this is NOT one of them, and I am sorry I purchased this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply a Pleasure!","review":"The consumate performer comes through with outstanding musicians and an updated sound. Some terrific new songs and old favorites. Even my kids enjoy this tape, watching all of the incredible musicians like Richard Bona and dancing along with the upbeat classics like \\"Matilda\\" and \\"Kwela (Listen to the Man).\\" I saw Harry Belafonte perform last night and he can still belt them out at age 74! Trust me, this is a quality production."},{"rating":"2","title":"David's review of Harry","review":"I first saw the video at one of my favorite Carribean restaurants. It was playing for the patrons as we munched on our fish orders. I instantly fell in love with it and when I found out the particulars, I ordered it from Amazon.com. It was very easy to order. It got here when they told me it would and I have really enjoyed it. The quality of the DVD is first rate. The programing of the show was outstanding and I have played it over and over again. I am very pleased with Amazon.com for having the DVD in stock, getting it out to me quickly and without incident. Harry Belefonte is exceptional in the video and the selection of songs will have you humming them for weeks. My favorite is Matilda.

So far, I haven't found it's enhanced qualities except the price. It does the job but nothing special about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major Rip-Off","review":"I bought this DVD because I love to watch figure skaters. I have many of the performances on this DVD on old video tapes, but wanted them all in one DVD, so I'd have them in one place, easily indexed, so I could find each performance without having to fast forward. Well, was I mistaken. This so-called DVD is actually more a video CD. There are no extras, and there isn't a menu. They didn't even put chaptering on the thing so you could skip to the beginning of each performance, so I'm still stuck fast-forwarding through the DVD to get to what I want to watch. And splitting the set into two volumes was just a way for the greedy to scam more money. Both volumes would easily have fit on one DVD, with room to spare for extras that weren't included. I gave this one star because Amazon doesn't give an option for zero stars. It really deserved a negative one."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's O.K., but not great","review":"I agree with most of the reviewers--it would have been nice to have a menu and be able to click through the performances to see a particular skater. I wonder if the producers made it first for video and then just recorded it on DVD without any changes.Truly, forwarding through the DVD would be great for my daughter. She's a figure skater and wants to analyze different performances.What was really frustrating was the way they built up the two Carmens (Katerina Witt and Debi Thomas), but didn't show much of Debi's performance. It would have been nice to compare the two."},{"rating":"1","title":"major ripoff","review":"Both volumes 1 and 2 are a major ripoff. There is less than one hour of film on each DVD, which could hold 6 hours or more. The clips are short and only show part of the performances. Most of the DFD is blather from the commentators. I was so disappointed I almost cried. Where is Sasha Cohen, the greatest skater who ever lived?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it!","review":"This is one of those skating DVD's that is designed to maximize profit for the producer, while giving the buyer very little in return. Only 60 minutes of coverage???Save your money and find the skating clips on you tube instead. I would personally buy skating DVD's if they actually had commentary, narration (such as the history of skating), and some extras, but this is ridiculous."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Much Pleased","review":"I was very pleased with this DVD. Practically all of the performances were in their entirety.

They are both with the same problems.I looked in Costco, Walmart and other stores for similar bikes, all of them with similar price tag are in better shape than these.I bought it for the reason that it states \\"Kawasaki\\" which should be at least assurance of quality.

For a $100 I paid for it on Amazon it all I expected it to be. The only thing I changed was the saddle, as it was a little hard for my butt.

I ended up tossing the instructions and just screwing stuff in where it seemed to fit. Either the bike is crappy or I didn't put it together very well. The petal has already fallen off, I thought I screwed it in right, but it's possible I could've cross-threaded it. Yeah, either this bike is crap or I'm just a moron who didn't put it together right.

If you don't like love triangles, especially ones that don't work out at all, DO NOT read this book. I have read every single one of Jill Barnett's books and short stories, and this is the only one I did not like. It's an excellent STORY. The J.R. and Kitty romance was good.

I feel that this must be known in fairness to the Portuguese people who may be trying their best and in fairness to people like me, the foreigners, who may be unduly discouraged from enjoying this charming land. On health matters, as on others 'Living and working in Portugal: all you need to know to enjoy life in Portugal' may frighten you away rather than tell you 'what you need to know'.

Check it out from the library if you must, but know that it takes a very, very scattershot approach to what is essentially a great books reading program.The author's choices are often poor, both in recommended material and approach- for example, there is no reason to chide us not to read our email in the morning, yet because this doesn't work for the author, well, by God, it doesn't work at all.I would strongly suggest looking around at university courses on Great Books, browsing their syllabi, and developing your own program instead.

The author takes a very daunting task (to become \\"well read\\" and classically educated) and truly encourages and motivates the reader.She offers her lists which, she explains, are just a starting point and not exhaustive. They are set up chronologically and she encourages the reader to make the lists their own by adding to or subtracting from the list.She also offers her perspective and insight on how to accomplish the task at hand. For instance, she doesn't read her email prior to starting a serious reading. Her analysis of the issue hit the nail on the head.I also appreciated the fact the author didn't re-write history by removing the Christian writings from her lists.

Some of these influences dominate the album, and others show up on only one or two songs. What other band has a sound which is that wide ranging?There is a great pace to this album - very well arranged. No disrespect to Built to Spill and Band of Horses, but this is by far the best album of the year. And I really, really love the other two.Here is hoping that this album opens the door for a good band with a somewhat similar sound and a lot of talent in Lake Trout.

This band has come a long way in the past few months, but don't believe the hype. Its a great band, a fun cd, but not my contender for album of the year. However, it is nice to see a good rock band emerge out of a scene full of shallow, dime-a-dozen emo acts.

Every song on this album great, and I highly recommend this band to anyone sick of the \\"alternative rock\\" bands played on the radio nowadays.

Have to agree with the few others on here that are aghast at the popularity and positive reviews of this band. They sound like a Holiday Inn-style Smashing Pumpkins cover band--if said cover band consisted of 15-year olds. But be clear: the Pickups' can't play with anywhere NEAR the ferocity and/or virtuosity of either the Pumpkins' Billy Corgan or Jimmy Chamberlain.I may be only one of a few that finds this disgraceful--but unless you're a 13 year old girl or have never heard of the Smashing Pumpkins (in which case you should definitely buy that stuff first) -- keep moving on past this one. These guys should never have even been signed to a record deal--it's a travesty unoriginality like this is rewarded.Oh well. No matter.

Only when you receive your order confirmation email will you see which vendors charged what for shipping."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous for funghi lovers!","review":"I recommend this book for fungi lovers old and new. Great tips and fabulous recipes, along with cute family stories. I use this book often for dinner parties and family dinners.

As a professional chef, I can't help noticing the details, a slight mistake: demi-glace is never made from chicken. Also, one of the mushrooms listed has a completely different season here in PA, than in the book.A note of caution, I would not use this as a field guide, it is not comprehensive enough. There is no mention of spore prints or of look-a-like mushrooms.

It is very spacious even with the laptop inside... it has numerous pockets to store almost everything... it can carry your computer with numerous thick books and they still fit!! The revolutionary front zipper opens vertically so you can access or store your books very easy!Also the computer compartment has padding giving extra protection against shocks and water! also the padding do not go all the way to the bottom of the bag... this is great because when you put the bag on the ground or in any surface your computer will not hit it!In addition, you got LIFETIME WARRANTY! If by some reason your bag breaks, Targus will replace it NO QUESTIONS ASKED! The only thing you need to do is call them and mail it! And you will get a brand new one!Finally this product is great I have been using mine for the last 4 years! And it still like new!It is worth your money because you will not have to buy any other computer backpack! It will last forever!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Could use more pockets","review":"Like other reviewers, I've found this item to be quite a little gem. The large side pocket is deep and has more than enough space to carry nails, screws, hardware, etc. However, there are only two small slot-type pockets for screwdrivers and other small tools. If it had a couple more, it would be worth 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"A keeper","review":"I bought this DVD and shared it with friends. One friend borrowed it, so he could take it home and listen to the whole thing. He finally returned it, then another friend who had already seen it asked me to bring it back and let her keep it for a few days. I have finally given it to her. Now, I am going to buy another God Bless America, and no one is going to borrow it. Seriously, it is a wonderful DVD, with varied talents from different ones. There is a harmonica special on there that is, alone, worth the price. Lynda Randle sings a beautiful song,with a little help from some friends. David Phelps is, according to this writer, always worth the price. (In fact, he was my original reason for purchasing this particular DVD, and what a great buy!) Like in so much of what the Gaither's produce, there is a little bit of history too. The humor is great, and if my experience means anything, it will be a great blessing to share. It is a keeper! Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good","review":"I like this DVD. There are many artists singing and performances of Natalie Grant and Whintley Phipps are superb.

Bountiful Baskets is suitable for beginners and those who have a wealth of basket knowledge. Everyone has a 'finished' look in mind and this not only provides the information and photos of finished products it gives ideas about other options one hasn't thought about.

This is definitely one to keep for my library. Good purchase!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book I have ever read","review":"This is the best book i have ever read. The ultimat best characters. An unraveling plot. Unending suspence. The constant battle between good and evil. Dwarfs, Hobbits, Goblins, Eagles, Ravens, Trolls, and wizards make up the wide variety of characters in The Hobbit. Magic, strategy, witts, and will are all forces in the outcome of an infinatly long and strenuous adventure. This is a MUST read. Buy it, borrow it, just get it. It is in fact one of the greatest books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not anything to jump at...","review":"I recommend the Mind's Eye dramatization of this. At least Mind's Eye gets the pronunciation of names correct. GahLOOM for Gollum? All it takes is listening to Tolkien himself reading \\"Riddles in the Dark\\" (I recommend the Tolkien Audio Collection) to know that these producers didn't do their homework. Also, the split narrative is a bit distracting, and Bilbo's constant hemming and hawing makes him sound like he has a mental condition. The voice casting leaves MUCH to be desired as well. Gandalf (or GawnDAWLF as they mispronounce it) sounds awful! This actor would be interesting as Wormtongue in LOTR, but as Gandalf - PTOOIE! The script is not badly written, although they emphasize some WEIRD things in the plot, like an overlong description of Elrond."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous!","review":"Exquisite! The voice actors were some of the best British actors of their time and don't disappoint. The background music is fabulous - very original.

The abridgement is poorly done, and takes unnecessary liberties with the book, the diction is unclear and muddy, the transfer from tape was botched so that everything streams by at a too-rapid clip, with unnaturally squeaky voices and sounds, and the special effects are laughable (the Trolls speak through vocoders (\\"Were you in D'Nang?\\").I bought this and couldn't listen to even the first disc of five; I returned it."},{"rating":"1","title":"not very interesting at all","review":"When I bought this book I was expecting something much better, unfortunately I was very disappointed, it contains few techniques and is not very clear with poor descriptions, do not buy!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Essential Classic Reference Work","review":"This is a magnificent book carefully crafted by two of the leading theorists of the twentieth century. If you have a basic grounding in mechanics, vector analysis and tensor analysis then much of this book will be accessible. The early parts of the book are concerned with Special Relativity and the classical electromagnetic field using the action principle and tensor form of Maxwell's Equations. Later in the book there is in depth presentation of the General Theory of Relativity. This is very much a reference book rather than one to approach these subjects for the first time. There are no exercises or problems but it is a truly masterly work and well worth the money spent upon it and time invested studying it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A cult classic.","review":"Seriously, a cult classic. And one should beware of cults. It's a very elegant, pristine presentation. However, this is often at the expense of sweeping some messier issues under the rug. Landau's reasoning has a very fluid intuitive quality, and it is easy to float along with as long as you don't stop an notice that sometimes it doesn't really make sense. I once heard a prominent physicist say of Landau's papers \\"everything's wrong except the answers\\". An exaggeration but some truth to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very dense little text, with lots of good content.","review":"This was the course text for the University of Toronto undergrad 'relativistic electrodynamics'. A surprisingly small subset of the first half of this text was covered in that very thorough course. It would take a significant amount of study to work through this little text in full detail.This book tackles classical electrodynamics in an systematic and thorough fashion (albeit short on a number of details). I'd eventually hope to have the time to work through that part of the text in complete detail. Those parts of the text that I did read were very well written. One of the side effects of the terseness of the text, is that it provides a concise and light reference book, something that I expect to return to a number of times in future studies.The last half of the book is on GR, for which I have no comment at the moment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated for Learning","review":"L&L, while elegant, is umotivated in the justifications that start their derivations.

Maybe it would be good for a math class, but even then I doubt it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Book I Have Ever Read","review":"This is the best book on gravity. General relativity can be presented in purely mathematical form with differential geometry and topology, or in physical form, using only algebra and tensor calculus. L.Landau and E.Lifshitz have chosen the second attitude, which is simpler and more useful for physicists. All derivations and constructions are clear, logical and seem to be natural. I learned general relativity from this book and this theory became my favourite, as well as this book. The part on classical electrodynamics is also very good, I like that the authors begin with special relativity and Maxwell equations (as well as the fact that in their Classical Mechanics they start from the least action principle). Although The Classical Theory of Fields was written about 60 years ago and there is no topics, such as radiation of black holes, it is in my opinion the best book for everyone who wants to learn Einstein theory of gravitation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliance and Revelation, Incarnate","review":"Please forgive my devotianary language, but after perusing this text, one is simply overwhelmed as if subjects long obfuscated by other texts have suddenly been revealed in an almost religious epiphany. The sections devoted to relativistic electomagnetism are beyond criticism while that on General Relativity cannot be found elsewhere. Compare Weinberg or MWT, and you will see the marked difference. Highly recommended to any intermediate to advanced student who has been exposed to GR or relativistic E&M."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing...","review":"As a stay-at-home mother of a 3 and 5 year-old, I was repulsed by many of the passages of this book. In the beginning of the book, the author/mother states that by staying home she is giving up on the luxuries that accompany a 2nd income. Yet, many times she relates how she receives packages weekly from her on-line shopping forays, as well as the many outfits she buys in order to find one to match her image and life-style, as well as her $250 (organic food) grocery bill. Seems like she didn't give up many luxuries...that is such a turn-off to those of us who actually did!

The only problem is that the book is far too meandering for it's own good. Piccirilli concentrates on creating a creepy, other worldly atmosphere and does so in spades, but he sacrifices plot in order to demonstrate his obvious poetic gifts. If you're a fan of William S. Burroughs and other such surrealist writing, you'll love A Choir of Ill Children. However, if you''re looking for a straight forward Horror novel, you would do better to look elsewhere in Piccirilli's catalog."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did someone pay these reviewers?","review":"Based on reviews, I decided to give A Choir of Ill Children a try despite its low price on Kindle. Well, I cannot fault anyone as it was my mistake for spending even $2.99 on this book. I honestly think the positive reviews must have been bought. I am a voracious reader and adore horror but well written, coherent horror. I haven't read this author's other work and doubt that I will, despite the award winning novel...cough. Choir is written in a very disjointed style that, at least I think, attempts to be clever and flowing, and ends up just being a huge mess with no structure at all. The tone is, I think supposed to be current but is laughable. The premise is stupid, the characters are loathsome, the setting is so contrived and sterotyped it is not funny or imaginative. This is probably the worst novel I've read and I've read some stinkers. Too bad I can't give away this book as it is a downloaded title, but at least I can delete it, FLUSH!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't Get Through It","review":"I really hate to write this but Choir of Ill Children is just plain poor. Reading it was impossible as my mind kept wandering because the narrative was so dull. I know many have written of what an atmospheric novel this is, but sludge, fog, and landfills also have atmosphere. But I don't want to invest too much time with them. I felt that Piccirilli's November Mourns did a much better job of pulling off the Southern Gothic thing. This book just seems to be an exercise in surrealism with no real purpose. Don't let this novel put you off from trying Piccirilli's work. Just choose another title."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disturbing and beautiful","review":"This was the first book I ever read by Tom Piccirilli.

The band is tastey, always keeping withing themselves while being the surging wave that carries Troy and The Daughters of Troy. You've got to hear the harmony, and catch the feeling of this group; they really \\"bring it.\\" Not only is it musically sound, but it also ministers to the heart of the believer.

I talked with multiple people within customer service and only one person seemed interested in helping with this problem.

This keyboard is probably not for anyone that can type reasonably well. Straight out of the box, I experienced an occasional doubling of keys. Instead of 'click' I'd see 'cclick'. If I slowed down my typing, it seemed to reduce the number of times that this happened. If I forgot to pace myself and started speeding up to normal, the doubling happened much more frequently.

The Mac special keys all work as expected, and my computer doesn't seem to have any trouble making and holding the bluetooth connection. I haven't had the keyboard long enough to speak to battery life, but Apple's small bluetooth keyboard eats batteries pretty voraciously, so I expect this to be at least that good.The keyboard is less modern looking -> it more closely resembles the Apple II keyboards, both in terms of looks and in terms of action, than it does the newer aluminum keyboards with their nearly flat chiclet keys.

I could not find any way to make it stop.Fortunately, I was working on a remote computer over vnc (but I had had this problem working locally as well, so I don't think that this is a result of the remote access) I used the mouse to break the connection to the remote host, turned the blue tooth keyboard off, connected my old USB keyboard which it replaced, reconnected to the remote computer, and was able to recover all the erased text by using 'undo typing' about 50 times.Now, here it sits on my desk, and I'm afraid to use it!

The musical ideas are there, but they don't go anywhere. Need proof? Listen to how \\"Make Love\\" is one loop, repeated for 4 1/2 minutes.

Now, \\"Discovery\\" is the best thing Thomas Bangalter and Guy Manuel De Homem-Christo released, filled with nostalgic, disco-style tunes that fit correctly in its great production. \\"Human After All\\" has more attention to guitars, which I feel are great but the songs are repetitive and not well produced.

Even the slow songs like something about us or veridis quo were really great songs to have on the cd. Another thing about discovery that i really enjoyed was the songs with lyrics in them. They were really well done and I really enjoyed them. With human after all however it seems as though discovery's soft core and homeworks hard edge collide with their third album which I do really enjoy but I really wish there were more songs than just 9 (on/off doesn't count).

It's more of a new experimental electro album ,with Daft Punk feel, full of never ending loops and robot voices! I kept waiting for a song to change or kick into high gear, but no!

Human After All simply doesn't have the effect as dance music as Discovery and Homework have. 'Television Rules The Nation', 'Steam Machine', and 'On/Off' are probably the worst songs on the album, and the worst songs Daft Punk have ever done. 'Emotion' and 'Make Love' are just weak. 'Technologic' is like 'Teachers' and 'Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger' had a retarded child.

The real shame is that there are still some killer riffs to be found here but they are played out with the utmost minimalism lacking any variation or increasing complexity. Songs -- or should I say vignettes? -- that would have been satifying at a neat 3 minutes are dragged out to close to 5 minutes for almost no apparent reason other than to pad this sparse album's playtime. The title track \\"Human After All\\" is the clearly shining track on the album, setting the rest of the album up for disappointment. Other singles like \\"Robot Rock\\" feature great riffs but quickly wear out their welcome when the 4-minute mark is reached and there's hardly anything to show for it.

While listening to the CD I was quickly disappointed. The first 2 tracks, somewhat reminiscent of \\"Discovery,\\" start out with some potential but just when you think the song is going to begin it never does. This trend only gets worse as the CD goes on. Every song seems to be composed of a 5-10sec loop repeated over and over for a intolerable 5 or 6 min.

Of course the loops are 'repetitive' and samples are mish-moshed 'sounding like going through a radio dial' (I am quoting other reviews on this site) because that IS DAFT's style, and they are artists, and they are progessive.If you judge this type of music on the surface, then it is obviously not for you.I give \\"human after all\\" 4/5 stars, because it is hot, but possibly could be even better I would imagine.

This has to be some of the most hollow and soulless music they've ever done. It's extremely repetitive even for electronic music. All the signature Daft Punk sounds are there, but they lack the proper song structure that would make them really catchy tunes. In other words, they lack an intro, verse, chorus, breakdown section, and outro. The majority of the songs go right into the verse or a chorus and repeat over and over until the end of the song. There aren't any hooks that make you want to hum the tune all day. It's just too boring and repetitive. You don't even need a lyric, just a nice bass line would do. I am convinced that they know how to make a good song, so I'm not sure why they moved in this direction with their style of music. Maybe they did it just to be anti-pop, but I don't care for it at all.Don"},{"rating":"1","title":"What is this?","review":"I loved Discovery so much that I bought this album as soon as I saw it. I brought it home, put it on while I had some friends over, and before half the cd was done, we couldn't take it anymore. The sounds on this cd are harsh, and they are repeated over and over again. Listening to this entire cd straight through is torture.Try and listen to a sample or a single first, before you buy this album, because it's nothing like Discovery."},{"rating":"1","title":"not very good.","review":"four years in the making, 9 tracks (\\"On/Off\\" doesn't count) and... well, this is just not very good at all. what the hell happened? there are two tracks i enjoy: \\"steam machine\\" and \\"technologic\\" - and even that is an almost carbon copy of \\"faster, stronger...\\" from the last album. every track is nothing but a loop idea repeated for six minutes. \\"robot rock\\" practically made me puke. i'm so bummed out."},{"rating":"1","title":"The death of Daft Punk?","review":"I remeber feeling slightly let down by Discovery, but still happy that there were at least a few great tracks on the CD. Our French friends have clearly changed for the worse with this one, plain and simple. Each track contains only a few different loops and the mixing doesn't sound like mixing at all it sounds like they just throw in a loop and then switch it off a few minutes later. Homework had so many creative fades and crazy loops that you can go through the entire album and have trouble telling where one song ends and the other begins. I was disappointed, let's hope they spend more than two months on their next album."},{"rating":"1","title":"boooo","review":"This album is lame. I can't believe it comes from the same group who put out the best album of all time, 'Alive 2007.' Seriously, this album is lame. It's simplistic and monotonous. There is nothing that moves you. Daft Punk was really phoning it in this time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too bad!!!","review":"It's too bad that the french band gives us such an album. I've found \\"discovery\\" very good. But this one is nothing but some beats that goes round and round with no beginning and no end. An advice...don't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Human after all","review":"This album is ok. It is the worst daft punk album, but its still not bad. My favorite tracks are Human after all, robot rock, make love, the brainwasher and television rules the nation. I love daft punk the the rest of the tracks are bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The other day I first heard Daft Punk's song \\"Technologic\\" on BPM (XM Radio Channel 81), thought it was good, then like an idiot I went ahead and bought the CD the next day. The rest of this album sucks! There are way too many boring and repetitive loops on here. This CD is only enjoyable if you listen to the songs no more than just once...otherwise your brain will be fried. I don't like that song \\"Technologic\\" anymore..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Catchy but too formulaic, gets boring fast","review":"Though many of the tracks like Human After All are very catchy and fun however within a week they get very old. Essentially, nearly every track on the album revolves around singing the same few words run through a vocoder over and over again throughout the entire song. While there are some cool manipulations of sound and nifty techno guitars, the obviously formulaic approach to constructing each track lends the album to a short shelf life. Also, the beginning of \\"The Brainwasher\\" seems lifted directly out of Black Sabbath's \\"Ironman\\" humorously. A fun album, but not one that you'll get much replay value out of."},{"rating":"1","title":"Merde","review":"Daft Punk were on a short list of groups that I would not hessitate to purchase without a preview listen. They are now off that list. There is about enough original material here to construct one of their usual songs. Next time I'm in Paris, I may swing by their studio to get my $13.99 back.This album and the Chemical Brothers' plodding Push the Button were huge let downs from an increasingly stale electronic scene."},{"rating":"1","title":"I liked it when they were robots.","review":"It took 6 weeks to make and it sounds like it. Very disappointing. I tried to get into it but daft punk just got lazy; however, they're not dead yet. Let's see if they can redeem themselves next album. I recommend the chems \\"Push the Button\\" or plump djs \\"eargasm\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm sooo glad they're back!!!","review":"After pining away for a new CD from them since 2001's Discovery, I was totally excited when I found out that there was a new CD out there. I ran out and bought it immediately. When I saw that I-Pod commercial that plays \\"Technologic\\" I thought 'that sounds like Daft Punk!' and sure enough it was! Technologic is the best song on this album! Play this one at parties and watch the break-dancers pack the floor! It's just amazing! I get chills when I hear it. The albums title track is great, also, It gets stuck in my head for the rest of the day when I hear it. Other stand out tracks are- Steam Machine and Robot Rock. This album is a lot like \\"Homework\\" and very reminescent of the electronicPioneers \\"Kraftwerk\\".If I had to describe this album in one line, it wiould be:Better than Homework, but still not as good as Discovery."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Human Indeed","review":"There are only a few bands in the world someone could listen to, and immediately know the song belonged to them. Daft Punk is one of them.The band continues with their signature robot inspired vocals and ultramodern computer programming, but what is strikingly different here is that the tracks on here are more repetitive as compared to ones on Homework and Discovery - and it is exactly this quality that makes this album strangely so much more profound than the earlier two releases.All 10 tracks on Human After All portray a multitude of different emotions, which the French duo obviously want us to experience through repetition of sounds for 4 minutes or so that each track lasts for.Not as mainstream or accessible as the previous two releases, but a stunner nevertheless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Repetitive x2","review":"I had high hopes for this album after 2 previous great releases. And at first listen it does sound good. The hooks are VERY catchy. The problem is, that's all this album has got. Hooks looped over and over. Maybe it would make for good dancefloor music, but not anything else. I've tried to enjoy it in my car, but after the first 30 seconds I'm bored and want to skip to the next one..which cause the same thing to happen.It seems like Daft Punk thought they would be selling their songs to companies for 30 second commercials, similar to their brethren Air. Yes, Robot Rock would make a great Volkwagen commerical track. But real music it most certainly is not. Even today's youth with their short attention spans must surely get tired of this effort quickly. Let's hope the guys get their act together for the next album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful and Disappointing","review":"Homework was amazing and everything has been down hill from there. Discovery was definitely worth buying and had some really great songs on it but this album is a complete and utter failure. The tracks seem boring, tired and uninspiring. Avoid this record."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Seems like there's two sets of fans of Daft Punk. Ones who loved their Homework album, which was more club oriented floor fillers. And ones who loved their second album, which was a pop album. Human After All seems to fall right in between, not too underground and not pop enough. I am a fan of their Homework album and was hoping to hear some of that. I'm also a DJ who plays One More Time at almost every Barmitzvah I do. After barely able to listen through the whole album, I can honestly say \\"Human After All\\" will not get any play in any format. It's boring and emotionless. Can you say REMIX."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only one?","review":"This is for ONE beer mug. It's nice, don't get me wrong, but not nearly as heavy as I would have expected for the price.

After going through the first half, I found it to leave out critical how to's and had an overall lack of good practical material I could use.

The coverage on most topics is inadequate and reflects a deep misunderstanding in how Crystal Reports is used. I should have read the publishers description further-- it was only when I recieved the manual I realised it was self-published (with what looks to be a photocopier and a binding machine.)

I also used it to cut marble for two bathroom floors and showers. The blade that came with the saw worked for the kitchen floor only. After that, I bought a high quality DeWalt blade. Talk about a difference. Anyway, the saw works really well. My biggest complaint would be the water pump. Really cheap...but it does do the job. I ended up using a five gallon bucket of clean unused water that was siphoned out by the water pump to cut. This way, the pump never clogged with dirty water.If you're working on a large job or several small jobs where renting a wet saw doesn't make sense, I would suggest this saw...but be aware that you will need to replace the blade quite quickly...so get a high quality blade...it will make a world of a difference. And be sure to use clean water out of a separate bucket...that way your pump won't clog."},{"rating":"1","title":"MK-370 Tile Saw","review":"I purchased the MK-370 Tile Saw (1/2 hp model)in October 2004.

The assembly was easy; however, when I powered on the motor, it made a loud cutter noise and the water pump sucks. I will not buy another MK product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disapointed","review":"The saw met my expectations.... when it worked.

Figaro comes only humbly at the third with just one solo aria.Then in this selection, the Comte di Almaviva got 'zero' pieces, just ensembles.The solo arias picked were Figaro's and Rosina's, that's all. Rosina isn't even Figaro's fiance or girl friend. All the courtship music by the Comte were missing, and what is the 'worst', is that this recording includes the Comte's last showpiece in the Finale, sung to great height by Francisco Araiza.That the editor missed that one out and comes out with a shorter than usual measured disc is truly horrific.The disc really deserves 'zero' stars, if that be available."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do you really need cliff's FOR THIS?","review":"Don't deny yourself the pleasure of experiencing this work.

Once up, I can reconnect the USB cable to the Hub and use all connected devices, but then I have to unplug before shutdown or right before start-up which is a pain in the arse.Hey, if you have a solution, then email me at wilkc@yahoo.com."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does everything it's supposed to do.","review":"Price was very good for what this device does.

It's like this thing has a fast switch inside switching between the inputs live/not live. But not fast enough for the mouse to stay connected to the Mac.I'll buy a different kind and see what happens."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tiny has its penalties","review":"Works great - no USB functionality issues whatsoever, and the lights are nice to have.Depending on your needs, you may or may not like the tradeoffs attendant to such a small hub. The worst of them is simply the light weight, the problem being keeping it in one place. My wife uses hers to provide a single connection point to her MacBook, meaning it stays on the desk. In order to keep it in place, she jams the upstream cord between the desk and the wall. The alternative is to stick it down in some fashion - or live with it moving around and popping off the occasional cord.If you need a very small, light hub, say to keep in your laptop bag, the Targus Ultra Mini is ideal. If you have the desktop real estate available, you might consider a larger hub."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty useful product","review":"You will appreciate this product only if you don't have enough USB ports.

Is filmed like a middle-school media project with what seemed like camcorders doled out to actors for home setups throughout, and is overall a 78-minute disappointment that flies in the face of what should have been.

Now Cal is temporarily out of the picture, you start to love Hunter as you see what he's really like. I was very impressed with the clever way in which Cate completely swaps four of the main characters around, turning Cal and Selene from good characters to evil ones and Hunter and Sky from seemingly evil to good. I just wish Sky would trust Morgan more. My only complaint is that David resorts to dark magick quite unnecesarily, I felt. Why didn't he just do a gain money spell instead of calling a Taibhs? That way he wouldn't need to have had his powers stripped. I liked the ending with the Morganite though.

The birthday ponies theme is helping because the little girl Jane and Grandma Aggie helped Popcorn\` s mother from the woods. I think the message is never give up you should never give up gust like when the girl gave up on taking care of popcorn. In this storey Popcorn changes a lot because everyone changes his life when Jane takes care of him. Letting Popcorn go is a symbol I think this because Jane has to let Popcorn and Sweatpea go. The problem is Jane is to far away to ride horses and the solution is her father got a new job a few blocks away. Now Jane can ride the horses. Before I read the Birthday Pony I thought no one could take care of a wild pony but now that I have read it my schema has change and I know that people can even take care of 2 ponies.

Then he saddles one of them up and has an actor ride it all day. Does anybody watching this movie really think this is okay? In America he would be up on charges of animal cruelty.

If the production of 'The Man Who Killed Don Quixote' had lasted more than an week the documentary might have been able to stand on its own, but as it is I think it should have been saved to release with Terry Gililam's final version, even if they had to wait another couple of decades."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent discussion fo soils!

I would highly recommend this book to other publishers that venture into the area of soil science articles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very pretty, somewhat boring","review":"This recording of the new works by Theofanidis and Higdon is first rate. Great performances, and nice to hear along side the Copland, which stands out as the real masterpiece. Mind you, Theofanidis and Higdon are obviously really talented composers.I like new music. I like beautiful music. And I don't usually mind if the new music I hear is beautiful or ugly, has a tune, or not. What matters is that I am pulled in, and not lulled in with cliches or pandering.The Theofanidis seemed to be much more interesting to listen to than the Higdon. His sense of orchestral color is very strong. But overall, their music is very pretty, and somewhat boring. Get this to hear that great Copland: it is the piece that on this CD that pulls you in to listen. I know this piece is not the new piece on the CD, but it really stands the test of time against the more recent works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rainbow Body & Blue Cathedral","review":"Insufficient musical scores to evaluate.

The people are a little off the beaten track but that's what makes this a book to be read."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of a Kind","review":"There is no other writer like Tom Drury. He explores the common-place, and somehow, in a casual and off-hand way, ends up exploring the profound and universal. His books seem like real life, in that it isn't always apparent what the significance is of certain observations or characters. He is a very down-to-earth writer, who cares about the characters he creates, even if they appear only briefly. In \\"The Black Brook\\" the main character, Paul, is almost heart-breaking in his inability to connect with those around him. It is a beautiful and funny book, that ends up a bit scattered at the end. But it resonates."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly atmospheric, somewhat meandering, but fascinating.","review":"I kept thinking that this is the kind of novel Paul Auster would write if Auster wrote more mainstream books. (It especially reminded me of Leviathan, due maybe to locale.)Though he depends less on coincidence than Auster does, Drury is still pretty far from the mainstream with this slow but beautifully written \\"mystery.\\" That is, it seems like it should be a mystery, but it doesn't read as if there's any rush to find out what's at the bottom of the odd circumstances surrounding Paul Emmons, formerly Paul Nash, who is in the witness protection program for ratting on the mob. It's more of a character study. Category-defying. The prose is sharp and fresh."},{"rating":"2","title":"How did I miss this author?","review":"Incredibly beautiful writing, interesting plot.

Lik The Shack, it's a little \\"out there\\", but if it helps people to reflect on their own spirituality and softens them to being a better, more forgiving, and loving person, than it's a great piece of work.. I did not have the time to read the whole book at once, and could not wait to get back to it and pick up from where I left off..I also, had a hard time putting it down and found myself tardy for an occassion by pushing the clock too far...If you like reading stories related to spiritual mysteries, different philosphies, and want something that may help you discover something new about yourself, this would be a good read...

Dismissing the universe as a \\"tiny, mad idea\\" because you find some of it painful is not courageous. Reinterpreting the message of Jesus Christ is not the truth. Proposing a radical and severe thought system that diminishes the human condition is not the answer. And rejecting the ideas set forth in this particular book is certainly not crucifixion. Despite this book's appeal to human weakness, I love my imperfect life and the sometimes crazy world around me, with all its joys and its challenges."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Book Ever Written about A Course in Miracles","review":"First let me say that anyone who is into spirituality will get a lot out of this book, whether they're interested in A Course in Miracles or not. As for me, I tried reading A Course in Miracles a couple of times and although parts of it were certainly beautiful, I couldn't get into it because it was well, incomprehensible. The I read The Disappearance of the Universe and went back and read A Course in Miracles and I was stunned at how clear it was to me. I now find that I can understand the Course very well. I had read other popular books about the Course and they never came CLOSE to clarifying it for me the way \\"Disappearance\\" does. This is a great contribution to the spiritual community and should be read by any intelligent person who has an open mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Repetitious Pandering","review":"This tedious book has told me NOTHING I haven't heard before from modern psychology and the more abstract religions of our time, such as Buddhism, Gnosticism, and Existentialism (although Renard thinks if he gives it a modern, edgy spin, tweaks a few terms, and adds a little raunchy humor, the lay people won't notice). I feel like an idiot for wasting my money and so many valuable hours on this silly soap opera of a book. If you'd like to save yourself a lot of time and frustration, do yourself a favor and look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Spirituality of \\"Duh\\"","review":"Enter the ascended masters in the author's living room, they got permission to call Jesus, just \\"J\\".

Odd that everything to be found in the alleged \\"Course\\" is all ripped off uncredited from Buddhist, Jain and Vedanta sources.

It's so clear and gives so much great information it's unbelievable. You have to be ready for it, but if you are it blows away everything else. It teaches how great masters achieve enlightenment, and tells exactly how to do it. It also explains the universe, life, things like hurricanes, terrorist attacks, tsunamis, etc. If you haven't read this book then you don't know the truth about the world or what to do about it. A must read for anyone who is on a spiritual path."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Mind of My Own","review":"The Disappearance of the Universe uses the same authoritarian tone as A Course in Miracles, but adds a pinch of condescension for good measure. I have read both books from cover to cover, and both books give the same ultimatum: This is the truth, the only meaningful reality, \\"a required course\\", and until you accept that, you will remain a mindless ego on legs, trapped in a meaningless illusion, fueled by fear, unable to know truth or love. Both books clearly and repeatedly state that our world is nothing more than an horrific nightmare filled with hateful creatures. Forgive my irreverence, but I wholeheartedly disagree. Unlike the \\"ascended masters\\" in Disappearance, I see beauty in this great Universe of ours, and I intend to make it a wonderful place to live, while I seek God in my own way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fatally Flawed","review":"This book is filled with contradictions. For instance, it states that \\"the separation\\" never occurred, then proceeds to instruct us on how to end it. It claims that no one is different or better than anyone else in any way, then casually mentions that Gary Renard is the direct reincarnation of an apostle. It says that there are countless other ways to God that are every bit as valuable, then arrogantly defines its own system as centuries ahead of the rest. It preaches love and forgiveness, yet passes more judgments than I can begin to count, and creates people who attack and belittle others. Not only is this book illogical, it's just plain unhealthy. It causes more separation than it claims to heal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Pleased","review":"The product matched the description and was delivered as advertised.

I even felt some of his statements were contradictory to The Course In Miracles. Also, Gary's conversatin had the exact same tone, attempt at humor, and style as Pursah and Artem. I am not convinced for a second that this actually happened to him. Lots of people can say God spoke to them. Example - George W. Bush believes God is guiding him.

All the characters speak with the same voice, so you can't tell one from the next without checking back to the top of the paragraph to see who's speaking.More importantly, the author comes across as the Pat Robertson of the left. If he doesn't agree with someone politically, the other person can't be another decent human being with a reasoned and insightful approach -- no, he's an inhuman scumbag who \\"doesn't care about people.\\" And as often as not, those prejudices are presented as blessed and confirmed by God.. or at least by Enlightened Beings.What good there is in this book comes straight from the Course in Miracles itself, so just skip the ego trip and go straight to the source."},{"rating":"2","title":"disapearing universe","review":"Truly one of the best books I have ever read.

It's completely logical and natural. Just like waking from a sleep, this is not a \\"required course\\" but something that will happen naturally anyway. Yes it has to happen, but I now understand it is natural, not given as \\"you must do this!\\" thanks to gary. All dreamers awaken, it just happens. Forgiveness is a way to reach that state where awakening will happen.I thank you, for I am there. Now I can begin to see it. Now I might awake from the sleep.

The way the different pieces of it all fit together, the setting the record straight about masters like Buddha and Jesus and how they really became enlightened, the 20 Sayings that are explained from The Gospel of Thomas, the many quotes from A Course in Miracles, the blunt and sometimes hilarious dialogue, the honesty of the author about his personal life (unlike many spiritual authors who are always trying to make themselves look good). To put it mildly, it all adds up to an extremely well done book. Obviously, people will believe what they want to believe and not what they read in some customer review. But if I can put my two cents worth in, this is a must read book for anyone who is serious about spirituality."},{"rating":"2","title":"There's really something here","review":"This is probably the single most important work I've come upon.

Strangely, during the encounters, he sometimes appears to posses knoweledge of different religions, sects, saints, etc. that is far beyond what an average, even educated, person might have. And then the language that the ascending masters sometimes use? It sounds more like Gary speaking. I tend to think that Gary made up the whole thing: the ascending masters, the ideas....Having said that, some of the information in the book is very interesting, albeit not that revolutionary, the only truly new concept being \\"forgiveness\\", which I find highly disturbing.

Everything inside shouted, \\"No!\\" In fundamentalist terms, I guess one would say a \\"false teaching\\" or a \\"false prophet\\". I will not judge that to be true or not, but only put it out there that that was my (very strong) sense in reading Renard's book.

The confusion came because as I was reading The Disappearance of the Universe, even though the words were clear and strong, my mind seemed to be translating them differently.

I just can't believe that two \\"ascended masters\\" would talk like that. The author states in the introduction that they said they needed to talk like that in order to get his attention. I'm sorry, but an ascended master wouldn't need to resort to trash-talk in order to get a human's attention.

A couple of so-called \\"ascended masters\\" proclaim that earthly life is meaningless, and in exchange for totally invalidating our lives, we're given a myth to cling to, a space-age fairy tale. We're told that we're giving up nothing in exchange for everything, but that's just one point of view, just an idea, nothing more. We're called upon to deny everything we've ever known, and instead focus our minds on one very extreme interpretation of God and reality.

It involves 17 discussions between the author and two Ascended Masters. The thing is, I felt as though the two masters were talking to me on a personal level. The talks are very straighforward, clear and down to earth. The masters explained they wanted to talk to the author in his own language so he could really understand them. The result is that they take very advanced spiritual ideas and explain them, as well as how to apply them in your life, and do it in such a way that I could really \\"get.\\" This book explains everything about the universe and what really runs human behavior.

It's all based on the tenets set for in A Course In Miracles.It's an interesting set of principles that I am trying to understand and practice.The narrators/ characters are pretty good, although the woman is tough to listen to at times.

Disturbing in that it contradicts much of what I was taught as a child and have believed as an adult. It has quite a ring of truth to it. It has kept me wondering and thinking. It is a hopeful book, but also has left me feeling a bit sad. I think I'd need more than 1000 words to attempt to cover it all.

My psychologist suggested I read the book to strengthen my connection with God. And that is what has happened . Even though the ideas put forth in the book are quite radical in terms of mainstream religion, they have helped me understand that the world is the illusion and that we are part of the spirit of God.

If you're gonna start predicting the future, do it within a few weeks, not a few years, decades, or centuries. He writes on the defensive most of the time. I don't know. I am thankful that I came across this book because it eased me into a course in miracles and let me know how difficult it would be. But other than that, this book reads like the national inquirer.

The hypocrisy is disgusting.Wayne Dyer seems to put his rubber stamp on every self-help book out there, so his endorsement doesn't mean much to me.

That babies are born impure? That the rain forest tree roots are fighting amongst themselves? This is just a mish-mosh of beliefs picked from here and there (mostly Christian) and filtered through a belief system of Gnostic Christianity that believes that the universe is sick and to promote ACIM. Ya ya ya, the world is hell, forgive everyone/everything 24/7 and go straight to heaven, etc. And if you have an interest in Taoism, Buddhism, please go to the source teachings and not this book. You might actually learn something about what they teach, and not what this book wants you to believe. I'm surprised they didn't refer to the Buddha as the Big B and Lao Tzu as Tao-Man. Just consider that maybe you are here to experience the joy of co-creation as God and you have nothing and no one to forgive? That you'll \\"get home\\" when you get there, so don't get so stressed?

So I had to read it. At first I was a little taken aback by the smart-ass style. But that turned out to be for a reason. As I went on I was enthralled by the story and how good a read this book is, and then by the magnitude of its spiritual teachings, which literally blow the other books out of the water. The Disappearance of the Universe is a great read that's full of great spiritual teachings. I agree that it's one of the most important, and probably the most important book I've ever read in regards to helping me understand everything about the universe and life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ready and Waiting...","review":"After reading The Disappearance of the Universe, I am totally appalled.

BTW, I've read A Course in Miracles cover to cover, and that book never stooped to such a commercial low. ACIM is beautiful, poetic, totally understandable if you give an ounce of effort, and doesn't deserve to be degraded in this way. The Disappearance of the Universe takes ideas from the Course and turns them into a silly science fiction soap opera. What a disgrace!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't Be Any Better","review":"The Disappearance of the Universe is one of the best spiritual books ever written. It has set me in the right direction. It engages in absolutely straight talk on a multitude of topics, including reincarnation (which is just a dream, like everything else except the Reality of Heaven) and countless others. I doubt if there has ever been so much useful information presented in one book, which is why the book is causing so much interest. It is also the first hit book that examines A Course in Miracles in depth in at least 13 years. But unlike other books about the Course, this one actually makes it understandable! Of great importance to the healing of the world is the book's unique brand of forgiveness, which is of a quantum nature, as opposed to the old fashioned kind of forgiveness, which doesn't work. If the system would let me I would give this book more than 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best Spiritual Books Ever Written","review":"I can't emphasize too much that there are very few spiritual books that give a complete presentation of the truth and this is one of them. You will find more valuable information in this book than what you usually get in 5 books, and this one has the added benefit of being fun to read. It is absolutely astonishing, especially given the condition of the world, that some negative people have nothing better to do with their lives than attack a great book like this. Don't be misled. This is as good as a spiritual book gets."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fantastic Read","review":"At last, a spiritual book that rocks. This one really puts it all together in a way that nothing else I've seen does. The author spent nine years of his life to give us this amazing presentation of the truth, as related to him by a \\"mysterious couple\\" who appeared to him from out of nowhere in his living room. Yes, that sounded pretty far out to me when I first heard it, but this book delivers - big time. More than one reading is highly recommended because there's just so much great stuff here, and it's all presented in an entertaining way. After this, other spiritual books will seem boring. That's all right, because this one, (and if you choose to study it, A Course in Miracles, which is explained by this one) give a complete picture. 10 stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Challenging and brilliant","review":"The scholarly approach, thoughtful consideration of many theologies and philosophies makes this book an excellent read.

It certainly did not live up to its synopsis, its endorsements, or the mysterious avalanche of 5-star commercials. This book degrades its entire genre, especially the very beautiful Course in Miracles book. Gary Renard thinks he's making spirituality accessible by talking about beer and farts and erections, and creating two very annoying and self-righteous \\"masters,\\" but really he's just catering to the lowest common denominator. The whole book was a spiritual turnoff to me. If you want to understand A Course in Miracles, then read A Course in Miracles. It's not nearly as difficult as Renard is making it out to be, in fact it's Disappearance of the Universe that complicates matters by adding a bunch of outrageous science fiction and trashy humor. Sure, ACIM takes time and effort, but so does Shakespeare, and both are far more rewarding than this book could ever be."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!","review":"This is a great read.

The story is simple but entertaining, and the animation is great. The characters are well developed for the short time this movie is on and there is always something to either keep you laughing hysterically or enjoying the action. It has the standard cast of favorites that you would see in any of his movies, his wife being one of the main characters. However, it was nice to see a big name like Paul Giamati taking on the roll of Dr Satan. For anyone who is a fan of Rob Zombie this is worth the viewing.

They are not in style today, but they were three of the major forces in Western civilization. Far too much attention is paid to David Hume, and Russian philosophy (Berdyaev, Soloviev) is ignored.I think the author wanted to show how the atheistic, materialistic doctrines of Marx and Sartre were derived through Descartes and Hume from Plato and Aristotle. An interesting thesis, but hardly the basis for an introductory text in philosophy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Intro on Western Philosophy","review":"This book is a great introduction to philosophy. I will even go as far as to say it's the best introductory book I have ever read. The book expounds on concepts that are made more difficult than they should be with other so-called introductory books on philosophy, and makes them easy to understand.For the first time in my life, I can honestly say I understand the concept of metaphysics and have a good grounding on it. As other reviewers have pointed out, the book is a little bit outdated because it was written a couple of decades ago, but its ease of understanding and very clear prose are what make it worthwhile.I would highly recommend this book for those who consider themselves laymen as well as for students and those more advanced in philosophy (who are few and far between)."},{"rating":"2","title":"From Socrates to Sartre","review":"A nice summary of the study of philosophy from the time of Socrates (before Christ) to Sartre (20th century).

Maybe it was a simple mistake on the part of whomever shipped the item but the grate cover I received did not have the simple one oval hole per row as in the picture, rather it has two and three \\"segmented\\" holes in alternating rows in an oval shape. It was a medium strength plastic that was not like the metal \\"looking\\" hard foam grate I was looking to replace. Very disappointing!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Executioner book I've ever read","review":"Most Executioner books I've read tend to be low on suspense, with lots of violence which is mind-numbing, and a plot that gets lost in all te falling bodies. Bolan simply roams through the carnage completely unscathed and never in any real danger. The writer of this book, David Robbins, captures the razor's edge which the Executioner straddles with each mission in a gripping, suspenseful way which left me turning pages like mad. Okay, so the plot was a little thin in its foundation; the encounters and exciting adventures along the way more than made up for it. Check out the way in which Bolan smuggles explosives into the bad guys' lair. I can't recommend this book highly enough to anyone who wants some mindless, violent, good, clean fun. :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"A Walk in My Shoes\\"","review":"I have read this book several times. I have read thousands of books and am an avid reader, but this book seems to draw me back to open it's covers again. It makes me lose myself in Frances' pain, feel the laughter, feel the closeness to Aunt Lucy, and seem to experience the emotions that Frances goes through in every aspect of the book. I wanted to fold her close to me during the pain of the abuse, the rape, the icy indifference from the step-mother as I could actually feel her anguish ripple through me. I have felt such anger at the rapist, and caught myself wondering if the step-mother had any idea that this would happen to this child. The bond I wove with the subject of the book bound me to her and kept me spellbound throughout the entire reading. I could almost envision \\"Aunt Lucy\\" as having wings, and a generous lap and ample bosom to rest your sad, weary head on.

Unfortunately, all was lost in the editing.Only small snippets are shown from each comedian. First of all, this destroys much of the effort of these comedians to craft a good act. Jokes out of context are often not funny. A good comedian will organize his/her material for the best effect. By grabbing small sections of various acts, the benefits of this effort is completely lost. In the case of this collection, it seems that the editor picked out snippets that were not particularly good IN context. The end result is you see each comedian for 1-2 minutes and they are not even funny for that short period.I daresay that most people seeing this collection on television would change channels rather quickly. This collection is not worth the time it takes to watch let alone the cost of the DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"HUGE waste of time.","review":"The editorial review says, \\"A must have for collectors and all connoisseurs of comedy!\\" That reviewer obviously did not watch the same DVD.

Plus, Rick Overton (the host) can get quite annoying after a while. Skip this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"Any true stand-up fan will be disgusted by this.

As an example, the front wheel spokes were so out of whack on receipt that the wheel looked warped. Whoever boxed it up at the factory should have noticed it was that way. It was not worth the hassle to return for another as a relacement might have been worse, and cost us more to get it \\"tweaked\\" by a professional after assembly than the bike cost.

I have been trying to assemble it for 3 days now. The pictures do not look anything like the bike. After I finally assembled it (on pure instinct), the front brake was difficult to adjust - but I managed. The back brake is broken and needs to be replaced - I think. The shifting unit was not factory assembled properly. I had to take the shifting unit apart, as well as take the back tire off of the bike, and re-assemble it for it to even function. Now that it is functioning, I am trying to adjust it to shift properly. I guess that was too much to ask, because it is still not working properly. However, the bike looks awesome. I can't wait to finally be able to ride it....although it will probably be snowing by then....."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent bike for the price","review":"The bike came double boxed with not a scratch on it. Had some difficulty with putting it together due to the fact I did not have any hex wrenches that big (8mm and 11mm are needed) but a quick trip to Wal-Mart solved this problem (oh the wrench set was $0.99).

The bike came in a double box and did not have a scratch on it. I found it was easy to assemble and only needed a quick brake adjustment and air in the tires for me to be off and riding.

I was able to put it togehter easy enough and loved it for the first month. I rode it about ten miles a day for the past 4 to 5 months. The brakes are very difficult to keep adjusted and and also the gear shifter. The rear tire keeps coming loose from baering house and the bike is very heavy. I thought by buying a bike for a little bit more money than a k-mart or walmart would of done me good but in all i should of spent the money on a hi end bike for what i needed.

Please don't refer the rating of mongoose products to any afliates of amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Novices","review":"This bike is impressive looking, unfortunately, unless you are an expert bicycle mechanic you probably should look elsewhere. The components of the bike are fairly cheap and getting the bike to work out of the box will consume many, many hours of time getting it operational. The brakes used on the bike are of very low quality and should be replaced before operating. In addition, the gears that come with the bike are also of extremely low quality and will need major adjustments in order for basic use. Other than the brakes and the defailleur's, the other components are of average quality and perform as expected.Bottom line is the frame and tires of this bike what you would expect for a bike in this price range. Unfortunately, unless you are very experienced at adjusting and/or replacing brake mechanisms and derailleurs, there are simpler higher quality choices available elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Getting what you pay for:","review":"The only nice thing about this bike is its dual suspension.

Yes, I took the time to take it to a local bike shop for a tune-up to get it in peak condition.I have absolutely no regrets with this bike other than the hard seat that I had replaced. No, I see no need to dock the product a star over a seat either. Most bikes come with bad seats anyway.Being a 6'2\\" male and over 200lbs I thought the bike might be too light for me but it isn't.

Then, after pulling the bike out of the box, I noticed some nice scrapes on the fork of the bike from where the handle bars were hanging when it was shipped. Also, on further inspection, I found some other paint scrapes on the back of the body as well. Also, after placing the front wheel on and checking if it spun straight, I noticed that it was way off. Basically, it wobbles. Fixing this either requires a trip to a bike store, or purchasing a spoke wrench to fix it myself if I understand correctly. This shouldn't have come like that in my opinion. This may get shipped back to amazon at this rate. Also spent an hour trying to get the shifter adjusted so it would work in all 21 gears. I appreciate that most of it was preassembled but come on. At least do it right."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unhappy :-(","review":"Unhappy that there were many scratches on the frame upon arrival and on such a large purches it's hard to return.

The atmosphere was charged with a night of great anticipation for a really great show. The late Great Charles Earland was in charge of the musical arrangement.

I added this book as an impulse buy based on some feedback. I find it adds nothing at all to the information in Wheelock. A lot of the suggestions are trite and much of the content is condescending.I can see that this book might be useful to one who lacks background in grammar in general (not specifically Latin grammar) and would benefit from context for parts of sentences. For anyone with a high school or higher education, it's likely useless."},{"rating":"2","title":"A True Complement to Wheelocks","review":"While I'm only halfway through the book I believe it is sufficient to make an accurate assessment. This book gives the student of Latin additonal insight to the Latin while remaining true to the writings of Wheelock. Helpful suggestions are made so that the reader may improve his or her understanding of the basics in Wheelock. Add to that the useful number of exercises with guidance to the corrections, many of which are in the back of the book, and this work is definitely a winner and an asset to any reader or student of Wheelock's Latin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Helpful","review":"I found this guide to be extremely helpful; Wheelock's Latin can be confusing and vague at times, and this guide helped sift through that stuff ... it also provides extra exercises that are instrumental in really nailing down the Wheelock's concepts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Indispensible for a Wheelock based self learner","review":"This book goes along with the material presented in the Wheelock, providing an additional approach and point of view to the material being presented, which greatly facilitates learning, especially if one learns by oneself. It also explains some of the points that Wheelock either passes over, or mumbles about. I decided early on on the following pattern of learning, that successfully got me through Wheelock: I read a chapter from the main book, I read a chapter from the \\"Guide\\" (while doing the exercises there as well), I do the exercises in Wheelock, I do the additional exercises at the end of Wheelock. This way I attack the new material from several directions, and also get sufficient amount of repetition to guarantee adequate memorization."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor design","review":"What a poor design.The \\"capacity basket\\" is much too wide at the base which causes a large amount of product to be wasted.The controls have a brittle-plastic slide control that is flimsy and sure to break.Distribution of product is inconsistent at best.

The control for the spreader were constantly jamming and the thing was just a piece of junk, really, for the price I paid. I was very disappointed to say the least.

Clearlythe author has not done some of the rides, as distances aredouble those quoted in some cases (In one case the recommendedmap was listed with scale 1:25K, but the actual map available1:50K. All distances / times were double those suggested.).Some of the general mountain biking advice in the intro chaptersis questionable (eg: recommended shoes for riding, method fordescending steep hills, etc).The rides in the author's earlier book (NSW edition) appearto be better researched (but still not flawless).

Her passion for Hunter is completely different from her old relationship but if Cal comes back who will Morgan choose?This book is one of the best and these books get better every one, I can't wait for the seventh one."},{"rating":"2","title":"On edge","review":"This entire series is fast paced and revealing. Spellbound is a page turning thriller, with surprises around every corner. Morgan and Hunter are growing closer, yet are still trying to figure out what they ARE- a couple, friends, enemies? Morgan discovers exactly who murdered her mother, and how this relates to her. She is determined to find out her heritage- to find answers, and many of her questions (and ours) are answered. I recommend this to all who have read the previous books in the series. If you haven't start with number 1. All of the books are magnificent, can't-wait-for-the-next-page type of books. Buy them all at once. If you don't, you'll be left at the end of any of the books, thinking, \\"Dang! I need to know what will happen NOW!\\" Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love and Hate, so close, so far","review":"Morgan is having problems. First, she has been avoiding Hunter, and he confronts her. Second, she know she still loves Cal. The two circles, Kithic and the one Cal started, are joining, to become the new Kithic. Things are happening to Hunter, like the car suddenly is out of brake fluid, almost killing him and Morgan. Morgan knows Hunter is jealous of Cal for being with her, and she knows it, which is why she doesnt tell him when Cal tries to contact her... or when she speaks to Cal. Now, she doesnt know who to trust--Cal, who claims Hunter put a spell on her, or Hunter, her new love which she thinks she trusts. Theres only one person she can trust, and if she makes the wrong choice, she may be killed by Selena, Cal's mother."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST!!!!","review":"This is without any doubt the BEST book in the series, if you had to choose to buy only one, buy this one. Two thumbs up!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Book!","review":"This was an excellent book, but not good enough for 5 stars. It made you really think about who you were, and what you needed to do with your life and it also makes you think about who you should really trust with those most personal secrets that everyone knows and loves.

And for all of you hopeless romantics out there, and you know who you are, you'll love this book!!! It's about Morgan dealing with her newfound love and advances in magick. It's very insitful and I enjoyed this book emensley, so read it and see if you love it, too!!! This is one of me two favorite books!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Relationships, Magic, Love, and Death","review":"The first half of this book mostly is about the dating relationship of various high school girls in the story. Our heroine, Morgan, had given up on Cal since he tried to kill her in book 5, and is falling in love with the Seeker, Hunter. She is making tentative reconnection with her childhood BFF, Bree, who is now becoming involved with another childhood friend. In the last part of the book Cal and his mother Selene have returned after their failed attempt to kill Morgan in book 5. Hunter and Morgan go to confront Selene and Cal, and end up killing them both, or so we are told. We once thought Hunter had been killed, and he came back in the next book. So Cal and Selene are dead in the end, and Morgan's power is just warming up. All the relationships and love interests are probably a good read for teenage girls. I enjoyed Morgan's understanding of Diet Coke as the universal beverage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Morgan asking Jesus and God for help in time of peril.....","review":"Just a curiosity...I noticed that when Morgan was getting ready to go in an face Selene she begged Jesus and God to help her, when throughout the rest of the books she has always asked the Goddess to help her...why is that?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unhappy with product","review":"This video is extremely poor quality - the picture is blurry, the sound is distorted, the persons giving the history of the subject were terrible!

In my book, it's better than his first disc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Espuela Land and Cattle Company","review":"This timeless work by Dr. Holden of the Southwest Collection of Texas Tech University is a wonderfully focused and authoritative review of the development and operations of the Spur Ranch of West Texas in the late 1800's. It is factual and of considerable historical importance, but it also contains many humorous / exciting / adventuresome stories about early ranch life in this area. Anyone with interest in ranching, West Texas history, the \\"cowboy life\\", or related topics will find it enlightening and entertaining. I highly recommend this historic text."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is exactly what life in Togo is like!","review":"I spent a semester of college in Togo about the same time the author was there. Five years later, I read this book. It was the most emotional book-reading experience I have ever had. Packer accurately describes all the emotions an American goes through when encountering life in West Africa. Ten years later, Packer wrote a moving addendum for the Boston Review, which is available online... Just find the Boston Review magazine website from Yahoo, and then do a search on George Packer. It's in the April/May 1994 Vol. XIX No. 2 edition of the Boston Review."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best Peace Corps travelogues ever written","review":"This book gets at the heart of being a Peace Corps volunteer in a third world country. I've read it several times, and am trying to get another copy for a friend who will be working in Africa."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compelling and insightful","review":"This book was a very good read. The feelings the author struggles with resonate with me. I also very much appreciated that he did not sugar coat his experience. Few PC volunteers (or expats more generally) admit to these things, and it's good someone put them in (well-written, well thought out) words."},{"rating":"1","title":"He got it wrong","review":"As a volunteer with Mr. Packer in Togo, I was thrilled when the book came out , bought it, and was quickly discouraged to read such a cheap shot at the Peace Corps and Togo. Clearly he is an excellent writer. Unfortunately he used his talent to paint an inaccurate picture of the Peace Corps in Togo and the Togolese people. Perhaps it is because he did very little during his limited service in the Peace Corps in Togo, and in fact left before the end of his service; indeed, it is often in the second year that volunteers have their \\"aha\\" moments as reality falls into place and it becomes easier to make sense of a culture so different from your own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a real PCV","review":"I read this book before I went to Peace Corps in Benin. Togo volunteers referred to it as \\"The Village of Whining.\\" They had it right. If you want to hear what Peace Corps in West Africa is like you should read a book by someone who actually finished their service."},{"rating":"1","title":"A book of little inherent value.","review":"I have to disagree with every review written about this book thusfar. It is not well written, for one. The style is amateurish, and it has little substance.But that's not what really bothers me about this book. What really bothers me is that he writes about soliciting a prostitute that he describes as having a \\"twelve-year-old's body.\\" Another thing that bothered me was that George Packer dropped out of the Peace Corps without even telling his so-called friends in the village that he was leaving. He wasted the opportunity that was given to him, wrote a mediocre book about it, and yet reviewers come on Amazon.com and laud it.Want some free advice? Read any other book about Africa, Togo, or the Peace Corps instead. This one is not very good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very useful-not for foodies","review":"I expected more from this book. The author provides some generic information and some of what I would call \\"fillers\\" (useless information to fill the pages) such as how to say something in different languages. In addition some information she provided especially about wine was not correct. In general the information was somewhat shallow and not anything new. It also appears that she underestimates the readers.

The messy, lovable heroine kept me laughing and rooting for her- whether for her safety, sorting our her life, hoping she would find romance, or the mystery itself. I usually read any-and-all fiction, not limiting myself to genres. However, I often read less mysteries, and less Christian fiction. I reached for this book as one of my light reads, and found myself being pulled into Thea's world,and not putting the book down.

So much for an expensive gadget."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes, it really does live up to all the hype","review":"We went to a party several years ago where the host had a Screwpull. Before the night was over, people were opening bottles of wine just to get a chance to see the Screwpull in action. Yes, it really does live up to all the hype. If you've ever struggled to get a bottle of wine open with a traditional screw type opener, or if you've ever had to pick bits of cork out of your wine, you will love this opener. It truly makes opening bottles of wine effortless. The minute I got home from the party that night, I got online and ordered one. I have never regretted it, nor the price I had to pay. It was worth every penny. Don't believe it? Even my 72 year old arthritic mother-in-law has no problem opening bottles of wine!

It also appeared to be of flimsier construction than our original one. I mistakenly assumed that the company we bought it from (Winestuff) would handle the issue but all they did was refer us to the maker of the Screwpull in the United States. We were told to send it back to them and they would either repair or replace it. I sent it back to the maker over 3 weeks ago and am still awaiting either a repaired one or hopefully a new one.

The new screwpull is made of plastic and not nearly as well made as the model he has from several years ago. He used it once and the second time, it wouldn't open the bottle. He pressed down on the plastic top piece which broke right off making the screwpull useless. I contacted the vendor who graciously agreed to replace it but I have not yet received the replacement.

First, the lever would not put pressure on the cork so the cork needed to be removed by hand.

I love that this DVD has segments for both dance and Step, which was exactly what I wanted.

I have very little dancing skills and no natural talent (I'd be at level -1), but it's a really good workout for beginners. I had to spend a lot of time with the tutorials before each session but after a week of daily workouts I really feel a good improvement in my health and ability to keep up. If you're a poor dancer like me, get it anyway and just stick with it. If we could follow her from the first try we wouldn't need this dvd.

Heck yeah I'll try this video for free before I buy. It was hard to hear her talking on the instructional portion, but when I turned on the step portion, there was ZERO audio from her at all. Just the music. I cranked up my tv volume hoping I could hear her quietly but it was no avail. Its like the mic wasn't working at all, and they said hey what the heck no one likes the talking anyway and made the video without it. Since I haven't done step aerobics in 10 years, I was looking forward to a beginning video but without knowing what she's doing or having any cues, I was very disappointed. I'll try it a few more times (hey, I've got it for 3 weeks) but I would return this if I had paid for it.

Sure, it makes a full pot in a minute, but how can that justify the energy use?I've experienced some electrical problems with this unit. The burner on/off light burned out within a few months, so there's no way of telling if the burner is on or off. I had to write \\"on\\" and \\"off\\" on either side of the switch with a sharpie.Most importantly, the taste of coffee this unit produces has deteriorated, though I never remember ever getting an exceptional pot of coffee from this machine to begin with.

It says its 10 cups, but the coffee maker will really only let you get about 9 1/2 cups. The lip and the actual pouring of the coffee sucks too. I have to poor it over the sink. This is mentioned in previous reviews. I read them too, and still bought the damn thing. Its true, the coffee pot sucks.The container for the filter gets dirty when you make a full 10 cups, the groungs come all the way to the top of the filter and sometimes overflow.Seriouly, visually the coffee maker is cool, functionaly its a piece of crap.

Secondly it will do as it states, \\"It will make 12 cups of coffee in 3 minutes\\" but, it will not slow down the brewing process for fewer cups like other premium coffee makers.

The details made this find very exciting. Bottom line it makes a cup of coffee. I cannot say that it is a great cup of coffee or even a good cup of coffee. I think the problem is that the coffee is not brewed hot enough. The coffee is cold in your mug within two minutes of pouring. There is also a misconception with this pot. Bunn details that you will have coffee within 3 minutes, which you do. But I should have wondered how it is done. Your coffee maker has to always be on to keep the water warm in the unit. It makes a quick pot of coffee, but I would rather it take ten minutes and have a hotter brew than cold coffee. Bunn is a good brand, but this coffee maker is not for me.

Worst of all, it was pretentious, trying to be something artful (which it was not) at the expense of a good, coherent story. The characters were one dimensional and none of them were sympathetic. I literally could not wait for this movie to be over. The only horror I felt was repulsion, which can work in a horror movie, but not when it's for the filmmakers themselves and their inability to craft a decent piece of entertainment.The idea of a monster baby has, of course, been done before.

I mean there is literally a lot of blood in it. Blood oozes, spills, pools. However, it's all to good purpose. It all has a point. But if such a sanguine sight makes you squeamish, this is not the film for you.The jacket of this DVD also might be a little misleading in that it suggests another \\"bad seed\\" sort of baby - another psychopathic monster. But that isn't it either. This movie is more inventive than that. The infant Grace poses a different sort of problem for anyone taking care of her.

I didn't find much in the way horror or surprises. There wasn't much dialog, and the pacing was very slow.

But-this type of film really is one that, unless you are comfortable with lots of morbid emotionally charged elements and getting caught up in dirty dish-rag wringing out of emotions - I really encourage you to rent first, then if it appeals, consider a pruchase. This is not a slam at the production value, quality of the script, OR lack of decent actors - that is all rightly there - but it has all the \\"feel\\" of a little girl standing over her dead-run over dog in the street and arguing with the cop saying \\"but Officer, that can't be my dog....Barkey doesn't have his guts hanging out of his mouth.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't go in the helth food store","review":"We have don't go in the woods, don't go in the house and finally at last don't go in the health food store.

The studio clearly loves it's fans because they have produced a few nuggets of gold on the internet. [...]."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Lord...","review":"Okay...

And OMG, wait for it...the baby drinks blood instead of milk! So, like the smell that existed in that bathroom at that moment, this movie stinks. It's boring, silly and an incomplete thought. There's nothing new or interesting about it. This movie makes no sense and takes something that you would normally see as a miracle and turns it upside down without any explanation or cause.

You'd except to get a lot of content packed in such a small book but that's the opposite : there are only very few pages of text in the whole book, of very moderate usefulness in my opinion.

There are simply too many musicians on the stage with him, and he barely touches his guitar. The setlist is unimpressive. The documentary portion of this dvd is very interesting, mostly due to Eric Clapton's comments, which are insightful and informative. The bonus material with Clapton being interviewed about his love for the Blues and his first time hearing Hooker is a real treat, as well.

Unfortunately, the book is unreadable on my Kindle DX due to bad scanning of the original document.

Thus the top-left quarter of an original page appears on one Kindle page, the top-right quarter of the same original page appears on the next Kindle page, etc. Among other effects, this slices every paragraph down the middle and makes reading impossible, unless you toggle back and forth between Kindle pages in the middle of every line of every paragraph.

Not just at the seams where the glue was, but in the wood grain itself. Looks horrible. My wife commented just now how warped the board is- and she's right. there is at least a half inch warping on each side.We wanted to buy this board because of the sustainable practices of the manufacturer, but unfortunately cannot recommend the board to anyone.

After weighting the board for 3 days, the warp had not changed much, so I decided to return it.I had other issues also. The board arrived well oiled---overly so, in my opinion. Picking up the board left my hands greasy and slippery. I was afraid that touching the board to my clothes would leave a grease stain. Maybe this amount of oil is common for maple boards, I don't know.Also, the oil had a subtle but distinct \\"industrial\\" smell. The smell transferred to my hands when I handled the board.

The only bronze on a cart of this nature would be the water fittings which except for a tee are made of bronze as you would expect. The basket is ideal for a sprinkler, or sprayer.

Her roommate Lilith may (or may not) be an actual demoness. She certainly engages in bizarre rituals. Seeing an opportunity to break out of her rut, Kate talks Lilith into taking her act on the road as a performance art piece.An Opening Act of Unspeakable Evil is a slice-of-life novel in the form of a blog, following nine months of Kate's entries about her experiences with Lilith and on tour. Like many real bloggers who focus on their personal lives, Kate is likable if a bit too earnest, and her story convincingly captures a young person trying to find herself by adding some excitement to her life. Even so, Kate's story on its own could easily have become boring. However, the \\"is she or isn't she\\" questions floating around Lilith add just enough spice to hold the reader's interest without descending in silliness or fantasy. And in the end, Lilith's growth and self-discovery are the most compelling parts of the novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Goodness","review":"Again this is a very cute Item but $29.00! come on!

(The pilot for the Heroes series is my idea of a good pilot episode.)A good pilot episode should develop characters, and by the end of this I felt grossed out but not like I really knew any of the characters in the series. Even Sabrina Lloyd was a disappointment as it seemed that all she did was glower.

This gives you a chance to get acquainted with the sentence structure of the Quechua language which I found very helpful. The author also shares interesting insights into the people who tell the tales. I love to travel in Peru and I am going to pass this book on to a Quechua friend who will surely enjoy it as much as I did.

Unfortunately, I can't review the product because I never received it. What Discount Jungle sent was the Mutec YA3, which is available from another Amazon seller for $9.99.I asked Discount Jungle for a full refund, and I received it. But Discount Jungle claimed to be selling something they weren't actually selling, and I never got my PA3B adapter. Not only that, I had to waste time returning the YA3 adapter to them so that I could get my refund. My time is valuable. So I gave Discount Jungle two stars.Discount Jungle's response to my feedback was this: \\"Item shipped was EXACTLY as advertised on the listing.

I bought the single, and after a few listens, found BT's little twang on the work again (\\"loove.. cooomes....agin'...\\") wore on my nerves. That being said, it has a pounding good beat, is quite danceable, and made me feel a lot better about myself.I bought the version with two mixes on it - the first, which I think is the Original Mix, is the best.

Of the 15, or so, cuts, there are only 3 tunes that don't quite hit the mark and the rest cook with either hypnotic funky grooves, or rippin' ferocity.

Listen to \\"Shake It Part 1 & Pt.2\\" and you just feel the energy, the groove is similar to that of the cool Mitsubishi car commercial song, the one with everyone dancing in their car! The music here is different, advanced, a bit techno, but the soulful blues energy is very present! This is great party music, you just want to jump up and dance... or dance in your car!

This is actually a Chopped and Screwed version of the Do or Die album \\"Pimpin' Ain't Dead.\\" So not only does this album have nothing to do with Devin, 'chopped' refers to the lyrics being spliced in a repetitive & predictable way, and 'screwed' refers to the sound of the voices being distorted to sound deeper and slower.

Another user said they had problems with theirs not nailing upside down... I noticed that a couple of time as well, but found that it has some sort of safety interlock that cases that. If you have your finger on the trigger at all BEFORE pressing the head up against the wood, it won't fire. Pulling the gun back, letting go of the trigger, then pushing the head against the wood BEFORE touching the trigger fixes the problem.

I also noticed a small air leak at the top. Needless to say, I will be returning this one. I will exchange it for another of the same model, since I have had NO problems like this before with Senco nailers.

Bayles is as critical of mindless nihilism as she is of sentimentality. With sharp historical insight, she tracks the decline of value in popular music and diagnoses its causes in the misappropriation of the African American cultural roots of rock, jazz, soul, and rhythm \`n' blues. Her style is very clear, and her argument quite engaging. I especially like her ability to locate pop music in the broader contexts of American history and the philosophy of art. She leaves us wondering where our culture may be headed musically and philosophically, and what it might take to restore quality and value to our art."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Brain-Expanding Eye-Opener","review":"Joy to the world!

It's a great book and a reflection of Martha Bayles's terrific intelligence, wit, aesthetic cunning, originality, and best of all for present purposes: the ability to get all this \\"stuff\\" into her writing.

There's always a market in America for neoconservative scarebooks, but this one is even more smug and thoughtless than the norm.

Martha Bayles is no Adorno. There are somelegitmate criticisms to be made regarding popular music, but Baylesisn't making them.

In today's society caught up in the trival pursuits of daily life - time out for social gatherings that bring excitement into our lives is a treasure - and Tutera's book is the chest to store those treasures to use one day - hopefully soon.

It's no wonder David has such a loyal celebrity following.I highly recommend this book for anyone who loves throwing or attending a suberb party. One of the best features are the Tutera tips, where David outlines his trade secrets, written in a way that a anyone can understand.It's a MUST HAVE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"detailed and fascinating look at compelling culture group.","review":"I was inspired to read this book after a 7 day bicycle trip in and around Lancaster, PA. Certainly any cultural group which resists the juggernaut and onslaught of American consumer culture bears study, and this book must be the definitive look at this group. How do you keep people interested in looking different, in downplaying their individuality in favor of the group's needs; in foregoing creature comforts like cars and electricity? And what is even more amazing is that there are many more Amish today than there were 50 years ago; unlike the Shakers, this sect is thriving. I recommend this book highly.RH"},{"rating":"2","title":"Insightful analysis of seemingly arbitrary standards","review":"Kraybill's treatment is an necessary extension of the work Hostetler began. Kraybill's book analyzes more specific examples of what \\"Moderns\\" see as hypocritical behavior among the Amish and provides the historical and doctrinal framework for understanding the rationale. There are no arbitrary decisions made regarding the prescriptions and proscriptions. As he concludes, the Amish are actually more advanced in their thinking than Moderns give them credit for.I would have rated this 5 stars, however, I think there are some points where Kraybill restates the same points needlessly; i.e. he will make a point, and then restate it in 2-3 different ways. Then, revisit that point again later in the book within a different context, and restate it again, 2-3 different ways."},{"rating":"1","title":"Biased author makes living on writing and lecturing on the Amish.","review":"It is very important for this particular author to play down or avoid delicate subjects that pertain to the Amish. His own religious background is sympathetic to these oft times not so peaceful people and in order for him to continue to be allowed entry where most outsiders aren't he obviously has to tread gently.

It includes 13 of your favorite Rolling Stones tunes performed by some of the greatest Blues artists of all time. If you like the Blues, this CD will be in the top of your collection. After hearing it you'll wonder if these great songs were originally intended to be Blues tunes all along. Otis Clay's version of Wild Horses is the best. I would never have believed you could improve on this original classic, but Otis will blow you away.

After all it was the Stones who introduced millions to the roots of rock music. If you like the Blues, even just a little, and if you like the Stones, these covers of some of their classics and some not so classic will impress you. Bobby Womack, a Chicago Blues Man from the late 50's early 60's, covers the Stones early hit \\" It's All Over Now\\" which was originally his song before the Stones covered it. If you want to here a new take on some old classics this disc is well worth the purchase.

My two year old player is the best player I've ever heard, so I assumed that this one would do just as well, since it looked similiar and had the same features. However, when I bought this one I plugged in my sony studio monitor headphones, and the sound level was about half that of my two year old player. This was a very big dissapointment. The only way I could get the sound level higher was to use the uncomfortable and low quality in ear headphones that came with the player, which happened to have a defect; the left side was made to fit in the right ear and right side was made to fit in the left ear, so it was even more inconvenient. Philips ought to listen to their older cd players and bring back the good sound quality from years past.

But after about 15 minutes I realised this was another in a long string of Soviet/Afghan let downs. It seems very few, if any, of the soldiers who fought in this war have anything but the most rudimentary idea of how to put it down on paper.

It is kind of like that. The thing I like is, each card has three levels, so you can choose easy,medium, or hard for each exercise. It is a great way to work out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product...wouldn't bother with dvd.","review":"I am very happy with this product. It is great for randomizing your workout and keep them from getting stale. I do have to disagree with another reviewer though (respectfully) in that I do not think that the dvd is really worth the price of admission. The exercises are all mostly self-explanatory and those that are unusual are not hard to figure out. So the dvd really is a 'one-watch' only product.I bought the Bodyweight and the Combat Sports. Rather than the dvd, I wish I had bought another booster pack instead, perhaps the 'Firefighter' or 'Navy Seals' booster pack as that will be of use in the long-run to keep mixing up your workout.In conclusion, if you are looking for something to make a workout fun, and mix it up a bit, this is for you without a doubt. Just don't buy the dvd, perhaps the small activities book would be better, as it might give you ideas to keep it fresh."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book that makes me look forward to story time.","review":"This is a book that my 5 year old son and I both love and we revisit it over and over again.

In this story, period details bring the multifaceted world of the 15th century convent to life when the sisters are presented with a troupe of actors who arrive with the wounded husband of the convent's maid.

The other thing that annoyed me was the change of names...Alexis and Alexei: make up your mind (I prefer Alexei)! The whole Cyrillic thing going on to make it more \\"Russian\\" was obnoxious.

It is a frustrating exercise simply leafing through it because the index is no help. Perhaps if I was intimately acquainted with New England I may have some idea where to look in the book so as I could find what I was after.

It was so in depth, it answered questions i hadn't even thought of."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read!","review":"I got this book not too long ago. I'm not much of a reader, but, even though I haven't finished it, I do like it...a lot! The book tells all starting from the inspiration for the comic, the task of trying to make it a movie, and finally works its way up until the very last second, the very last detail of the film. Definitely necessary to any \\"The Crow\\" fan collection!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Subject covered better than expected.","review":"I was fully expecting this book to be like a rehashing of every media account of what happened on the set of The Crow, but it surprised me by its tone and the way the subject matter was handled. I would recommend this to anyone who's interested. It is worth a read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only if you don't have better choices","review":"The premise was interesting--poaching of abalone--so the protagonist worked for Fish and Game. However, the story was disjointed, had gaping holes in the story line, and tried to include too many people. Was it a story about poaching, drug smuggling, or an evil hit man's revenge? Yes. Fish and Game, FBI, local police in several locations, informants who changed sides, suspects who helped in the end, and, oh yes, a marriage separation and a teenager suffering anorexia. Too much for a coherent tale.It was made more frustrating because of how it appeared on my Kindle. It was as though it had been moved from a magazine or newspaper that requires justified lines; hyphens were dropped in all over the place. There were other grammatical errors a good editor would have caught. I finished it because I'm basically stubborn, but I don't think I'll be looking for more Kirk Russell novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissippointed ....A Save the Abalone Disguised as a Murder Mystery","review":"This is a book I wouldn't buy again. I felt like it put the value of a shell fish over the value of human life. I understand that a author has a right to write whatever is important to them...just as I can and will choose not to buy from certain authors. I bought it in Kindle form, and there was a blurb somewhere about plague at the campground where the murders took place, well that was never fleshed out in the story. It was just a teaser. I don't plan to buy anything by this author again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only okay.","review":"With the story set in my own San Francisco Bay Area, I very much enjoyed the locations and appreciate manner in which he presented the problems of the Dept. of Fish and Game. I would never have guessed abalone smuggling could be more profitable than drugs. However, even with all the bodies and climatic encounter with Kline, I never felt the suspense of this book or a real involvement with the characters. All the bits were there-plot, dialogue, setting--but, somehow, I just did not have a visceral connection to the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't bother","review":"I was a bit disappointed in this book, and certainly can't recommend it for others. The plot was confused, and the reader could easily get lost in knowing who was who."},{"rating":"2","title":"Relevant and engaging...a great first work","review":"As a diver, NorCal native and committed conservationist, I was captivated from the start by this potent, believable tale. Russell's characters are completely real, coping with difficult work, complicated families, career decisions--hey, a lot like the rest of us! His eye for subtle details and capacity to project the plight of the characters onto the canvas of California's fragile resources make the story at once relevant and engaging. This is a promising first effort, and I can't wait to devour the next in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"kind of disappointed","review":"well i just received the package today from England and it came sooner than expected. the book that came is in good shape and its A Treasury Of Hans Christian Anderson alright but its not the International Collectors Library edition. i was kinda disappointed cause i wanted THAT edition but well i guess i cant complain really cause i paid 2 cents for it. at least i got a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"this is a 2004 Christmas Doll","review":"Although you cant see it in the Picture and it is NOT stated in the desription this doll is a 2004 Christmas Doll and Says 2004 on her Dress.My daughter loves Manhattan Toy Dolls...... but if you were planning on giving this as a gift, you may want to reconsider."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inaccurate Product Description","review":"Do not pay attention to the Product Description, YOU NEED ADAPTER RINGS. I'm certain that the holder is exactly as it should be, however, the product description is wrong. I spent a considerable amount of money (since I also purchased filters) with the intent of using them on a two week excursion and now I will not be able to. The product description states:Product DescriptionThe Foundation Kit is a slip-on filter holder that is designed to avoid vignetting. As this holder slips over the lens, no adapter ring is required.ADAPTER RINGS ARE DEFINITELY REQUIRED!!!!Even the instructions included with the holder says that adapter rings must be used. I am extremely disappointed in Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great format","review":"Lots of room to write down conditions, results, etc. Since they've screwed up the \\"The Complete Runner's Day-by-Day Log,\\" this will be my new diary from now on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best on the market","review":"I buy one of these for my husband every year.

I'll continue to buy him one each year until he quits running, which I'm sure he'll never do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drop the Days of the Week","review":"I guess I'm being picky. Okay I know Sunday is really the first day of the week but for those of us tracking miles by week (especially important for building your bases so you don't over do it) you usually can't break the weekend apart. Sometimes due to your time schedule you can train long on Saturday and sometimes you have to do it on Sunday. Let's say your building for a marathon. You do 5 - five milers during the week and a 15 mile run on Sunday. Next week you do the same but have to do the 15 on Saturday. According to the book you did 25 miles one week and 55 miles the next. How's that for tracking weekly miles? The better training log's leave the days of the week blank so you can fill it in. And yes I know you could always cross out the days of the week in this log and rewrite it but why should you have to?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great way to motivate you for running...","review":"This was a great buy!!! My parents purchased this training log since high school, and now, being in college running for NCAA. I now look back on what my mileage was at that age, and how fast I was able to run! Highly recommended for someone young or old that has a passion for running in your family. This is because I have always thanked the person that bought it for me, every year."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wolf in Sheeps Clothing","review":"For a small novel, this reads like a book twice it's size. This story grips you and never lets go until its done. As the cover suggests, it is based around the aviation industry, but does not get itself too wrapped up in technical jargon that only those in \\"the biz\\" will understand. Although I felt this is primarily a man's tale, it is not to be ignored by women who enjoy a well paced, 21st Century caper that takes you around the globe and keeps you guessing.A first class debut that would make an excellent screenplay."},{"rating":"2","title":"100% Business Education","review":"This was a wonderful book; I still use it as a guide. I first saw this book 10 years ago when I started my first business.

His voice is arrestingly gravelly, and is perfect for the gospel-tinged ballads of deep soul music. This album contains some of the most beautiful songs in popular music. Among these songs are Misty Blue, Message from Maria, Teenager's Prayer and Hangin' On. I have been listening to them for 25 years without tiring of them. I was overjoyed three years ago when I got this album under a different name. It is one of my most treasured. If you like deep soul, and by some misfortune, you have never heard Joe Simon, then I envy you because you are due for a revelation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only recommended to big Tom Hanks fans who've never seen this.","review":"I saw this movie listed on Amazon and wondered why I never heard of it before, since I thought I had seen all Tom Hanks movies. I gave it a shot on Instant Video...and regret spending $2.99 on it.It feels like a made-for-TV-movie. Hanks is in it, but not really the star. This is clearly one of his first movies. It's about a Dungeons and Dragons-like game that's popular at the time.It took me two tries to actually sit through it, as the first night I tried watching it I got bored and fell asleep. I decided to force myself to watch the rest of it the next day...and I regretted renting it the whole time. This is one of those movies that I hope will get better but it never does.Only worth seeing if you are a big Hanks fan and want to view everything he's ever been in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strange movie","review":"Can't even begin to tell you why I like this movie, but I do. I really love Tom Hanks, but the other actors are only okay. It's just one of those movies I saw a long time ago and liked it. Bought it recently and I still like it. If you're a Hanks fan, you'll probably want this for your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Most Delightful Read","review":"I was given this book by a friend two years before she died. She knew I would love reading about the same era as when she was a young girl in Oklahoma. Froggy Bottom, about a young teacher who ventures into teaching a one-room school, is a most delightful read. If you enjoy any nostalgiac reads, Froggy Bottom is it.

Yes, you have to have learned the Latin of the mass so you can follow every word of the singing. Yes, this is the most drawn-out setting of the text of any mass you've ever heard--it takes a couple of hearings to adjust your expectations to the extremely long dwelling on every word. Yes, you have to be skilled in listening to polyphony. But this is the kind of masterpiece that makes you think about buying an extra CD in case something should happen to your CD.

Proir to wrapping it, I thumbed through the remainder of the book only to find the monkey saying \\"this is so dumb\\" and \\"I am going to tell those lovestruck losers how to have fun\\". For me personally, I would not want my 3 year old son using the words \\"dumb\\" and \\"loser\\" at his age. I promptly returned the book for a more appropriate one for the exchange.

Had trouble putting batteries in 1 of the peelers because there was a tiny plastic piece in the way which we just cut out. Then batteries went in fine. (Looked like the plastic did not cut off straight at the manufacturer's.) Both peelers work great and are very sharp and easy to use. I tried a different peeler first that had a shield guard, but found I still had peelings flying all over the place if I was not careful. This peeler doesn't shred the peelings like the other one. It cuts them in strips just as if I was using a non-battery operated peeler. Much cleaner way of peeling! I was hoping to find a peeler that didn't need the \\"on\\" button pushed while peeling. I used to have a peeler that I could just turn on while using but can't find them any more. At least this peeler has the \\"on\\" button in an easy to hold place. Overall, I'm very pleased with the product and would recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work very well.","review":"I bought these for my mother who has really bad arthritis in her hands. She had picked up a similar peeler somewhere that actually worked but it had broken.I hoped these would work also. The motor seems to work fine but the blades seem dull. I hope to somehow sharpen them so it works.Only works for the very lightest peeling job."},{"rating":"2","title":"good guide, but more research is needed","review":"I used this book to guide me through my first 2-day hiking trail in PA. It was useful for the fact that I do't know much about Pennsylvania trails. It gives you a breakdown of the whole state, telling you everything about what you see on each trail down to the kind of plantlife you can expect to see. There's also helpful ratings about each trail so you can pick one that is suitable for your level of experience. Each description of the trails also have a rough sketch of what the trail is like...marking campgrounds and bodies of water. However, the trail description on the one that I chose said that there would be a park office where we could get a topographic map of the park. I might have missed it, but we never encountered such an office. I highly recommend just using this as a guide and buying your own topographic map on your destination.Other than that, I am planning to buy his guides on some other states. It was very helpful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great shampoo -- kills fleas, smells good, great price","review":"You don't have to use much of this shampoo, it goes a long way.

Dogs love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get the Kleenex...Very good book!","review":"The story is about Leah Travers. Her, her husband Perry and their 2 year-old son Galen are traveling home from Leah's parents house. Perry is angry with Leah because her parents always try to run things and Leah lets them do it. They take a different exit and notice some older lady who needs help with her tire. Perry wants to stop and help. That's when tragedy strikes. She is left with a heart full of grief and not much will to live. Until she meets Jacobo Martinez. He is a believer with stong faith. A big yet gentle man who also happens to be the brother-in-law of the the man who killed her family.I thought the book was very truthful in how you would react, things you would feel etc. It seemed natural. The characters seemed real to me. Jacobo was a hero every women would love. I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gel-eez not the best choice","review":"We bought 3 of the Case Logic Gel-eez wrist supports several years ago. My wife used them for a short time, but we both found that one's wrist is elevated too much for it to be comfortable and/or useful when grasping the mouse. Modern mice have a low profile, so a simple 1/4 inch thick foam pad would be much more enjoyable and useful. Initially the contents were a gel, but after a few years, all 3 of the supports, which were stored in a drawer since we didn't want to use them, had their gels turn to a liquid with a viscosity similar to that of water. I would be worried about using a liquid-filled device near expensive computer equipment or other valuable things. It is time to throw them out and learn from our experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"I won't use anything else","review":"My title says it all.

I have viewed better plot development and characterization in a Visa television commercial. And television must have been on Peter Mayles mind when he typed this disaster.This reads as a proposal for a mini-series. Flat, wooden characters. Hackneyed plot. Improbable coincidences. Wacky villains. Comical mayhem. No cliche' left unturned. Inane.\\"After finishing the last page of 'Chasing Cezanne', Richard reached for his glass of Vieux Telegraphe 1982.

Stupid, unexciting plot; flat, cookie-cutter characters; a lack of deeper themes or messages. I've never read Peter Mayle's other works, but I expected a whole lot more from a bestselling author."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!","review":"Having enjoyed Mayle's previous books so immensely, I was thrilled to pick this up at a bookstore last year. What a disappointment to find it so lacking in the warmth and spontanaity of his others. I found little to care about the characters drawn here and kept hoping the next chapter would be an improvement. Even the descriptions of food and eating weren't as fascinating as A Year in Provence. Oh, well, thank you anyway, Mr. Mayle for your other books. No one can be perfect all the time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lightweight Divertissement","review":"This rather light book is a decent beach read or a companion on a plane flight, but little more. The plot centers on a stolen work of art, and in typical Mayle style includes a romp through France, with many stops at fine restaurants and brasseries. Mayle has a wonderful way of describing the French joie de vivre, with heavy emphasis on their culinary prowess, and this work is no exception. Unfortunately, there is little more to this novel. The plot is not all that plausible, the characters uninteresting, the story not well fleshed out, and the ending is simply stupid. Peter Mayle has written some wonderful novels, but this isn't one of them. I can't even recommend this to someone who liked his other works, it is really without interest or merit. Overall, a disappointing effort, and worthy only to pass the time on vacation or while travelling."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Chasing A Plot\\" is More Like It","review":"As a fan of Peter Mayle, I can't tell you how let down I was by this extremely slight, jetsetting-but-going-nowhere novel. I enjoyed the lighthearted A Year in Provence and Hotel Pastis, so I wasn't expected War and Peace by a long shot. But this (perhaps mercifully) short novel does nothing to evoke the landscape, whet the reader's appetite for fine food and gracious living, or even hint at character development. Too many stock characters (the dashing photographer, the take-no-prisoners editor, the perfectly pressed art dealer, the starry-eyed first-time-in-Paris ingenue). And the quick pacing leads to a disappointing denouement, which is -- sacre bleu! -- even more lackluster than the author's description of the colorful art which is purportedly being \\"chased.\\" The extra star is only for my fondness of Mayle's other books: Otherwise, I'd only give it one. Two dreary thumbs down."},{"rating":"1","title":"am i the only one who did not \\"get\\" this?","review":"a disappointment. while the descriptions of place and food were wonderful, as always with mayle, the plot involving a real Cezanne painting and not one, but two, copies, never made sense to me. if someone else can explain the plot to me, i'd appreciate it. the owner of the Cezanne arranges to have it removed from his house and copied. Holtz was going to arrange to sell the copy as the original? and return the original to the owner along with some of the money? was Pine also going to arrange to sell a copy? or the original? was there ever a second copy? what happened, or was going to happen, to it? what role did the magazine editor play in all this? in addition to not being able to understand people's motives, i too thought that many of the plot developments were improbable. the characters repeatedly failed to recognize the obvious and they kept secrets from one another for no apparent reason. in retrospect, a most unsatisfying read."},{"rating":"1","title":"clumsy and hastily penned Mayle","review":"I've enjoyed several of Mayle's other books, but this one is an amiable clunker. The mystery plot is buried under the guise of globetrotting and eating good food. The book would have read much better without the dumb chase scenes (the \\"hit man\\" following our narrator) and with more meals. After all, it's mood, ambience and food that Mayle specializes in, not characterization and plot, both of which are sorely lacking.This book is so mediocre that it's not even a good beach read. You won't care much what happens in this \\"art\\" mystery because the plot is so thrown together. One gets the feeling his editor said, \\"Okay, we need a book in a week.\\" I won't hold it against Mayle since his other books are much more charming, but this one is almost totally devoid of this usual charm."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fake Cezannes and Frou Frou Fiction","review":"I loved Mayle's \\"A Year in Provence\\" and \\"Toujours\\" and based on the pleasures of reading those two books picked up a $4 remaindered paperback edition of \\"Chasing Cezanne.\\" What a disappointment! The characters are two dimensional; all dialogue is stilted and hackneyed. The plot is a fallen soufle.

Now, sometimes mysteries have a very gruesome component, and some other times they are rated PG-13 or even G. The latter is the case with this book. This novel is rather bland, and it lacks the spice present in most \\"grown-up\\" mysteries. Also, i finished the book not understanding why there had been so many copies of the painting made. It was all very confusing, and i blame my confusion on not paying enough attention to the plot, and i blame that on the fact that the story line was quite insipid and lacked a little something.There are mysteries, and there are mysteries!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Chasing Cezanne is a very silly book.","review":"Save your time and read \\"A Year in Provence\\" instead.

Art scams and art thefts are very current - Interpol has just created a website about stolen art- and, as an artist, I enjoy fiction concerning art. I wasn't disappointed - Mayle's characters are fun to the point where the reader can start visualizing film casting, the pace is quick,and delineations can be biting. At 295 pages, it is a light and entertaining read. Since the food descriptions can be mouth-watering, the only warning is not to read it if you are hungry!-"},{"rating":"1","title":"Brainless Beach Material","review":"Though, that is not to say I did not enjoy it.

Erasing and re-recording the disc does make it go away, but it's not worth it.The battery life is excellent, even with the anti-shock on. One feature from older Panasonics that I miss is the ability to quickly pull the AC/DC adapter out of the back of the unit while it was playing. The old ones switched to battery; this one shuts off.Don't buy this unit for the remote; wireless remotes on portable CD players are not worth extra money.

Steve Carrell's role could have been performed by anyone, so his higher salary was wasted as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sooooo Disappointed!","review":"I was so looking forward to this movie with the great actors. It was horrible. I don't think there was more than one funny moment in the whole movie. It left both my husband and I almost depressed.

I feel like we shouldn't have to pay the full price."},{"rating":"2","title":"BIg time actors make sweet chick flick","review":"Wonderful, entertaining little movie with two of my favorite actors. Humorous and witty. Seeing Steve Carrell as marriage councelor was a real hoot!"},{"rating":"1","title":"PG-13???????","review":"It amazes me how Hollywood can accomplish their agenda. First, the movie was rated PG-13. There was no nudity and the language was not terrible, hence, the PG-13 rating. However, the movie, simply stated, was filthy. It starts out with an older couple, Streep and Jones, with a dull, lifeless marriage. Streep wants some life back in her marriage and signs them up for a weekend of intensive marriage counseling. The homo-sexual agenda was clear with the encouragement from the marriage counselor to purchase a book, \\"Sex Tips from a Gay Man.\\"I was sorry that I watched the movie and would not recommend it to those that are offended regarding sodomy and open marriage experiences or suggestions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unexpectedly Boring","review":"We love both Tommy Lee Jones and Meryl Streep, but we were bored throughout this movie. It never really went anywhere. We wanted to like it, but it just didn't work."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a bomb!!!","review":"The previews of this movie on television made it look like a romantic comedy, which my wife and I both enjoy, but after ordering and watching it we realized it was a very heavy handed and cumbersome drama.All the cast members are fantastic actors! Hope Springs should have been an Oscar candidate with this powerful cast, but this show is a total flop. The cast, I believe did the best job that they could with what they had, but the script stunk on ice. It was not at all enjoyable to watch.I used to think that Fargo was the biggest waste of film, and the worst movie I'd ever seen, but Hope Springs out bombed it by a mile, and then some!My advice is don't waste you money on this DVD, but if you did, do what I'm going to do, use it for skeet shooting. It would make a much better clay pigeon than a movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"movie","review":"I cannot say how very disappointed we all are.. We had friends over to see this movie. Merrel Streep has always made movies I was not afraid to allow our teen grand children to watch. This is it! I cannot buy it and give to our daughters as they have already said they did not want it..they walked out of our home theater. What a shame. Again..we are disappointed.However, the company who sold the movie sent it on time and as new....that is the only thing good about this horrid movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Comedy?","review":"This movie should really not be considered a comedy, the only times I actually laughed wasn't from something funny it was more of a \\"this is really uncomfortable for me to watch this with my parents\\" kind of laugh. It was awkward in many places and as much as I love Tommy Lee Jones and Maryl Streep I won't be watching this again. I kept waiting for Steve Carell to make a joke but it never happened, he was serious the entire movie and it was weird. I won't be recommending this to anyone unfortunately."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cancelled purchase","review":"I cancelled the purchase since it would not play on my Roku device.

Sure, I'm younger, but thought the story looked like a good one. The actors, classic. I wrongfully assumed this movie could not be bad. I was wrong. Boring, slow, not as funny as expected. My husband and I nearly walked out of this movie and we never do that. We stayed hoping for more but got nothing out of it in the end. I don't suggest buying it. Go the one-time rental route if you feel you must, but buying it would be a waste, as I'm pretty sure you would not want to sit through it more than once and torture yourself. I feel bad for writing such a poor review for such amazing actors, but this is a movie I just can't support. Heck, it doesn't support itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was really excited about viewing this film, but found it to be very disappointing. The film left unanswered questions at the end. Two thumbs down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Even Tommy Lee can save this movie","review":"10 minutes of story stretched to an hour and a half. If you like all of Meryl Streep movies, you will probably like this one. Otherwise, you see Tommy Lee Jones as you never want to see him again--as a boring accountant with no romance. The epilogue to the movie showed him happy, loving, and full of life but we never get to see him make the transformation.Steve Carrell is boring as the marriage counselor. Meryl is Meryl as a 50-year old old maid who happens to be married to Jones and cooks him bacon and eggs every morning. In the highlight of the show, she can't bring herself to perform oral sex on Jones in a theatre, and Jones runs after her telling her that it is no big deal.Just like this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love springs eternal","review":"I would recommend this to those married a long time.

Especially that this movie had Steve Carell in it, The story line was not bad in itself, but it was more serious, about an aging couple with relationship issues. It was more of a Lifetime show, not something I would pay to go see or rent (like I did). There were a couple of parts in it I didn't need to see."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad","review":"Boring. Not funny at all. Thought it would be good with these actors. It wasn't. Do not bother or waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn....","review":"I agree with the subpar reviews, what a waste of two wonderful stars. Meryl can hold a failed romantic view (think Bridges of Madison County). I love Tommy Lee, but he is basically an action Star. Not a good match, their energy did not sync. Meryl is Shakesperian quality. Tommy is Good Old Boy fun, bad mismatch. Both wonderful actors with the right story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie for couples who have been together for many years","review":"Realistic storyline. Tommy Lee Jones and Meryl Streep VERY believable. My sister and I watched this and discussed the parallels in our own relationships. Could be a great conversation starter if you could actually get a man to watch it. Better chances to watch as a rental. It did inspire hope for exploring reconnection with a spouse and bringing back the spark."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific!","review":"Two absolute prose enliven an excellent script.

There were several times when I found myself laughing at loud uncontrollably. It's well acted, and it's nice to see a movie with substance rather than a movie where an actresses sex appeal, cleavage, and butt are suppose to carry the story....although - I thought both Streep and Jones were sexy for their age!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Movie Rating and Experience","review":"I chose this rating not because of the movie (which I thought it was a 5 star) but because we might have had a better viewing experience if it were not due to playback issues (stuttering, buffering).

Of course, Tommy Lee plays the bad guy here for a while until they both find out things about each other that they didn't know during their therapy sessions with Steve Carell. I'll have to say, this is the first time I have seen Carell play a serious part and he does a great job. Their therapy is a hard struggle and so is breaking old habits within their relationship. But, the end result is worth it. I cried in some places, hurt for them in others, and laughed during this movie.

Meryl Streep and Tommy Lee Jones did a fine job portraying believable middle-aged characters along with Steve Carrell playing a sympathetic counselor. As far as an empty marriage requiring a 180 degree change, it was a believable plot line until their therapy only involved sex work with some really stupid juvenile tips that will bring on cringe-inducing moments. Rather than make a movie for 'grown ups', this production devolved into yet ANOTHER story built around SEX. Very tiresome when this had makings of greatness and could've been 90 minutes of marital counseling for the masses but instead was built around teenage fantasies for old people and how to rekindle sex at age 60 like an 18 year old.

It's like watching real therapy - not that entertaining.These are both excellent actors, but they couldn't shine with this material.

While the acting was certainly outstanding, the story itself was fundamentally and wildly depressing. Not at all the \\"funny\\" experience so many friends had suggested it was.

Unless, of course, you haven't had sex for umpteen years and then perhaps it would be cathartic..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointing","review":"This could have been an insightful look the impact of time and lack of attention on a relationship, and it could have taken advantage of two of the best actors Hollywood has to offer, but it didn't.Both lead roles became characatures rather than the characters they should have been. In particular, Tommy Lee Jones was such a cliche' of a distant husband that he was practically a cartoon.Possibly the most frustrating aspect of this movie was its failure to contect the dots between the two totally alienated people that awkwardly stumbled through counseling, and the two love birds passionately sharing a Kodak moment on beach at the end. 80% of this film depicted a disaffected couple heading for divorce, and then it rushed to wrap things up in a bow and send the viewers home happy.What a shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"HopeNot","review":"With the leading actors and potential story line, I thought it would be a bit more \\"quipy\\" and entertaining.

Meryl's character is barely intelligent, Tommy Lee Jones, was not even given that dignity. Steve is playing the passive therapist. Give them some lines.

What Hope Springs presents is a story about two boring old fuddy duddies who were once two young boring fuddy duddies who never had much passion or spark to begin with. Meryly Streep was sexier in her Julia Childs' role, although she and Tommy Lee Jones deliver well drawn comedic profiles and make the movie watchable, even funny at times. Steve Carrel is wasted as the shrink. Too bad.

I will take note before watching other $1.99 movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"How does this film \\"hope\\" to rekindle any romance?","review":"I will give this film 2 stars only because Meryl Streep managed to stay \\"luminous\\" during this epic fail of a mature romance/comedy/drama feature film. This film will most likely have a hard time finding its audience. There are too many cringe-worthy sexual references and scenes for the older crowd and painfully slow pacing for the younger crowd. I fit into the middle-aged crowd and let's just say that I would never attempt what Meryl Streep's character attempts to do in a movie theatre. Awwwwwkward.I had high \\"hopes\\" that this film could be a good \\"spring\\"board for rekindling marital intimacy, but would a couple (in this case, primarily the wife initiates the crash course) really find intimacy once again by racing through the romance part of a marital relationship only to jump right into acting out intimate sexual fantasies - with no comfortable middle ground?

The story starts out pretty realistic and hard. Then, it just feels like they were running out of time, so jump to the happy ending. Howevet they couldn't cut the awkward attempts at oral sex. No way should this movie be rated PG-13. It should easily be R."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful.","review":"How did this get rated PG-13? The sexual content was through the roof.I thought Hope Springs looked like a cute, funny movie about a husband and wife falling in love again. And maybe it was - but I sure didn't get that far. I think my husband and I made it about 25 minutes into the movie before turning it off. I don't really care to watch random people \\"exploring themselves\\" or learning how to give their husbands oral sex.One thing is for sure - Tommy Lee Jones and Meryl Streep do a great job at acting uncomfortable. Although they probably didn't HAVE to act during those scenes. Yikes.Glad I rented instead of buying it, but still sad about being out $4. I could have used that to watch a clean, decent movie.

I liked that the end didn't leave me hanging and there was a good outcome. Steve Carell in a non-comedic role was a big surprise and he pulled it off perfect. I don't think this movie is appropriate for young kids, or even teens. It's a movie for mature adults and those who can handle the truth, and need a lesson about what life can become if you don't do something about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"very cute","review":"good message good acting steve correl in a not comedy roll was more than passable i need five more woods in order to submit"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent movie","review":"An excellent movie with top-notch actors.

That being said, I checked this film out at my local library thinking it might be entertaining. Boy was I wrong! Most of this film is devoted to Meryl Streep and Tommy Lee Jones' characters exploring intimacy with one another to salvage their marriage that's in the dumps. I can't begin to express how uncomfortable I was in seeing these aging stars try to develop chemistry with one another. It was pathetic at best and not something, as a viewer that's enticing to see.

There wasn't enough comedy in it and it was more serious. Yet Tommy lee jones and meryl streep did an excellent job in this movie they played the parts really well.

Otherwise it's not one I personally would ever watch again.

But of all the films I've seen this one get's closer to the feel and action better than all the rest, the dialog and action is amazing to those people like me who look these films for their artistic value as well as content.

It is an eclectic collection of prose, poetry and artwork, all in celebration of the frog. This is not intended for the reader looking for practical information about frogs, but it is still educational none-the-less. It is fanciful work aimed towards entertaining the frog-appreciating individual. Charming poems, interesting artwork that includes frogs with a historical perspective (including frogs in medieval art), and a collection prose related to frogs grace the pages of this book. Remarkably entertaining, this book is very well researched and nicely organized. Numerous books celebrate more widely popular animals like cats and dogs, but this book is truly unique.

I love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Macabre","review":"Be forewarned: This book, while perhaps intellectually interesting for the right (horror-loving) audience, is extremely macabre. It would better be called, \\"Toads are from Hell.\\" It is not a book for the unsuspecting reader who is a nature- or amphibian-lover or a person interested in the depiction of animals in art and literature. Most of the artwork and writings presented here focus on the association of toads with disease and moral corruption --- think grotesque images from Bosch.

Unfortunately, it failed to deliver. It was a little boring, talking about blocks and common things like Jacob's latter. There were some pictures, but they were of kind of boring stuff, like a disk on a string that spins when you tighten the string.Overall there were too many common and boring things without much about each one, just the stuff you would already know.At the back there WAS a cool activity about spinning a disk with a picture on the top half of one side and the bottom half of the other to form one picture when spun, however there was only one activity and the rest of the book was lacking.I wouldn't recommend buying it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Battery Pack","review":"Like the charger, not sure how long it will last.

Many people also own vicious dogs for protection - fortunately, those in my neighborhood are behind fences. Nevertheless, when you walk pass their house, they growl & jump at the fence as if though the only thing protecting you from them tearing you to pieces is the fence.I tried this Dog Chaser on a walk in my neighborhood during which I encountered about 20 aggressive dogs, both strays and those behind fences. It quieten two or three of them, but didn't faze the others at all.I was so hoping this device would give me freedom & peace of mind to explore here, but unfortunately, I won't be biking or walking around much in this neighborhood...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy!","review":"The 'Dog Chaser' is no longer available, it has been replaced by the 'Super Dog Chaser' (according to Techtonian). This new product has flashing lights as well as ultrasonic sound. Problem is, this unit does NOT produce any ultrasonic sound. I own a Dog Dazer device that is 50% effective on dogs and 100% effective on cats. The Super Dog Chaser had no effect on dogs and even cats had ZERO reaction. Cats are very, very sensitive to sounds so it is obvious that this device does not produce any sound at all. Do NOT buy this item. Techtonian did provide a refund for the item (but not shipping, either way). Techtonian did have a very polite and responsive customer service department.

We don't do any really heavey construction so for us they work out well. Even the terry cloth on the top side of the thumb comes in handy to wipe the sweat from the brow. My first 2 pairs fit fine and were great. My 3rd pair had some glue on the inside holding down the thread which rubbed against my palm and was quite bothersome but it wore and before long I didn't even notice it. I have used these for minor construction to working on equipment with small screws. Even if your hands get soaking wet the gloves still fit well where a full leather glove has a tendacy to stretch and want to fall off. I am ordering 10 more pairs right now!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Finger & thumb fell apart the 1st day...","review":"The first day I used these I was hanging drywall with screws. About 2 hours into it the DuraClad on the thumb and index finger of the left glove were worn through (something that doesn't happen with good leather gloves) and the seams were coming apart. So, I wrapped 'em with duct tape and that did the trick.I liked the velcro at the wrist and the fit was good for my hands, but I doubt I'll buy 'em again. I can buy three pairs of good leather gloves at Costco for less than one pair of these, i.e. more glove-life for the money witout the hassle. If they get the price point down maybe I'd buy again.Using several layers of duct tape and gluing down the various pieces of DuraClad as soon as they started coming off, the gloves lasted about a month and a half. Maybe it should be not-very-durable-DuraClad. I guess for lighter duty they'd work well, but not for remodel work I put 'em through."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor quality","review":"I used to count one ironclad gloves, but for the last three years or so, the quality of workmanship has fallen off dramatically.

They were comfortable, the grip was good, and I enjoyed the good tight fit. I found they gave me the dexterity to do things that I couldn't do with my regular cheapo work gloves. I did find myself having to take them off every once in a while for tasks that demanded a little extra dexterity, and in those cases, the wriststrap/tight closure was kind of a hassle.

Maybe I am a bit sullen about it because when I was in high school a boy I knew had a party at his house when his parents were away on vacation, and the kids did so much damage that it made both the national news and the Reader's Digest. Jack, in this movie, was lucky that didn't happen to his house. The only good I can say about this movie is that it could serve as some half-baked warning to teens to not host parties when their parents are away. Beyond that, it uses about every trick in the book to break traditional values of honesty, sexuality, etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smaller than advertised","review":"The photo shows a rectangular mouse pad and the dimensions given are 9 x 12.8 inches.

From his scathing treatment of the Bush administration to his nutty faux paean to Anne Coulter Rollins, is by turns witty brutal and unforgiving. If you are already a Rollins fan you'll find his explorations into human darkness as (if not more) compelling and powerful as they always have been. Those new to Rollins work, hold on and enjoy the ride. Overall this is a good read with tight pacing, an interesting structure and the mental image of Barbara Bush saying \\"Boo-YA!\\" alone is worth the price of admission."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great looking system","review":"I bought this for my elderly aunt and it looks really good and fits in any decor.

When I asked him why, he pointed to a drawing of the crocodiles, and said \\"sharp teeth.\\" A similar book that he prefered is \\"One Monkey Too Many.\\" I found the rhymes somewhat forced. The message is one greedy monkey can outwit many crocodiles to help get what he wants -- not exactly a good role model for a young child. One page of crocodiles with chicken pox only reminded my son of the shot the doctor gave him to avoid the pox. In the end, the monkey does not deliver what he promised to the crocodiles -- how many crocodiles are there in the sea?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Issues....","review":"Someone please explain to me the issues that M Night Shamaylan has with the Christian Church.

This is particularly offensive seeing that he is a non-Christian."},{"rating":"2","title":"One to look for!","review":"You won't find this movie in a prominant place at your local video store. you will have to really LOOK for it. But when you find it,rent it. This movie is enchanting, funny, moving and somehow profound. This is from the guy who wrote and directed THE SIXTH SENSE and WIDE AWAKE has a few things in common with SENSE: it deals with grief in real emotional terms, it has an INCREDIBLE performance by a young actor (Joseph Cross)and a neat little \\"surpirse\\" at the end.Seek this one out and share it with the kids.

When it was my turn to meet him, he looked me in the eye, asked me questions, and listened to me intently. He also signed the bottom of my K Custom Session ride cymbal (from the line that he helped design with Zildjian). Then as I started to walk away with my wife, Steve motioned for her to come back so he could meet and speak with her as well. He expressed this genuine interest in everyone he met at the event. He is truly a wonderful person. Steve employed a warm, conversational tone throughout the clinic that followed. He communicated his ideas and techniques in understandable ways, and he demonstrated them on the drumset. While watching him break down some of his grooves, a sense of awe engulfed me; yet at the same time I felt inspired and empowered to become an innovative drummer in my own right.

I calculated that the machine paid for itself in 6 months, after not having to make the daily stop at Starbucks anymore. The hot water dispenser is great for making tea, soup, instant oatmeal. Definately read and follow all instructions, especially when it comes to cleaning the machine. At first the milk steam/froth procedure may seem confusing, but once you get it it is easy. This machine is so worth it with the superior quality of espresso or capuccino as compared to standard brewed coffee.

But this is a great album. I do not remember paying $30 for my CD tho and I did get it from Amazon. I do have to say that I had a chance to see Hank Snow in person. He, Ernest Tubbs, and Roy Acuff were touring to encourage listeners of country radio to support playing of older singers on their stations. Sad, the changing times.

The paint chips were actually getting in his mouth and this was only after about 2 days of using it.

The very sight of this painting conjures up the scent of a rose garden on a warm spring day. Look and let your eyes delight in the fresh and vivid colors of the picture: the deep turquoise of the lady's medieval gown, the blush and strawberry pink of the roses, the green of the leaves, the shining silver of the beads in the lady's auburn hair. Notice too how masterfully Waterhouse has rendered her hands, with their exceptionally long and slender fingers; one rests, slightly tense, on the wall, while the other curves gracefully around the stem of a plump rose. Reproduced here in a large standard size, THE SOUL OF THE ROSE is an essential print to decorate the homes of Waterhouse admirers and/or rose-lovers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it!","review":"I can't imagine why this game was produced.

And while I agree, it is 21st century characters, it still does bring history to life especially for the younger grades. I think the grade level of 5-8 is high. I think that age group would be bored with this. Although the writing is at that level which is making it enjoyable for me to read.I highly recommend it as a read aloud with grades K-3.

The action comes only in small sections and it does not further the original story in any significant way.

I sort of stand by this movie out of loyalty to the awesome concept that is \\"30 Days\\", especially when dealing with horror-haters! But truly, it didn't have the first movie's razor-like clarity of plot and effects. The plot got muddled; it didn't cover half of what I got from the novel. The effects got sloppy and repetitive, the characters vague. There were still some of the chilling, gorgeous visuals, and a good sense of vampire ruthlessness.

The local FBI man is in cahoots with the vampires as he desires to be one. A group of vampire hunters meets Stella in her room and asks her to join them (along with a turncoat vampire) to go into the underground tunnels of L.A. and hunt down and kill Lilith, the vampire queen. Lilith speaks a strange tongue with subscripts, until the very end when she can suddenly speak English. The acting wasn't all that great. This is another movie which uses the high tech \\"special effect\\" of jerking the camera around to make us feel the terror of the scene (yawn!) because the script can't do it.Lilith, in ancient folklore, fed off the blood on infants.

This sequel, based in Los Angeles, fails to recreate that feeling so whenever the characters are not in danger the movie just drags.Instead of trying to create its' own original elements as the first film did, \\"Dark Days\\" borrows some from such movies as \\"John Carpenter's: Vampires\\" and \\"Underworld\\" and leaves you feeling like you've seen all this before."},{"rating":"1","title":"30 Days of NIght 2","review":"I loved the first movie but this one is a huge let down.

I understand it was a smaller budget film but this was just inexcusably bad. the writing, the dialogue, all of it.I'm actually disappointed that I could have bought the original on blu-ray for less than I paid for this. it's like they tried to frankenstein together \\"30 days of night\\", \\"Daybreakers\\" and \\"Blade trinity\\" into a coherent storyline using the cheapest actors they could find and get them to play characters that always make the worst decision possible.Save your money, watch it online before you buy it and I don't see how this is getting 5-star reviews but clearly those reviewers saw something worthwhile I did not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money!!!!","review":"What a waste of 92 minutes! I've been awaiting the release of this sequel since i viewed the first. I loved 30 Days of Night, but Dark Days was such a disappointment.

The vampires didn't look the same, and regular bullets could fatally wound them. The story line made no sense and the end... well even more stupid. If you must watch this movie please don't purchase. RENT!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"30 Days of terrible","review":"30 Days of Night: Dark Days tries to be a woman vampire action film in certain parts. It has dull women both as vampires, and vampire hunters. They are so tedious to watch though. It is filled with impossible, ridiculous and even painful battles in Los Angeles and vampire massacres, many with no explanation since none could be hoped for.The vampire hunting characters, one of whom we recognized as being played by a member of the cast of \\"Lost,\\" launch poorly conceived or planned attacks on vampires in dark ghettos. They do diametrically reversed and polar opposite things and get into harm's way so idiotically that you, too, will be quivering then scoffing and finally puking every minute.The acting is terrible, the script is stupid, and the vampires are not even scary. Mia Kirshner is definitely miscast as the evil vampire leader, she's so boring.If you're looking for to be frightened, you won't really find it in 30 Days of Night: Dark Days."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Great","review":"I did enjoy the first 30 Days of Night. It isn't an all time favorite, but I thought it was effective and well made. This direct to dvd low budget sequel just doesn't hit on any level. Stella the only survivor of the first encounter(different actress in the part) goes around the country trying to tell people through lectures that vampires killed 98 people in Alaska and not an oil fire mishap. I'm not sure why the highly organized vampires wouldn't just kill her for trying to expose them. Instead they wait until she meets up with a group of vampire hunters ala Blade II before they decide to try and take her out. The acting is very flat and the characters don't garner much sympathy, the vampires and rules of the vampires have changed from the first movie. If you loved the first movie I know you will want to just make a blind buy, but I think everyone should rent this before purchasing."},{"rating":"1","title":"30 Days of Night: Dark Days","review":"In short, this movie SUCKS!

I found this very useful and a lot of features. With the price itself, which is still cost me less with its useful features. Here in the Philippines, you cannot buy anything like this. So, get one now!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Recording Time listed misleading, 60 sec max per message","review":"The Recording Time listed (14 minutes max) is misleading because individual incoming messages are limited to a 60 second maximum and then it cuts your caller off! Your outgoing message is also limited to a 30 second maximum. Neither of these restrictions was listed in the description; I didn't find this out until I read the owner's manual upon receipt. These restrictions made this product unsuitable for my purposes and I was very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay away from this product","review":"Very bad product as others have said. We've had this phone for over a year and it's been nothing but problems. Poor phone quality, frustrating anwsering machine, not able to use remote access feature. Now it has a really loud background hum. Final straw. We will replace shortly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid this phone","review":"This phone comes with good features, but it performs very poorly. Answering machine messages are virtually unintelligible, and it is very difficult to hear and understand people through the handset. I wish I never bought this phone. If you think the price is too good to be true, you're right."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for","review":"This phone is garbage. I bought it because it had speakerphone and answering machine for $30. But, I had to return it because:1) Reception was terrible2) Speakerphone does not really work well. When the person on the other end stops talking, there is absolute silence (rather than room noise). So, the voice is so choppy that the speakerphone feature is absolutely useless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never Understimate the Passion of a Spanish Woman","review":"If you can read this in the original Spanish it's worth a look into the mind and heart of the legendary Evita. Her wish to belong to history fulfilled in a life that was dedicated to enforcing her own brand of social justice, albeit at the expense of the Argentine Treasury. All her hurt and anger ravaged on her country from the Casa Rosada. There are so few women who have managed to achieve so much with so little. If Evita had just been a trophy wife/arm candy of General Peron ... she would not have accomplished much. The reason for her historical legacy is that she wasn't a gold digger ... she was a woman on a mission... she worked 18 hours a day with her Foundation ... and her workaholism killed her. Evita had a cause, she was not an opportunist, she was misguided in her approach to social justice in Argentina, but she was hardly lying back and enjoying her wealth and status."},{"rating":"2","title":"#1 punk band","review":"Hey dudes!!

First off the pad provides very little support because when you put your wrist on it the little bit of gel that is in there goes to the side. (and there is a very small amount of gel) Leaving you back on a hard surface. Also it provides a very small surface for you to move the mouse around. To top that the very hard smooth surface gives the mouse ball no grip and you find yourself moving the mouse but it is just sliding on the surface.IF YOU OWN AN OPTICAL MOUSE IT WILL NOT WORK on this mousepad.

I was wrong. All of the writing is repeated word for word. They used a different illustrator this time around which proved to be a big mistake since all of the new images seem grotesque in comparison to the original ones. All in all, it was an utter disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rocio Durcal..The Best keeps getting Better!!","review":"I have always admired Rocio Durcal for her amazing voice. Her last 5 productions have been have been terrific and what makes them so great is that each one is like a little different world. In this, her most recent production. Rocio demonstrates once again that she is the very best and the Ultimate Queen of Spanish music. My favorites from this album are \\"Sombras Nada Mas\\" of course, \\"Caminito\\", \\"Nostalgias\\", \\"A media Luz\\" and \\"En esta tarde Gris\\". I love this album, I have heard it 10 times today already and I still want more!! She has a harmonious voice, I am so proud to be her fan because she is truly the best, and the best thing is that she doesnt have to do a \\"crossover\\" like other artists to prove that she is the very best. I hope that she records many, many more albums in years and years to come"},{"rating":"2","title":"ahora tangos ole......","review":"its to no surprise ms.durcal would choose to cover tangos with a mariachi twist... rocio has done her native flamencos, pop ballads, rancheras, boleros and everything else musically speaking.entre tangos y mariachis.. a totally complete and gorgeous production from bebu silvetti and rocio on this thier second production together.rocio with her incredible voice and phraising makes like rocio and tangos where made for one another.caminito, sombras ..nada mas and vida mia are just three of the ten great songs on this musical adventure. rocio all i can say is whats next? i am already excited just to think the incredible musical voyage only a performer like rocio durcal could take us on..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its strange but i like it! lol","review":"I got it on a trip in D.C also and i remember the person asking for a donation even though he said it was free.It is very strange music and everyone who has listened to it doesn't like it, but i like it a little.I can imagine it in a fast pace move or a horror movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"In a word, I would describe the music as \\"cacophonous\\"","review":"I was also on a class trip to DC in 2003 and received a copy of this CD for free (maybe even from the artist himself). It's terrible. Even getting it for free was paying too much. I'm almost willing to pay someone to take this off my hands! Unfortunately, that would require me going back to my parents house, digging through boxes of things to hopefully find it, and then sending it to you along with whatever we agree on for the price. Even then, it's still probably worth it just to be rid of this awful, awful CD.I would give this CD zero stars, but Amazon won't let me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same Here!","review":"WOW! I thought me and my friends were the only ones who knew about this guy. We were on a class trip to DC in 2003 and the street vendor told us he was going on Warp Tour so we bought it...what a mistake! However, it has provided us laughs over the years. We still bust it out from time to time. I think its funny that other people were also infected by this virus from the same zombie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Saves you from cuts and shards","review":"I bought these gloves because I had a large metal framing project going on. These gloves saved my hands from the usual cuts associated from working with metal studs and track. They were especially helpful because you could grab even the smallest screw out of your pouch without having to stop and remove the gloves. There was some fraying of the seams, but nothing that harmed the integrity of the glove. These gloves are probably not for large demo projects, but nothing short of heavy leather is. I would definitely buy another pair when these wear out."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't be fooled, these gloves suck!","review":"after three weeks of purchase, wearing them for only 3 1/2 days of continuous use, the stiching started to come apart. these gloves are a complete waste of money. i normally buy the blue vinyl gloves and they last 4-6 months of continuous use, unless i abuse them or use in a circumstance i know will tear them. but better the gloves than the hand. with the blue vinyl gloves, i can pick up a washer on a concrete slab. i've also bought leather gloves for 11.00 and cut off the fingers i use most often, just like the ironclad gloves offer. leather feels better than the ironclad. these gloves are just a gimic-gadget, not a quality, durable product, at least that has been my personal experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ironclad? Doubt it.","review":"I used these gloves for about 2 weeks, delivering US mail, not framing houses. The thread on the middle finger of the right glove failed and the glove finger came apart.Save your money. Go to Home Depot and purchase a cheaper pair of Stanley gloves. They don't fall apart so easily."},{"rating":"1","title":"too small","review":"These are very small for a x large..

The first pair of them had a blow out in the finger within the first week. I contacted the company which said that they would send me out a warranty card but never did. I decided to try again hoping that maybe I just got a bad pair. The second pair lasted longer but only about a month and a half in total, before serious tears started happening in the palms, the velcro strap came off one of them, and several other minor holes. These gloves are great while they last, but they are pretty expensive to keep replacing. I do remodeling, which doesnt always have me working with brand new material, but nevertheless I think I am going to try a different brand at this point."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disposable Gloves!!","review":"I purchased these gloves based on a couple of good reviews, ignoring the few bad ones. The gloves were very comfortable right out of the box. They live up to the manufacturers advertising. Unfortunately, they lasted for four days of moderately hard wood working. Not construction ... wood working. These are expensive for disposable gloves."},{"rating":"1","title":"great concept, poor performance","review":"Didn't get a week's worth of work out of these before they started to unravel.

I have already recommended this book to half a dozen friends. It is worth every penny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book for beginners","review":"This book is terrific for anyone thinking of trying winemaking. The author takes the beginner through the steps for a basic wine recipe, using few pieces of equipment. Then, for the brave who wish to continue, Garvey adds complexity to each successive recipe, leaving champagne-making for the end. Terrific book with great recipes and easy to follow tips. Just enough humor to encourage new winemaker, and plenty of recipes for the gardner with leftover produce -- from rasberries to potatoes"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Grape Wine Book","review":"Only reason I am giving two stars is i bought this on the premise i was going to learn about making wine with grapes which is popular in the New York/Ontario area where i live. The author is more in love with wine from fruit. I have to admit it intriqued me, but, I think the title should be Making Fruit wine or something like it. Out side of that good book on basic wine making tips, I learned alot, just not about making wine from grapes.This is more of a book for apple wine or berry wine, than forMerlot or Cabernet..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice intro to winemaking","review":"This book does a good job at giving basic techniques and recipes for making fruit wines. Don't use there mead recipe though. Also, they mention boiling the corks to serilize then which is a no-no that will give you crumbly corks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great beginner winemaking book, however...","review":"The title should be \\"The Joy of Home Fruit Winemaking\\" as it's really not about Grape wine... it's really focused almost completely on fruit wines. However, most of it applies to grape wine as well. I only give it 4 stars because the title and cover are misleading, but the book is excellent. I would recommend it to anyone interested in home winemaking whether you're interested in grape wine or fruit wine. It's well written in casual style that is very accessible and actually quite entertaining. I felt as though a friend was giving me a lesson in something new and providing insight and tips you probably wouldn't get in a more formal winemaking book or education. Highly highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good starter book","review":"I started making wine with this book. It covers home winemaking very well and even walks you through making the first batch of wine. It has many recipes and covers ciders, champagnes. The tips and tricks that the author gives help the beginner winemaker new ideas and newer tricks to use. I've recommended this to a lot of people I know who want to get into it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"For the new fruit wine maker, this is the book! Nice prose and a relaxing method of walking you through the art of fruit wine making, this book has great recipes and makes it a snap.The first recipe is one that you can do with a minimal amount of investment (<$15 nowadays) and gets you thinking about and understanding the process. Then the details the equipment and additives and then gets you going on making more complicated fruit wines (\\"complicated\\" maybe isn't the correct word as these are pretty darned easy).If you got some fruit - and you like some wine ..this book is a great instructional ...and a nice evening read by itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent and easy to read","review":"Harry Sheehy wrote an great book, here.

I hear things in familiar music that I've never heard before. I take it with me biking and it performs under all conditions without skipping. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent machine for jogging and other light excercise","review":"This machine lives up to its billing. It delivers high quality sound, without skipping during normal usage. The only drawbacks are that it must be used with the neoprene belt, which is included. The belt is adjustable, closes with a backpack type clip, and fits snug when new. However, the neoprene belt started ripping after less than six months of use. Also, the belt must be worn in front when jogging. If kept on the hip, the machine would skip. All in all, it is the only machine that I've ever been able to jog with, and worth owning."},{"rating":"2","title":"review for panasonic portable cd player","review":"I love this CD player.

I put them in and naturally, they don't work. After a call to Panasonic, I find out you have to use only Panasonic brand Ni-CD batteries which are available in about 10 stores nationwide. You have to order them through Panasonic for an additional $13.

Cut 8 holes, and this tool worked fine considering the cost.My experience was:1. take your time and be very attentive to keep the cutter square to the hole, tilting the drill, even a little, can cause the cutter to grab. Even when careful, it did grab with me, just go slow, it helps.2. Yes it has a little dust-it is sheetrock people. I had my wife hold the vacuum cleaner hose at the cutter and it helped some, but I really was not surprised nor disappointed at the dust-use drop cloths. The cheap pie plate dust catcher had alot of dust in it, so it does work.3. Yes you can buy a better tool, but not for the price. I am all about saving a dollar, and having a cutter that will adjust to various sizes and do a job I seldom have to do for $23 is worth it.4.
