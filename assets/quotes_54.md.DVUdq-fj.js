In this book, Harding does just that to the reader - at least he attempts to have the reader do it to him/herself.

This book is written from a Zen Buddhist perspective, however, Harding pulls from Christianity, Hinduism, science, and other fields to drive his point home. Though this book will not bring you the enlightenment that Harding seems to have received, it will help you to view enlightenment from a unique perspective.This book is short and sweet, and Harding comes across as honest and compassionate.

Miles is an amazing story and life to read about.My only problem with the book was that Miles was so hung up on the Black/White racial thing that it got old listening to him rant and rage for pages at at time, especially at the end. I get where he's coming from and the age in which he grew up in but it's gets a little bit old after while. I would rather have learned more about him personally then read about all his problems with the White race.

For example:\\"'Bird of the Cool' became a collector's item, I think, out of a reaction to Bird and Dizzy's music. Bird and Diz play this hip, real fast thing, and if you weren't a fast listener, you couldn't catch the humor or the feeling in their music. Their musical sound wasn't sweet, and it didn't have harmonic lines that you could easily hum out on the street with your girlfriend trying to get over with a kiss. Bebop didn't have the humanity of Duke Ellington. It didn't even have that recognizable thing. Bird and Diz were great, fantastic, challenging--but they weren't sweet. But 'Birth of the Cool' was different because you could hear everything and hum it also.\\"MILES could have been 200 pages shorter and only focused on Davis' thoughts about music--perhaps as a musical memoir?--and it would have said a whole lot more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Miles The Autobiography","review":"I read about 25% of the text.

I wanted to find out more about this gifted musician and found alot of insight into Miles Davis. While I don't agree with some of his opinions, I admire him for his bluntness of his beliefs. I especially enjoyed reading about his collaboration with Gil Evans and how such immortal classics as \\"Sketches of Spain\\", \\"Miles Ahead\\", and \\"Porgy and Bess\\" were developed and made into classics of Jazz. His opinions about fellow Jazz musicians are not sugar coated in any degree, either Miles liked you or he didn't, no middle ground. Yet, he admits his flaws and weaknesses, but makes no apologies for his past and the way he lived. His views of music critics and race relations are bitter, yet those were his experiences as he saw it. This biography of Miles in my opinion is the best insight into the musician and the man printed so far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really great book.","review":"A lot of jazz history inside it.

In this book he says a lot about the jazz developing, the backstage, drugs, racial problems in the US and some very good stories about some of the greatest characters who cohabitated with him in the jazz scene such as Parker, Dizzy, Hawkins, Max Roach, Mingus, Coltrane, Gil Evans, Clark Terry and many others.Everybody who is interested in jazz should read it! A must have, for sure."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing !","review":"excellent choice if you want to know the true story. it is amazing how well written (for a musician) it is and how Miles remembered things with an awesome precission."},{"rating":"2","title":"MT Fuji is the highest peak in Japan","review":"Mt Fuji is the highest peak in Japan and this recording hits the highest peak in performances for Albert.

Nice illustrations. Looks good on my 10\\" tablet.

In addition, the book is not well structured and chapters are spread out haphazardly throughout the book, not following any logical order. The chapters themselves are not organized, lack the recapitulating tables that the previous editions had, have little references listed and most of the times no references at all. Obviously written quickly and hastily by a mercenary of authors, it doesn't live up to the hype."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gorgeous","review":"This is one of Chanticleer's best recordings. Their vocal sound is splendid and the pieces presented are impressive. The quality of compositions testify to the individual strengths of these largely unknown composers, the general power of Baroque choral compositional techniques, and probably, the high quality of the choirs in the provincial Mexican cathedrals for whom these pieces were written. A wonderful exploration of a largely unknown aspect of the Baroque."},{"rating":"2","title":"Musical splendor of Mexico in the 18th century","review":"Maybe the musical sophistication achieved in Mexico during the XVIII century is not well known. This recording will go a long way toward exposing the greatness of Mexican composers of that time. This recording was recommended to me by a PhD musicologist as an example of the excellent polyphony written by Mexican authors. Some pieces are a capella and of an older, Renaissance style; others with a baroque ensemble reflect a later, baroque style of composition. This CD comes with excellent program notes explaining the history and the styles of the two composers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Barely at all good.","review":"This video was a big disappointment to me. The singers were good, but the rest is not good at all. I wanted this video mainly to see Ruggero Raimondi as Count Almaviva, but there were problems with his singing. He sounded very weak in this video probably because he is older in this than he is in the others that he is in. Heinz Zednik also wasn't a very good Basilio in this production. He seemed very strange, & not at all like he was as Monostatos in The Magic Flute. Most of the other characters were a little better, but there were lots of other problems in this video. Two really good arias are omitted, there is only one intermission, & to top it all off, there are no subtitles! Instead of subtitles there is a book with translations in English, German, & French that you have to stare at the whole time. I really wouldn't reccomend this video, but if you still want to pick this one, that is perfectly fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Large High Quality Bag","review":"I have this bag for my HDR HC7 and all accessories.

The bad editing and writing, horrific acting, and awkward camera angles will have you in stitches. In one shot, it looked like they switched from film to video. Don't get me wrong I knew this film was low budget but come on they could have done better. It seemed as if they had a budget of $20.00 and half of that looked like it was spent on the food.

Although it can be a bit tricky to get this bracelet close by yourself.The stones are delicate looking and oval shaped with smaller round stones placed at 3 points in the bracelet.From a distance, this looks like the real thing, but all in all it is just a fun piece of jewelry on the classier side of costume jewelry.

It is markedly distinct from those of Schubert and Beethoven in certain respects, and it is in this that makes it successful. The mood is distilled Brahms, yet we do not find the elemental forces at work here. Instead we find the reflective, particularly in the 3rd movement which is immediately involving and essentially transcendent if you permit my use of such a vague term. The Alban Berg Quartet are very successful in interpreting Brahms here, and they can be recommended without reservation, as can the quartets for any who long for the tranquil genius of Brahms not to be found in his symphonic output."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great features, bad sound quality","review":"I received this cd player for Xmas, i was really excited about it.

The design also leaves much to be desired as it has too many buttons (some of which it turned out are just decoration) and the lay-out is very confusing.

Rather than taping, I now wear running socks inside them to prevent the blisters where the fins bind and rub. As I lap swim at least 2 miles in 1 hour per day, the on and off is a hassle. Wore Churchills for 30 years, but the heel strap wouldn't take any more repairs. I would have been better off paying twice+ as much and getting a known product.

Oh, and if you miss something, it doesn't say, \\"you were early\\" or \\"you were late\\" or anything, it just says FOUL. It's quite frustrating.

The sheer variety alone makes this a title a) worth the money, and b) good for replay. The graphics are nice and the music is pleasant enough, and the physics are fairly accurate and challenging.

The mini games just felt too short, too simple, or too bland.Mario & Sonic Olympic is the perfect mix. The mini games are reasonable length ( approx 1 - 2 minute each), tons of different characters with truely different skills, not just the graphics, even the Miis are used perfectly here.

Do not get discouraged at first. I know a couple of people who gave up very early on this game saying it was too difficult. Once you get the hang of the games none of them are devastatingly difficult. Only draw back was having to win all of the circuits to unlock all the different games.

Mom, Dad and my 9 year old daughter.My son has had no troubles with most of the games (although there are a few that are just too difficult i.e rowing, trampoline).The game is great and with many little events, awesome to keep the little one's entertained!The one flaw, when we first got the game, was learning how to play them. There are not very detailed directions. It took a lot of hit and miss on a few events before realizing how to really do them!Buy the game! It is worth it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"So bad we shut it off mid-competition","review":"We rented this game from the video store to play over Christmas break, specifically for the multi-player competition. We (three seasonsed gamers) found the game play clunky and difficult - the responiveness to the wiimote seemed off, and the actual game controls were arbitrary and annoying. We played it for an hour (and were constantly forced to choose our miis as players, each time we chose a new game - something that wii sports or wii play doesn't so!) and finally gave up mid-game, we didn't even care enough to finish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe on a different platform . .","review":"On the Wii it just stinks. The controls are unresponsive compared to any and all other wii games. Each time it was time to \\"GO\\" there would be a lag in the control to go and so it was hard to be competitive. I hated it. It could have been a really great game if it played correctly on the wii, but as it is I would rate it a zero and caution anyone not to waste their money on this. I would toss it in the can even if it was free. Seriously, it's that bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Bad Mario Party with Sonic","review":"This game tries to hard to be Mario Party.

I found that I had to shake my controller so much that I could have broken my arm just to get it to work. And even with all that shaking it wasn't enough shaking anyway. Some of the games like the javilen and dream race and the swimming one was ok. I played with my brother and he won a race and was on the phone at the end so he didn't even really have to do anything just to play it. Others require you to push combo's of button and shake at the same time and sometimes it just got frustrating. Then theres the loading. It loads the area then shows the scene and then goes to each character to tell you who you are. There's just too much flashy stuff before getting to the playing. Just get to the playing part of the game.Over all I didn't like this game, rent it first if you like it then get it.I actually like the winter one better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games.","review":"I have two super mario fans & for the 1st time they said they don't like it soI had to try it & I think the game is frustrating..not my kinda game..

For whatever reason when you play with more than one player in Mario & Sonic it will not save records or medals awarded. IE, if you win a gold and set a new world records in sculling with two or more people playing at once, none of these scores will be recorded. So much for competition... Competition brings the best out in people and Nintendo failed to realize this which destroys a lot of the fun in competing and suceeding..Not to mention no Wifi play, just uploading scores which is nice but these can only be viewed from the game itself. There is no way to check your scoring as in Guitar Hero... Save your money and buy the DS version of this, at least you expect that on a smaller more inexpensive version of the game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun competition","review":"I bought this game as a gift for my boyfriend who is 20. i wasnt sure if hed like it but once we played together it is his new favorite wii game. he recommends it to his friends and talks about it very highly.

It has a very low level of distortion at very high volumes.The loudness control is great. It allows you to add a much fuller sound when listening at lower volumes.It does what it is supposed to do, and what I bought it for.It replaces my old Yamaha reciever that was almost the same except put out only 75W per channel.

Since I live within a few miles of Sturtevant, I brought the clipper set to the Andis factory to see about getting them repaired. Instead they took my information and gave me a replacement on the spot.The replacement sounded different than the original, much quieter and slower-sounding, but still it was apparently the same model. It worked well as far as I knew, but recently I tried using it to trim the hair on my head. Beard hair, being far coarser, gets cut fairly easily, but cutting head hair using anything but the shortest attachments is virtually impossible. Using the one-inch comb, the clippers were more likely to push the hairs out of the way than to actually cut them!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good for cat hair","review":"I bought this to use on my 2 cats, one medium-haired, the other long-haired.

However, upon first use I felt compelled to write my own review. Out of the box the clippers were down right dull. In fact, I had to dig out my old Wahl clippers, the unit I was hoping to replace with the Andis, to go back over the hair to make it presentable. The clipped hair that was produced with the 'second-over' using the Wahl provided me with confirmation that the Andis did a mediocre job.I would also note that the Andis got very hot at the business end. This is not something I've experienced in the past with other clippers. Warm? Yes. Hot? No. Maybe the heat is evidence that the clippers are not working properly but I expected better out of the box."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hair clippers","review":"I have arthritis and felt it was too heavy for my hands.

These three series all follow the same parameter- people who need to survive in a post-apocalyptic environment. For all you fan boys, there is not full nudity (at least not anything you would expect), but the language and themes are adult enough to entertain. This book is nothin spectacular, but it is well priced, fast paced, and one of those series that just keeps on putting out issues, because it can dangle you forever, long after the theme gets stale (like Preacher). Like I said, if you like Walking Dead or Y, you should probably get this too.

But when I tried it I discovered 2 things. First off your legs have to be at a 90 degree angle in order to pedal without it moving all over the place (which means you have to have an adjustable office chair or put phone books on a normal one). And when I finally get settled on it no matter how hard of a setting it's on it only burns about a calorie a minute.This bike might be great for arm workouts because it doesn't move as much on the table and it can offer a lot of resistance (though I only tried it for a few minutes) but definitely not for your legs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good little bike","review":"For some reason the electronic control panel doesn't work on my bike.

It worked for a week and then it wouldn't read any CD's. The drive unit is a pain. In order to get the CD's out of the unit, you have to continually close the door, hit skip disk, open it back up, and repeat this ridiculous operation until your CD is in the proper location to remove it. The tuner reception is awful, I didn't have a chance to use the cassete deck, but I guess if you don't plan on listening to CD's or use the tuner you might be interested in the RCA.

According to Amazon's product details, it says Manufacturer's age: 12 months and up and Our recommended age: 12 months - 4 years. This is NOT correct! The box for these bath toys says ages 3+ because it's choking hazard! This is the reason why we are returning it. I am not waiting 2 years to use a bath toy set that I thought was age appropriate for babies.2. The quality of the product is very cheap.

Smith digs up the golden plates and the angel gives him another plate that enables him to translate the language on the other plates, resulting in the Book of Mormon.Oh, but wait a minute -- the plates are then destroyed so we have to take Smith's word for it.Then comes Bring'em Young who decides he needs a sweet young thing to keep him warm at every place he stops in Utah so he authorizes polygamy.And this, folks, is what one of our presidential candidates believes.Oh, and did I mention the magic underwear Mormons wear?

So I bought this because the product box said it's Mac compatible. There is no software to install. Just hook your internet cable/modem to the product, then hook it to your computer, open your browser and type in an address and you are connected to the router. You can then run a \\"wizard\\" which worked ok on Firefox, but crashed on Safari. I made a couple of setting changes and disconnected my laptop and I was up and running very quickly. It also has 4 ports to connect directly to computers. Coverage and speed are much better now, so it was a good buy.

I finally boxed up the router and returned it to Amazon and bought a Netgear that worked perfectly the first try and connected perfectly with the D-link range extender.

This time, I spent 20 minutes going thru the typical overseas call center checklist, argued over the spelling of my name, the spelling of my email, unplug this, unplug that, restart this, restart that, being called \\"Sir\\" more than 3 times a minute.I consider tech support to be part of the product, especially from a company that makes huge claims about their support.

Millmand sets out to trace the Viking Route across the North Atlantic and along the way comes up with tales magical and gritty at the same time. My favorite is his meeting with the lighthouse keeper who lives with his library of 16,000 books. Millman has the ability to be open to every experience, take it all in, meet all kinds of human beings and make it come alive in words. This one goes on my short shelf to be read over again. A great book for travelers dreaming of a northern journey and for armchair travelers alike."},{"rating":"2","title":"I WANT MORE!","review":"I have never read/seen a book published in this manner. It took me down one avenue with one story and then down another avenue with a different one.The authors have very vivid imaginations and make you believe that YOU are there as the stories unfold. I laughed, cried, reached out for my mate, and everything else that the stories in this book call for.I'm impressed with the attention they paid to even the smallest of details and will probably read it again and again and again. Family matters, Mystery, suspense, and erotica, all in one place seem to be far-fetched, but the way that they were presented in this book are absolutely fantastic!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A confused mess","review":"Sorry but this book was a huge disappointment and nothing more than a confused mess.

A world where letters compose stories yet are stories to themselves. At times I felt as though each sentencewere bursting with shades of meaning beyond the story itself.A wonderful book from a wonderful, talented writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely Disappointing","review":"This book is a rambling disjointed unconnected hodgepodge of ideas.Like creating a Chullent, the author tries to make a blend but the book falls apart.Having just finished the book, I feel soiled.

The book is hard to read and understand, many of them can be taught in a simpler way but it chose the much unintelligible way of all things. It's too terrible to give it any star. If my calculus class didn't require this book I would never read it any more. If possible, choose others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"Even though textbooks have answer in the back, it means nothing if you don't know how they arrived at the answer. Thankfully, this solutions manual was cheap and affordable. It helped immensely. My issue is that it didn't have all the ODD problems worked out for you. The authors probably assumed that we would be able to answer questions with just one example answer. That's not always the case..other than that, this solutions manual was my best friend in calculus :D"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy Some other Book","review":"I really dont like the way author explains in this book. He makes easy things seem hard. It's like one of those teacher who dont know how to teach. Well consider this author much worse. There is no point of having this book unless you are in the calc. class that requires this book, even much much worse if you are trying to self teach. DONT with this book. Try some other Calculus Author."},{"rating":"2","title":"An inspiring read!","review":"I thought this book was both entertaining and informative.

Public Relations at its finest.Not the Bush's finest hour."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good if it's free","review":"Got this as a promotion from Amazon with Maxxum 5, and was surprised and amused to find out it's even weaker than the build in flash(GN is base on ISO 200, you need to divide by 1.4 to get the real number). So the only use is when you got a long lense, the higher positioned external flash won't cast the shadow of the lens on your baby's face as the build in flash will.On the bright side, the flash is very compact and comes with a carrying case and it uses the same battery as the camera, so I may keep it just in case, as a backup flash and a battery storage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't live up to the boasts on the cover","review":"The 1st bullet point on the cover \\"Increasing the performance of your application with ADO\\" is inaccurate for this book. There is no mention of the Datagrid, MSHFlexgrid, Data Environment, or SHAPE command in the brief ADO section. Databases, VB and Grids have always gone hand in hand, yet the authors totally ignore the grid with ADO. I must note here that this is not the only book that falls short of actually covering the newer features of VB6. In order to actually make use of these new features we are forced to 'fly by the seat of our pants' while gleaning some insight via MS Knowledge Base and a few books who actually bother to attempt to cover the features. However, this book was not much help."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't make the same mistake I made.","review":"I don't usually buy a computer book before checking out the customer review on the books. This time, I was in the hurry and had no time to check the review, so I wasted $.On the cover, the publisher claims the book is \\"THE DEFENITIVE PROBLEM SOLVER\\". Shame on the publisher and the authors. The code in the book doesn't compile. ActiveX components are missing from the CD. In other words, nothing works.The Waite Group, you owe me $+ tax."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is ALL you will need","review":"I usually don't write reviews, but this book has helped me so much that I felt a social responsibility to say it.I got a job that involved database and reporting work that evolved into being primarily VB with databases three weeks after I started the job. (Isn't it amazing how job descriptions can change after the hiring is complete?)Anyway, I had to learn fast and accurately to keep the job, and this book provided all I needed to save my job!It was also a great desk reference to troubleshoot when I got stuck down the line. I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND it to anyone who wants to learn and wants to buy only one book that they can continue to use after they're more comfortable."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is poor written and edited (i.e. bad sample code)","review":"This book is for the Advance VB user only. I calculated that 60% of the examples do not compile unless there is some re-coding. This book gives a weak description for each of the covered topics. Function are missing from the sample code that comes with the book. For example, half the code in Chapter 10 and 11 does not work due to missing functions. I am a developer with the full Enterprise Visual Studio 6.0. I review VB manuals for our developer support department. I wish that I could get the author to give me my money back or at least send me working sample code."},{"rating":"1","title":"A VB-5 Rehash","review":"Publishers of computer books are taking the easy way out and reprinting the same stuff again and again - just putting a new title on it. Many of the examples are VB5 code and won't compile under VB6."},{"rating":"2","title":"VB 6.0? Where?","review":"In the rash to satisfy the need for VB 6.0 DB development manuals the publisher (and with it the authors) have used the usual trick of repackaging an existing VB 5.0 book with a new cover and a couple of hastily written chapters trying to cover the large number of VB 6.0's new features. The code is useful to understand the technique but often does not compile under VB 6.0 and is written without following bookwide coding conventions. Roger Jennings' VB 6.0 book is a much better buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent code examples; however, they are poorly explained","review":"This book has some good examples of using Visual Basic 6.0 and the various data access techniques, etc...However, the book reminds me more of a shopping list with it's individual check marks; than a clearly written educational manual."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Poor","review":"This book is long on (basically negative) innuendo and the author's unsubstantiated (and uninteresting) opinions; short on substance or meaningful insights. It rambles. The reader is also treated to plenty of low grade psychobabble. It's a posthumous hatchet-job with lots of typos. No wonder Sir Alec wouldn't have anything to do with the author when approached for an interview."},{"rating":"2","title":"Glossy, pictoral, easy to follow.","review":"I can't complain about the price since I bought mineused for around five bucks.

The book is eminently readable,extremely useful and clear, and illustrates the commonhousehold electrical challenges well. In short, it will givea reader the necessary competence to accomplish the mission."},{"rating":"1","title":"Home Depot wiring book","review":"The book arrived in almost new condition from the seller and unfortunately I can readily see why. Although the graphics are well done and very clear, the subject matter is strictly elementary, and is really intended for readers who have absolutely no experience whatsoever. Hence it wasn't used very much.So if you are a complete novice, and need a great introductory text to help you through elementary chores like replacing a wall outlet, this is the book for you.Anyone looking for more advanced wiring instruction would be better off looking elsewhere.Perhaps an informal rating system for \\"how to\\" books should be implemented by Amazon. A simple three tiered system like; basic, intermediate, and advanced would be helpful.DSK"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wiring 1-2-3","review":"The books condition is satisfactory but worth it. Overall the book is very helpful with small home projects. Good pictures and easy to understand directions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clear, to the point","review":"Great for basic stuff, but could use more details for the more complex stuff, like three-way or four-way switches.

However, I was very dissapointed in the workout and plan to give it away. I am in better than average shape and work out on a regular basis. After doing these workouts, I felt nothing in my legs/buns but my knees hurt for days. I don't believe that it was my form since the exercises are simple and well known. I therefore do not recommend this tape."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Pharaohs are spinning in their tombs!","review":"The book is well-written, I'll give it that. While it is certainly more poetic than any other version of the Book of the Dead, it comes at the cost of all of the specifics and crucial information needed for success in the afterlife-- which is why the Book was written in the first place! The true poetry of the Chapters of Comming Forth by Day lies in the information contained within the hieroglyphs. Interpreting the BoD in this manner is like rewriting the New Testament or the Dead Sea Scrolls and inserting one's own personal orinion into the text. A book like this is no less blasphemous."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book you will not soon forget...","review":"An acquaintance, well versed in things Egyptian, advised me to look at this book. I had complained thatwhat I had seen of the Egyptian Book of the Dead seemed academic and dry as dust.The first page of this translation captivated my attention. Reading it I could not but helpfeel that THIS is how it would have been sung (or said) in ancient Egypt.If you read it to me (I had a friend do this) the text dissolves into a vision of what the original author was seeingas this was written.If you told me this was received by the translator from Isis I'm afraid I would have to agree.If you like things Egyptian, do yourself the favor of a personal gift to yourself of this translation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"I read the Chapter \\"The Bath\\" first. A few paragraphs into it, I felt like reading it out aloud. So I did. And it felt so good. Half way through it I found myself start crying. When I finished the chapter, tears were all over me. I can't even identify where this emotional impact comes from. All I can say is that these words are magic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good book","review":"Awakening Osiris is a good book. Allay the question of the trueness of the translation and envelop yourself in the reading. The invocations and prayers, praises and prose are simple and fluid. The passages are down to earth at times and lofty at others. Enobling, the work is sympathetic to the contemporary soul. I read Awakening Osiris years ago and it still has a place in my heart and a well deserved home on my bookshelf among the more scholarly works of ancient Egypt."},{"rating":"1","title":"No sleep, little power, limited, shaky?","review":"This card, using a TI chipset, has always been annoying.My son saw a lot of mysterious firewire issues with devices connected through the card, though we were never able to pin down the culprit.While advertised as compatible with a wide range of machines and systems, it is a 5 volt only PCI card, limiting it to older hardware.At least on my example of the card, F5U503 Rev.S-3, there is no internal power connector, limiting the useful capacity to one bus powered device, e.g. iPod or 2.5\\" hard disk, but not both at once. This is not an issue if you plan to use 3.5\\" or 5\\" firewire drives which have their own power supplies.The failure to support deep sleep is the most infuriating aspect of the card. Macs are competent and reliable sleepers, going months before rebooting. The Belkin card prevents deep sleep, something I only learned on the Belkin support site long after I bought the card.Whether for PC or Mac, I'll choose more carefully next time."},{"rating":"2","title":"IT DOES NOT ACCEPT THE JAZZ PHILOSOPHY ENTIRELY","review":"I know that DAVID SANCHEZ is a gifted tenor sax player ,however in this recording he is trying to tie jazz with classical music together, leaving to every genre its autonomy individually and he does it to a degree succsessfully and harmonically ,with warmth elegance and silkiness .SUPPORTED by players charesmatic like him /special mention to miguel zenon and his alto sax and pianist edsel gomel /the result is warm ,sweet pleasant and imaginative.It is not so a musical exploration between and throudh classical and jazz music ,though they differ a lot ,but the harmonic combination which can be achieved, if both musical genres find a common approach, without pushing their extentions to high forms of analysis complexity and diversity .

The book is good, it provides most of what you need to understand fixed income valuations, particularly essential bond pricing. However, the book really serves well mostly as a reference. There are few true explanations of formulas. With a little effort you can figure out the derivations yourself, but still, is not the point of buying a book with \\"mathematics\\" in the title to have something to guide you through that step? Again, worth having, but not the ultimate to explain the nitty gritty, though not sure that that text exists."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a real beginner's guide","review":"The book was a great disappointment to me.

It's a history book with 932 pages of block text on newsprint paper with no illustrations, maps, or photographs, like it was pulp fiction. I would have paid twice as much to have a well-published history in two volumes.Thankfully, there are sub-heads and a few drop-caps that break up the visual desert but only with marginal success."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST read for all public school graduates, and Home Educators","review":"This is all the history that was edited, or revised out of the public school.

Kind of like I remember in my school history lessons. The review of our early history to the present is so good.

Schweikart says all of those historians who talk about racism against brown people are missing the point that the brown people ARE ALL DANGEROUS TO OUR [racist? economically exploitative? misogynist?] way of life as Americans... or at least, a threat to the white dudes and their wives that live on top. The book barely qualifies as revisionism - it's more like 'we're racist, so what' -ism. Because, as Schweikart tells us, it's not racist because history [written by whom?] has revealed the ways in which all brown people are evil.If you need to rinse your mouth of the stupidity contained between these covers, I would suggestA People's History of American Empire- it has pictures, for all of you who don't like the pages filled with words and logic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not happy as a Southerner","review":"I have been so excited to read this book. I fully enjoyed it UNTIL we came to the Civil War and Gen. Sherman. Absolute Northern B.S. I am so unhappy with the praising of Sherman and his burning of the South that I will NOT recommend this book to anyone. The Union Soldiers under Gen. Sherman raped, killed, and destroyed the south, their own AMERICAN family and that is good? I love to listen to Glenn Beck and took his advice on reading this book. As informed as I believe Beck to be, HOW can he not know the same propaganda and lies that happen today in the Obama administration also happened in Lincoln's administration."},{"rating":"1","title":"I must not know what the word Patriot means","review":"This book is much like a porn movie that has all sorts of sets and situations but each scene ends the same way. It turns out that every event in American history can be linked to the current Right Wing agenda and anybody who acts contrary to this agenda is berated in this book.If thats what \\"patriot\\" means I am not sure I want to aspire to be one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh brother...","review":"I thought it might be nice to get a view of history that's written from a different angle.Or maybe the book would highlight issues and events other works had (deliberately) left out.But if those critical of Abu Ghraib and the (handling of) the war in Iraq are simply referred to as \\"left leaning\\" and \\"anti war\\", this can not be considered a history book, balanced or even patriotic.It is nothing more than a bitter and self righteous opinion piece, merely addressing those that hold the author's beliefs to begin with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Revisionist and unobjective","review":"I've never written a review before, but the deification of Lincoln and demonization of the South was enough to make me stop reading. I bought this book due to Glenn Beck's recommendation, but I'll just say that Woodrow Wilson could not have usurped the power that he did without Lincoln's actions as precedent. To imply that that the South would never have freed the slaves (when every other country in the western hemisphere did) is intellectually dishonest. To imply that the North was for the war when pro-peace Northern newspapers were denied access to the mail (and quickly quieted down). There are evils in the past that both sides needs to deal with, as continuous and increasing involvement by an unresponsive federal government in all aspects of our lives will only end badly."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a farce.","review":"This book reminds me of the story of two men talking about the days of knights and kings.First man \\"Gee, it would have been great to live in those days.\\"Second man \\"Yeah, if you rode the horse, but what if you cleaned up after the horse.\\"In the same way, these writers have chosen to look at history from one viewpoint.

But after 3 days of reading, with each night thinking, \\"Why am I wasting my time with this?\\" I finally gave up. The writing is a mile wide and an inch deep. It seems as if was put together by their students with a lot of facts but no context or analysis. There are conclusions however about how capitalism saves the day without any real support for that view.

It was long, but that's expected. Some areas were amazing, and some not so much and seemed to jump around from idea or fact to fact. But overall, it was well worth reading it all!

Written in an easy to read format that nicely flows from one era to the next, not getting bogged down in any one of them, the book explores history from the standpoint of someone who loves and appreciates the United States, but also recognizes it's past transgressions and challenges, but put in their proper perspective.

At our local bookstore, I located the book. Because my sister works at the Reagan Library, I turned to the book's index and looked for Reagan. What puzzled and disappointed me was that I could find no information directing me to the book's pages that reviewed Iran Contra. If that was the historical perspective the authors were providing, I decided not to buy or read the book since the authors appear to have ignored history. As to the objection to Zinn's title including People, the objectors are forgetting or ignoring that the framers in the Preamble of the Constitution refer to \\"We the People...\\" rather than \\"We the bankers, politicians, Wall Streeters, CEOs....\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Same Old Trap","review":"Trying to counter overly negative histories of America with an overly positive history is to fall into the same trap. Revision of revisionary history? If it merely retold history all in a positive light, it could be enjoyed as a funny counter to the silly all negative histories out there. But it is not like that. It is basically a pep rally for today's Republican Party. So some historical events are good and some are bad, based on the values of today's politics. That's a terrible way to explore and present history; terrible in exactly the same way the overly negative or overly leftist or overly anti-American histories are.Same old trap, other political side.

This is absolutely the most incredibly ignorant history book I've ever read. Actually, I think it would be better termed \\"revisionist\\" history.Don't misunderstand me, history books are often innaccurate and disagree, but this tome can best be described as a fantasy version of US history that will appeal to the most rabid instincts of the average knuckle-dragging Limbaugh/Fox News fan. I'd honestly never even conceived of a partisan American History book.One simple example would be using the rather unsubstantiated and implausible theories of the book \\"Silent Coup\\" where G.

One wonders if the authors would have used that characterization if they were truly striving for a balanced history.The authors seem barely able to conceal their glee at the thought of Cortez killing over 100,000 Aztecs in the sack of the city. We are assured that it is a righteous stuggle, the Aztecs were inhuman monsters, and it was the least the poor Spaniards could do to bring the savages God and government.

If you want an interesting account of American History through a conservative lens, read Paul Johnson's book.

I wont mention the other cause I used to be friends with the author. Over 5000 titles, less than 200 being novels, and this is my only second waste can candidate....I fell for the title. Book formula is easy, decide on what you believe and write a history in which every interpretation directs you to your preordained conclusion.

The truths it reveals cannot be denied, the Revolutionary war was fought mainly to protect the interests of the landed and moneyed elites. American Indians were massacred, their lands stolen, treaties broken over and over. Every real right won in this country from women's right to vote to the 8 hour day to civil rights for blacks was won by the people through struggle and civil disobedience.

In 2012 a monstrous flood never seen before wiped out parts of Jay Cooke park created by The CCC and is being rebuilt today. This is just one of the many parks.

Everyone is entitled, I guess, to their own opinions, but when they mask as a rigorous history of the United States, more must be expected. Much of the book is standard high school stuff, but when he gets into such subjects as divorce, feminism, and regulations affecting business the screws come loose. Of course, like many right-wingers, he likes to wrap himself in the robes of patriotism. It's a \\"patriots\\" history. All other histories are, at worst, unpatriotic or at least suspect. All you need to know: the introduction, of sorts, is a glowing interview with that remarkable ego, Rush Limbaugh and like Rush and his ilk, the author is most interested in calling out the suspicious characters who have led this great nation astray.

There's an indentation on the bottom that keeps it stable on a cat food or soda can alcohol stove. The lid fits snugly so it doesn't fall off and it might even save you from losing your dinner if you knock it over. It will hold the stove and a windscreen when packing it up, plus your lighter and a spoon. The spout is very handy and the handles fold against the body. It's lightweight, too.There are three drawbacks: the high price, it's hard to clean when making meals with creamy sauces as they tend to stick, and the handles get hot so you have to either let them cool or use a bandana.Overall it's probably the best little backpacking pot there is if you can spare the bucks."},{"rating":"2","title":"tv arrived shipping cost $0.00, in four days","review":"i paid 199.95, free shipping, i can't say 'no tax' but \\"no tax\\", i declare it in my state return.

The sound quality was quite good, with much presence and depth to the sound. This transfer to CD seems to have lost a little of that quality. The presence isn't quite there.Giulini's accompaniment is rather dry, which the CD transfer seems to make more evident. But the performance by Perlman is excellent. Truly a virtuoso of the highest order!Perhaps not the greatest overall performance, but one well worth hearing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nicely paced, clear majestic rendition of Beethoven","review":"What I like about Perlman is his tone and even pace. Each note and detail is clearly heard and rendered beautifully. He makes the Beethoven sound majestic, as it should. The 2nd movement is especially lyrical and haunting. Perlman is not afraid to play slowly, exposing every note and ornamentation. Being a violin student, his rendition is easy to follow and appreciate. Others might put more fireworks into it, or play too fast, obscuring or crushing some notes. But not Perlman, he appreciates taking his time to express and cherish each note. The cadenza is by Kreisler, for those interested in following along."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lived up to the hype!","review":"I just recently bought this CD and was not at all disappointed with it. I like this version MUCH better than Zuckerman's recording with Zubin Mehta and the LA Philharmonic. I was wondering why all the fuss about this concerto--now I know!It only gets 4 stars instead of the deserved 5 stars b/c this CD is only 44 minutes long. In this day and age, I believe that is unacceptable. How hard would it have been to fill up the 30 minutes of blank space with a violin sonata or romance or SOMETHING?! 44 minutes just doesn't cut it with all of the competition and options out there. EMI, are you listening?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too spicy","review":"It's likely that Perlman is too self involved in the music and I doubt if he is playing Beethoven's concerto. Maybe I am wrong since Beethoven might be as sentimental as Chopin, but I just cannot read anything like this from his other music. Simple interpretations given by Oistrakh, Schneiderhan, Heifetz, Kaagan and Zukerman are more enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smashing!","review":"A bravura performance from arguably the finest violinist in the world playing one of the greatest classical pieces of all time. One can listen to it time and again without it ever becoming stale."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn","review":"Perlman's Beethoven is technically sound, and in tune. It is not, however, bold, exciting, unique, or interesting. His high notes are frequently lost in the orchestra, it's too slow (classical era, NOT romantic), and despite the perfect intonation, his passage work is boring, repeated sections are noticable, and there just isn't enough raw power in his playing for this piece. Listen to the orchestra part if you doubt me. It clashes with the placid nature of Perlman's playing. I generally love Perlman's recordings, but I think he just got it wrong with this one.If you want the most amazing performance of Beethoven's violin concerto ever recorded, as it should and was always meant to be played, buy Heifetz's recording with the Boston Symphony. Simply stunning. If you want Perlman playing an etude with some decent cadenzas, get this \\"classic\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Listen to some samples before you buy this one","review":"Be sure to listen to some samples before you buy this CD.

At track 13 be prepared for a surprise. Vivaldi wrote many pieces that are even more beautiful than the Four Seasons and this is one of the most compelling. This version of Op 8/No 9, RV 454 is a truly special composition. In this CD we hear the oboe version. In the Op 8, volume 2 CD we hear the same composition (and listed as RV 236) played with the violin. I would buy both CD's just for this piece alone! The oboe version is calm and assured while the violin version contrasts by being delicate and refined. I'm absolutely blown away by the sublime key and abrubt tempo changes in the first allegro movement. These sounds are one more example of the truly world class and mesmerizing musical effect of Vivaldi and Il Giardino Armonico."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eye Socket bone universal?","review":"Its is obviously not so.

I wish I could return both sets and the music, too. The music is AWFUL! I had trouble getting past the music, feeling like I was watching a porno movie. The movements and the choreography were uninspiring. I think these videos are more of the same thing as the other videos and just a way to get you to buy more videos by putting them in different packaging and a different set. Try the other bellydance videos on Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"why did I waste my money?","review":"It truly appears to me that someone saw the Belly Twins taking a beginner belly dance class, and said, \\"Hey, I'm going to make them stars because they have a genetic defect!\\" And viola, we have the Sensual Art of Bellydance. They know nothing about dance, bellydance, or exercise, and have no business passing themselves off as such. I wouldn't be surprised if someone filed a lawsuit against them. They have no credentials whatsoever, and after wasting my money on this boxed set, I understand why: they are not qualified. People, please read the boxes before you buy, and if you are interested in bellydance, consider qualified instructors such as Rania and Dolphina."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you want to start learning bellydance this is for you!","review":"I bought this set from my book club and it is great. I have all of the bellytwins workout videos. But if you are wanting something learn from but not necessarily a workout then get these. The twins take you step by step through three different types of dances. At the end of each video they take you through the routing three times, each time being a little faster. Also a wonderful collection for those of us who already bellydance, to add new moves to our routines. The twins give us a new and refreshing change of pace in bellydance instruction!"},{"rating":"2","title":"MUST HAVE FOR ANY BELLY DANCER!!!","review":"Neena and Veena have listened to their fans...they made videos that bring together the choreography into a DANCE, not just beautiful movements. Challenging without being frustrating, this is one of the best sets I've boughten."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty fun","review":"I bought these tapes after 4 months of bellydance instruction. While these tapes cannot compare with a class, where a teacher can correct and encourage you, I think they're pretty good just for fun dancing. I expect they'll be useful when I move and can no longer take classes. :(There is only one regret that I have about this -- I wish that I had not bought the boxed set, as I did not like the Basic Moves tape at all. I watched it once and was very bored, as I (with my small experience) already knew the moves on that tape. If you have ANY bellydance experience, I recommend getting just the other two tapes. If you don't have any experience, then get this set and enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a good one","review":"I think Bidasha sisters are amazing dancers, the video is very well done the music is nice but it I think it could be better. I learned a lot and they gave me lots of new ideas. But I would prefer that instead of learning a dancing routine, it would encourage to improvisation, but anyway it is a good video. Another thing that could be perfect is a routine with finger cymbals! and they dont include this. I recomend it if you want some good ideas for your performance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"This set is particularly valuable for the beginning dancer who is more interested in learning the technique than in a workout video or weightloss.

Many videos provide instruction on the moves but not how they all work together into one beautiful performance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overpriced - cheaper at Borders","review":"$39.98 is too much to pay for this set.

This was not the best or the worst. The video was very professional(unlike some) and had a nice set. I found the videos a bit dull and dare I say it? OK I will: The instructors lacked Sensuality. Since this is the title of the video, I was expecting the instructors to have more passion and sensuality. The instruction is done in voice over, so the instructors have the most artificial smiles on their faces through-out the entire video. It is not inspiring and a bit annoying. The movements are broken down clearly, so it is not a total waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for spicing your love life","review":"I decided to buy this so I could do something fun & special for my hubby. This has good step-by-step instructions. It is not as exciting as I thought it would be. I thought there would be a routine for me to learn, but it is mainly about feeling the music and moving to the beat. (I can do that without these steps.) The performances under the special features are good to watch and get a feel for the dance. I would not recommend this video to use as a workout or for fun. It's mainly to learn for cultural dance reasons."},{"rating":"2","title":"great video!","review":"I ordered this dvd on to supplement my beginning bellydance class.

If you are an advanced student it may not be that helpful, but as a beginner, I would recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If new to bellydance, this is great to have!!!","review":"I bought five belly dance movies, the Art of Ancient oriental dance(1&2) and the boxed set for Sensual art of Bellydance. I first recieved the ancient art and had a hard time following, I also hurt some of my muscles.The other night I did the first of the sensual art movies and loved it. The instructions were easy to follow, they followed through the steps many times. The went from slow, to a little more up to speed and finally to tempo. They were informative and easy for me to do. I loved it. The only let down I had was sometimes when they were explaining the movements the camera would be focused on the actresses belly instead of her whole body, so it was hard to know just exacly what to do. I am glad I purchased this set, because I have the other ones handy for when I get a little better."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Marvellous Introduction to Belldydancing","review":"What a marvellous box set and certainly a must for aspiring bellydancers out there. I have only recently started taking bellydancing classes and I have found these videos very helpful in practicing what I have learnt during class. Neena and Veena's gorgeous smiles, fluid movements and beautiful figures are inspirational.Despite what other reviewers have suggested, the use of a voice over, rather than Neena and Veena speaking (they just smile gracefully) is not off-putting at all. I am far too busy concentrating on the movements to find it at all disconcerting. In fact, I think it works far better than if they were to personally talk the student through the steps.I do hope Neena and Veena produce a video for more advanced students soon!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bellydance","review":"I thought these videos provided clear and easy to follow instructions. The videos were tastefully put together which made it enjoyable to watch as well as to follow along."},{"rating":"2","title":"belly dance","review":"First off, I have to say, THESE ARE NOT EXERSIZE DVDs. At least, not at first. Sure, once you've learned them all and can do the dances, I suppose it is exersize. And all movement is really some kind of exersize, right? But these DVDs are not designed to help you lose weight, or even become more flexible, or whatever- they are designed to teach you how to dance belly-dance.That said, if you want to learn how to belly-dance, these are fantastic. The two dancers are great, and it starts out slow, building to more complicated moves. My only complaints- yea, the voiceover is lousy (but once you've gone through the dvd a few times to get the gist, you can turn her off) and when they put the moves together at the end, they put ALL the moves together at the end, instead of building one on another and then starting over to build another. But that's what pause and rewind are for- so if you do want to learn, this is the set to get."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible","review":"This DVD sucks! You don't actually learn any bellydancing and the girls put you to sleep. I would say if you're having trouble going to sleep watch it. It will definitely help you fall asleep. A waste of money and time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceptional dance instruction videos","review":"Once again Neena and Veena outdo themselves and give us this amazing set of videos. Their instruction is easy to follow and not only teaches basic isolations but incorporate them into routines that you can actually learn and do on your own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loads of fun - Good Instruction","review":"I have a number of years as a dancer and thought it would be fun to try belly dancing. I really enjoyed the video and am hooked on belly dancing.The set is aesthetically pleasing. The twins don't talk during their demonstrations, rather they have a voice over. Consequently, their faces are frozen with the same expression throughout the video which may be a little annoying.However, Veena and Neena do an excellent job breaking down the steps for you. Moves are presented in a way that you can learn them easily and quickly. The dance at the end is fun. One of the things I wished was some more choreographed dances."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, Easy, and Amazing","review":"Sensual Art of Bellydance is an amazing set if you want to get a decent work out and learn bellydancing. The instructor's voice is calm, not shouting, and the steps are easy to follow and that's coming from someone with two left feet.I don't keep up with exercise very well, but I've been working out to tape one for a year now. I feel as if I have mastered it so I have just moved on to the second tape. Both tapes have been challenging and fun. Also I'm losing weight, and hey that's always a bonus :)But the best thing of all is how you feel during and after. The elegance that is associated with bellydance can lift anyone's self image... and this is coming from someone with a very large \\"image\\" ;)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A different approach to music theory and composition","review":"For the studied musician or composer, this book offers a new approach to the way we veiw both music theory and composition. Schenker begins with a detailed description of how we perceive music based on the natural laws of overtones. He then demonstrates how the \\"old systems\\", i.e. the church modes no longer, or ever really could be consisdered as independant systems of tonality. The only valid systems are the major and the minor. The first half encompasses his broad yet clarifying theories and the second half demonstrates these theories in practical applications. The concepts of \\"compositional unfolding\\" and many others have increased my understanding and comprehension of theory as it should be.....the way Bach, Beethoven, and many of the greats perceived it before Ramaeu. This is definetly worth the time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgraceful pseudo-scholarly translation of a great book","review":"Schenker's first major work, a brilliant accomplishment, but only in the German. Sadly, over a quarter of the text and over 70 musical examples have been excised from the original, in this so-called scholarly edition/translation--a hatchet job presumably carried out by the editor Oswald Jonas, to bring the book into line with Schenker's later work. Amazingly, even this travesty is still a pretty good harmony book, but it's not a patch on the original.

The maps are great, but don't expect them to be 100% accurate for a rapidly changing place like Beijing. (For example, in May 2004 they already had an extra subway line which didn't appear in the guide) Other perks are the great quality of binding which makes it easier to travel with (on one occasion it got wet, but somehow survived) and great sense of humor.The only major disadvantage was the lack of \\"off the beaten track\\" info. I'ld say the best bet is getting these tips from other travelers or maybe using another guidebook as a sidecar.Still, LP offers the best value for the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great resource, especially with Chinese venue names","review":"Compared to the other travel guides (I have them all - Frommer's, Time Out, Fodors, HoodHot), this one has good maps, conveniently located in the back of the book (you'll need em! and quick! to try and figure out how to tell the driver where you want to go) and a great index where you can look up venues that you wanted to go to etc. Great for finding good places to go in Beijing, and better when I used it with my iPhone (downloaded the HoodHot Beijing Taxi Guide app from the app store, which translates English venue names to Chinese and gives Chinese addresses), so I didn't have to bring the clunky book around!"},{"rating":"1","title":"SO SAD","review":"The other reviewers of this CD are far too kind (probably because they would love another great LaFaro/Evans Album) but you can not rate this album highly because the talking among the audience is far too audible.

I found it at times to be ridiculous and unrealistic.The narrator was a complete sap who constantly made excuses as to his rightful actions. His ex-wife was a completely unlikable bitter woman who lived a lie for years. I didn't like either one of them and at times was completely exasperated at Pete Morrison's lack of confidence.The last chapter was a complete fabrication of real life and made the whole book into a joke. Why didn't the narrator try to adopt the boy? The jerk was throwing money at him and his cold-hearted mother left and right throughout the whole book. He was constantly belittling himself and thinking he was the bad guy, when instead, he was the victim of the ex-wife's manipulation.Do yourself a favor and don't waste time on this nonsense."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put it down","review":"I'm not a big fiction reader, but this book sucked me in from the start! The very discussion that needs to be had on paternity rights in this country makes my blood boil, and this novel hit all the veins with brilliant descriptions of a father's emotions, and ex-husband's stubbornness, and a betrayed man's anger.The legal maneuvering described might be a little far fetched for real life, but the leaps the author asks you to take are small.I read this book in two sittings and went right back online to see if Deangelo had more novels out there. I was disappointed to only find the one.I suggest this novel for anyone who wants to feel the rage and disbelief of a well-intentioned father, and leave with the love shared through a bond that doesn't need DNA to be created."},{"rating":"2","title":"DON'T ASK...","review":"This story is about 3 people and the tragic effects of DNA testing.

Both informative and very entertaining.","review":"The book put forth the travels of Alfred Wallace in a most entertaining mannner and gave a very useful synopsis of theories dealing with island biogeography. The book is both exquisitly detailed, yet very understandable. His tales of extinction show the impact humans have made on the natural world through their direct and indirect actions. The book shows how this impact has caused great losses in biodiversity and how it has brought forth massive amounts of ecoystem decay. The author's own travels and experiences make for a informative and entertaining book that is a great reference material."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really long but not dragging","review":"I was surprised by how long this book is - I was expecting it to just skim over extinction of a few species and make its conclusion. Instead, it is a thorough and detailed account of the history and the science behind the natural world today. Great for both the people who know a lot about natural science and those who are simply curious. This book reads more like a good blog than a report, with opinions and personal experiences of the author included among in the drier retelling of scientific theories.

Generally, I am not a skimmer of Quammen's work, and in fact often enjoy his wit and lithesome prose, but after only a dozen pages or so into Dodo I found myself flipping page after page looking for something substantive, looking for meat. In one word, the pace is SLOW. Over and over again in the margins I found myself scribbling \\"Go! Go!

He hints at Darwin being nothing short of a lying cheat who stole the idea of natural selection from Walace out of pride. I would not be so put off by this but he does so with little; strike that, NO evidence other than conjecture. He believes Darwin is lying about a the date he recieved Wallace's manuscript and ASSumes that Walace's account of the day he sent it (written thirty years later) was correct.Skip to MacArthur and Wilson's book.

Granted, I've not always been the best example in every area of life, but I have learned that true, meaningful sex involves the spirit, mind, and body...and all the senses. True lovemaking has to be centered on truth and trust. And when it is, it can be mind-blowing and lasting.There are several great books about senior sex out there that touch on the religious element. This one and Seasoned Romance are two of the best at explaining the spirit, mind, and body dimension (though Seasoned Romance doesn't purport itself to be Christian, it does include several interviews that mention the role of faith and belief).So, regardless of where you are coming from, religion-wise, it's definitely time to celebrate true love and lovemaking!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much God and religion for me","review":"I did not realize this book was directed towards Christian, married sex.

The brass playing is sub-par in both Mars and Uranus. That the trumpets add a misplayed note to one of the more signifigant passages early in Mars and this is just not acceptable. I am surprised that EMI ever allowed such a recording to be released to the public. Such playing is not even worthy of budget releases and there are good number of budget releases that are better than this.

It is very easy to read and understand. I highly recommend it to every parent who has to deal with this situation. It is an A+ book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of it's kind","review":"I bought this book as a present for a friend who renovates homes, but I had to buy another as I didn't want to give it away.The photography in this book is simply amazing, and the designs are stunning. Most of the houses are contemporary in design, and the fitouts are superb. The architects names are also included if you want to contact them, a very nice touch indeed.There is something for every person interested in design in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"150 Best House Ideas","review":"150 Best House IdeasI am planning to build a house and was looking for some ideas to help me with the house plan.

The diversity of the authors lends itself to an amazing range of lifestyles, choices, and events. Each author brings originality and clarity to their opinions partially formed by who they are and how society interacts with them. I found each piece added to a larger harmony and that the differences in ideologies and experiences enhanced my knowledge of women with disabilities. Society could truly benefit by making this book a prerequisite for entering the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"WWII Soldier finds his way","review":"This is great story of a career Army officer who learns to believe in himself and turn his career around. The tale takes place in a fiction theater in the South Pacific in 1942. Lt. Col Farralon arrives at HQ to find the command demoralized and in a stalemate with the Japanese. Before he can help turn the tide on the enemy, he must fight his own past, his reputation and the enemy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievably slow","review":"Having just finished singing the Requiem with the Syracuse Oratorio Society, I bought this eagerly, loving the music. But this version sounds like it's got a lead weight around its leg. The unbelievably slow tempi make this much more dirgelike, even in the bright shining passages. A real disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"lasted 4 years","review":"I bought this TV in 2004 from Best Buy and it crapped out in 2008. White horizontal lines appeared at the top of the screen. If a persons head was shown on screen near the top, the white lines reflected an upside down image of the top of the head. I ran this TV all night while I slept but I still expected it to last more than 4 years, preferably 10. Everything looked good before the white lines appeared. Giving it only 2 stars for the durability. I'd rather not buy a new TV every 4 years."},{"rating":"1","title":"electrica hum from back of unit","review":"The television is a nice small size so perfect for a bedroom but the television makes an electrical hum from the back of the unit. The hum just drives me nuts. I thought this might be a defective unit but others have commented on this problem with last year's model. So looks like they have not fixed this issue."},{"rating":"1","title":"A grave disappointment; stick to the earlier ones","review":"I bought this book expecting more of what Alpern has covered in his previous books: more buildings, with more stories, and more floor plans. Instead, while some material is new, quite a few of these buildings have been covered in his earlier books. And there are no floor plans at all. If you are an afficionado of great Manhattan apartment houses, avoid this book and stick with \\"New York's Fabulous Luxury Apartments\\" instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"A deadly good time!","review":"The most striking thing about Pushing Daisies is the cinematography. It has the look of a Tim Burton movie, with all the high contrast colors and wide angle views. But beyond the beauty of the cinematography is more mastery. The characters are well cast, the actors are great and likeable. The mysteries are quirky and fun. Every week, it's something different that you'd never have imagined. It's like watching a mini-movie every week!"},{"rating":"2","title":"best show i've ever watched.","review":"complete. well written. great acting. fantastic plot line. no unintelligible blubber. simply put, an instant classic with every aspect of creativity in existence."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best show in a very long time","review":"I absolutely adore this show. I loved the DVD too and I hope there are many more Pushing Daisies DVD's to come. It is a breath of fresh air and I love the photography, the characters, the stories and everything is just perfect!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but weird, but narrated by Jim Dale!","review":"While the story concept is very odd, I'd keep watching it solely because Jim Dale narrates it. I love his voice and what he can do with it to really make even the most blah stories amusing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whimsical!","review":"Pushing Daisies was beyond the norm when it debuted in 2007. That, along with the writer's strike are probably the two main reasons why it did not last. The show is witty, surreal, and quirky. It is very character driven with a weekly murder mystery thrown in the mix. Too bad it is off the air"},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't make it past episode 5","review":"This show is as overdone and pseudo-humble and pretentious (there is such a combination) as Zoe Deschenel. I really hated this show. Just because something is artsy doesn't automatically make it good. I'll leave this one for the hipsters of the world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too cute.","review":"Based on the unanimous praise on Amazon, I was really looking forward to this DVD, but frankly, it just didn't work for me. The premise was interesting, the visuals were good (somewhat Tim Burton-esque as another reviewer noted), and the actors were fine. The problem: the writing was just way, way, WAY too precious and cutesy for me. If you, like me, are the kind of curmudgeon who generally doesn't like precious and cutesy but wonders, based on the uniformly great reviews, whether this DVD might be whimsical and likeable rather than cloying and saccharine, I guess my role is to warn you that you may be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horribly bad!","review":"This is horrible! It is badly written and has bad actors. Do not waste your time or money on this crap.

(I think you have to protect those shows you dearly love to keep them from the \\"lost sock\\" syndrome.) Please hurry up and release this season on DVD!!!!!I feel this show may be too intelligent for general consumption (how can I put that politely??? Hmm, I can't!) - and by that I mean, it is full of symbolism, classic movie references and literary themes. I don't know if the average viewer may catch all the references but who cares, right? It can be enjoyed by all for it is truly bright, colorful, and FUNNY!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pushing Daisies is the best!","review":"I absolutely love this show. The dialogue is entertaining, witty, and fast paced, the sets are fun and Tim Burton-esque, and the actors meld together so naturally and are all incredible talents. There really isn't a single character I don't enjoy, and I especially enjoy Lee Pace's portrayal of a gentle, slightly awkward Ned who happens to have this gift/curse that he never asked for and isn't always comfortable using. If you are looking for a charming escape, Pushing Daisies is by far the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"A magical place","review":"Great Series. I don't think I've seen another series that ties in magical surrealism and romance in the way that Pushing Daises does. It almost mimics life in that sometimes you want something so bad and yet you know if you have it that it will be the end because things will never be the same. Nevertheless, after watch this series you will definitely be hooked and be left wanting another serving of the pie hole and all its magic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous","review":"One of the best shows I've seen on tv in a long while.

It's been a long time since its December finale and I highly anticipate its October premire."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Show Ever","review":"This was the best show I have EVER seen on television. Its criminal that its not on the air anymore. It won piles of awards and comes packaged with its own devoted cult-like following, yet they never even gave it a chance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eye candy!","review":"This was a unique, wonderful and sweet show (no pun intended). It was a shame it left us so soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this show!","review":"I still think about some of the sets and visuals. When I first heard the premise about dead things coming back to life I wasn't really into it. I watched it years after it ended and was really pleasantly surprised. Really this was a super cute show with a 1950's like feel."},{"rating":"2","title":"All Colors but Blue","review":"This ground breaking (but short lived) TV series is fascinating and doesn't look quite like anything else on TV before or after its production. The director LOVES the colors green, yellow and red ... but NOT blue so have fun spotting this preference in an off kilter love story with a deadly sideline!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Why was this ever cancelled?","review":"Clever, romantic and unique. I love this show. I would highly recommend that you give it a try if you're looking for something new and different."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great premise","review":"Really interesting premise that turns into a great show. Great cast and great sets and styling. Quirky and fun show."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth watching","review":"A charming and whimsical dark comedy about a man who can raise the dead with one touch, but the second touch causes death forever. This is in the vein of Dead Like Me and like that series, catches on quickly. I think if it had a better title it would have lasted longer as a series (people may not have caught on to the meaning behind the phrase). It is a very well done series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most tragic cancellation since Firefly","review":"Many shows are entertaining, many shows are worth watching or purchasing, but hardly any show is as beautiful and pure as Pushing Daisies. Gorgeous, heartwarming (but never groan-worthy), and just GOOD in every sense of the word, this show deserved far more than two truncated seasons. Please, if you are even slightly interested, buy these DVDs now! Good enough sales may at least get us a finale, and it's actually a very good deal at this price as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's brave to be happy","review":"How do we construct ourselves? If we cling to the past, is that a strength or a weakness? When we finally decide to face our demons and begin the difficult, messy, painful, and utterly, utterly necessary process of rebirth, how do we decide what to keep and what to let go?Cynicism is cheap and easy. It doesn't take any effort to continue in the path you're on, even if you're unhappy. Let's hear it for a show that advocates the much more difficult path of learning to be happy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"I really have enjoyed this show. Once I discovered it, I think I watched the entire season in a few days. I love having the video and being able to share it with friends.This show is so entertaining. There is an underlying story that moves from episode to episode, but the main action is fresh and inventive. I can't think of any other show on television that is like this one, it is more like a movie in the set, filming, character development, and acting. This show does not disappoint."},{"rating":"2","title":"My niece loved it","review":"My niece reports that she loves this series, and she is SOOOO pleased to have her very own DVDs. I guess Season 2 for Christmas..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great series","review":"Season One was so great. Very original. Season Two has been just as great. Sorry to see it cancelled. One of the few original shows out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally Original - Fairy Tale for Adults","review":"Great care is taken with the sets, costumes, and writing. All of these are used to create a fantasy world where a man can give life to the dead. The show keeps a lighter tone although it deals with a murder of the week. Primary colors are used a lot in the costumes and sets to set a unique tone. Much of the cast has musical stage experience so it is put to use. Once in awhile Chenoweth breaks into song, even singing next to a janitor in a choregraphed number. The dialog is unique too. It hard to believe this quality can be done with the network fast paced schedule. The show is suffering from low ratings, a pity since original work doesn't sell as well as familar fare such as procedurals and reality contests."},{"rating":"2","title":"He was the best pie maker in town...","review":"This was an adorable show with a great all star cast, it's a shame it's gone off the air in just two much too short seasons. I would love to see more shows on television that are so artistic, colorful, intelligent and quirky... Nope. Everyone's too busy watching Teen Mom's beat their exes & Snookie & the Jersey girls get drunk & urinate on restaurant floors... This was something the whole family could enjoy!!! Does anyone even REMEMBER the wholesome shows we grew up with?! They used to be the majority... now, well... good luck finding a decent lineup. T.G.I.F. is gone & Saturday morning cartoons too. It's okay, we are better off... let's just have our kids play video games while we get wasted & watch Hoarders & people who are addicted to eating chalk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Is it Zen?","review":"I once read that we read to find a bit of ourselves. \\"Finding the Way was that and more.

I mean, they only have two ingredients, right? Wrong, these were weirdly like gummy bears instead of chewy and they had very inconsistent flavor. The whole first bag tasted like some one dumped a flowery cologne in it. I much prefer the Reeds brand to this and am going back to them as soon as I finish my case-ugh!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Inconsistent Quality","review":"I didn't purchase this from Amazon although I was about to since the 12 pack is so much cheaper than buying individual bags at the grocery store. So I thought I'd try a couple of bags to see how I liked them. The first bag was wonderful - plump, sweet, juicy pieces of ginger. Nicely sweetened with a good, hot ginger hit. The second bag was awful - mushy ginger and some pieces with strange unnatural textures. And the ginger was way too hot in that second bag.Not sure what's going on. But I also tried a couple of bags of the Reed's and liked their ginger much, much better. And the quality was consistent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stretches that don't stretch...","review":"This video contains three 10-minutes stretch routines, one standing, one sitting on a chair and one on the floor. The standing routine is a pretty basic set of stretches. They do the job. I found that except for the stretches (such as triceps) that are the same in all three, the sitting and floor stretches were useless. I am not especially flexible but even so I did not feel a stretch on most of the moves. I suppose the tape might work if you have very limited range-of-motion or have done no physical activity at all in a very long time. Overall, this tape is a waste of time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor quality","review":"When I received this item, the insulated lining was already ripped. Doesn't bode well for durability.

The stories centered around the interaction between Chen and Sifu Starr are reminiscent of the insightful interaction that Sifu Starr shares with his current students. I highly recommend this book to the serious martial artist whether they practice kung-fu, karate, judo, etc. We all have one thing in common--we train in order to understand what it truly means to be virtuous.Vincent Hardy"},{"rating":"2","title":"An instant classic","review":"After reading Sifu Phillip Starr's THE MAKING OF A BUTTERFLY, I felt connected with the author and actually felt like I shared in his journey of training with Sifu W.C. Chen. The lessons he learned have now been imparted to me and the philosophical truths imparted are ones that I can share with my children and others. This book is relevant for any martial arts stylist and also for anyone striving to attain a major life goal, whether it be an athlete, businessman, student, etc. Sifu Phillip Starr has written an instant classic - I put it in the same leaque as Funakoshi's KARATE DO: MY WAY OF LIFE. I highly recommend this book - if the reader approaches this book with openness, it will do more than just enlighten, it will also bring encouragement and promote a hightened sense of discipline, determination and positive attitude."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great pianist, great perfprmance","review":"Limpid, delicate, highly nuanced, lovely Chopin.

I emailed the seller nearly 6 weeks ago and have still not heard a word from them. Unless the situation is rectified, I will never purchase from this seller again.

I was allowed to buy the singles though (I guess my parents figured the singles wouldn't have the \\"bad\\" songs on them). Anyway, this single is awesome because of the live version of \\"It's So Easy\\" that's the B side to it. This is an early performance that's really awesome. It's really heavy, and unfortunately the band stopped playing this song so heavy once the \\"Use Your Illusion\\" era came around. Worth it for the B side...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be very careful of defects!!!","review":"I bought this TV from Best Buy back in June, and have had problems ever since. The 1st one I bought had a defective picture tube (left side of screen was green). I took that one back and got another. Everything seemed fine until I watched a letterbox movie, and noticed the piture looked crocked. It was too late to take it back to Best Buy, and when I called Toshiba, they were very unsympathetic or helpful...all I got was the name of a service center. The \\"recommended\\" service center came out to fix the problem...but in fact did nothing, the picture still looks crocked. I am now realizing the picture is not crocked, but in fact compressed on one side. It seems to me Toshiba got a bad batch of picture tubes! I would hope I just got stuck with 2 rare examples, but somehow I doubt it...and the fact that Toshiba was so unhelpful is not very reasuring!"},{"rating":"2","title":"DONT BE FOOLED BY A BEST BUY PURCHASE","review":"HEH HEH, NOT TO SAY THAT TARGET IS BETTER, but you are not the only buyer who has had bad experiences with Best Buy merchandise.

I got it back today and the problem is STILL there, in addition to a messed up picture tube (red/blue/green splotch on the left side around the middle) and hesitation when turning on, as well as trying to power on when unplugged.

If you read the section on Satellite Assisted Surveillance (GPS) on pages 161-163 and compare it to the original author's (Willing, R., USA Today), you'll see a scary example of what I mean. Lyman cites Willing, but that hardly justifies using ALL of Willing's data & merely changing a few \\"ands\\" and \\"buts.\\" This book is full of other peoples' work...chopped up & slapped together!It's apparent to me that this author passes other's research and work off as his own.

The objectives of the general curriculum MTEL have changed since it was published, so a lot of the information this book covers isn't even on the MTELS. Their history section is VERY weak and incomplete compared to all the information one must know for the test. It's a large book, they could have been much more selective in what facts they included, and not have talked about extraneous information that isn't even on the test anymore. Go to the DESE website (or just google MTEL, it'll be the first hit you get), and look up the objectives the state wants you to know. They aren't comparable with this book, but you can find info on most of those objectives through other resources, even on reputable websites for certain things.

What might have seemed like cutting edge thinking at that time is now missing the boat for the most part. Higher education is still grappling with how to deal with what has become a buyers' market for education. Faculty, who are stuck in the paradigm of a sellers' market and protected by the cloak of tenure, are the critical players in the e-learning scenario. Pittinsky hasn't found an answer to the real problem: who will hold faculty responsible for the fiscal strength and market share of higher education? As in so many instances, online learning has crystallized the issues of who teaches, who learns, and the bottom line for strong and productive higher education institutions."},{"rating":"1","title":"there was no real valuable information","review":"Just finished watching this documentary, I have always been interested in immortally out of body experiences and life after death so I was excited to watch this movieI was extremely disappointed, besides Thomas Campbell's information there was no real valuable information, the rest of the teachers gave nothing of value or information you can think and develop with, it felt like a mediocre TV show.

While it's not the most colorful in the world, it's a nice change from the heard-way-too-often Ravel version. I especially like the fortissimo horns at the beginning of Bydlo, and of course he keeps the Prominade V which Ravel left out. Overall, it's a great performance as always from the London PhilharmonicThe Classical Symphony of Prokofiev is also performed well here. While the tempos of the 1st and 3rd movements are a tad slow for my taste, the music is really brought out well and balanced - the sound quality of the recording is very good.I recommend this CD to anyone who like Pictures already, and this is certianly a good version of the Classical Symphony. It only gets four stars because it's under 50 minutes, and the two pieces aren't quite related enough to be the only two on the CD, in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good stuff","review":"Item purchased is equal then show into the online shopping.

All shades of human feelings pass through our hearts from the first to the last movement, reaching the blissful and lofty representation of cheerfulness at the end of the 4th. Listening to this record for the first time, early in my life (I am now just 31 years old), the feelings aroused by the melody surpassed the hearing sense, making me feel I was watching joy straight before me... red and yellow sparks disseminated from all the sound environment making such a scene of blissful delight, unforgettable.I should admit I am utterly fond of Karajan performances, but just for once in my life am I forced to acknowledge other's performance was the best.Sure I am, if such the case Beethoven being alive, he would listen to this record over and over"},{"rating":"1","title":"Less than Medium","review":"THis is an OK CD. In all movements, the recording mics were poorly placed. I found the sound very general in both nstruments and voices. Nothing clear and strong. Performance-wise, the strings sometimes do not play together as in mvt 1. People drop things during the recording. Sometimes the brass is out of tune. I don't recommend this as a study CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"And now for something completely different...","review":"I realise that I might be the only person who feels this way about this recording. I do love Beethoven and his 9th, but for me this version is way too slow. I blame it on Wagner. It seems that after his influence, many conductors felt it necessary to make their interpretations grand and majestic. For me, it ends up sounding fat and bloated. My personal preference is George Szell leading the Cleveland Orchestra. Even though it is on Sony's budget label it has more life than this turgid, plodding rendition."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT good at all . . .

First, you have to have it because of its historic significance. Second, it reveals the slower way the symphony used to be played. I was greatly disappointed listening to the recording while following along with the score. It was slow which was O.K., but the third movement dragged on forever. I was disappointed that the strings drowned out the woodwinds most of the symphony. When the strings were going full tilt, you couldn't hear much else but them. Furtwangler didn't like the recording set up, but some how got talked into getting it recorded any way. Listening to this and you can hear why. I realize that this recording was made in the early 50's, but EMI is really reaching to call this a great recording of the 20th Century."},{"rating":"1","title":"Much better out there.","review":"People have already written some good comments about this. I'm really only adding because I hate to see so many 5s on a considerably less-than-enjoyable recording of Beethoven's 9th. It seems to come down to this: if you're someone who puts, what...the conductor 'aura/persona' high, you might like it because of the history behind this recording and Furtwangler's unique idiom. If you just want a good recording of the 9th, however, look elsewhere. George Szell's is a particular favorite of mine, but at any rate, there are many out there that better deserve 5s from those only interested in the music!Actually, this recording reminds me of the only concert I've ever nearly walked out of: ironically, a Beethoven's 9th concert at the National Basilica of the Shrine of the Immaculate Conception. The acoustics were so AWFUL, that it was only out of respect and decorum that I stayed at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"There is Jackson standing like a stone wall...","review":"This book is about General Thomas J (\`Stonewall) Jackson's elite infantry brigade in the first three years of the Civil War; they were otherwise known as \`Jackson's Foot Cavalry'. Like most early men-at-arms titles, the book focuses at least as much on the history of its topic as the uniforms and weaponry; this makes it more exciting to read but still useful for both the casual and more knowledgeable readers.Only the plates and plate commentary actually focus much on the uniforms, and the plates depict more of the leaders than the common fighting men (but then again, the former varied in appearance much more so than the rank and file). The artwork of Michael Roffe, one of Osprey's earlier artists, has not particularly appealed to me in the past, but these are some of his better plates in my opinion.Overall, this is a good foundational book about the Brigade that would probably be useful for anyone interested but especially those new to the topic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good fuzzy socks in OD green for that manly man","review":"Shure, your guy wont admit it but he envys you when you wear your awsome fuzzy PINK socks.

The performance is very musical and imaginative -- the sisters take pauses and bend the tempos to really good effect, the playing is emotional and, for the most part (the violinist is good but not great), technically very sound. In fact, the sisters manage to make this Trio a little bit less stodgy than I thought prior to hearing the performance (it's not as strong a piece as the Op 26 or Op 65 trios, IMHO). This is high praise.The performances are excellent throughout but I'm not giving it 5 stars because I think the two other pieces on the CD -- a Suk Elegy and Shostakovich's disappointing 1st Trio -- are not up to the caliber of the Dumky Trio."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classical Music comes up for air","review":"The Ahn Trio has done Classical Music a great service in their interpretations of these works. Passion and virtuosity are exuded from every track of this recording. Whether due to sisterly kinetics, or plain old musical genius, the result is a perfectly balanced performance. This is not to say that the music is static, but rather that each instrument is able to sing, sail, dance, drone, wail or whisper, while never overpowering, or being drowned by the other two. The musical interchage between the three sisters is magical. Their performance of the Suk Elegy is enough to make any listener homesick for Prague. What the Ahn Trio does best is breathe life into the classical repertoir. They know how to move. They do it without histrionics and with masterful success."},{"rating":"2","title":"great tv","review":"this is a great tv, great picture, great sound. i did online research before buying this box, and it seems this is the best crt box 25\\" and smaller. but it was walking into best buy, and seeing this box for myself, sitting next many others like sony and panasonic, that i knew this one was the one...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective product","review":"Upon reading the reviews, I thought that this was the perfect tv for a 2nd home.

I had to connect the sound into two different input jacks to get sound from the DVD portion AND the VCR portion of the combo player. Later, I realized when I was trying to connect the satellite, the entire back panel where the inputs go was defective. In other words, there must have been a loose connection.Long story short, I had to jerry-rig the inputs to get adequate sound from all sources.This tv is in a location that is rather a pain in the neck to try to get fixed so, I'm kinda stuck with it.As for the picture, it's pretty good for a relatively inexpensive set."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great TV but no remote control","review":"I was very impressed by the great picture and sound except that the remote control is missing.

I have in the past used DVDs with almost religious regularity (by another instructor). However, this one was a waste of money b/c I don't feel drawn to it at all. I think some people might benefit from it but I need an instructor who's more alive (e.g. Sharon Mann from fit tv). I need a bit more engagement, more people perhaps to break up the monotony and definitely better music.

It's just *dull*."},{"rating":"1","title":"Agree with not my cup of tea reviewer","review":"I bought this DVD with high hopes and expectations after reading the mostly rave reviews. I have to say I was really disappointed. I have been doing all six workouts every day for 12 days and they leave me feeling like something is missing. I find the routines very dull and have to turn down the volume and listen to my own music. After doing this workout I have to do something energetic and find the Kathy Smith Kick boxing workout the best way of getting a great all over workout. This is probably a good toning workout for people just starting out on exercise routines. My copy of this DVD is scheduled for donation to my public library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"After reading the reviews here I thought this would be a great, quick and to the point workout, but that is definitely not the case. Typically I do the video after already having done cardio so was very irritated to find a long cardio workout before the ab exercises began. Also she spends too much time giving instructions for each exercise, I found myself wishing she would just hurry up the whole time. I also bought the 8 minute video series and maybe that is why this one is so disappointing. I recommend buying 8 minute ab if you are in a hurry and don't want to deal with an annoying instructor!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not very good","review":"I purchased this dvd because of the reviews i read on amazon.com. SORRY I did that. Tamilee acts like we all have bodies like her now. She goes to fast and even though there are 3 different workouts, one for arms, abs and buns, you can't chose to do three in a row. You can do one and then go out and chose another and so on. It is just too much trouble and time consuming to workout with her. Not to mention the poor quality. This dvd sucks in my opinion. I hate that I wasted my money on this.Sorry Tamilee but you don't get my vote on this dvd."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 on 1 Training","review":"We all know that Tamilee has that body.

I had no idea what I was getting myself into. I consider myself to be pretty fit -- I spin and/or run a few times a week, do some weight training etc. So I thought I'd get this DVD for the days when it was just too cold to leave my apt. I began with Program 2 of I Want Those Buns. I was completely cocky about it and figured it would be a breeze. It wasn't exactly a breeze, but it wasn't too difficult either. HOWEVER, I was quickly humbled the next day when I could barely sit on my \\"buns.\\" It was a good kind of pain -- the kind that accompanies truly efficient workouts. This after just 15 minutes with Tamilee. I have similar stories with the other segments. I'm incredibly impressed with this DVD and highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An oldie but a goodie","review":"I've had this dvd for 4 or 5 years and its one I keep coming back to. If it had some exercises for chest and back it would be perfect. (Which is why it only gets 4, instead of 5 stars from me). As it is, a great workout that you can mix and match to make it as tough as you want. The exercises are solid and Tamilee really knows her stuff. Definitely a classic you should have in your exercise library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost Perfect","review":"I love this DVD. I love that there are six intense 15-minute sections I can pick from for arms, abs and buns/legs depending on how much time I have. I love to add these sections onto other workouts, mainly after cardio. I also love that she does about 3 sets of most exercises which makes that difference between 'toning' and getting the muscles really worked. I gave it only 4 stars because there is nothing for chest or back, but I still think this is an excellent DVD. It is somewhat fast-paced which gets my heart rate up if I use heavy weights, but still easy to follow and Tamilee is very friendly, natural and motivating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Toning Workouts","review":"This DVD has 6 workouts, 2 for Arms, 2 for Abs, 2 for Buns. Each is 15+ each with the brief warmup. I had been doing Kathy Smith's Time Saver Lift Weights to Lose Weight pretty exclusively for toning - 20 minutes upper body, 20 minutes lower body and a 7 Min Ab routine. I needed a change/mix-up to my routine and bought this DVD. The Ab sections are challenging to say the least. The Buns incorporate lunges and squats and your rear is definitely feeling it the next day. The Arm sections are OK - Program 1 seemed a little too easy for me. The only down side the the arm program is that it really only concentrates on the arm muscles - and not so much on your chest or back. If you are a beginner, I'd definitely stick to Program 1 for each segment at first. I alternate Programs and even though I'm a pretty avid exerciser, there are times when I'm ready for the 15 minutes to be over!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best workout videos available","review":"I've purchased quite a few workout videos over the years, beginning with the original \\"Buns of Steel\\" series many years ago. Because I was familiar with Tamilee Webb's instruction style and the quality of her workouts, I had no qualms purchasing this set. What I love is that there are six 15 minute workout programs (2 each for abs, arms & buns), perfect when your pressed for time. Each workout leaves me feeling great - most of the moves are unique and challenging, but not so brutally difficult that you'll dread (and skip!) your next workout. When I finish the routines, I feel that I've done something effective and healthy for my body (as opposed to some workout videos which just feel like plain ol' torture and quickly end up in the 'donate' pile.) Tamilee's cuing is excellent and she's encouraging without being patronizing or annoying ~ a rare find in a video fitness instructor.

I am a small framed girl who gained 55 lbs during pregnancy (when I quit working out.) About 10 weeks after giving birth, I felt huge and my belly was still jiggly. I decided to try some post- pregnancy DVDs. None of them were giving me any results. I started watching this DVD again and slowly tried the routines again. It took a few weeks to build my muscles back up. I once again have a waist!

Okay, if you don't like the DVD say so, but let's leave insults out of it. I love the way this DVD is making me look: not as great as Tamilee, granted, but the most toned and defined I've been in my life (and I'm in my late thirties).

Try it - only one in thousands would be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, quick workout","review":"This video is fabulous.

(I've gone from a 6 to a 2, yay!) I've only done the level 1 workouts so far, but for me, that's enough. The only downside about this video is that the background music is somewhat annoying, but on the DVD you can turn off the music, and just have the instructors voice, and put on your own cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast Results!","review":"It's fast and easy! Tamilee keeps it simple and thinkgs start to look tighter after the first week if excercises are done at least 3 times. This DVD goes great with Tighter Assests: Weight Loss. I love it and I'm getting a firmer body."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Workout for Home","review":"I felt the burn for 2 days later. Good structure of beginner/intermediate to intermediate/advanced."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW great DVD","review":"YUP I like it! Has 2 levels in three focus, abs, arms and buns. I did too much the first time, and I got really sore, so take care!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tamilee Rocks!","review":"Since 1994 I have been working out with Tamilee Webb. I have also tried numerous other tapes by different instructors...you know, whatever the latest craze might be at the time. I still have never encountered a better instructor than Tamilee. She talks you through each workout set and lets you know how to do each exercise correctly. I have just started using this DVD again and already, after just two weeks, I can see NOTICABLE definition and firming. I would recommend this DVD to anyone, and if you are not in great shape like me, just ease into each routine, doing only one set (instead of all three) until you feel strong enough to do them all. I have purchased this DVD and other Tamilee Webb video's for many friends and family members over the past ten years and everyone I have introduced her workouts to agree; she is the best!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great video! However...","review":"I found that this video was very good -- it works the muscles it states it will work. HOWEVER -- if you don't know the \\"routine\\" it is a very hard video to follow. Once I learned the actual moves, it was easier. It does work, don't get me wrong, but it definitely should be watched a few times before even attempting it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh my goodness! I Love this DVD","review":"The only words I can say about Tamilee is WOW! I did her work out and didn't feel anything untill the next day after! I was like oh MY GOODNESS im so sore lol! I love the fact that Tamilee has done research on the BEST workout routines for OUR bodies. I have never heard of an instructor and or fitness prgram that takes there time to make sure that YOU get the most effective workout!I read the reviews before I bought my dvd and NEVER heard any negative comments about Tamilee and I am sooo glad I bought this dvd. I love also to how it's didvided into 2 sections and you go at YOUR pace. I am soo greateful that I read the reviews and now amd writing my very own. If you need help in your areas like I do and want a workout that you will definately FEEL and see? This is for you, you will NOT be dissapointed. I know that I am not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very challenging & one of my favorites","review":"I made the mistake one weekend of doing all 6 workouts back to back...ouch! Love the second arm workout and the results can be seen fast. The abs workouts were challenging am\\\\nd I will return to those when my tummy is stronger. I too thought the second buns workout started easier but the isometric exercises make ir more intense...especially if you squeeze during them. A good dvd that I will utilize more in the future to upgrade my workouts. Would not recommend for beginners. The only thing I hate about it is the lab video that is on before every set of exercises. Once is enough!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great workout!","review":"I just picked this video back up after taking a break. I have a few workout videos, like Tae-bo, but this is my favorite. After only 2-3 weeks of doing the Abs one, I already started to notice definition in my abs. The arms programs are a bit more frustrating for me. The tricept and shoulder exercises I feel a lot (I use very old 3.3 lb weights) but I almost never feel it in my biceps! Sometimes I will do Arms program 1 and 2 just to make sure I am working my arms out. As for the Buns, I found that Program 2 is better for me since I have knee problems. Program 1 is just squats over and over and after the first set, my knee would give out and I would do the exercises wrongly. I find I can do at least 8 out of the 12 reps in Program 2 for each exercise and still feel good when I'm done! Just doing one program from each when I exercise, and the time flies by!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The HOLY GRAIL of fitness DVDs","review":"This video is the best - you get alot for your money, because 6 fifteen minute segments - 90 minutes. There are 2 programs each for your abs, legs, and arms. Each program is challenging and effective (especially the 2nd Abs program!!!). Try it out on a day that you don't have to walk the next day! The sumo-squats in the Legs program one are a killer!! The DVD is great, because you can pick and choose what parts you want to work out. I like to do one program from each category. I love Tamilee Webb because her cueing is right on and she is serious, but also fun to watch and listen to.... not annoying (like some other video instructers). This is a staple in my workout DVD collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"good workout","review":"I recently purchased this dvd & have only done program 1 in each section, but i could feel the burn & soreness in my muscles as i was doing the exercises & the next day - in every spot that was worked. i would recommend this dvd to anyone looking to target the abs, arms, & buns. at first i was disappointed that there was no specific workout program for the thighs, however it isnt needed b/cause the thighs get a workout in the buns segment."},{"rating":"2","title":"good choice","review":"Good workout video for only 15 min. per session.After doing the video for 2 weeks straight I could tell the difference.My only complaint was that Tamilee doesn't give very explicit instructions for all of the moves.It was a little hard to follow at first.If you are looking for a decent workout for a small amount of time,this is a good choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT WORKOUT!!!","review":"I love this DVD! I have always liked Tamilee Webb's videos and instruction technique--she is very clear and not at all annoying like some exercise gurus. This is a very thorough workout and even gets the heartrate up. The exercises and routines are easy to follow and there are two programs for each muscle group (abs, arms, buns) for different difficulty levels. The Program One workouts are tough, but still doable for a beginner. I plan to make this DVD a regular addition to my workout!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A challenge you will get!!!","review":"Very good and challenging. In her DVD there are no breaks that what makes it such a challege. If you want to tone those abs, thighs, or buns this is it. She has a wide variety of excercises to do. I've bought work out DVD before and after I viewed them they were given to someone else or thrown out. You will definately not do it to this DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wish I'd have found this sooner....","review":"This DVD is GREAT!! Broken down into 6, 15 minutes segments (2 abs, 2 arms, 2 buns), this DVD works great as a supplement on light cardio days (a refreshing walk in the brisk winter air!) or to squeeze in a bit of weight training while the kids nap :-) Tamilee is the best....there's no messing around with this girl, she knows her stuff and makes sure you get the job done with moves that really work. Try this, you'll love it!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Appliqué and material very scratchy on baby!","review":"I received this hooded towel as a gift at my baby shower and I have to say I am not very impressed with it. It feels very cheap and the appliqué in the hooded part is terrible! Agree that the material is more absorbent than others I have but I have to say the towels I have found to work best on baby are the ones I use for the shower! Baby towels are cute but function wise, save your $$ and just buy some super absorbent regular bath towels. They are all over soft for baby and work best!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute!","review":"Pay attention to the size... I didn't, and was surprised at how big it was.

I don't think amazon.com has an edited version of this movie but you should just look somewhere else for a good clean edited version of sailor moon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very informative movie","review":"This was an informative historical video in as much as it shows (hopefully) the viewer how an attempt has been made to propagandize the Arab/Israeli conflict. It was definitely made with one purpose in mind. Throughout the entire film not one mention was made of the death and destruction that the Zionists committed against the Arab population. Not one reference was made about the brutal murders that were committed by the Zionist militias like the Irgun. Or how almost a million Arabs were driven from their homes and communities. On a scale of 1 to 10, I give it a 10 for blatant bias alone. History is never one-sided, despite what's portrayed by films like this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well 3 cheers!","review":"Not only is this a nicely made charm, but the designer actually included the entire state!

Brandon Flowers has lyrics like, \\"he doesn't look a thing like Jesus\\", and has a catchy tune with the chorus sounding like U2. If you're willing to spend the $13 for the 3 songs, you'll definately get what you paid for.

The PC and WMP did not recognize the product - and no reason was given. The manual is written for dummies but with out any content!

Hedging strategies explained are inadequate at best with no explanation or regard to the cost of the hedge as it would relate to risk vs. return. Author tries to tell you that if you have an overnight position you should hedge so that you can sleep better. Author also describes the 30 or so different commodity contracts very briefly with no fundamental insight whatsoever. You can get more from looking at the exchange web sites.

I read through the book, and lem'me tell ya, im glad he's only hung up on the eldritch blast. The imbue item power, by itself, is enough to make this class overpowered. I made a character with duel wand wielding, (another new feat herein), and he turned into a gunfighter with as many and as diverse a wand as he wanted. If you're a power gamer and you really wanna piss your dm off, the warlock class is for you. It has the ability at third level to be abused via the normal incantations.

The feats are the same, the artwork is the same, the only add ons are culled from other books and magazines, basically a reprint all around. The book has the Warlock in it, a class where you can do ranged touch attacks with spell-like augmentations at will in an energy type that has no ER to counter it. Neat. In a sick, out-of-balance way. Run one of these at equal level against a party of 10th or higher and watch them cry when the EXP is so low. I would think facing a 20th level lich with a few minions would be desirable over dealing with a 16th level Warlock with the same minions!Not the worse buy you could make if you don't have Tome and Blood, the Feats are really good, but certainly not worth the price tag.

It also has an extremely good assortment of creative prestige classes, some so cool that I changed the direction of at least one of my characters so they could take a prestige class from this book.Overall, a great supplement for anyone that likes to play an arcane caster a lot or wants to try one of a different kind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Might be good, but all the $$$ necessary for D&D is lame","review":"Here's why D&D; supplements (ie SPLAT books) are good:If you want a lot of extra rules, occasionally some good new optiosn, and the ability for your players to make characters that are overpowered -- without a single magic item. And when the overpowered characters DO get an item, look out!Here's why they suck:I'm happy they pumped the Wizards & Sorcerors... but if you buy the D&D; game, you're looking at hundreds of dollars of books.The whole system needs to be revamped. A roleplaying game shouldn't cost players, GM's, or fans hundreds of dollars.Players & GM's, go find a cheaper yet also good RPG like Call of Cthulhu, Amber Diceless, Paranoia, Hackmaster, ShadowRun, etc. Or just DON'T buy all the expansions!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Trash","review":"An excellent prop to steady a wonky coffee table, prepare to be dissappointed as there is little favorable that can be said of this book apart from a few moderately interesting prestige classes, a handful new magic items and relitively little else.Considered in totality i found it to be of marginal utility to players or GMs and believe much of the information here to be unbalanced with the existing framework of the game. Everything within the book is presented in the context of being bigger and better than before. I had hoped the book would embrace diversity and develop new (original) concepts that were well thought through and balanced against the existing infrastructure. I firmly believe wizards of the coast have failed to maintain the integrity of the D&D; branding on this product.

Sunflower seeds are healthy; they're rich in that \\"good\\" fat that lowers your cholesterol; and I think they're also rather tasty. This final adjective, however, doesn't describe Sunridge Farms' Organic Sunflower Seeds. I opened the first bag. Took a couple of bites and then spit them out. I tried a second bag. Same reaction. I wondered whether or not there was something wrong with my own taste, so I offered them to someone whose sense of taste I respect. She had the same reaction I had. In short, these sunflower seeds are inedible. It's like chewing on rancid, tasteless cardboard. I threw out the entire shipment. There are far better options available."},{"rating":"1","title":"allergens not listed correctly on amazon","review":"I think the allergy statement on this page is REALLY MISLEADING. It only warns about peanuts and tree nuts, when actually the package also mentions a number of other allergens that these sunflower seeds were exposed to. If there was no allergen statement, I would have contacted the manufacturer to find out the allergen statement for this product. But because there is allergen info in the description on Amazon, I assumed that it was the complete list, so I went ahead and ordered these, only to find out that actually these \\"may contain\\" wheat and other allergens. My family is very allergic to wheat. So now we've got a ton of useless sunflower seeds. I think the description of this product should contain either a current allergen listing, or no allergen listing, but not an incomplete one -- that's misleading."},{"rating":"1","title":"motorola v710/e815","review":"The product does not work. the charger does not charge my e815 and the leather strap popped within 2 days. the ear piece does not pick up well. will send back if i find time. found a better product that works for less on ebay"},{"rating":"1","title":"Only worth it if it's free","review":"I got this kit for free with my Motorola V710 phone.

It deals with the big idea of grace in an easy to read way. Much of the book is vivid narratives about the lives of the Apostle Paul and John Newton (the man who wrote the hymn Amazing Grace). I could easily picture the scenes he described. In addition to the storytelling is some great reflections on the nature of grace. The reflections are divided up into the sections of grace for the past, grace for the present and grace for the future.I think this is a book that will be helpful in some way to all Christians, whether they be new Christians coming to understand grace for the first time or not so new Christians rediscovering the wonder of the grace they already know.

Great spirituality - one really feels the depth. Very different from, say, Gardiner's shallow merry melodies. But..., well, Ted Libbey in his classical cd guide wrote:(as far as I remember) \\"... the Kingsway Hall ambience survives\\". In my opinion, the size of the Hall changes a lot from track to track on this cd. And the orchestra sounds as if they were sitting on each other.

The article below tells you a little more about the challenges of the recording engineers of the day, and yet this recording quality is unsurpassed even with modern digital equipment and its comparative ease of use.[...]While a tiny amount of background noise can be detected just before the first track starts, it is not otherwise discernible.The close interraction and working relationship between orchestra and conductor gives this piece a warmth and quality I do not sense on many recordings.

Of course, there is a wide variety of experiences and opinions about the merits of the U.S. occupation (or lack thereof).Why I think this book is strange is: I assumed from the title and the background of the author that this was supposed to be a critical account of U.S. policy in Iraq. While reading it, however, I started thinking that maybe the U.S. presence isn't going as badly as people (such as the author's employer, Pacifica Radio) would have us believe.I gave it 2 stars not for ideological or political reasons but just because I didn't think the book was very well written. If you want to read about the Iraqi occupation, I'm sure there are better books out there more worth your time (and mine).Not terrible but not recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly Credible Account","review":"Aaron Glantz, along with everyone else in their right mind, is obviously critical of the US presence in Iraq, however, his account is unique in several important respects. First of all, due to his courageous approach in working outside of areas secured by US forces, he offers unique insights into how this disaster continues to evolve. Secondly, his perspective is refreshingly credible; the reader can easily follow how and why he arrives at his conclusions. In most critical analyses of the Iraq invasion and occupation, the authors seem to have already made up their minds, and proceed to justify their conclusions. Unlike such hysterical screeds, Glantz's book is not only highly credible, but exceptionally well written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun for the kiddos","review":"My kid really likes Infantino puzzles.

They replaced something they called a reflection board. Then, a month later; POP! Same problem. No picture, and now the part is on backorder. No one can tell us when it will arrive. I've been told to FAX a copy of our receipt to them and they will consider replacement. Why do I think that will take even weeks longer?

I dont care if there is only \\"so much Jimi\\"A good example of concert producing and camera work is the Led Zeppelin DVD set released in 03 and pick and Austin City Limits concerts on PBS. why is this so complicated to learn? one would think a monkey could do this right.Listened with Sennheiser 595's, the best that I have found, had 555 for a couple years they are nice too, but cant touch 595's, pay the dif and see, er I mean hear.buy the Gypsies Live CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Skipper","review":"It paused and skipped through the whole DVD, except for the interviews with other people, at the beginning. I was really disappointed with the quality of the DVD. This includes both DVD's."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Hendrix DVD","review":"The production is not too bad, especially for a live concert. The footage of Hendrix does not have any added material mixed into it (a few shots of the crowd). I really liked the second guitarist in the band. It would have been nice to have had more of that sort of thing in Hendrix performances. The other Hendrix DVDs are of what look to be great performances, but the production quality is poor, or the event itself had problems or you have people imposing their impressions of the event onto the performance. With this one, you can sit back, watch Hendrix perform, its reasonably well produced and a good sampling of Hendrix works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Concert DVD","review":"This DVD is a concert that Jimi Hendrix did at the Woodstock festival. The music, of course, is wonderful. The audio quality is actually very good, none of the songs are hard to hear, and everything is crisp and tight. One of the benefits of this particular DVD, is that it has the bonus disk. On this disk, it shows an amateur video of the concert taken by a guy who sneaked on stage during it. If you are a fan of Hendrix, you should already own this concert and not be reading a review. However, if you don't own it, get it as soon as possible. If you are not a Hendrix fan, this concert is still great, because it depicts the \\"hipi\\" music very well. I highly recomend this great concert to any one."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW","review":"I heard Eddie Kramer say that this is not one of Jimi's better performances.......I can see that maybe it is not his most consistent, but some of his performances are as bad as it gets. (Bad in the best sense of the word)This really is some of the greatest electric guitar playing ever captured, and the sound of this DVD is outstanding. Crank it up on the surround sound!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Check this out","review":"OK, I agree that there is a lot of Hendrix at Woodstock video out there, but this one is different. There's this gut that snuck onto the stage as part of the film crew, and video taped( yea folks, this was the early days of video) Hendrix at Woodstock. Part two of this dvd set is the black ang white video tape of the show, and it is an insight into the world of performing onstage. It is great to watch Jimi directing this fledging band with a movement of his guitar neck or a wink of the eye.Check this dvd set out, it has footage that says it all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Music, Bad Film","review":"I believe there were four cameras at Woodstock recording Jimi's performance. The best camera position was just in front of him, at stage level. If the \\"editors\\" of this film had used mostly that camera angle, this would be an outstanding film of a great performance. Instead, it's the most amateurish and useless editing I've ever seen. We get prolonged close-ups of Jimi's nostrils, the back of his head, his finger tips, and people sitting in the audience looking mostly miserable and bored. It's a tragedy, so irritating that I can't even watch it anymore (and I'm Jimi's biggest fan)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Audio is not as good as the 1999 Edition!","review":"While I share all the other reviewers thumbs-up on this re-issue, I did notice that the stereo audio track was somewhat different from the 1999 truncated (i.e. edited down to 50 minutes) DVD version. I did some A-B testing with 2 DVD players and lo and behold this is what I found: While both versions of the stereo audio track were mixed by Eddie Kramer, the 1999 Dolby Stereo soundtrack is mastered at 448 kbps, while the 2005 is at 198 kbps. The result is that the 1999 version has less compression and more dynamic range and headroom. It does make a big difference when you play them side by side! I guess they had to do this in the 2005 version to accomodate the longer playing time and the 5.1 soundtracks, which the 1999 version did not have. I guess I'll have to keep both versions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Read!","review":"This book is about a young piano player Elly and Jake a vet. who have a love affair as teenagers and end up expecting a child.

The costumes, story line and acting are just perfect. I especially enjoy the little details, as when the carpets were rolled back for a wedding, the maids came to wax the dance floor.The scenes in the prison are made to look realistic, with grubby, dirty walls and poor lighting. You can almost feel the cold, clammy atmosphere.Maggie Smith has absolutely the best lines!! She can say the most cutting things with a perfectly straight face!

Downton Abbey captures all the style and grace of aristocratic England without the stuffiness one might expect from an English period piece. The characters are all unique and their story lines create a patchwork quilt of subplots that continue to draw in the audience as it moves from one story to another.A soap opera? Perhaps, but the most stylish and engaging that I've ever seen. All class and no trash."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best TV ever!","review":"Truly a great series.

This series is amazing, with a richness of character development not seen in years. It's wonderfully written, the actors are amazing, with the sets and characters giving us a glimpse into a bygone era. When I was a little girl, we used to 'dress' for dinner and I never really understood why...now I do. My parents were just trying to uphold a 'standard' one they were not able to uphold for long. I've now lived long enough to see so many 'standards' and traditions leave for a more casual lifestyle befitting the trends of the day. How interesting it is to watch a way of life ease away.

This was recommended to us by friends. Thankfully, Amazon has all 3 seasons available for instant download. I went through all three seasons in less than 2 weeks and am looking forward to season 4.

You're not the brightest crayon in the box2. You're not the sharpest knife in the drawer3. You don't care for excellent screenwriting4. Outstanding acting bores you5. Sumptuous costuming, sets, and locations don't suit your personal aesthetic6. Bridging the concept of all people from all walks of life and all eras have many of the same life issues doesn't pertain to you7. You can't understand why anyone with the name \\"Lady Violet\\" would be appealing to a smart, smarmy, fashionable clod such as yourself8. You don't like period pieces9.

First Sybil and now Matthew?? Can we not find drama without having to have everyone die off the show??? That is my only qualm with the series to date.The show really portrays how I would picture the time period, every detail of it. The attention to detail even for the surroundings is wonderful. I give many 'props', if you will, to the acting, directing, production, etc. for the series. The writers are wonderful, with the exception of the above mentioned. I hope to season 4 brings MUCH more happiness than death!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Jumped the shark in Season 3 due to schlepie bo beppie writers","review":"Spoiler alert - I naively wrote a friend of mine in England about how enjoyable I thought the video was. He wrote back to ask me how i could stand this tripe and then began to point out all the upcoming ruination of the Family.I should have known it was going off with the every episode a cliff hanger in season 2.Now we have an avid thinking feminist, Sybil, not only marrying a Roman Catholic, she becomes one in a church where mysogyny is the default protocol. In Season 2, we'd seen the father who manages neither his farm nor his money pushing himself on a maid, here he loses all both money and reputation. Then you thought it was bad enough for William to die but NOOO they have to kill off Matthew. The list is endless. Too bad they fired the good writers and went with the hacks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Used DVD","review":"I am hoping the DVD will work.

ALL TV should be this good!!!DA is a masterpiece of artistry in location, sets, lighting, production, directing, acting and storytelling. As a program director and videographer I really appreciate the exceptional visual quality, some of the camera moves are without equal. As one who hand held a video camera for a single 9 minute walk through yacht shot on Live TV I know how difficult it is to travel with a camera and rigging hanging from you. The photographers are constantly delighting us with extraordinary long moving shots that are so well staged and choreographed.

My mom told me about it and at first I was hesitant, but decided to give it a try. Wow, am I glad I did. I had just finished reading Canadce Camp romance novels which take place in Europe, very Jane Austin like, but with hot and heavy love scenes. Because I was reading of an era long ago with Earls,Lords,Butlers,Maids, and young women needing to find a husband while attending the Ton, I was in the mood for Downton Abbey. The scenery is amazing, the music is fantastic, the acting superb, and the plot is so good, I can't wait to see the next episode. My husband, who favors action thrillers, is even addicted to it. The only thing I don't understand is why the uncut U.K. version isn't aired on PBS. I don't know the difference, for I have only watched the uncut versions because I buy it on Amazon so I can watch them anytime on my Kindle.

More than likely, I will watch it first on TV, then again on DVD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Server capacity","review":"The program downtown abbey is excellent. You must improve and expand your capacity. It is hard between eight and eleven to get connected and the quality and speed once one is connected is slow. You can and should fix this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ying and Yang...","review":"I am heart broken as I write this review; first because of the last scene in season 3 and second, because it is over for now....what a wonderful story. So full of true life, the loss and heartache, the ecstatic joy of life. Downton is full of lessons and shows how we all are touched by the good and bad, no matter if we are rich or poor. Bravo! Artfully and tastefully done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"How can you NOT love this show? Once you accept it's really a period soap-opera and go with the flow, it's quite a fun ride!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Addictive","review":"I was totally enthralled and can't wait for season Four. It was historically accurate and I loved the fashions. They were so elegant. Very interesting saga. Well developed interesting characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Holding true to history versus being relevant to today's society","review":"I have really enjoyed the series. However, the story line does not hold true to how things REALLY were in the early 20th century concerning homosexual behavior. Thomas would have really been imprisoned and not promoted. Though I understand wanting to relate to society today, the story line does not hold true to that time in history. It wasn't really until the 1980s that the homosexual lifestyle was more accepted. And even, then, it's only been in the last 15 years that it's become less of an inigma in society."},{"rating":"1","title":"crabby abbey","review":"There are some fine moments -- Thomas and James sorting it out near the end for instance; the beauty of the Scottish landscape, etc. but the writer finds no way to develop the relationship between Matthew and Mary other than to have them off each other or sentimentally enrapt with little in the way of nuances. This lack of development reflects a lack of imagination or interest in complex human interaction. Since the first two seasons were primarily driven by the chemistry between these two characters and the possibilities of bringing them together, this two dimensional and clumsy handling of their marriage has the effect of letting all the air out of the balloon. Instead, we get a shifting of focus from one relationship or situation to another to keep us interested. It works for a time but sooner or later the audience wants to be fed and most of what transpires is not satisfying. Killing off characters is dramatic as death has a way of stealing a scene or two, but good drama it is not."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING - THIS VERSION IS NOT THE ORIGINAL!","review":"I absolutely love Downton Abbey. I pre-ordered this DVD believing that it truly is the original UK version. I am sad to say that this is an edited version! If you watch the episode on pbs.org and then watch the episode on the DVD you will find that there are scenes left out. Thirty seconds here, thirty seconds there. The advertising is incorrect.

But I've been watching it in re-runs and now I'm hooked.In episode 3, the Dowager Countess (Maggie Smith) delivers some zingers, Matthew Crawley (Dan Stevens) saves the day, and Bates' murder plot develops. But poor Edith. Will she ever get happiness? Another fine episode. I missed watching Sunday night and couldn't wait until it came on-line, so I bought the episode. Well worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top Quality","review":"Excellent production with outstanding performances, beautiful staging, costumes and a knock-out cast.

Those scenes that were a little dull in the script were offset by the acting, costumes, and scenery, which has always been excellent. I continue to highly recommend DA and look forward to Season 4.

But the show's creators spiced up Season Two & I soon found myself looking forward to each episode!!The overwhelming question: Can they keep it up? The trailer includes several promising subplots, & I fervently hope this season delivers all the guilty pleasure it promises. On that note, it was too bad they had to kill off that gorgeous Turk.

Lord Grantham turned into an obstructionist at every turn: the doctor for Sybil, fighting Mathew's ideas to modernize, and not supporting Edith's plan to write for the paper. First Sybil dies in childbirth...ok that did happen in that time period. Now Mathew is dead! Really?? Are they hoping people will tune in to see who else gets bumped off in the next season? The whole thing with Shirley McLane did not work for me either and neither did the time spent on the fact that Thomas was gay, or the young teenage girl staying with them. Why?? The other episodes have taken us into the reality of their lives during war and changing time. Season 3 has lost the magic and should be deleted. Hopefully, the writers can get back on track and produce to a higher standard again in Season 4."},{"rating":"1","title":"Audo out of sync","review":"Audio was out of sync. Was not worth $1.99. Would not recommend it. I hope future video purchases are better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Time to quit","review":"I just finished watching the final episode of Season 3, and I am done watching this series. It began faltering in season 2. It seems that the producers/writers are beginning to use the \\"let's kill off a character to get things moving again\\" method. Give me a break. First we see Sibyl die and her child left motherless, now we see Matthew die and his child left fatherless. I guess it has been decided that no one deserves to have any happiness longer than a couple episodes. What a cheap shot. You killed off one of your best characters, folks, and one that the series has revolved around from the beginning. This series is starting to remind me of the endless X-Files series where the viewer was constantly dangled the alien carrot with no resolution, the difference being that instead of the elusive aliens, we are being asked to jump from one transitory character to another and thank them for it. Sayonara."},{"rating":"1","title":"So far a disappointing third season","review":"Is it my imagination or does Season 3 appear to be stuck in the mud? I'm rather appalled that Mary's whole focus is getting Matthew's money just to invest in a lifestyle that is outdated and archaic... Maggie Smith still delivers the best lines with panache. Shirley McLaine was a huge waste of time despite the glowing reviews. And goodness, Edith once again gets the short end of the stick! Perhaps Dan Stephens saw the writing on the wall and jumped ship at the end of this eason..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Weekly Watcher","review":"Season 3 of Downton Abbey was as the previous 2 seasons were, excellent, captivating and moving.

Very disappointing finish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to snuff","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed the first two seasons, but the 3rd has been a disappointment!! While 3rd season is nice, it's not the same level of writing or plot development and terminating the second character (no spoils here) is ridiculous, given all the other circumstances.

Last night, while surfing the internet on my laptop for Charlotte Russe recipes for next week's viewing party, I decided I needed another peek at Ethel's masterpiece, so I popped over to PBS.org for another look, rather than get up and fiddle with the TV and remote. Of course, you can't just re-watch one scene so...much to my surprise there were Thomas and O'Brien in the corridor discussing Jimmy/James!

I think the set of \\"extras\\" for season 3 may be the best in the series, and worth watching even if you don't like Downton. You can even watch them first, as I did, and not really get an episode spoiled with advance details- good stuff.The stories are still at their high level of quality, the detail of the sets is amazing, great casting- better all around than just about any \\"American\\" television.I'm waiting for season 4 now, already planning to buy it too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant series","review":"Well written, well casted, well acted series.

I can't believe I waited to so long to watch it, and now that I've watched all the past episodes, I eagerly await the playing of the next episode on PBS. The costumes, jewelry, furnishings, castle, grounds...all are magnificent! The storylines are well written and wonderfully performed. I can't think of anything I do not particularly relish of this show at all....You MUST watch from the first episode, however, or you may become muddled in the stories, but it is well worth it to immerse yourself in it. Love, love, love Maggie Smith -- she was perfectly cast for her role! Can't say enough good about it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Doesn't Dissappoint","review":"If at all possible, Season 3 outdoes the previous 2 seasons. Shirley vs Maggie!

The story lines continue to keep me interested - some are predictable, but enough twists are thrown in that it doesn't get boring.

I wasn't sure watching it on such a small screen would be as engrossing as on a large screen, but it was. The series itself is, for me, the best thing on television and of course I can hardly bear the thought of having to wait months and months to learn what happens next - and no, I won't spoil it for those who haven't seen it, other than to say there appears to be no end for new beginnings.

Of course anything by Masterpiece has been good but this is GREAT. I plan on purchasing all the season and giving the as gifts for my families. Yeah to the producers of this show. We love it and I wait each week for the new episode. I have several of my freind hooked as well. This is good, quality family television.

So when we saw this Downton Abbey Season 3 [HD] episode 2 [EU version] available on Amazon Prime we thought it would be worth it to pay $3 to see it early. What a surprise and waste of money. We had already seen it. It was the last part of the american version episode one.Don't waste your money on the Amazon version. Watch it only on PBS. They have the FULL episodes free and you don't get the \\"half\\" episodes you get on Amazon. The equivalent of the PBS version on Amazon would cost you $6 on prime since you would have to purchase two full Amazon versions to equal one PBS version.

I was not impressed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Although I have enjoyed DA I was very frustrated with the way they killed off Matthew. Most disappointed because I understand it was the actor playing the role who wanted out, to 'do more challenging roles,' etc. Celeberties are in the buisness to entertain. Thats why they do it. If it was all in the name of artistic expression then he should have stayed with stage performance. Very dissapointing on all points. Hope there is some way the directors/writers can dig their way out, or I'm sure the next season will be the last if it is not cancelled."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHY ARE THESE DVD'S EDITED FROM THE ORIGINAL VERSION?","review":"To everyone out there purchasing these DVD\\"s. Do you know that you're being cheated and ripped off? These DVD's, all of them, all 3 seasons, have been EDITED for content. All these DVD's are missing KEY SCENES from each episode. I want to know why? I've PURCHASED these DVD's and I'm entitled to receive them and veiw them in their entirety! For example, season 3, episode 5. For those of you who already have the season 3 DVD's watch episode 5 - then re-watch episode 5 on TV if you have Exfinity On Demand. Do you see how many wonderful, decent and pertinent scenes are missing? I love Downton Abbey! I purchased the series on DVD so that I could own and watch and re-watch something wonderful. I didn't get what I paid for - a series that is UNCUT and UNEDITED. I hope I'm not the only person who is as angry and disappointed as I am.

Much of the content seen on TV is missing. The final regular season episode is actually missing about 1 hour's worth of content. The whole Thomas-gets-in-trouble thing is completely missing.

Used Amazon instant video to purchase this season thru the TV pass so I was able to watch the entire season BEFORE it aired which is a great service offered by Amazon and very reasonably priced. If you haven't watched the show, just make it through the first 3 episodes of season 1 which are admittedly slow and you'll find yourself at Amazon buying the seasons."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money.The episodes are edited, badly.","review":"I ended up buying this set about 2/3 of the way through the PBS run of Season 3. The fact that they are marked \\"Original UK Edition\\" led me to believe that these were more definitive editions than those being broadcast in the US right now, with additional footage. Nothing could be further from the truth! These have whole swaths of dialogue and even entire scenes missing as compared to the PBS episodes, often making the story less clear or reducing the impact of scenes that were set up earlier, in scenes that are now missing. These actually watch like a dumbed-down version of the Downton we know and love. I was extremely disappointed and I cannot recommend these discs to anyone unless they have no other option for watching the series. It also makes me very wary of purchasing anything from PBS's DVD label in the future, if I cannot trust them to present their shows in an unedited format."},{"rating":"2","title":"Instant Classic!","review":"I'm obsessed with Downton Abbey and so happy to have season 3 in my collection now!

Very good acting & correct historical perspective. The story line of the upper crusts & the servants is a wonderful political statement. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Downton Abbey","review":"The art of the scenes and clothes are top-notch quality and I love watching the show every week. The episode that included the birth of a baby and subsequent death of Sybil was emotional, and I found myself crying over the bittersweet moment of a beginning of a life and also the end of another. My one little dislike of the show is the focus on Mr. Bates. It is just a tad unbelieveable (in writing terms) that one person could be accused of so many false charges and go through as much as he does. Also, he never gets upset??? I would be one raging howling lunatic to be the so-called innocent in a series of accusations. Maybe the writers have him calm and passive because he really is guilty and is fooling everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Disappointment! Spoiler alert!!!","review":"I was waiting and waiting for Season 3 and so far it's been total dissapointment...the plot is so old Edith at the church, the cancer scare, the shirts dissapear etc etc nothing new.

Back in November, I purchased the UK version through Amazon UK to watch on my region free DVD player. I was very happy with it, but I was still looking forward to receiving my blu-ray version and watching it in high def.When I watched it on PBS, I was stunned to see (edited: a good 8-10 additional scenes that were not shown in the UK version), and the whole series hasn't even been shown yet.

I just received the entire Season 3 set yesterday.My computer won't recognize this disk. If Windows Media tries to open it, I get a message \\" Disk is empty\\". If the Blue Ray DVD software on the computer (CyberLinkPower - came with the Dell a year ago) tries to open it I get an error code and says it may not play newer movies without an update. SO I update and it doesn't see the DVD. If I use VLC media player, it says disk is empty.I don't want to watch on BluRay player simply because my husband isn't into this and that means it's in 'his domain'.I gave up and sent it back since I couldn't play this on my device(s).I'm sure of course, the CONTENT is amazing.

My grandmother could have been one of those daughters - she grew up in a large house in England and was the same age - so it helped me understand a lot about her, especially her comment that her family had lost all their money in WW1.Such a fascinating cast and such good understanding of the various personalities and the relationships and tensions - personal and professional - between each individual.I recommend this to anyone who likes good believable acting with a good script"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great show.","review":"This season is packed full of great twists and new cast members.

Especially important for a show with such high production values. However, the audio had issues with clipping and popping sounds. It did not seem to be in surround, more like stereo plus center channel. One episode actually came through very well for sound but rest did not. Unsure what the difference might have been. I have 10mbps+ cable internet service, usually well over.

The production values and the acting are tremendous.Inevitably, though, the script has to descend into soap from time to time to retain interest. Before this series the return of Matthew in the middle of the concert in the second series had been the soapiest but the last moments of the new series are pure soap. I'll watch and buy the fourth series but with a perhaps more critical eye on the exigencies of the script.Still a great effort by the team."},{"rating":"2","title":"I <3 Downton Abbey","review":"One of my favorites shows ever!

I've seen probably 80% of the shows and I was expecting a slow moving \\"soap opera\\". I was surprised that it is well written with many plots and sub plots that keep the story moving along. It also has plenty of antagonists and plot twists. Overall, I'd say it's no action flick and not for everyone but for me it boils down to a good story that it well acted. Finally, it is very well produced with elegant cinematography."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable to the Max!","review":"I have already recommended Downton Abbey to all my friends.

I now understand what all the hype is all about. I will say this is one of the best shows that I have seen. I am glad that I re-watched season 1, because the rented version had cut scenes. Reading reviews, the U.S. version has cut scenes, so I would recommend getting the UK Blueray version,plus are unable to play the UK DVD disc in our DVD players, so be sure to order the BlueRay version.

Season 3, episode 3 has several crucial scenes deleted! It is over 4 minutes shorter than the PBS broadcast and the storyline is disjointed because of the missing scenes.

They shouldnt take scripture out of context (he who is without sin shouldnt cast the first stone)He says that but at the same time he (Lord Grantham) is contradicting himself by saying homosexuality is a sin. But in the next breath says he was born that way.Which one is it? That's nothing more than confussion. If you want to condone sin, dont use the Bible to do it.2. If God made people homosexual he wouldnt call it an abomination (Lev 20:13)If a man also lie with mankind, as he lieth with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination: they shall surely be put to death; their blood [shall be] upon them.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Series","review":"I normally don't watch TV series but every once in a while one comes along that is worthy of my attention. For the last few years it has been Downton Abbey. The acting, costumes, and production are all top notch, the story lines are excellently written as well. I wish American TV could come up with something this compelling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Direct stream doesn't work well","review":"While episode itself is magnificent, it had stopped at least 6-7 times during my viewing and I had to re-start it all over again. Instead of 1 hour, it took me 2 and a half hours to finish."},{"rating":"2","title":"the grinch that stole christmas","review":"Downton Abbey deserves all the praise that it receives - acting, sets, costumes, drama, comedy, etc. However, the mischievous Julian Fellowes, the writer and creator of the show gleefully proclaims in one of the features in the third season that he is the grinch that stole Christmas and he certainly is that. He laughs that his audience will be crying at the end of the Christmas special - from the creator of cruel characters such as Thomas and O'Brien, I suppose we should not be surprised. J.K. Rowling was warned by other writers that killing off Harry Potter would jeopardize future sales of her books, so she came up with a creative solution. Fellowes did not. The world has enough injustice and misery without this. I will be selling all three sets today. I cannot see that will ever want to rewatch it, excellent as it was in many ways."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loving it just as much","review":"As I've written about the first two seasons, this is outstanding stuff particularly if you like British acting. It is accurately portrayed by the skillful thespians to represent the period following WWI where the long-entrenched aristocracy must either make their inheritances self-sustaining or face the unsavory dissolution of what has been long enjoyed. What's special about this series is that we are equally if not more interested in the goings on of the service personnel who have their own intrigues and relationships in their private world. Very entertaining stuff, great lines and deliveries thereof, and great sets and scenery."},{"rating":"2","title":"Historical soap-don't miss it!","review":"Each episode is a story unto itself whilst being a continuation in the saga of this family and its associated characters. Filmed on location in a superb setting, which makes for some historical accuracy not to mention eye candy, the series is a modern take on life of an aristocratic household and staff illustrating a social history of the period.Add to this the inevitable drama of three unmarried daughters and you have a modern-day soap with a lot of class!Written with warmth and wit by Julian Fellowes and with a well chosen casting, Downton Abbey proves to be an irresistible concoction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic show","review":"I am a huge fan of this show and this season didn't disappoint.

I love it. I am not tied to a room and can have great sound and video quality anywhere I choose to watch it and when I choose"},{"rating":"2","title":"Still better than most","review":"I don't rate Season 3 as highly as I did the previous 2 seasons. Without giving too much away, I'd say that one of the tenser story lines had a somewhat anti-climactic, hurried conclusion, another was dealt with in a more open-minded way then was probably likely for the time period, and there was a bit too much foreshadowing of the conclusion. However, this series is still better than most and I will probably continue watching them for as long as they make them. Some of the characters are absolutely wonderful, and they are all interesting in their own way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this show!!","review":"I missed this episode when it came on tv so I had to rent it.

It's like reading a good book. Getting engrossed into the story and not wanting the book to end.

It's a horror film about a woman who is doing a documentary about Goths, whom she calls the 'weekend vamps', and ends up getting involved in a lesbian relationship with a real vampire. I thought this movie was really good. It was also nice to see all the cool Goth characters and to have actual Goth music in the movie from bands like Fields of the Nephilim, Ghost of Lemora, Voices of Masada, Scary Bitches and NFD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mere Hype","review":"This kinda documentary look at the vampire/ goth scene has quite a bit of girl- girl kissing and some scenes of nudity. I wouldn't recommend it. The box descrpition made it out to be a cult film, but I've seen a lot better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the time.","review":"I only watched about 75% of this movie. The best scenes in this movie were all before the two main characters started having spoken dialog. I lost interest once Vicki the Vampire revealed her secret of being a Vampire. It wasn't a believable performance and was reminiscent of a drunken live action gamer fallen into their own fantasy at 3 AM at a coffee shop..."},{"rating":"2","title":"An inspirational read!","review":"ALIYA by Liel Leibovitz is an incredible exploration of the ideals and values that propelled three Jewish-American families to move from the United States to Israel. It examines how these ideologies apply to the American-Jewish community at large and how they have changed with each generation. Illuminated by Leibovitz's masterful prose, Israel comes alive anew in each section of the book. Moreover, as Leibovitz traces \\"aliya\\" from the 1940s to the present, he vividly describes the experience of moving to Israel, with all the requisite joys and challenges, and his compelling storytelling draws readers in to each character's story. This marvelous book is an essential and enlightening record of Israel and American Jewry, and it is a must-have for every history buff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I didn't care for the author's writing style, which was overly verbose and prose-heavy. The author set out to answer a question, mainly to assuage his own guilt in leaving Israel (he is a 9th generation Israeli!): what draws people to move to Israel and settle there permanently, especially people living in affluent America? While each of the 3 stories profiled were fairly interesting, he did not answer this question convincingly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written","review":"This book is written at the level of a good freshman college paper complete with one sided story telling and shallow pop psychology.

Get both and start a 4 last songs collection........the problem with zueignung is that it is beyond her vocal capacity and instead of leaving it out they left it in and ...its OK if you haven't heard Rothenberger (mature also) and some others do this so well. I adore her version of Die Drei Koenigin, it is quite exquisite, never likely to be bettered!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Something more","review":"Listening to Schwartzkopf singing the Four Last Songs you realize she is using her mother tongue. In addition to her phenomenal vocal gifts, this adds a dimension of understanding and feeling that other artists have not yet achieved. It also makes one overlook the slight imprefections inherent to remastering old recordings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classical Monolgues by Leon Katz","review":"Leon Katz's volumes of classical monologues provide an excellent resouce tool for actors and educators. Some well-known, some deliciously obscure, these rich monolgues can expand and deepen an actor's repetoire of audition and class material. In addition, Mr. Katz's introductory notes to each monologue provide a wonderfully astute historical and theatrical context for each selection. A superb addition to the theatre practitioner's library."},{"rating":"2","title":"You must own this book.","review":"This is one of my treasured books. Beautiful translation. Excellent introduction.

Second off all, it says anti-skip but it doesn't help at all, i could have bought another cd player for this so it is not worth the value. Third, is that it is not durable. I dropped it from a foot off the ground on carpet and the sound went bogus. When you change the sound it would scratch and be very obnoxious. And last, recently the clip that keeps it close just broke off very easily. So after this i tried to get my warranty but it was only 10 days. You had to buy an additional warranty before that one expired. I am disapointed with this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good sound","review":"Just bought one after listening to it in the store.

It earned a place in my diaper bag, so when my baby falls asleep and I have an extra five minutes in the car, I read an essay or two. I gather strength. Ariel Gore's essays are so true, like other hormonal (mama) readers, I have to cry. She is compassionate toward all of us, single, married, poor, hip or hippie. She doesn't have rules that bar us from her club. She encourages us to take care of ourselves, not just our children. I'm a single mom, and I have read lots of books about parenting, but none I treasure like this book. It stands alone. I recommend it as the best book I have read about mothering and discovering yourself, which is The Mother Trip."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glad I borrowed this from the library","review":"I almost bought this book from Amazon based on the excellent reviews, and a good price as usual, but I'm really glad I borrowed this from the library instead. If this book offered anything particularly insightful or tips one could really put into practice, you didn't find it in the first third of the book, after which I skimmed the rest to see it was more of the same. I decided I was done wasting my time reading anecdotes from other moms, most of which were depressing. If you want to feel empowered a much better choice is The Must-Have Mom Manual by Sara Ellington and Stephanie Triplett where they include anecdotes from their own personal, and practical, experience to relay informaton and advice to guide you through your own personal journey of motherhood."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not alone","review":"I'm relieved to see I am not alone in not liking this book, The Mother Trip. I had a very negative gut reaction to this book. It just makes me feel out of sorts and a little queasy. It reads FAKE to me.

I can't think of anything I liked about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Every Mama Needs This Book","review":"Ariel Gore is an honest, inspirational, and much-needed voice in the world of mothering literature. The essays in The Mother Trip will provide sustenance and support to Mamas who are tired of second-guessing everything they do.

I'd heard only good about the book and I expected only good after reading the Survival Guide with my first pregnancy. I am, however, disappointed in the Mother Trip. Maybe it's because I expected too much; maybe it's because I don't care for or buy into MARKETING TARGETED merchandise (Gen X, Slacker, etc.); maybe it's because I re-read the Survival Guide and found blatant hypocrisy (use the Catholic Church and other religious organizations when you're in need but hey, when you've gotten what you need from them diss 'em openly and freely), and that coupled with the arogant, superficial, pretentious tones and whiny attitude of the Mother Trip is enough to make me hurl.

I have it mounted on my wife's rack. In fact it is so bright, that I have a hard time riding behind her in the morning as its blinding! My only complaint is the on/off switch, its just a cut portion of the plastic - I have some concerns about its life span. Plastic does not tend to last very long when it gets flexed frequently.Update after 93 days, the light now shuts off after I het any bumps. I can press the red enclosure tighter and get it to turn back on again, but on the next bump it may shut back off. I suspect the batteries are just poping lose.None the less this is not a good situation. I emailed planet bike about it - no response and I suspect it only has a 90 day warranty. So it lasted as long as they (planet bike) needed it to.AVOID IT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost impossible to turn on","review":"The on/off button is completely inside of the plastic case. I understand the reasoning - it's a cheap way to make the whole thing waterproof. But it also means that you have to deform the plastic case pretty significantly to trigger the button. It requires enough concentrated force that you can't actually do it through thick winter gloves, so my fingertip ends up being both sore and cold each evening.I really like Planet Bike's mission, and their front light is basically acceptable, but I'm extremely dissatisfied with this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"falls apart and not water tight","review":"I purchased 3 of these and I no longer have any. Yes they are very bright, but what good is that when the light falls apart on the lightest bump or curb hop. I lost two of them before using zip ties to hold the 3rd together, but it failed from water intrusion. $75 and 4 months later I have no lights. Save your money and get a USB light."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to use","review":"It is very hard to insert the batteries and to turn on, change the on state to flash and to turn off. The switch is at at the bottom and is flush with the unit. You need a sharp finger nail to activate the unit. I would look elsewhere for a light."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fell off","review":"Well, I guess I should've followed everyone's suggestions but didn't.

Seems to be of nice quality and has a good company behind it. I got this light most because of it's larger area of visibility from all sides (180 degrees). It is easily visible at night. If you are looking for more daytime visibility I would stick to the Planet Bike Superflash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not durable","review":"I have a short commute to work and I've had this light for about 8 months. It's a pretty smooth ride and I don't jump curbs or anything like that. I got home the other night and it was gone... it just broke off leaving the clip in the holder. I just can't recommend something that breaks this easily."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor frame-mount design","review":"This light will fall apart if mounted to the bike frame or seat post due to a design flaw. The design flaw is that the heavy electronic components (battery, circuits, LED lights) are integrated with the lens cover assembly, not the base/mounting bracket assembly. This is the opposite of every other LED bike light I have ever owned and it results in the electronic components detaching and falling into the street.I still use this light as a clip-on to my backpack, and it performs well in this role. I do have some pros: very bright, affordable.And one more negative: On/Off button is not very convenient to use.Cheers!"},{"rating":"2","title":"new stuff","review":"it's hard to find new material from moltmann. he takes a truly hegelian tack here and gives us truly something new. recommended to those who want new ideas from moltmann"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's all about track 7!","review":"I own all of Too$hort's records so I had to buy this one.

Overkill from my perspective. Hillerman seemed fixated on getting every aspect of Navajo culture included yet still keep it to 200 pages. I found the book very difficult to get through as a result.

I would much prefer to pay a little more and get a sperate charger. As it is if you have multiple batteries you have to connect them to the drill to charge them.

But if it works for FM, then it should work equally for cancer, heart disease, spinal injuries, Parkinson's, diabetes, et al.

It is a shame that the label --in this case Telefunken -- doesn't release their entire output (say in a box set, for instance).

However, due to popular demand, they are putting it back on the market at the beginning of the year in the states that will allow the higher percentage.

The story of Eddie, an American hustler in antiques and whatever else he can turn a profit on, starts with him bumming around Amsterdam, doing hashish, checking out art, and meeting a beautiful and mysterious woman. Though her, he gets involved with a nasty Swiss-German thug and another beautiful woman. Then there's his stunning actress wife back in England... It starts to reek of author wish-fulfillment after a certain point. Veronese throws lots of art history references into the story, but that can't hide the fact that it's never at all clear why these women are drawn to Eddie. There's a lot of crap spouted by almost everyone (bikers and rock stars included) but the story all boils down to drugs and money. There's no reason to care about Eddie or any other characters, and Veronese's writing is unmemorable. If it's a homage to pulp fiction or film noir, it's an utter failure."},{"rating":"2","title":"A remarkable work of literary criticism","review":"From a poet's-or any artist's-point of view, the problem is always to make art that bubbles over with an energy of its own, that isn't merely a reflection of somebody else's inspiration. As Thomas Fink points out in David Shapiro's case, the desire isn't to \\"make it new\\" for the sake of finding a place for one's work ahead of the competition. Rather, Shapiro's often-difficult work, as Fink proves, is true to itself, developing along the integral course driven by the poet's intentions. In this really remarkable work of literary criticism, Fink takes the difficult course himself, avoiding theory spinning and syllable counting (things with which academic criticism seems to be preoccupied), and instead examines Shapiro's work, allowing it to speak for itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful for the classroom","review":"I was excited to see a book like this as I searched for icebreaker activities for the classroom and this book is a wonderful resource to use for that."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is great book - get them before they're gone!","review":"I have been using these since 1992, and they are just terrific.

The delivery system has extreme design flaws if you want to carry the gallon jug and spray and walk. The white connector pulls shut and stops the spray if you carry it and spray trying to use the length of tubing provided. The tubing hose is too short. This makes the product very frustrating to use.

Pull out the handle, and then all you have to do is point the nozzle and pull the trigger. It was actually mildly enjoyable to \\"shoot\\" the weeds. So I gave it an extra star for this...That said, it did nothing to kill my weeds. I've used Weed B Gon for two years in a row following the directions explicitly, but all my dandelions are still here. They wilted for a couple days after applications, but were soon back to full strength. I made two applications as suggested... still no luck.

This was their second album, and their biggest commerical hits, improbably cracking into the British Top Ten based on the strength of the bouncy single that lent the album its title. Not really that \\"trad,\\" for the most part this album is a dreamy, drifty acoustic psych-folk exploration, much along the lines of the Incredible String Band, or the early albums by the Dransfield Brothers. Often the lyrics are embarassingly hippie-dippy, yet the album will grow on you, particularly the hit, \\"Fog On The Tyne,\\" which is the kind of tune that sticks in your mind for hours if you hear it play just before you walk out the door to run errands.

I've even discussed Renner's Greek knowledge with Renner himself.

I expected that he might give a more useful and pragmatic analysis of the Greek literature, but at several points, it seems to me that Renner only uses it as support for making \\"his\\" point.

Often there are pre and post treatment pictures.It may be outdated soon with some of the newer OCT technologies coming out, but I think the basics and OCT findings presented will not be significantly different.The focus of the book is definitely on retinal disease although there is a chapter on OCT in management of glaucoma. For retinal disease, it is pretty comprehensive, usually showing multiple examples of any given disease.I would highly recommend this book for those with an interest in OCT.My ownly gripe with the book is that I felt that the authors should have developed a methodology for the systematic evaluation of an OCT...similar to how medical students are taught to read a chest x-ray.

Crider being one of my favourite sopranos sings Amelia with feeling and security in both lower and top registers. I find her much more preferable to Martina Arroyo, whose lower register is weak and she seems to glosses over the text, although she sings the role well enough. Some may find Crider's tone jarring and her technique beyond reproach, but she still scores in my books, and she does this well! Leech and Chernov are excellent in their respective parts, with both Zaremba and Bayo offering fine support. The letdown in this set is the slack conducting of Carlo Rizzi. I think the cast and orchestra would have been more inspired with a Muti or Solti. Imagine that.................!

Los secundarios cumplen sobradamente del primero al ultimo. CARLO RIZZI plantea una direccion matizadisima, con unas intensidades muy marcadas (veanse los pianissimos con que comienza la obertura o los tres acordes en fortissimo que abren la escena de la caverna de Ulrica) al mando de los cuerpos estables de la WELSH NATIONAL OPERA, que rinden a un nivel tambien satisfactorio. El sonido es notable."},{"rating":"2","title":"The anthology that has it all","review":"From the mid 1970's through the mid 1980's, Styx cranked out one master piece after another. This anthology has captured all of this music together. The antholgy cover every period from the earliest days to the most recent releases. The beauty is that all of the truly great works that band recorded actually made it on to the disks. The heavy emphasis is one the golden period of the classic line up of the band with Tommy Shaw and Dennis Deyoung. It is nice to see some of the early work that is not so well known except for \\"lady\\". It is also nice to see some of the most recent work included to allow a long time fan to see what the band has done recently. In my opinion, the newer material is not the same quality of the old, but it doesn't mean it is bad either. If you are a STYX fan, this is the perfect collection from the band. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"32 for you","review":"well,styx has put together another cd, planned a tour,and once again, proving that these are \\"the best of times\\" indeed!! emerging from the wilderness into the high life again. styx as before, styx as always. can't keep a good band down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing!","review":"I'm a big Sytx fan and have most of their studio albums so this collection isn't of interest to me.

No benevolent ruler would sit idly by while music this bad was being unleashed on innocent people. A plague of locusts would be much easier to take than this CD.Styx featured the kind of song writing that only developmentally delayed junior high kids would pen.

If you really want to experience Styx, buy thier top 3 Albums (in my opinion as a long time fan) 1. Grand Illusion, 2. Paradise Theatre, 3. Pieces of Eight... If you like these then venture to the rest of thier work... buy the remasters of the original albums... these compilations are just a money sync off the fan base... hopefully most of us are older and wiser...

The pain is caused by slight misalignment, compression, and pinched nerves (standard lower back pain). Care must be exercised to place the spinal column in the correct position. If you get the spine aligned properly, you then must find a way to force your muscles to relax and allow the device to do it's job. This is uncomfortable at first so that makes it harder to relax the muscles. Once the muscles finally relaxed, I could feel the spine realigning and it felt good. I rated 4 stars primarily dues to the difficulty in centering the spine on it although, in all fairness, I don't know how they could have designed it differently. Bottom line: If the dog ate it, I'd buy another.Mark H"},{"rating":"2","title":"worth every dollar - but read forth...","review":"This product may not be good for everyone - it work very well for me.

YOU WILL NEED A GOOD PILLOW to support the neck and head - otherwide your back pain will be better - but you get a stiff neck.4.

Like so many I did so want to find a solution without going to the doctor/chiropractor regularly. I read about this devise on Amazon and decided what the heck, it is only $35.I got some relief, but it is minor, like the kind you get when pressing your back with your hand or a chair. I don't like reviews within days or weeks, so I've tried this devise for 2 months. Doesn't work (for me). Maybe many of the reviewers here found a solution, and if so then it is certainly a small amount to pay for the item. However, I bought this as a gamble, and consider it to be a loss. Good luck to you if you try it. I will move on to an inversion table.

While that opening line may not add to this review, at least it adds some color to my story. I had a horrible experience with this unit because of the uncomfortable nature in the design. I was in * MORE * pain after using this (in my opinion) torture device than before I used it. I even took it to my chiropractor after he returned from his two week vacation and he disapproved of it. I would NOT reccommend you buy this or any other medical device without consulting your physician or health care professional. I only kept this unit because I had hoped that it was simply a case of user error, but it was not. I had friends try out this device, and they couldn't even get up off the floor after using it! Don't waste your money on this worthless product. See a professional and seek out their advice first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product for those in the know...","review":"Quite simply a good product that does what it claims.

The idea is ingenious: Mold a piece of plastic into the shape of a persons back to make it realign itself.I'm sure whoever helped model their back for the prototype really enjoys it, but one size isn't going to fit all. If they made it adjustable it would be a million times more pleasing. Also, I'm not always sure if my backbones are centered correctly, which could actually lead to worse back problems.Bottom-line: Save your money and buy the $90 (which was only $75 a couple years ago) back stretcher.

I thought to myself, why not...it's not too expensive.I now use it once a day before I go to sleep, and it has relieved the twinge in my spine I began to feel again.

I tried going to the chiropractor, and tried out an inversion table, neither one helped me that much. When I ordered the Spine-Worx I really didn't expect it to work as good as it does. After the first night of doing a 10 min session on it I felt a difference. I now do it everynight for 15 min and have been for a week. It really is the best tool to use for my backpain and I will use it from now on. Not to mention that it is also very relaxing, moving your arms and legs around really lets it hit certain target areas of your back. I have been recommending this to people I work with, and I recommend it to you also!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This things works!","review":"On the floor with a small pillow for your head is the way to go with this. Just a few minutes, once or several times a day will help \\"crack\\" your back into shape.

When on the floor, try moving your arms in all directions, above, to the sides, or to your legs to get all angles. You may be sore the first couple times using this. It helped me, because I work night shift and doctors are not available at 10pm to help when my back is not cooperating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth It!","review":"I used the spine-worx device following the instructions explicitly and the pain was unbelievable.

Several friends tried it too and all agreed it was lame & you're better off with something less passive like massage, chiropractic, yoga, tens units, and/or exercise balls.

There's something really appealing about the idea of straightening out your back and putting it back into alignment. But after using this device (one time for as long as 45 minutes) I've concluded that it doesn't work for everyone.I gave it two stars instead of one only because it seems to be solid and reasonably well-made.

I can't really figure out if it is something I'm doing different between the times it works and the times it doesn't - I don't think so. This probably only does one thing, while a chiropractor can adjust and use different approaches depending on how your spine is reacting that day. I'd still recommend this pretty highly, as the 1-time cost is lower than the cost of a single chiropractor visit, and when it works well (say 60% of the time, and if it doesn't just try again the next day) it is about as good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spineworx back alignment device","review":"I needed a way to exert pressure to help my spine align properly. In fact I had begun to build my own device and was wondering how to get the right curvature. Then I saw the Spineworx device and decided to try it. My height is 6' 1\\" and though the fit isn't exact it is close enough. My wife at 5' 6\\" said it didn't fit her at all. For me the curvature in the lower back portion of the Spineworx device is a little too much and I've found sitting on a thin pillow or folded towel aids comfort. My technique is to extend both arms above the hips and slowly move them in an arc that ends with the arms extended above the head then reverse direction of movement. I do this a few times and roll off after 10 minutes or so. No substitute for a spinal adjustment but might let you extend the time between appointments. I didn't give it 5 stars because it wasn't perfect, but it is certainly worth the money. Suggested improvement: a way to customize the spinal curvature."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Chiropractor Liked It","review":"This item may take some getting used to, however, I had my chiropractor try it and she liked it immediately and basically endorsed it's use. She added that my lack of enough curve at the bottom of my spine could make it less comfortable at first for me than some others, comparing it to wearing orthotic shoes for the first time to help correct flat feet. So she felt it had benefit, I haven't felt any real difference after using it yet but that could be because I didn't have any twisted vertabra at that time. If I feel I need an adjustment in-between chiro. visits I'll try it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"SpineWorx frm TJinPA","review":"Interesting device. I Find it relaxing once used.

I thought this device might help align things as advertised. I followed the instructions to the letter but it didn't do anything positive for my back. It did not hurt it or cause any long term problem. It just was not a pleasant experience.I can best describe its use as laying on two rubber, knobby rods that fit on either side of your spine and force your spine to curve to its predefined curvature. My 6'2\\" frame did not fit to that curve.A much simpler and effective treatment was provided by a physical therapist. Take a old thin towel and roll it up. Then place it under your upper spine while laying on the floor. Lift up you spine from the floor by pressing your elbows into the floor and then slowly relax back down onto the towel.

It puts a lot of tension on your back and if you should stretch or move in an unpredicted way, you'll definitely pull something out of alignment. If, after stretching, you get a knee problem, see your chiropractor or other health professional immediately!The instructions say that no one should stress you from the top (like, for example, a child, or maybe a really dumb significant other who wants to kid around) because the result could be severe injury.

Throw in the maps, the preparatory work of Lewis and related ephemera for good measure. This will not only require a huge investment in time but several feet of book space. At [the price] per volume you will also limit out your credit card. Is it worth it? No other work can provide the background for understanding the ensuing growth of the West.

Some of the book's material may be exactly what you knew before but then it never hurts to refresh you memory.

She is dating one of the many suspects of the crime. Is this a crime of passion? Or is it a more sinister premeditated murder using the demonstration as a facade?

This book is entertaining, puzzling and intriguing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Robinson Winner","review":"This book, though one of Robinson's early works, succeeds nicely. In sleuthing the murder of a policeman at an anti-nuke rally, the author probes the venalities of both the cops and the protestor community. This is a typical Robinson procedural, leavened nicely by the presence of a Scotland Yard hotshot sent up to Yorkshire to solve the crime. Superintendent Burgess becomes one of Robinson's more interesting characters and the interplay between this freewheeler and the more restrained Chief Inspector Banks adds nicely to the book. In this book, it's the well-drawn characters which win the day, not the plot which is fairly mundane. All in all, in this and all his books, Peter Robinson distinguishes himself as one of the best police procedural writers out there.

Brooks is also a good writer, and he writes very clearly. Don't get this book, if you already understand the subject, since it doesn't cover advanced material. However, this is essential reading for those who don't have a clue or for those (like me), who've memorized a lot of emi guidelines, without really understanding why they're necessary.Given the book's title, the only area of improvement I can think of is a chapter or appendix on basic pcb manufacturing and terminology (buried vias, microvias, antipads, etc)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor","review":"terrible product didnt do anything will not buy at all...wasted my money ...dont buy this product ...i had no change in my skin condition it felt like i was applying water on my body no action or reaction... poor didnt work for me... my opinion.."},{"rating":"1","title":"looked like it was opened and sitting on the shelf for years","review":"The seal on this bottle was broken, and the bottle looked cheap and filthy like it was sitting on the shelf for years.The spray was no more effective than locally bought at the grocery store with the same ingredients.The bottle could spray upside down, but that's the only positive thing about this overpriced medicine I can think of."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does Not Spray","review":"I received the product on time and the packaging was fine, but the bottle does not spray.

Rather than encourage the reader to break with her parents, she advocates learning your mother's history and examining your own attitudes and behavior.

Alot of the senarios in the book looked really neat but in practice they weren't all that great. The missions are very one sided so that the senario will play out just like it happens in the movie. Very good for realists but not very fun for playing a game. The only good thing about the book is the last chapter. It has alternate game play rules, stats for additional equipment that comes with the book, and a random senario generator. The only way I would pick this book up is if you don't pay very much for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The publisher has serious quality problems.","review":"I was really excited to get this accessory, mostly because it had a map of Tatooine and Bespin.

This book is intended to extend the games by providing other situations beyond those in the original package.Reading this as a book by itself, without knowing about the game and original rules will not make a lot of sense.

BUT I was glad they brought back barraka(who is my favorite), sub zero, scorpion, and nightwolf.also there is a quest mode were you find chests that can unlock cahracters and movie galleries, and pictures, like in deadly alliance. which I liked.Otherwise the graphics and gameplay makes up for most.

If you're a Jack Black or Steve Zahn fan, check it out only when it hits the old releases shelves at the video store since they both do fairly decent jobs with roles that are horribly written.

The fault COMPLETELY lies with the writers, the script made use of well-tread sitcom devices (receiving \\"coaching\\" during a date using a body mike and earpiece) and \\"humor\\" that, at best, could be compared to the jokes and banter that is written for award shows. Jack Black (High Fidelity) is usually a funny actor but he is handicapped by some of the worst dialogue material in his career. The movie's lone shining moment was the performance of Amanda Peet...her facial expressions and icy dialogue were perfect for her role. It is not often that I will turn a movie off halfway through, but the aforementioned \\"date coaching\\" was too much. Don't waste your time, and pray that the actors involved will not suffer too much for this travesty."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst movie ever","review":"major disappointment considering two of the best young comedic actors were in this- Jack Black and Steve Zahn!

I watched this movie because I'm a fan of Jack Black, but this movie doesn't work on so many levels. First of all, you never really get the feeling that the friendship between these three friends is really very strong. So when they start kidnapping and planning murder, you don't really understand why they're going to all the trouble. Another thing is the obsession with Neil Diamond. It's never really funny and it just falls flat. Third, the chemistry between the supposed romantic interests is terrible. The characters are all supposed to be in such deep love, but you never see it in this movie. If you're interested in comedy, you can find lots of better movies than this. For Jack Black fans, head for High Fidelity, or School of Rock instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolute Brilliance","review":"Saving Silverman is an incredible comedy about a controlling girlfriend breaking up a lifelong group of friends, and those friends don't take it lying down. Even though the film stars Jason Biggs, Jack Black and Steve Zahn steal the show. Jack Black might be the best comedic character actor of our time. This movie is a must have for fans of good comedy, maybe not high-brow, but good comedy. And by the way, how many Jack Black fans spotted KG of Tenacious D as the annoying magician who tries to pick up Amanda Peet? Oh well, the movie is hilarious, it has beautiful women, and good actors, what more can you ask for?"},{"rating":"1","title":"I made a mistake...","review":"...and actually tried to watch this movie.

This is one of those situations where they showed all the funny bits in the preview. This movie couldn't be more not funny if it tried. It's saddens me cause I really like all the actors in it. Don't waste your time or money because this movie is awful. It was like they were trying very hard to be clever, but it ended up being a bad copy knock-off of other film greats such as \\"Something About Mary\\" and/or \\"American Pie.\\" If left me feeling bored and disappointed.

But he tries to be a gentlemen because he knows he is falling in love.The new 3 minute footage isnt as raunchy as \\"Roadtrip\\" but it's a definite plus!

There's no better way to explain it. It just stinks on ice. It's a really good example of why DVD is going to kill VHS in the long run. To begin with, the first 20 minutes of the VHS tape is filled with trailers and advertisements for other films, and special offers from Columbia Studios. Then, when the movie finally does begin, it's chopped to pieces. They've taken so many scenes out of this movie that I kept re-winding to make sure I wasn't losing my mind. The DVD has all scenes intact, just as the movie appeared in the studio. My suggestion is to let VHS die, and buy the DVD. It's cheaper, cleaner, and you get deleted scenes and director's commentary."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent F-Critics","review":"This movie is hilarious, dont listen to the critics..If you enjoyed movies like National Lampoons Vacation,Xmas Vacation,Road Trip, you'll love this"},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't stand these new Hollywood movies anymore","review":"being entertained by this movie is like laughing at people who have unfortunate miserable problems.

If your more into a somewhat South Park type of humor definetly get the R rated version, otherwise stick with the PG-13 version, there's not much difference. I have to say i really liked Amanda Detmer in this she's beautiful and i liked her character as well. I would have chosen her over Amanda Peet ANYDAY... Steve Zahn is hilarious in this and Jack Black is really good in this too. Rent this and don't listen to this critics, if you like BUY IT !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Probably One of the Worst Movies Ever Made","review":"This film suffers from the worst thing a comedy can suffer from: namely not being funny. The humorless script was disjointed and had the production values of a first year mail order film school student project.

Fairly easy setup for recording up to 8 recordings. Once recordings are set up, you have to remember to turn on the timer which is only on the remote, and you have to turn it off to use the VCR and remember to turn it back on when you finish! There is no eject button on the remote! The front display doesn't show rewinding and forwarding which is something every VCR I have owned has done - if they have a front display. However...

The BSG also show that even though they are young, you can make a difference like when they raise money to save the local movie theatre in the fourth book! Promises, Promises isn't as good as the other books because it spends waayyyy too much time on the girls fighting about the election. I am not sure that I would have finished this book if it weren't for the fact that I had already gotten permission to read it for school. A little bit of fighting goes a long way!!

Your \\"inconvenience\\" is nothing compared to the inconvenience of going through 3 or 4 junky \\"Apex\\" DVD players, spending $300-$400 and having nothing to show for it. The only problems I've noticed with this player are that it records in widescreen only with S-Video on my DVD recorder and that some DVD-R's recorded with \\"DVD Backup\\" play with skips. However, these same DVD-R's play fine on my model DVD726. Therefore, I have concluded that the DVD726 is the better player, but the DVD727 has a better remote control. Both can be set to play all regions in the same way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"Of all the DVD players I've ever owned this is the worst. It continually skips and freezes.

None worked, so paid the $29.99, plus $8 UPS shipping. I wasn't happy paying $38 for an exchange unit just eight months after purchase.

Too bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's up with the angle icon?","review":"For some reason Philips decided that if it should read an angle feature on a dvd then it should pop up an angle icon on the tv. The funny thing is that movies that do not have an angle feature, like \\"Brother Bear\\", the angle icon pops up anyways. Not just once but many times throughout the feature and there's no way to disable it. So the first time I realized the angle icon could not be disabled was the last time I used the player. I since went back to my older pioneer player. I'm waiting for philips to post a firmware update. Otherwise I'm selling it. Without the annoying angle icon the dvd player is excellent. It has a nice picture and great sound. It also handles error-prone dvds that normally have problems on my other players. Get rid of the angle icon and this rating goes from a 1 star to a 5 star."},{"rating":"2","title":"TNA Wrestling: Genesis 2007","review":"this dvd is ausome every match is great no matter how man wrestling matches youv seen in tna it is allways different exicting to watch unlessyou watched this on the ppv.you can not predict the out come of all the matches."},{"rating":"2","title":"TNA Genesis 2007 Review","review":"The Abyss-Black Reign-Shop of Horrors match was a pretty good hardcore brawl.

Styles & Tomko against The Steiner Brothers(Rick & Scott) had good brawling,high-flying and wrestling action to make it watchable. The Samoa Joe-Robert Roode was a hard-hitting & smash-mouth brawl. The Christin Cage-Kaz Ladder match was a high-flying and hardcore showstealer.

(actually just lifts up the cooler) After a few times of doing this and regular wear and tear the insulation seperated from the plug leaving just the two tiny wires hangin on by a thread. This lasted for a few weeks until the wires fatigued to the point where one of them failed.

Before, it averaged ~110 degrees, and after in the mid 90's. When the DVR ran hot, the DVR fan kicks off and on and is pretty loud. 100% happy with the cooler for use with DVR's.I got a second one to use for laptops. It doesn't add much to the wire tray I used to keep a 3/4 inch airspace under the laptop. The usb cable is a bit cheap. I wish the laptop turned off the power to the USB when it is off, so I end up connecting/disconnecting the cable a lot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recommended!","review":"I just got this cooler, and since I had been running my notebook for 5 days straight, I plugged it in as soon as I got it. Simply put, VERY quick cooling, light, and quiet. There are no warm spots across the board. I do admit the power plug on the cooler does come off a bit too easily, but I don't carry the cooler around anyways, and I'm carrying my notebook around my house. Well designed and fits perfectly with my 13-inch notebook. When mounted, it will give you an elevation of just uder an inch, and produces adequate airflow underneath the notebook. Plus, it has a neat little blue LED light on the fan speed selection switch. I will point out that my notebook is relatively thin, thus making the cooler work better, so if your notebook ranges to about 1 inch thick, this is definately your choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than Targus","review":"This cooler is better constructed and operates more reliably than the Targus that I had previously.

More surprisingly, you can only plug the fan on one side of the laptop, since if you try to plug it on the left side near the power connector, it will not allow you to plug in your power cord! After seeing these two I simply put it back in the box and sent it back!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple and excellent","review":"What you need from a VCR is this modern age is simple: stereo, excellent picture quality, s-video output and an easy to use interface.

It proves to the listener that Mahalia Jackson could do more than just yell, scream, and holler, like many feel that she does. Mahalia could handle it all. So this pairing shows the 'churchy' side of Mahalia and the romantic, operatic side of Mahalia, which still remains Christian.I'm not too fond of GREAT SONGS OF LOVE AND FAITH, but several of the selections really minister to me. Songs like \\"My Friend,\\" \\"I've Done My Work,\\" \\"That's America To Me,\\" and \\"The Green Leaves of Summer\\" are, in my opinion, the four best songs on that album. When I hear Mahalia sing \\"My Friend,\\" it brings tears to my eyes. Such a blessed, angelic voice!

I've never found heat to be a problem on this unit even after extended play. The tons of connection choices is a plus and has almost all the stuff in it...except some of the more obscure Dolby capabilities and thx. Another reason i got this unit was because it had a competent dvd player built in. I did not want to get another player and take up more space on my shelf. The receiver functions, though not extremely high end, does have most of what you need to build a decent and competent home theater.

SVHS good on SVHS tape, but not on regular VHS tape.Good edits.Remote clunky for trying to operate TV (all TV controls are shared with other VCR functions and you have to hold down two buttons at the same time to control TV).Cheap plastic case (I am replacing an old $1000+ Sony), but you get what you pay for.Inputs on front are not color coded (white, red, yellow).

Roswaenge is one of the most important tenors of the period, with many admirers and not a few detractors. Recordings of his are not uncommon. But this set is missing the big tenor-soprano duet that, for most admirers of the work, is the very core of the piece. It would be nice to have had this pointed out before purchasing it. I would look elsewhere for recordings of these singers."},{"rating":"2","title":"understanding photogrpahy philosophically","review":"This book by Flusser is so densely written that it is a joy to come to it again and again.

I eagerly await every disc release since I bought his debut album \\"Bel Canto\\" a few years ago, and with \\"Tenor's Passion\\" Alvarez continues his string of brilliant recordings. Alvarez has taken a large leap forward in a well-nurtured career. Leaving behind the lyrical Italian and French roles he has relied upon so strongly since his Met debut in 1998, Alvarez lets all his dramatic passion pour forth in one great recording. Marcelo's fans have anxiously waited for years to hear his interpretations of Cavaradossi, Pinkerton, Rodolfo, Calaf, and Don Jose in particular. Those of us who have followed his career closely know all about how patiently he has waited until his voice matured to take on some of the weightier tenor roles. All I can really say is it was definitely worth the wait.

The other half of the time, it would turn off after recording after only 10 seconds. Tech Support said this MIGHT be fixed in their current software upgrade... they'll send it and I should have it in about 10 days.- the manual was really poor.

They couldn't have made it more complicated to use! The manual is no help. What were these designers thinking?

Either way, I have tried calling customer support prior to the warranty period being offer, and they insisted that I have received a replacement unit. Not true. To be honest, I cannot tell you how many times or hours I have wasted with these people and got nothing.

It is incredibly unintuitive. The manual is not laid out well and skips important points in the intial setup regarding how to view TV through the box , and how many titles are allowed on one disc. The recorder does not recognize several major label dvd discs and also has problems recording video footage originally recorded in LP speed. The naming system is prehistoric and time consuming and utimately does not display complete titles anyway.Tech support for the product leaves a lot to be desired as well.This recorder is not a simple VCR, in fact it is almost as complicated as a computer. It should not be sold as such and will undoubtedly sit on your shelf unused. Do yourself a favor and try a different brand or wait until they have mastered this technology better.Go back to the drawing board Philips!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good So Far!!!","review":"Shortly after purchasing it, the predecessor to this model proved to be a nightmare in every possible manner. After being sent to Phillips for repairs under warranty, no improvements were noticed. So we cajoled the national chain that we purchased from to exchange (we paid the price differential) for the newer Phillips DVDR75.Several months have passed and countless hours of +R DVDs have been burned from my DirecTV / UltimateTV (similar to TiVo). I put the DVDR75 model through a demanding workout early on to reveal any existing technical glitches right away. What a difference this model has made! No more defects, ruined DVD blanks, or poor dependability. I tend to record on 6 hour mode and have been pleased with the resolution and overall results.So maybe Phillips got things right this time! I would recommend this model to anyone seeking a proven work horse."},{"rating":"2","title":"A few suggestions before you return yours....","review":"Yes, there have been some bad reviews on this product -- BUT, I think most problems can easily be resolved by doing two simple things:1. Making sure that your unit has enough air flow for proper cooling. If you insist on sticking in between your VCR and cable box, no doubt the heat will cause problems. Mine did until I moved it.2. Upgrade the firmware -- a bit of a pain, but really doesn't take too long...Once I took care of these two things, I haven't burnt any more coasters!!!Besides, how else can you record VHS, DVD, TV onto a DVD permanent, easily readable format painlessly.... try copying a DVD with your computer, you'll know what I mean.One minor downside, one VHS tape has copywriting info on it and it wouldn't copy it....

Some truly horrifying background information on one of the most evil people to ever hold the post of U.S. Attorney General (no, NOT Ashcroft), and some deeply disturbing statistics about the so-called \\"War On Drugs\\" and who it REALLY targets.Buy this book, then send the author a thank-you letter. I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Napolitano Vilifies the American South","review":"To blame the post-Civil War American South for gun control which 'spread to New York' is absurd, and says much about Napolitano's ignorance or intentional distortion of history. He gives no mention that the American southern negro was incited to violence especially upon his fellow negro by northern carpetbagger governments installed 'at the point of a bayonet' by the Radical Republican national government from Washington. Furthermore, Napolitano's theme that the Civil War was over slavery was the knockout punch for me, and his neocon book went right in the trashcan.Prospective buyers of Napolitano's book should perish the thought & get a copy of The Tragic Era by Claude Bowers for a truthful and accurate account of life in the Reconstructed South after The War for Southern Independence.We know that the victors write the history books, and Constitutional Chaos is penned under that standard of disinformation."},{"rating":"1","title":"The expert's disease","review":"Judge Napolitano regrettably suffers from \\"the expert's disease\\" -- his narrow, specialized point-of-view has blinded him to the legitimate concerns of the community at large. Like many people who have made a career in the law, he has become obsesses with the minutiae of \\"rights\\" and \\"process.\\" He has lost touch with the deep concern of ordinary people that actual ~justice~ be the result of the legal process, not just a trial record that is without flaws from the perspective of a constitutional scholar. And many of the constitutional \\"rights\\" that he so zealously defends are recently minted by activist jurits, not put into the constitution by the framers. If you, like the judge, think that the country's big problem in criminal justice is carelessness with defendants' rights rather than the absurd legal obstacles that obstruct prosecutions, then you may enjoy this book.

Not that these two are judicial paradigms, they at least atempt to project an essence of objectivity. Whereas napolitano was ostensibly objective when he first entered media, it may have been a result of his fear and trepidation. He has evolved into a pompous know-it-all who appears to have one agenda--his own. From an initial apparent conservative/libertarian personna this chameleon has become a spokesman for the liberal left. This book reflects this southpaw's liberal leanings and he has become a disgrace to the network and the judicial system."},{"rating":"2","title":"Our Government is diverting from Our Constitution!!","review":"Excellent!! Judge Napolitano shows us how our government is using its power to divert from Our Consitution! It's shameful!

Its like they \\"totally forget\\" the Constitution once they get there.

My main complaint is that the book speaks to seasoned professionals who are already engineers or had previous experience with higher mathematics. The book has these assumptions and it's frustrating to a student who is beginning a career in engineering, and takes the higher math for the first time. If you are a beginner, you will likely fail at the hands of this book without ample accommodation from tutors. The book tries to explain the concepts but not in a way that's easy to digest.

I'm not a math whiz, if I was I wouldn't be using this book to begin with. It's been nothing but frustrating trying to do the exercises at the end of each section as most of them are nothing like the examples shown, and you have to \\"read between the lines\\" to try and understand it.

Many tracks are on the borderline which makes these cds very enjoyable to listen to and they also evoke nostalgic memories of a time gone by. Great tunes like \\"The Hustle\\", \\"Car Wash\\", \\"Heart of Glass\\" by Blondie, \\"Boogie Nights\\" are included together with the more usual tunes you'd associate with the disco genre. Taken all together, this means the 2 discs are not monotonous to hear or boring with the same groove but the mix in tempo and song types makes this a very enjoyable listen.

It is terribly unrealistic as well--presenting Asian immigrants as dirty parsites when in reality Asians in Western nations are hard working and extremely educated and productive.

Having heard of the book, and being highly sympathetic to it's base message, I was stunned by the primitive and brutal racism of the writing style. Relentless, turgid dialogue, cardboard characters, zero insight. It is one thing to promote racism on the grounds of tribalism and human nature, it is quite another to revel in the language of bigots and rednecks as does this author. He writes with the leaden prose of a Victorian, and his attitude would seem to be stuck in that period of history as well. Avoid this book at all costs, as it does nothing to help the cause of the West in the current global demographic. This author is a literary Neanderthal, struggling massively in a world that has left him behind. I can't stress how bad the book is.... just be warned that it is dreadful. One of the few I might consider burning. I can't even bring myself to give it away....."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nostradamus 2.0","review":"During the 2003 march against the Iraq war, many marches yelled \\"We Are All Hamas Now\\"! In the Camp of Saints, many marches yell \\"We Are All from the Ganges Now\\"! Now that is spooky. How did the author, Jean Raspail, know what people would be saying 30 years in to the future? There are many premonitions in The Camp of Saint. This is amazing and I can only think of two other books that can do this. This is why I rate this book with Orwell's and Huxley's. These guys predicted the future, not because of some weird magic powers or a membership in the illuminate, but if you have the gift of psychology, like Orwell and Huxley and the daddy of them all, Friedrich Nietzsche, did, then you too can see through the rubbish regurgitating out of the udders of the system, and see how things really are."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my all time favorites","review":"I first read Camp of the Saints about ten years ago. I have read it three more times. It is, as another reviewer wrote \\"a joke without a punchline.\\" Raspail is a a literary genius. His description of the end of civilization reminds me of Kurt Vonnegut's Galapagos. There is a dark humor that resonates through both tales, a harbinger of doom that the reader knows she cannot escape from, but like a train wreck cannot turn away. You will not finish his book and feel good. As a matter of fact, you will feel the gloom for days. Raspail was railed for his execution of this novel. It is politically incorrect. It condemns the modern fools who preach brotherly love but suffer from a deadly form of NIMBY (not in my back yard). As the filthy dilapidated fleet of dying Ganges inhabitants sails towards their new Nirvana, the loving arms of the liberal love mongers push them away- \\"not here- there is more for you over there...\\" This is a must read."},{"rating":"1","title":"short stories sewn together ...","review":"I just got done reading kamila's latest book and was extremely disappointed.

Let's start with the packaging; the case and sleeve art give the DVD a \\"home-made\\" look. Also, I thought this was a new documentary; on the contrary, it was originally produced in 1995. The narration is overly dramatic and the text adds nothing in the way of increased knowledge on the subject matter. The music is a distraction at best and annoying at worst. The one redeeming quality and why I did not rate it 1 star: there are MANY images and film clips that I have never seen in any other documentary covering the German/Russian conflict, and I have watched hundreds of hours on the subject.

I am a missile engineer with 27 years experience in the design and development of rockets and missiles. While most of my experience is with solid propellant missiles, I have a working knowledge of liquid rockets. Patrick tells it how it truly is. The book leads the reader through the classical trade-offs involved in designing a liquid-fueled payload-to-orbit rocket system. Not until the chapter suggesting the existence of a monestary on the moon did I come to appreciate that this is really fiction.

I say this because even though VHDL is designed as a hardware simulation language, it seems like it's more better introduced the same way programming languages are; for example: basic file structure, what those parts mean, basic data types, what each one means, typecasting, loops, and so on. This book lacks an adequate definition of all of those, and instead just shows the reader examples of that code, WITHOUT EVER HAVING DEFINED WHAT THE PARTS OF THAT CODE MEAN!

King John I of England was an early 13th century king who lived many years before the date of the Sawney Beane stories. Furthermore he was an English Angevin king, prior to the union of the Scottish and English crowns; he therefore had no jurisdiction in Scotland. He was certainly not, as the author says, 'John IV' of Scotland; no such person ever existed. Scotland has had only one King John, that was John Balliol, who was an elected king from 1292-1296 - again this is well before the supposed lifetime of Sawney Beane."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Book for Crime Research","review":"I have to say I personally enjoyed reading this book, as a criminal justice student and self-proclaimed serial killer expert I have read this one from front to back.

It's a darkly inappropriate look at a protagonist rife with self-loathing and a plot with more holes that a pair of 2 year old socks. I like vampire books, but this one really did not capture my interest at all. The ending makes no sense (it contradicts itself) and it's hard to be captivated by a main character who is an indiscriminate killer, though for no real apparent reason. The writing is often jarring without being effective. The book is just full of mean, unlikable people, esp. the \\"hero\\" - so really, what is the point?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Problems wtih Genius","review":"I found this book rather interesting, and the only reason I didn't vomit all over the cover is the fact of the vampires. I believe Lord could have just put a smidge of remorse in the monster Jean-Luc. If he had, I believe this book would have been absolutely riveting. The eroticism of the book was completely eroded by Jean-Luc's viciousness, by killing all his lovers.

As I read the book, the thing that keeps going through my mind is surely law suits will be flying or Al will be as he mentions about several others, be \\"eliminated.\\" But he reminds the reader he simply knows too much to be elimnated.Being from Arizona I get to see how accurate Martin is when he mentions bank fraud in Arizona and mentions our ex-Governor Fife Symington. Symington was in fact involved in \\"creative\\" accounting and convicted of that, and resigned as Governor that day.

I loved the relationship between Christina and William, the epitomy of young love, and loved her later relationship with Dick, to whom she was probably more suited. I also loved Christina's determination to forge a family out of the ragtag bunch she found herself with. I totally agree with those who bemoan the video quality. I should think they could digitally remaster it. As it is now the color is faded and the sound has to be turned up nearly as high as it can go to be heard properly. The one thing I disagree about with previous posters is the music. I find it horribly annoying and \\"the Song of Christina\\" is cring-making. At least it being a video I can fast forward thru the music. Otherwise, though, I love Flambards."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great serires","review":"We loved discovering this series.

All dinosaurs documentaries are mainly tageted to a younger audience, as is natural. This is no different, but the writing and direction keep it from being a pure kids's show. Computer and stop-motion animation help the audience see dinosaurs as they were. The Computer animation is not as good as it could be because the raptors have full feathery plumage, and the stop-motion is a bit jerky, but not horrendous. It is worth it.

Some have questioned the durability of the materials and construction; I don't agree. While it may not be durable enough for every day professional use in a spa, it is more than strong enough for at home use by a single or a couple, which is what most people are probably looking for. Also great design -- very simple to set up and folds into an easy to store size and shape.

Though certainly influenced by Eliot's advances in form, he rejected that poet's despair in favor of a grander, more mythic, and ultimately more affirmative vision of the world. (Ironic then, that he would die young by his own hand, while Eliot lived to be much older...). Crane's poetry is dense, soaked in language, shot through with a burning eroticism, and goverened by what he called \\"the logic of metaphor.\\" Often enigmatic, labyrinthian or just plain opaque, his poetry is well worth the effort one may need to put in to appreciate it fully. And as with any great work of art, one can discover something new with every repeated reading. This is not a book that sits on your shelf collecting dust."},{"rating":"2","title":"In the Tradition","review":"Hart Crane's brilliant poetry continues in the tradition of Eliot's 'The Wasteland,' in that he is interested in exploring the modern American landscape. Crane's poetry pulsates with his passion and tragedy. Frequent themes are his own homosexuality and the coldness of contemporary existence. His work is tremendous achievement in terms of its visual beauty and lyrical flow:\\"Often beneath the wave, wide from this ledgeThe dice of drowned men's bones he saw bequeathAn embassy. Their numbers as he watched,Beat on the dusty shore and were obscured.And wrecks passed without sound of bells,The calyx of death's bounty giving backA scattered chapter, livid hieroglyph,The portent wound in corridors of shells.\\"Hart Crane lived a tragically short life. Fortunately his remarkable work remains."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dont Pay that much !!!!!","review":"The book is a great resorce, but they are charging WAAAAY to much.

However I do have problems with it creating a vacuum, allowing water to get trapped in the the space between the cap and my ear, and my ear getting water in it (only on one side). This only happens when I put the cap all the way over my ears. I can't tell if I am incorrectly using this or if it is a normal. To fix this I instead put it half way over my ear as to not block the canal. That way the cap doesn't act as a barrier sealing the water in as opposed to out.This cap won't keep your hair completely dry, but it does a good job of minimizing the amount of chlorine that you hair comes in contact and also keeps the hair out of the way when swimming."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good cap","review":"I am in fifth grade and this cap(whish i got in pink), fits very nicely, great for kids 8-about 12 who need a swim cap for school physical education.

In colder weather the tightness works to keep my head warmer, which is a plus.However, I have since tried two other Speedo caps from Amazon and am much happier with them: the infinitely more comfortable Lycra cap, and the much thicker and sturdier Aqua V Silicone cap which is also a bit more comfortable.

Durabilitywise, you can drop this thing all day long, and it'll still play without missing a beat (As long as the Anti-Shock is active). I like the slick fence-like design, and the display on the player is large enough where you can see what you are listening to and also displays the Anti-Shock on the right side of the screen. Another feature is Progamming of the AM/FM tuner, something I look for most in these types of players. The instructions to programming the tuner is really simple.I fully endorse the JVC XL-PR1 Portable CD Player. Another great item by JVC."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice watch","review":"Nice watch overall, easy to see the numbers and the hands, nice shade of blue-purple as a background.

With an excelent, and extreemly overlooked and underrated Pretty Toney Album, and the Birth of a Prince growing on me consistantly, we now get No Said Date. Surprisingly enough this is one of the best Wu-Tang releases in a while. It has the vintage 94-96 sound and style of the classics such as Liquid Swords and 36 Chambers. And the inclusion of ever clan member (aside from u-god) makes the album that much better. A few of the beats were off, but what can you expect with an indie label budget. Over all a solid release which will hopefully show that if the most underspoken member of the Wu can do it, that the rest can to. Now all we need is a clan album with RZA masterminding an orchestra..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wu Tang made a statement here","review":"Wu Tang made a statement here that they never left! It was about time Masta Killa decided to drop and album considering the rest of the Wu Tang had already done so. This is classic wu tang with kung fu samples and incredible production, the wu tang joins masta killa to make this feel like a wu tang release. There are only a couple of yawn or skippable moments but overall very very solid. Love the old school feel on some of these tracks. Very well done , this made people wake up that might of forgot about wu tang and realize they never left, Wu Tang Forever!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than 85% of the albums out there.","review":"Just got this album as a present and have been enjoying it. It's a little up and down but overall the lyrics are good, the beats are good and the spirit is good. This is a nice step toward the Wu-Tang's resurection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yeah!","review":"I've been waiting for this disc forever! Everyone keeps dissing all Wu solo stuff, which 75% deserve this dissing, but people seem to forget all GZA/Genius stuff, U-God, Inspectah Deck and early Meth. All the solo stuff has golden nuggets of beauty but the bad parts way overshadow the good stuff. This album, is brilliant. Secret Rivals and Old Man are brilliant, it's worth buying for those two songs alone. Everyone should buy this album, especially those Wu fans jumping ship."},{"rating":"2","title":"4.5 Stars, where is that option?","review":"FINALLY...I have been dying for a Masta Killa album since his solo joint on The \\"W\\". This album is pretty good. Too bad it won't get promoted like it should. The production is solid and the lyrcis are never in question"},{"rating":"2","title":"WHAT?!?!? Masta Killa!?!?! Say Word!!!!!!!!!!","review":"It took almost 10 yrs for this kat to get his solo LP out. The man is very , very patient!!!!!!!!! I can't believe that I would say this about Masta Killa's album. But the truth is the truth!!! This joint is hot!!! Wu-Tang signature sound (because MK did not stray away from the formula-using Wu-Tang producers and guest appearances from some members also). I am not getting into too much detail due to the fact that most of the earlier reviews are all correct. I would do it no justice by saying the same thing as they said. But what I will say about this LP is that IT IS BETTER THAN METHOD MAN'S!!!!!!!!!! (but that depends if you love tru Wu-Tang sound, or commercial type (...) that just got on to Method Man or for anybody in Hip-Hop for that matter). Masta Killa's flow got better over the years and it is evident on this Lp. Get this album if you truly love the real Wu-tang sound, and real hip-hop!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Now this is more like it...","review":"If your a fan of the Wu or just appreciate great hip hip, pick this up. While the airwaves are being flooded with bubblegum rap, Mastah Killah brings that classic Wu sound. Intelligent, grimey, etc. This has been way overdue. Now only if more of the wu members would follow suit. What happened Meth?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ranks amongst the best in the Wu-Tang canon","review":"This album is wondrous. Just when everyone thought the Wu was falling off, Jamal Arief comes back and takes it back to the roots. Only Wu fam on this album. The samples on this are great, including the Bruce Lee at the end. I'd rank this up there with Liquid Swords and Ironman. PICK THIS CD UP!! you will not regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"bring tha brothers 2gether again","review":"pretty good need more production from the rza wu tang is always on point rza is the head they r the body also where is killarmy at bring the gods back ohio in the house peace"},{"rating":"2","title":"Masta Killah does what his name implies...","review":"This is one of the best CDs of the year, no question. With tracks like the self-titled, Kung Fu-theme sampling \\"Masta Killah\\" and MK's ode to Hip-Hop, \\"Digi-Warfare\\", this is the album I've been waiting for since 36 Chambers. Among the other fantastic tracks are \\"School\\", with RZA, who rocks his slick drum patterns with lines like: \\"I stood like a man and questioned my teacher.\\" Plus, \\"Old Man\\" is hilarious, with Ol' Dirty Bastard doing his best Sanford & Sons impression over an exposed bass and plucked electric guitar strings. The only disappointment here, however slight, is that ODB didn't rhyme on the track himself. And finally, my favorite song on the album has to be \\"Secret Rivals\\" with Method Man and the returning Killah Priest, and the three rock a cipher over banging drums and sampled tinkling piano. Whether you love the Wu or hate 'em, you WILL love this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wu-Tang Forever","review":"WE've been waiting for this album to drop for a long time....you know how the story goes. No Said Date is like the cure being injected into the murky waters of hip-hop that is today. The best producers are on this, including RZA. If you love the true Wu sound, this album carries it. Every rhyme, hook, and beat is sick. Bruce Lee's adlib on the last track seal's the deal.Wu-Tang Forever."},{"rating":"1","title":"whats up with the reviews?","review":"I have seen other reviews and have noticed that a lot of you people seem to be retarded. This album was not as good as I thought it would be, I saw myself skipping a lot of the songs. Its a shame that it took him this long to come out with an album and it bombed this bad. If your not sure about getting this album do yourself a favor and get another wu-member cd, other than U-God of course, haha.

Laura Giordano, particulary, is outstanding. The rest of the cast is at least up to the job.

I will view this dvd at least dozens of times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Started out good but...","review":"This book is definitely readable -- short chapters, clearly identified povs. But I really felt it hard to feel connected to the four women -- really connected, that is. The timeline moves quite quickly and pov shifts often. I felt as though I was watching a play, and getting to know the characters on a surface level only. Still, the author has a nice writing style."},{"rating":"1","title":"really disappointed","review":"I thought I would like this book, I was SO wrong. I don't mind 'beach reads' sometimes its nice to not have to think too hard about a story, but this book was awful. It is a really really basic story, almost non-existent. The characters are so predictable, its cheesy. I found myself cringing at the totally unrealistic story lines. The only intriging thing about this book was how the author got it published. It is cheesy predictable, and thats fine if its also fun, reading this was not fun at all. Read on the beach...if you want to fall asleep, thats all its good for. Really Awful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice","review":"I buy this clear flow filter every year, although this time I bought two, infear of them being discontinued.

The goggles fit fine, and did not fog up for the time in the pool. The snorkel works as this novice snorkeler expected.The fins are Un-friendly however. Because they have an adjustable strap, they would not stay on very well even though I had them tight. And the fins are hard, not flexible which puts a lot of stress on the foot. In just 15 minutes I was mildly bothered by it (Can't imagine after 3 hours in Tulum it would be any better!). I put on the flexy fins that are individually sized at the pool just to see if I was imagining it - and it was immediate relief. I do not recommend this set up because of the fins.Nifty backpack idea though - wish I could return just the fins!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value","review":"Great value for the money.

I wonder how long this sat on the shelf before it was shipped out."},{"rating":"1","title":"very lacking","review":"I can't comment on the quality of these bread recipes - because I see no way to bake them. Each recipe gives ingredient amounts for a \\"regular\\" and a \\"large\\"loaf - but NOWHERE does the book tell you what these mean. So if you're making a \\"regular\\" loaf, do you set your machine for 1 lb.? 1-1/2 lbs? 2 lbs? I can't believe how thoughtless this is. The main (only?) thing this book has going is glossy full-page pictures. Othwise, there's nothing you can't get in any basic bread machine book. Waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"All the Bread Fell","review":"Every recipe in this book sounded great! And every recipe I made in this book fell!

They were right. There isn't a bad recipe in the bunch; I have tried around half of them now. Your friends on low-carb diets will have a hard time once you start making loaves of bread with this handy! This book is also available in plain paperback - buying the library binding version is worth the extra cost, though, as the book lies flat, making it easy to follow the recipes."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fantastic book!","review":"I just received the paperback edition of this book and am very happy to say that it is as complete as the hardback edition. Colored photos of the breads and all! I just purchased a bread machine and didn't realize I can alter my recipes to work with it.

I intend on buying the other electric bread books as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Eclectic\\" Bread","review":"It's not a typo. Eclectic Bread would be a more suitable title for this book. We have over a dozen books on bread baking and this one does not live up to the other reviews. If you love wild loaves (saucy apple, peaches and cream, maraschino pecan, almond poppy, tropical medley and sweet coconut curry, just to name a few) you may love this book.

Other receipes have worked out fine, but there is something wrong with these.

And each time - dissapointment. Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not like it","review":"I haven't read any of Shirley's works till this one. I really enjoy her movies. I love dogs so I thought I would try to read this book. I found this book to be very lacking in dog understanding. So maybe she wasn't professing to really understand dogs and was just using them as a tool to convey some type of message. But if this was the case I found the tool/message lacking and not worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Out on her rocker","review":"It's very sad that a celebrity has to look for true love from a pet rather than friends and family. I have read all of her books and feel greatly disapointed that at this stage in her life she resorts to writing about a dog and their past lives together.I guess that is what is to be expected from an actress winning the Academy award, who now does an occasional movie of the week. I really have to question someones mental health and suggest she retire gracefully like many of her peers.What I found distrubing is why doesn't she address issues with Dogs she has had in the past, what makes this one different. Also with all that is going on in the world today I think we all need to love one another unconditionally especially we two footed beings.On a footnote remember this unconditional love comes from someone who sent their daughter to Japan at 3 years of age."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"I enjoyed this book; because being a pet owner I could definately relate to some of the things she was talking about. However there were times when it was a little hard to follow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Remember when you were a listener?","review":"This book is great for us preachers who may have forgotten exactly what it was like being a weekly listener. Van Harn talks about how we are \\"listeners\\" for our whole community- the church we serve. We listen to what they are dealing with, wondering about, concerned with and help them by putting voice to that from the pulpit. He explores how the Holy Spirit works through preaching; how we are all connected in the \\"one holy catholic and apostolic church\\" and how the sermon does function as \\"word of God.\\" I used this with my adult Sunday School class to discuss the topic of preaching and what they hear and how they respond. It was very fruitful for us!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Appropriate","review":"This video tells about the life cycle of a butterfly.

It just depends on the audience. I will use this again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is ethnic cleansing okay when the good guys do it?","review":"I have to think that other readers besides me were a little disturbed by this book's seemingly easy acceptance of \\"final solution\\" thinking. A well-constructed narrative, intriguing concepts and bad, bad, bad guys are not a good enough justification for fascism, whether we're talking about actual history or speculative fiction. Strong, wise leaders who need to cleanse society (even a really rotten one) for the elites? Norman Spinrad's Iron Dream looked at this kind of seductive thinking a generation ago -- read your SF history!Try some LeGuin in either her cultural or political mode, Emma Bull's wonderful War for the Oaks, or even the recent Lisle/ Bradley \\"Rift\\" books as antidotes to this stuff. Or go to the Salon e-zine to see David Brin's thoughtful rant about similar issues in the Phantom Menace. Good sf/fantasy is not incompatible with democracy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my cup of tea","review":"I am very fond of Teppers books. So much that I blindly buys everything I can get my hands on.This book, however, was a huge disappointment.The style clearly shows that this is among Teppers early works. The style is far from as elaborate and enjoyably intricate as some of her later work. The story as such quickly becomes boring. After about half the book, I started to get an \\"are-we-there-yet\\" attitude and found my self checking how many pages I had left to read before I could put it down. Some wise person said that life is too short to waste on bad books. So, I took the implied advice and put it down (for now). I regret having spent money on the sequel that was just recently published (\\"The Water Rising\\").I strongly recommend several of Teppers other books, though. Books like \\"Grass\\", \\"Sideshow\\", \\"Shadow's End\\" and \\"Six Moon Dance\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strange Tepper","review":"This is probably the strangest Sheri S Tepper book I have encountered so far. If you've not read one of Tepper's books before, this would not be the best one to start with. Her talents are best showcased in Beauty and The Family Tree.If you have read and liked other Tepper novels, then you'll enjoy this. On the surface it's very much to the Tepper formula - a strange and disturbing future resulting from modern society's monumental mistakes. But it's just a bit odd. The characterisations are deliberately starker and the plot takes a while to get going. 4 stars because I like it, but wouldn't necessarily recommend it to everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth it if you give it a chance","review":"I'm writing this to off set the one star rating this was given, it deserves much better. It's complex, but not so complex you need to re-read everything twice. It kind of starts off more complex than most books and I guess that puts a lot of people off, but it shouldn't because once you get into it its really very good. Also I liked how the author sort of incorporated Jungian beliefs into the story line."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deceptive","review":"This is a delightful novel.

Agian Tepper manages to weave a mystical tale that is thought provoking, as well as entertaining. The tale goes from mid-evil archtype towns right out of Rodgers and Hammerstien, to futuristic suburbs with shocking proficiency. While not quite as good as some of her other books, it would be better if the world were either a little more realistic or a little more aligorical, \\"plague of angles\\" holds its own with any of the abstract sci-fi out there. What makes Tepper so good is her ability to write books with several levels of meaning without falling into vague or inaccessable metaphors."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth it","review":"I read this a while ago, and was thoroughly unimpressed. The plot is disjointed, the characterization nonexistent, the prose style clunky, and the book's attitude on gender relations is irritating and simplistic.

Miranda, Evan, and Artemis are well-rounded, believable people with true insecurities and problems to be faced. The author avoids tried-and-true plot devices and provides a sweet tale set entirely in the countryside rather than in overused London. The author's voice grew stronger as the book moved on, and I can only think that her next book will be even better. I'm pleased to see that the next will be Artemis's story, and I look forward to reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible taste!","review":"I am amazed that this got some kind of award for good taste. I have three children (11, 9, 6) who have been taking another brand of DHA/fish oils for years (Nordic naturals.) When we ran out this time, I decided to give these a try. None of my children was willing to eat them -- I'll have to see if I can return them.

This book does not do that. In fact I am not sure what it does. It is only a few score pages, printed on cheap stock and is not organized in what I would consider a pragmatic way.I've since bought a number of Vedic books so I have a better idea now of the ideas put forth by this book and this author. They are simple enough I suppose for a beginner but only if, perhaps, that beginner is an Indian and has already grown up in a culture where such astrology is commonplace.

Equally at home in collections of New Age, goth, or ambient music, Lanterna is a simply beautiful collection of songs suitable for candle-lit latenights, rainy Saturdays, dinnertime, bathtime, or bedtime. The album's strong point is its continuity and cohesiveness: the songs meld together like an epic poem. The downside of this, of course, is that the songs individual character may easily escape; but over time, careful listeners are sure to find a very personal favorite."},{"rating":"2","title":"Descrtiption and track listing","review":"From [...]:\\"Lanterna is a project put together by Champaign, Illinois mainstay Henry Frayne. This gorgeous CD is filled with delay-drenched guitars, reverb-y drums, and sparse singing (the record is predominantly instrumental). These beautiful soundscapes, rich in moody guitars and dreamy, thoughtful rhythms, define Lanterna's sound; somewhat akin to Bruce Licher's Scenic or Ennio Morricone's spaghetti westerns... an ideal soundtrack for a road movie in slow motion or a drive across the desert...This special project is packaged in a beautiful, letterpress discfolio designed by Independent Project Press.\\"TRACK LISTING:Silent HillsDown By The SeineTurbine No.1985DarkPassageColossus DawnEnd Of The TunnelBells/FallingDown By The Seine (Drowning)Ether NetNo. 7 Galerie Des AnciennesDragon SeasonSpring Achieving OnenessSlidesPuerto De Luna"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful","review":"Beautiful.

Even if the stories themselves differed from mine, I found at the very least phrases and ideas that summed up thoughts of mine that had been hard for me to articulate. These phrases and ideas grew to concepts that bolstered my essay quite a bit. My vote: get this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh.","review":"If you're totally lost, this could be a good starting point, but if you actually wrote a personal statement that sounded anything like this you'd come off as a total tool. So if that's what you're going for, great."},{"rating":"1","title":"For about 1 percent of Applicants, if that","review":"The two stars go in honor of the questions asked early in the book, which do suggest many useful things to include in your statement. Very quickly, however, the book takes a one-way street that only the extreme cases can follow. The example essays include people who have escaped the communist regime of Cuba, been haunted by the Russian KGB, lived in a car, and an Olympic Skier. If you do have an extreme tear-jerker for the academy, buy this book--but that is the only style of essay discussed. If you happen to be among the average applicants, though, and you trying to get an edge, this may not be the right place to look. I am applying to Public Health school, and found more useful info in a book on getting into Law schools. I would suggest checking out the Degree of Difference Series over this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent, broad-based resource for graduate applicants","review":"An excellent, broad-based resource no graduate applicant should miss. While clearly useful for individuals seeking admission to law, business and medical schools (which attract the largest numbers), the book lives up to its title by also providing a wealth of valuable information for those of us applying to other types of graduate programs. Included among the excellent essays, for instance, are examples from candidates for public administration, English and American literature, science, dentistry and geology. The author's advice, and that of a multitude of admissions officials, obviously applies to all applicants and offers exceptional direction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Emphasis on regular people by giving extreme examples.","review":"My big gripe, which someone has already wisely brought up is that this book emphasizes that one does not need incredible stories to write a great personal essay. However, the example essays are pretty incredible with the whole KGB scenario or a parent having AIDS just before taking the LSATS. Moreover, this book is best for law, business, or med school, and the book is probably more useful for those with a few years of post undergraduate professional work. If you're like me, and you're applying to a general/regular graduate school right after undergaduate school, you will have to really fight hard to extrapolate the concepts needed to write a good essay. My closest example in the book was for an international affairs graduate school with an applicant that had about 10 years of professional drug use........."},{"rating":"2","title":"not for every surface","review":"If you need this product, buy the trigger spray instead.

Some people have said they don't see the anti aging benefits - I disagree as sometimes one doesn't know what type of damage or aging effects people are trying to correct or reverse. I have used anti aging products with minimal sun exposure for about 10yrs and using Murad definitely maintains my youthfulness in its current form... My aging is certainly not any more noticeable so it must be doing something.

This guy had the nerve to accuse me of tampering with the POS they sold me. After an hour of arm twisting they finally agreed to replace their junk. I went home and used them for about a week before they died again. Went back to their office in Chino and that they said they won't honor warranty on a replacement?! I gave up and just threw their POS in the garbage next to their office. As I drove off I saw two of their employees digging through the thrash to salvage the POS they sold me.

Just page after page of type; so, not as bad as a 1900 newspaper, but unappealing and unfriendly. I think the versions I read long ago had illustrations by Ernest Shepherd. Ohhhh, that is a loss....Think about this. Two small-print columns per page, no illustrations, a floppy paperback printed on what appears to be cheap paper.

Ok so the hero believes his sister that has shown signs of instability and still finds a way to blame the heroine for losing the baby. They never really say if he believes it is her fault because she was clumsy and fell or he thinks she threw herself down the stairs. Through the whole book he makes reference to how she killed the baby and it is all about him wanting to get her pregnant to replace the baby she took from him. All I can say is this is just horrible.

There are many well-written books for adolesants that deal with sexuality in a tasteful way. This is not one of them. The writing is horribly juvenile and patronizing, the characterization is weak, and the plot flops.

We felt like everyone was doing \\"it\\", and since the book was written for us \\"it\\" must be OK. Nothing could have been farther from the truth. Yes, everyone was *talking* about it, but most were *not* doing it. However, several of my friends became sexually active shortly after reading that book. Even if *some* teens are doing these parties, it doesn't mean they all are. Books like this will cause it to become the norm and should never be published!

The Corn is blares unexpectedly while the dynamics are all over the place. The audio quality may be good, but the music sounds so bad; especially the harpsichord which has an unpleasantly metallic timbre.If you want a great new recording, get either the Tafelmusik recording under the direction of Jeanne Lamon (which has the best Concerto No. 5 around), or Jordi Savall's recording directing Le Concert des Nations/La Capella Real de Catalunya. Both of those recordings far outshine this one and make it sound like the work of amateurs."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't get the glowing reviews at all","review":"I bought this set thinking it would rock the sometimes-too-sedate world of recorded Brandenburgs. I had read good things about their performances of Vivaldi classics, so naturally I was intrigued. Well, what a disappointment. This performance hardly \\"rocks\\" at all. (If that's the best word.) It sounded a bit soulless. The slow movements didn't move me. The actual recording is first-rate, though, and for period instruments it's nice. But the playing is just not that inspired. I couldn't tell where I was a few times; which concerto I was listening to. Maybe that was just me putting my attention elsewhere, like, \\"when am I going to find a hot recording of the beloved Brandenburgs?\\" Perhaps I'm having a bad day, but I doubt it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"Is this some kind of joke? This collection of egomaniacs makes a mess out of the Brandenburg Concertos. The horns \\"blat\\" too loudly, the tempos are ridiculously fast and the varation in dymanics (loud and soft) is distracting and, very often, absurd.They appear to be just too impressed with themselves and treat this beautiful music as if it needs \\"updating\\". It does not, it's Bach. Play it beautifully and sensitively. Not like this abomination."},{"rating":"1","title":"I love to hate them","review":"I own many disk of IGA including this, I've heard them in concert and even assist to a rehearsal.

If you're looking for a story, this isn't it. It has an English word and a Spanish word on each page. The main thing it lacks is the phonetic Spelling. Overall, a good vocabulary builder, or an addition to a comprehensive curriculum's chapter on weather, like Flip Flop Spanish.Bright pictures and nice sized words are easy to see, but just not a real show-stopper for daily use with my own children. However, it is great in my Spanish classes.At home, it would be a great addition to any curriculum, to change things up with some colorful pictures.

She does discuss how many total calories your child should get in a day, but not any other nutrients. There are no recipes in this book. She does provide some examples of what an appropriate serving size is for each age group, but only for a very few specific foods and there is no guidance as to how to adapt what you read on a food label (usually for a 2000 cal. adult diet) to what your child actually needs in their diet.

This book was obviously rushed out the door without careful editing (sadly this is the case for far too many technical books these days).- It does not address the topics in nearly enough depth for the CCIE written exam. Nor do the sample questions require the kind of in-depth reasoning and understanding that the CCIE exam requires.Preparing for the CCIE written definitely does require multiple books.

It is part SF, part satire, but all very readable and enjoyable. It is thought-provoking but doesn't beg to be taken seriously, and certainly not literally.For the objectivists in the crowd, I recommend it for those who thought *Atlas Shrugged* was gospel when they read it in college, but who are now ready to begin questioning Ayn Rand's philosophy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not his best.","review":"A humorous and entertaining story that captures ones attnetion and continues to engage until the last page. I was turned on to Ruff's books with Fool on the Hill which I enjoyed so much I had to buy this one. This story provides great charcter development, and tells a story that is unbelievable, yet makes one wonder how far away from reality it really is.

However, I always find it offputting if major characters spend inordinate amounts of time lighting up and puffing away and that was the case here with several characters. Most improbably, one of the chain-smoking characters was a one-armed veteran from the Civil War. Still, I was amazed at the inventiveness of the author and would recommend the book if only for that reason. Too bad this was written before 9/11, as the author would have had great fun working that in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Weird and wonderful","review":"I'd never heard of this book when it was recommended for our book club. With the confusion of characters and sub-plots it took a while to get into, but was well worth the work. Ruff has created a wonderful, witty adventure of a novel - as it progressed and the storylines came together I had trouble putting it down.There are moments where his 'term paper'-style arguments with Ayn Rand de-rail the flow and grate a little, but his satire of American culture and all things 'politically correct' are entertaining enough to forgive him. Definitely recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Goofy Entertainment","review":"Recipe: Start with parody, stir in madcap; search the surreal cupboard, add everything plus the kitchen sink; light on the spices, you don't want much depth; toss sloppily.Result: An entertaining beach read with several tasty morsels (e.g. Abbie Hoffman trying to develop Ayn Rand's sense of humor), but you'll be hungry for some literary meat after an hour."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not quite Neal Stephenson ... yet","review":"\\"Sewer, Gas & Electric: The Public Works Trilogy\\" (which I said in full anytime anyone asked me what I was reading) is without doubt a very enjoyable read. The three page or so summary of Ayn Rand's \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" is worth the purchase price alone. However, the reason it didn't rate higher is, as Harry Gant would have said, a lack of \\"neatness.\\" Don't get me wrong, it almost is a \\"neat\\" little package. Just almost though.

Unfortunately, the wit and innovativeness of Ruff's first novel have taken a cynical turn in \\"Sewer, Gas & Electric\\".My biggest disappointment was the book's lack of balance, and for that I hold the editor responsible. The Ayn Rand element is vital, but way, way overplayed. There are also strange little allusions left dangling (e.g. one of our hero's contracting chicken pox in the last pages).

But from there, to actually beleive that people are intrinsically bad because somebody dreamt that he was a snake or a spider, or that he is the next avatar of humanity because he is a tiger or a jaguar, is childish. Many crimes have happened when people begin to believe that the unconscious world is part of the real world. With this kind of philosophy, it seems the power of belief takes over the power of awareness. This is a confusing book, far from its apparent good intention, it hides its purpose. I agree with other reviewers that it borders with indoctrination more than with a real sense of connection with nature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Far from good","review":"With the apparent intention of setting up a new and very original paradigm in the world of animal esoteric meanings, the author tries with no success to describe what he calls, a revolution in the knowledge of allies.According to his vision, spiders and snakes are bad and jaguars and dolphins are good.... I think this kind of thought is quite infantile and yes, it is new and original, because no author ever dared to state something so ridiculous.Suryavan Solar usually calls privately that women who are too beautiful and talented, snakes, as if this would be the worst. All this kind of beleifs and superstitions, doesn't have anything to do with real native knowledge and wisdom.If this book pretends to be of some interest, maybe the author, should take new ideas of other books, such as Animal-Speak: The Spiritual & Magic Powers of Creatures Great & Small, of Ted Andrews, who with much sincerity and little pretense, shows a world where animals belong to a kingdom of awareness."},{"rating":"2","title":"increible conocimiento","review":"leer este libro es una revelante experiencia, los aliados de poder nos ayudan a avanzar en nuestro propio mundo, y el tener una buena relacion con ellos nos da mucho conocimiento de nosotros mismos y de la mision que estamos cumpliendo en este planeta. yo creo que todos debemos de conocer quienes son nuestros aliados y como atraerlos a nuestra vida y como relacionarnos con ellos para poder usar mejor nuestro poder personal y lograr muchas mas cosas con mas facilidad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but full of errors","review":"Whilst the author has gone to great lengths to show various routing theories & their implementation, the number of errors is large.

How can configuration statements and command outputs that one would think were simply copied verbatim from a console session contain so many errors?And we're not just talking typographical errors and misprints. One exercise uses pings to test an access list-based route map on the same router. One problem: access lists are designed to filter traffic going through the router. They will not filter traffic that has originated from the router. So how was the sample output shown in the book generated?

Though each chapter goes into detail, the chapters contain key defintions and concepts in bullet points. Each chapter concludes with a summary and exercises that can be used by one person or by groups.

Morris lends the story depth by including colorful depictions of everyday New York life circa the early 1900s, intriguing descriptions of the corrupt practices of editors and reporters, and vivid accounts of major events like the Titanic disaster, a story that Chapin's paper scooped from its competitors.

The building metaphors were frustratingly tedious (just read a sample page, and imagine it multiplied by 100 before buying). Almost all the characters were simplistic and two dimensional; females were the worst. They have zero personality and seem to exist only as sexual sycophants, nymphs or nutjobs. I mean I guess a lot of pulp fiction has similar characters but I was expecting more depth.

Those who liked the first volume will enjoy the second one. At the end of part 1, Shido's secritary, high school student Riho, was near death, and having no other way of saving her, he reluctantly turned her into a vampire.

Dirk Pitt, who's been shot more times than a Texas Yield sign, takes on the evil Japanese Empire as they smuggle atomic bombs into America via imported cars. Oddly enough, the trillions of dollars spent on national defense can't stop a bunch of missiles cruising down Route 66 at 55 mph. This book panders to the anti-Japanese sentiment of the early nineties, which severely dates it, and makes it that much less believable. Cussler's Pitt novels have always been over-the-top in their villians, heroes and story plots, but this one will virtually assault your credulity sensors. I usually enjoy the roller coaster ride, but not this time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A phenomenal novel absolutely full of excitement!","review":"In 1945, Two U.S. bombers took off for Japan with atomic bombs, but only one got through. Now, in 1993, Dirk Pitt and the american government find that Japan has developed a plan to destroy the western countries, called the Kaiten Project. Through this project, Japanese fanatics have hidden over a hundred nuclear bombs in the powerful western countries. And if their economical demands aren't met, they will have no choice but to detonate them...This book was Clive Cussler at his finest. The whole novel was very well thought out, and absolutely loaded with action. Anyone who enjoys reading will enjoy Dragon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dragon","review":"This book, Dragon, was by Clive Cussler. I have read about 5 of his books, and this one was outstanding. Mr. Cussler has a knack for keeping the reader interested from the beginning to the end of his books. His characters are varied, but all hold your interest. I would suggest this book, as well as other Clive Cussler books, for an interesting reading experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"An old Cussler is still better than a new anyone else","review":"A genuine hero, how rare is that?

It ranks a close second to \\"Cyclops\\". \\"Dragon\\" is a very thought-provoking novel in that it makes me wonder just how far off Cussler's baseline story reflects today's world. His use of robots made for the sole purpose of driving Japanese cars with hidden nuclear bombs to predetermined world locations is disturbing. Who knows how far an intelligent, industrialized nation could go if such a nation fell into the hands of the wrong power-hungry leaders? My only objection came at the end of the story. Without giving anything away, I found it hard to believe how Dirk Pitt managed to survive again! Oh, well. Such is fiction. Despite this minor complaint, \\"Dragon\\" is still a great entertaining read with nonstop action. I recommend it to all Cussler fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another winner....","review":"I was hesitant to read a cussler novel, but now that i have read 4, i plan to read them all. they are entertaining, insightful and overall just very good. the comparison to james bond is abundant, but the story lines are much more complicated and absorbing than any bond film. just enjoy!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cussler's worst","review":"Clive Cussler is my favorite author but this was his greatest misfire and the only book that I have NEVER reread.

The rest are ho hum and could be representative of any european country without a truely defined cuisine.This is available in places as a PDF so look around and get yourself a bargain rather than the expensive hard copy book (I have the entire library of these books)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good, thought-provoking book by a knowledgeable theologian and educator..","review":"Eugene Peterson is a very knowledgeable theologian and educator. He is thorough as well as very good at covering his topic from several different viewpoints and with a variety of \\"word-pictures\\" and sidelights on his topic. This book provided a very good basis for an online faith formation discussion I participated in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a user's manual","review":"The earlier reviewer is right: This is not a user's manual. Peterson doesn't explain his ideas with straight, clear prose. Rather, he waxes poetic and writes rather circularly, going round and round a point well after it is established, but not necessarily shedding new light on it each time. But then, that shows my preference in style; others apparently really like it.I think the book also is for the already-converted, those already familiar with his basic ideas and who share his assumptions. It is not for the non-Christian or the non-traditional Christian, especially since it seems to define \\"the spiritual life\\" (rather than \\"a spiritual life\\") only in Biblical terms, despite the spiritual practices and wisdom of many non-Biblical faiths."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Message Bible is great; this is not","review":"The Message Bible is excellent; his other books are not.I flipped through it and sent it back."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like what it says, but not how it says it","review":"As the title suggests, Peterson is proposing a new (or ancient) way of thinking about and talking about God. I love the way he captures the flavor of spiritual intimacy, and the way he captures the essence of living at peace with God. The book is full of gems of insight and language.But the poetic language gets both dense and protracted, and at times almost impenetrable. This is not a book to be read in a hurry. It took Peterson a ream of paper just to elucidate the odd title.I would have enjoyed it more if he could have accomplished it in 150 pages. But accomplishment is not the point of a Conversation in Spiritual Theology, is it?The fact that I found this book frustrating to read tells me that I fail at a broad spiritual discipline it expounds: Sabbath Keeping"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute!

Even the pitch of the narrator's voice is different between the two versions.I don't know if this was deliberate (I hope not, since the DVD box claims it is Portugese) or if they used the wrong film master, but it makes a tremendous difference.Also, the sound is distorted in part of chapter 4, but I could even live with that if it was in the right language.I was really looking forward to this and I'm too upset to even come up with a sappy response for the Where in the world are you? box as is my custom."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well produced CD","review":"This is an absolutely excellent production.

Of course that the book has it's flaws here and there (like that a child whose English speaking skills are limited throughout most of the text, occasionaly uses 'GRE' words), but then again, who am i or anyone else for that matter, to critique a way that a child soldier sees and experiences what is happening to him. Iweala, according to the interview at the end of the book, has written this after numerous talks that he had had with children who have seen the horrors of war, from Bosina, to Afganistan, to Africa.PS - Some reviewers have said that there are better books on child-soldiers. When i read them I will give them five stars too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beasts of No Nation: A Novel","review":"This book offers an excellent window into a civil war torn country and the children who fall victim to the brutality of adults. The story is told from the view point of a young boy who is abducted by a bunch of roving revolutionaries and forced to grow up in an instant as he is inducted into a ragtag, undisciplined \\"army\\". The writing style was a bit difficult to get accustomed to as it is written as if the main character is speaking to you in his broken, local dialect. But as the story progresses and you become absorbed in his story, the unfamiliar cadence of the language melts away and you become that young boy struggling against the evils surrounding him. Mr. Iweala tells a hard tale, one that is painful to read, but one that needs to be told."},{"rating":"1","title":"Here we go again.","review":"You almost feel sorry for the author. Draped in acclaim, among the books of the year, it can only mean that any reader approaches this book with high expectations. More worrying, the author's information on the back of the book talks mosly about all the prizes he won at Harvard. And that's what the book feels like, a very well executed assignment. It's written in a fairly convincing pidgin English, but when it wavers, it breaks the rhythm and the belief. It also feels entirely formulaic. It goes through the trials of dehumanisation (murder, rape, sodomy etc) but it never engages the reader's sympathy, just occasional admiration. There's no doubt that Iweala can write. I hope he dares to produce something fresh that doesn't feel borrowed from another culture, another life. I'd risk buying another book of his."},{"rating":"1","title":"traumatizing, and quiet","review":"Beasts of No Nation creates a image of horror for the readers, but the matter of fact tone it unfolds in left me wondering why I had read so many pages of horror.

Little is known about what the soldiers are fighting for, or what they do. It was written in Agu's voice,and his point of view. The book is easy to read, but in my opinion lacked the emotional appeal one would expect from a novel of this subject. Also, the author does a poor job of characterization. We know little about Agu, except his innocence, and it is hard for the reader to become attatched to him or any other characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry but I don't get it","review":"I was really looking forward to reading this work as I'm very interested in what is going on in Africa and I am a writer as well. I found this work almost impossible to read as it does not adhere to any form of English that I have ever read. The story is probably great but that's moot if one finds it too difficult to read. Interesting that one of the reviewers on book's jacket cover commends the writing for coming up with a new form of English.

The campground was pretty much in a city where other campers' radios had great reception. I tried hanging the radio from a tree, from the middle of the tent and even around my neck. Nothing worked.The problem with this radio is that when it's in your hand, the radio station sounds fine. As soon as your hand moves away from the tuner, the static overtakes the reception. I'm not sure if a homemade antenna would work or not, but it shouldn't be needed for something that's supposed to be portable and convenient.I've had cheaper radios that worked better than this one.

Wild chases, wacky comedy, and sentimental soul-searching ensue.

If you're a Kathy Bates fan, it's a must have. The movie shows us how life has alot of unpredictable twists and turns and how the influences of just a few people in your life can take you to new places - literally and otherwise - as with taking a person out of their comfort zone to where they end up living life out loud more.

It's definitely a must see!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste all around","review":"This confused, badly written jumble of a film is an insult to the fine acting ability of Kathy Bates and Rupert Everett and a waste of time for those able to endure it. It isn't a comedy, an adventure, a soap opera, or much of anything else. You wait until the last five minutes to learn that it's all about how good homosexuals can be and that life can be truly fulfilled by singing on television. This one goes in the golden turkey book. My copy goes quickly into the garbage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kathy Sings","review":"First let me say I love Kathy Bates. This is at least as good as Misery or Fried Green Tomatoes if not better. She is particularly good in the scenes where she must have a flat effect. From pathos to suspence to comedy this movie has it all. I was hysterical for the Sundance scene. And then Kathy sings. I have heard her with small bits but in this one she really cuts loose. From softly singing to herself to making the rafters ring and she is really very good. The supporting cast does a marvelous job. The only thing that bothered me was the \\"Fox\\" singing numbers - the chorograghy was not the best. It was stiff and abrupt, not like I have seen him move before. After you find out that his character was [homosexual] it could make sense. This is a welcome addition to my collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame, total waste of talent","review":"I love Kathy Bates, but this movie, with a great cast never takes off or hits a mark. Julie Andrews doing \\"Getting to Know You\\" once was quite enough,there was no need for an encore.It is a bad \\"gay\\" movie, and a bad \\"straight\\" movie. The start is incredibly slow and bland and when Miss Bates lands herself in England, hopefully to pick up the pace, it continues on it's banal course. This movie needs some spice, a lot more wit and a much faster pace. There is no comparing this to Muriel's Wedding or Four Weddings and a Funeral.

However, that's not a unique sin to this one: many horror movies from 1980s and later have used the original Psycho plan. Despite that, the movie has a pretty descent script and acting if you take into account the standard for horror movies in the 1980s (e.g., Friday the 13th). Despite very few \\"fatal errors\\" that come with horror movies (e.g., the killer keeps coming back after being shot or heavy wounded), the movie has a good pace and is entertaining. I recommend it.

I have marinated vegetables on put on the kabobs that were wondeful. Last but not least I have cooked at least 7 chickens so far (two were cornish hens) and the whole family loved them. One thing I would watch is when marinated or basting the chicken don't use a paste type rub with lots of pieces of spices because they will just turn black but when I just juice type marinades and dry rubs they melt in your mouth. I have not used the steamer on the top yet and don't know when or if I will. I am just not in the habit of steaming fresh veggies. Any way, I love this product and am so glad I went for it. Oh, easy clean up too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as hokey as the infomercial","review":"My husband was skeptical of getting this. But after making a couple of dinners with it, he is sold. We absolutely love this machine. Very easy to clean. Important to keep kids away--it does get very hot to touch. We use our island to set it up on to cook. The reconditioned unit we bought had no blemishes-I couldn't tell it was not a brand new, never opened machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"A BARGAIN BY RONCO A DISASTER FOR THE CUSTOMER","review":"I PURCHASED ONE OF THESE UNITS ONLY TO FIND THAT IT WAS MISSING PARTS. I HAD A HEAT REFLECTOR FROM A MODEL I BOUGHT YEARS AGO SO THAT WASNT THE PROBLEM. WHEN I TURNED THIS UNIT ON TO COOK A CHICKEN I HEARD A BUNCH OF CRACKLING NOISES AND WHEN I LOOKED AT THE OVEN DOOR IT WAS SHATTERING INTO HUNDREDS OF PIECES. THE GLASS STARTING FALLING EVERYWHERE. NEEDLESS TO SAY ROASTED CHICKEN MIGHT OF BEEN A GREAT DINNER BUT I HAD TO SETTLE FOR A CUP OF SOUP. NOW I CANT EVEN GET RONCO TO RESPOND ABOUT THEIR SO CALLED WARRANTY. IS THIS BREAKAGE OR DEFECT????WHO KNOWS BUT STILL NOONE RESPONDS TO MY NEED TO REPLACE THIS GLASS DOOR.

But if you want the best roast chicken........yummy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great machine, great price...I just want one that works!","review":"I received this item in a timely manner and it came looking new, but I was disappointed when I used it the first time that the timer did not work and the light didn't come on. I received a timely response and got directions to returning it. I got a second unit and this one the timer didn't work. As for the product, it cooks food great, I like the clean up but you will need to use a little elbow grease. I'm currently returning my second one and hoping that maybe three's a charm and I will get one that totally works!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A disposible applience","review":"It works as described. After about 5 uses, the plastic starts to crack and fall off. It soon develops an ugly, unremovable brown patina. I've had and used it for about a year now, and it looks so bad...I can cleanup my LAWNMOWER!, but this thing is unsightly after about 15 uses.Hey it made great chicken, but It's now an embarrassment. I will throw it out soon.A better finish, plastic, etc. would have helped.I wouldn't buy another one.I feel I was taken, and for this reason I will rate it 1 star."},{"rating":"1","title":"I just don't agree","review":"I found the product to cook unevenly (outside and ends burned, inside and middle pink). Also, it is extremely hard to clean, and by far the most unsafe product I have seen in a while. With all of the parameters, there is no safe place for it in my kitchen, the outside is definately a hazzard for children, and the places you have to clean make me worry about damaging the electrical wiring and causing a fire. I gave mine up to a garage sale, only it wouldn't sell!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Delicious & Easy to Use","review":"We just received our Rotisserie & accessory kit & LOVE it! This is the first time all of our children ate everything we fixed. Amazing. It was easy to clean, all parts are removeable and dishwasher safe. Excellent rotisserie finish. We cooked chicken inside (of course), next we cooked new potatoes inside using the accessory kit basket & we steamed corn on the cob on top. Delicious...buy extra corn...it will go fast. Also, must buy accessory kit...offers extra basket, ties, great cookbook. We got the rotisserie & accessory kit as a bundle ... ...."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Love My Ronco Rotisserie","review":"I purchased this item from my gold box, and I am so glad I did. It is wonderful. I had a diner party for 6 people and decided to make a roast beef. I marinated the meat, put it on the rack, set it and forget it. The meat came out tender and delicious and perfectly cooked. The recipe book that is included has some really great ideas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't hold up to the test of time","review":"I loved cooking with this product. I might have used it about 10 times. The food turned out delicious. However, my Ronco started to fall apart. Small pieces of plastic (from the track that holds the door) fell off every time I used it. The oven door no longer closes securely. I have tried repeatedly to reach the company and cannot get through to them. My letters go unanswered, and my Ronco collects dust in the basement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not built to last, but the chicken is great.","review":"I have purchased 2 of these ovens. They both broke in the same place, the plastic at the bottom of the oven in the front that holds the front glass cover on. I love the food it makes. If you own one, please take this advice. Use the big hypodermic needle to inject chicken broth and your favorite spices or flavor scheme into the meat before you cook it. Dont poke it throuth the skin, just poke it around from the inside, and the areas where the meat is exposed, like the neck and the back end. Good luck with the factory defect, You will need it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ronco Showtime Rotisserie","review":"Love this rotisserie! This appliance is the one kitchen item my wife says she could not live without, and she has practically every modern convenience known to man!! We got ours two years ago at full price and feel that it was excellent value even at the much higher price. We use it all the time, and thoroughly enjoy the foods that we cook in it. Meats, fish and poultry taste better than with any other cooking method. And a 15 pound turkey cooked during the holidays tastes beyond belief. It truly is \\"Set it and forget it!\\". Couldn't be easier.An added benefit is that it is a great conversation piece when guests arrive during the cooking process!We like it so much that we'll be buying another one from Amazon.com for our boat."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great product!","review":"I ordered this a few weeks back from amazon. I read all the reviews and thought about this purchase very carefully before I made my decision. I've got to say, I made a wise one with this rotisserie. It was very easy to operate and everything I've cooked in this has been so good. Last night I cooked 2 whole chickens and my family asked me when I was going to cook some more. No leftovers here! What a wonderful product this is!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed with Missing Peices","review":"The missing peices from this shipment have me re-thinking ordering from Amazon. There is no apparent method for contacting this merchant to request the missing peices and without it my Rotisserie is inoperable. I just went to the Popeil website to buy the peices which will cost me another $40!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works as Advertised","review":"First, recommend buying the accessory kit with the rotisserie.I'm very pleased with the virtual brand new condition of theunit, the completeness of the system, and the fact that it indeedworks as advertised. Have enjoyed a wonderful pork roast and beef steaks, although the latter did not brown due the shortnessof the time needed to cook medium rare. The accessory recipe book's recommended cooking times are extremely accurate. Overall, I'm delighted, and can't wait to try other recipes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tastes good but very poor quality","review":"THe food taste great out of this thing, but mine broke a lot and the parts are expensive to replace. Working with Ronco was a pain. Personally, I would get the George Foreman."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would be nice if it were hotter.","review":"Seems easy enough to use and clean. But it doesn't seem to get hot enough. First night I did a chicken. Looked wonderful, but gave it an extra 10 minutes and it still was a little pink in places. Next night I tried chicken kabobs. It said 35 minutes. After 35 minutes I used my meat thermometer which said medium rare(did not get to \\"well\\", or \\"poultry\\"). I gave it extra 30 minutes, and it still read medium rare. I finished them on my barbeque, they were a bit dry. I know it's under warranty but I'm not sure I want to spend the time and postage (both ways) for another refurb that might not work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Luck with Rotisseries","review":"I orginally order Factory-Reconditioned Ronco Inventions 3000TFS Showtime Indoor Compact Rotisserie & BBQ and I attempted to use it 3 different times and all time is smelled like a burning element. It was a very odoress smell to the point that I was not able to continue to use or keep it. I then ordered the Factory-Reconditioned Ronco Inventions ST4000R Showtime Indoor Rotisserie and Barbecue and that was missing several parts: the relector plate that goes behind the heating element (not able to use machine without it safely), the kebab rods and flavor injector. I feel very frustrated as the only way to communicate is through email and internet, you do not get to talk to an actual person. I hope that the replacement they are sending me will bring me good luck and work properly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the infomercials!","review":"I love the rotisserie. Forget the infomercials. I didn't buy this for years because I thought it was all hype. But it is quick and easy to use, the clean up is easy and the food tastes great. Instead of watching the stove, the oven and the microwave I just glance at the rotisserie and it's doing it all. The fat cooks out and there's no constant fiddling with the food. I would never have ordered this because of the infomercials but my sister brought hers when she came to visit and I tried to hold it hostage when she left. She took hers so I bought my own and wish I'd done it years ago."},{"rating":"2","title":"me liked it lot","review":"chicken tasted butter then KFC.couldnn't whait for it to get done.it was evan goood haf raw! Roast was perfuct and blood went into pan to save for Wendsday nites meeting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than storebought!","review":"I got my Showtime Rotisserie 2 weeks ago and have since fixed roast chicken (juicy and done perfectly after setting it on sear for 4 min on each side to brown even more), salmon in the small basket, and 2 porkloins, as well as 3 club steaks (think I prefer the outside BBQ, but the snow was too deep!). The food has been very tasty, moist and easily cooked and cleaned up. It beats standing in the cold by my outside BBQ. It's even easy to entertain while you use it. The instructions work well. ON Today show Al Roker took the chicken out too early, as it needs at least an hour + for a 3 lb chicken. Took 1 1/2 hr for 6 lb one-done to perfection. Try it and you'll enjoy life again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Chicken I've Ever Had","review":"I received the Ronco Rotisserie yesterday and tried it on baby back ribs first. They came out only so-so.I cooked a 4.3 pound chicken in it this morning. I used the supplied injector to inject Italian dressing into the chicken and cooked for 65 minutes and then switched to the rotation only (no heat) mode until it cooled. It was golden brown on the outside and juicy on the inside. I couldn't ask for anything better.Cleanup was really easy. No sand blasting required. Just a little soap and brushing with a toothbrush (yes it was new) on a couple of parts and it was as good as new.I read on Usenet that using aluminum foil on top of rhe drip tray and puncturing it to provide drainage makes cleanup even easier. I guess I will try that next time.I'm looking forward to trying a roast."},{"rating":"2","title":"JUST GET IT!!","review":"HAVE HAD MY SHOWTIME FOR TWO MONTHS NOW. FLAWLESS OPERATION. LIKE BRAND NEW. HAVEN'T HAD PROBLEM WITH DOOR AS OTHERS, I SUSPECT THEIR SLIDING UP DOOR BEFORE IT'S FULLY EXTENDED CAUSING PINS TO BREAK.HERE'S SOME EASY CLEAN UP TIPS:FOR EASY CLEAN UP, LINE DRIP TRAY WITH FOIL.

The reason I only gave it a 4 star is because I noticed when I've cooked chickens it tends to smoke making the house smokey. Other then that the food is absolutely DELICIOUS!! I would highly recommended this product and even being factory reconditioned you would never be able to tell it. AND the price was right! The wheels squeaked a bit so now before cooking I apply a bit of cooking oil to each area and that solves that! When I cooked my first chicken, my husband and I sat and ate the whole thing! Clean up is fairly easy. Order one today! I really don't think you would be sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great food, Awful customer service","review":"I have had my unit for over a year. It makes the best food even better, the problem is when something goes wrong as the company will never reply to their Emails. Mine first broke on Thanksgiving day. I Emailed them requesting information on replacement parts, No reply. 2 months ago the timer handle broke so I Emailed them again, 2 Emails 0 replies. If you buy the item you will enjoy it until it breaks."},{"rating":"2","title":"I can't believe it really works this well???","review":"A great machine!! I can't believe I bought something from the guy who sells spray-on hair (Ronco). I saw the info-mercials and thought that if this thing works half as well at home, then I would love it.Even though it was factory reconditioned, it looks new and operates just fine. We have cooked several chickens and a boneless leg of lamb with no issues. The clean up isn't too difficult either. Read all of the directions and watch the video as it gives some good tips for tying the chicken.The chicken is tender and juicy like it should be. You really can cook 2 3-4 lb chickens in it at once. Make sure that you have room for this one as it's a bit large, and the outside gets hot while it cooks.This is one appliance that we will use often (the butcher gave my wife a funny look when she asked for 6 whole chickens)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ronco Indoor Rotisserie","review":"Not impressed with this indoor rotisserie. It does not get hot enough to brown the meat sufficiently. The warming tray, (we thought came with the unit), is an additional charge. We did not have very good luck contacting them either. We will be putting this item into the next rummage sale."},{"rating":"1","title":"ronco rotisserie","review":"This machine can do a fair job,but it has big drawbacks: 1) difficult to set up 2) heat is not trapped so it heats up the kitchen greatly 3)By the time it is set up, food planned could be better cooked in an oven 4) difficult to clean properly 5) messy and dangerous 6) I no longer use this thing and feel cheated"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome! You can't tell the reconditioned from a new unit!","review":"I purchased a reconditioned unit for about half the price. The unit was professionally cleaned and all the accessories appear to be new. I have already tried chicken and roast beast (as the Grinch would call it) and they both came out nice and juicy. Others have complained about the clean up being messy but I found that lining the drip tray with heavy foil easily solves this problem. I just remove the foil after and my clean up is done. This unit does get very hot which could be good or bad depending on how you look at it. When I have this puppy going I don't need to turn on my heater so for me this rotisserie is a plus. I was hesitant to buy one initially but I am really glad I did. No regrets!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product but set off smoke detector.","review":"Arrived in great condition, with all the accessories. When it was first tried, we put in beef roast and after about 30 minutes, it set off the smoke detector - somewhat irritating. The meat cooked well and was eaten in a matter of minutes. The product is great and our smoke detector works too well.
