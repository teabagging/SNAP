Cuts like \\"Hold it Down\\", \\"Do You Really Know\\", and \\"Uncut Pure\\" would probably go gold with the right promotion and marketing. These cuts Lyrically are way ahead of the game and the production on these tracks is reminiscent of the classic \\"Golden Era\\" of hip-hop, without being too \\"old school\\". The Lack of many guests provides Kane with the opportunity to explore many concepts ranging from child neglect, alcoholism, his comeback, and his view on the \\"new school\\". The lack of guests such as we have come to expect from Kane in the Past is somewhat of a letdown, it would be nice to see more of todays hot acts on a track or two with the Prince of Darkness.

It may work for the NP-F550, but when I search for chargers for the NP-F950/970 battery, chargers that look like this one come up on many sites. I paid so little for this, it's not worth returning, but right now I'm not certain I can find a charger that is guaranteed to work with the battery I bought.

I tried for a couple of hours, on my own, and following the instructions of sandisk's tech support people, and the feature simply does not work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for the money","review":"This mp3 player was simple and easy to use for someone who's never had one. My gift recepient loved it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality","review":"I bought this mp3 player because it was on sale for a great price. Now I know why it was so cheap. The sound quality was horrible. In order to hear with the headphones, I had to turn the volume to the max. What's worse was when the player was hooked to my car stereo: even when both the player and the stereo were turned up all the way, I still couldn't hear very well. In addition to the poor sound quality, the buttons were not very responsive, as I would have to push them 3 or 4 times before anything would happen. To top it all off, two weeks after my purchase, the player stopped working all together (would power off as soon as it was turned on). So I bought the Sansa Clip Micro Player--much much better all around!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good product for the price","review":"this was a gift for a teen.great sound on sansa's and priced well for 2gb and a good brand. the teen likes it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Serious Flaw in Product parts","review":"I have had this MP3 player for about 4 months.

The company that sells it, TIGERDIRECT, has not responded to my emails so I went directly to SanDisk. SanDisk gave me a promt response and sent me a label to return the product with free shiping. Another bad thing about this player is that it organizes your music in it's own way and has trouble figuring out artists even if you have the artists name on the song."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fulfills My Requirements for Audible / Books on Tape","review":"I purchased this player primarily for listening to books on tape. At the time of my purchase, it was one of the only players that was compatible with audible.com and allowed use of AAA batteries (needed for camping and extended travel). The battery life was disappointing as others have noted. Because I listen to books on tape, I have an accurate measure of battery life -- about 10 hours. Nevertheless, I would still recommend this product for those needing a player with replaceable batteries, as few alternatives exist. A second disappointment was the extremely slow fast forward speed for non-audible.com files. The FM tuner works OK for stronger local stations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply Awful Player","review":"I wish someone had told me about this player before I bought not one, but 3 of them. The controls are awkward, the screen is just terrible - even indoors it's hard to see. Selected menu items look identical to all the others - there is no contrast or color difference at all (well, there is, the background color changes from very light blue to very very light blue). Worst of all, the one I kept for myself only works out of one channel, and it's not even 4 months old. I put on Simon and Garfunkel, and get only Garfunkel.

Why do you think it's more important to show the box size than the product size?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not exactly what I was looking for...","review":"I primarily purchased the product for recording lectures and it did not work well. The Mp3 recorder records the lecture, afterwards, recording is really bad. Sometimes it doesn't record at all or it erases the file or there is an error. In addition, the volume/sound quality is bad. Not loud enough. In the end, you need the software to transfer files, takes forever to figure out what to do. My brothers bought Mp3 player called Matchspeed (red color), good price and it worked great. Best player we ever had, 3 times louder then scan disk and the best thing, no software needed to transfer files. Just drag he items into the folder, thats all to it. And it records great. I hope this advice will help saving everybody's time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as Thin as It Looks","review":"The photos of this product are misleading.

Totally not worth spending what we did on this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works as advertised","review":"I bought this unit to replace a 1gig sansa I had, and am quite pleased with it. Regarding volume, there is a setting in the options to set to higher volume output. I use some SR60 Grado headphones and the unit drives them quite well. I only rip my MP3s at or above 256kps for the best sound quality, and use Windows Media Player to move my mp3s on and off the player. The file system used by the player is intuitive, and works well for me, (I tend put entire albums on, instead of individual songs) and the player groups them by artist or album. There is also a GOlist function. The audio is excellent, and really is a function the ear/headphones that are hooked to it. Lastly, it uses AAA batteries, I use rechargeables. Sounds just as good as any Ipod. And Amazon MP3s are DRM free. Excellent product"},{"rating":"2","title":"Samlex SEC 1223 Power Supply","review":"It's compact and quiet.

So the content itself is pretty advanced, but too advanced for non-native speakers. Certainly, you need to change the way you talk according to the person you are talking to or the situation you are in. That's a fundamental art of conversation. I must admit this book shows us that clearly. However, I'm afraid it's going to be painFUL for non-native speakers if they deal with this first. Of course, again, it is quite useful for theater plays, musicals, and speech contests to get your message across to the audience.Therefore, for beginners it may be literally better to start with Painless English for Speakers of Other Languages. In other words, you shouldn't deal with Painless Speaking as a textbook for English conversation classes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Abraham Lincoln's WORLD","review":"This book is not about Abraham Lincoln alone, but about the world in which he lived.

It ain't life-changing, historically significant, or even all that innovative, but it is catchy as hell, stuffed with soaring hooks and crunchy power chords. It doesn't hurt that the songs are uniformly awesome: \\"2nd Street\\" is pure power-pop bliss, with a ringing guitar riff and unashamedly sentimental lyrics (\\"She's the only girl I want her to be\\"), while \\"Letter From An Old Friend\\" is high speed three-chord sneer. \\"New Blood,\\" \\"Crazy Horse,\\" and the comically furious \\"Funeral\\" are in a similar vein. There are also a few smarter-than-your-average-punk-pop tunes aboard: \\"Buffalo\\" has a great melody and some oddly affecting lyrics, while \\"Landlords\\" makes great use of acoustic guitars.

The scenes at the cottage were lacking and left you wondering what happened. It to me was very poor. You knew what was going to be in the end and you felt like you were at a funeral the entire movie.

Each one is completely different in mood and style, from lighthearted humor to dark twists of fate, from romance to a touch of the supernatural. The author fills each tale with people you'll find yourself wishing that you had known or vey glad that you didn't. The vividly described settings along with fine attention to historical details of events, people, equipment and weapons, pull you inside and make you feel as if you are there.

This book illustrates this beautifully.Though written some 53 years ago, it's not really a dated book. The basic principles discussed and the story could be from today. Indeed many of the ways that government treats those it is entrusted to protect in the book are straight from todays headlines.The characters are very well thought out and realistic.

You will not be disappointed.The problem with the Audio CD version of this thing is that if you turn off your CD player before the disk is over, you have to \\"seek\\" within the CD to find where you were last. There is one track per CD. There is no logical pause between chapters.

Lord of the Ring was three books (4 if you count The Hobbit) but every page meant something, served a purpose, moved the story forward. AS treads water. Was Rand paid by the page? Or by the word? Where ten words could suffice, Rand uses two hundred and fifty. I have just enough interest in these characters to keep me reading the book, but I don't need page-long descriptions of everyone's hair, breeches, chin, face, skirt, expression, cleavage, skin color, sweat, shoes, etc. NO ONE CARES.

Her life was in the end a failure and a dead end which is what the life of anyone who buys into this philosophy ends up being. You will find out for example that the people around you are not interested in knowing the virtue of your selfishness.I have to say though, she does a remarkably good job making us feel ok about our prejudices, if that's what you're looking for.

Seems she decided that communism is pure evil so whatever is the opposite must be pure good.I had to skip the second half John Galt's 59 page speech.

Man is capable of great progress if we are free to produce, keep what we produce and benefit from what we produce. America was built on these principles and it became the greatest nation ever seen on the planet. Please read this book if you care for yourself, the ones you love and freedom. Thank you."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book has had an enormous impact on the world we live in","review":"Atlas Shrugged is by no means a perfect book, but it must be read. Among its greatest errors are the one dimensionality of the characters. They are either good, or bad. There are no shades of gray. It is also filled with redundancy. There is no better example than John Gault's speech. The love story is clumsily handled. The writing is often mundane.The ideas, however, are so important that they would overcome five times that many weaknesses. The book is an unbelievably vivid illustration of the principals that make capitalism the premier system of government that man has ever devised. The threats to that system are illustrated brilliantly by showing how the results of well intentioned actions backfire."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's a scissors, or a hatchet, when you need one?","review":"A few friends agreed to finally take the plunge and tackle \\"Atlas Shrugged\\"--which I've put off since having it thrust on me in college 30 years ago. I tried, I really tried, and I'm proud to say that I made it to about page 800. But, my God, didn't this woman's publisher employ an editor? Let's put aside the shrill rants and endless--and I do mean endless--philosophizing. Let's forgot the \\"characters\\", which are nothing more than silly embodiments of her ideas. Let's try to ignore the Captains of Industry business and the \\"world grinding to a halt\\" nonsense.

While I appreciate the author's enthusiasm for individual ability as well as his desire for said ability to be unfettered by the mediocrity of society, I do not appreciate the fact that he either naively or obstinately make no allowances for the fact that the playing field is not at all level. It would be nice to think that everyone has the same chance, ability, etc and that those who hone and use their ability deserve to reap any and all benefits with no obligations to the rest of society,because anyone could succeed as long as they work hard and think hard. However in order for this to work, the rest of society would need all the same advantages all of the time. So this doesn't work. So what are you to do?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Atlas Shrugged is a book for our time","review":"Atlas Shrugged is one of the best books I've read in a long time. The times Ayn Rand speaks of forebode our times now. Today's government is running big business and forcing them to bow to lesser men, so it was in soviet Russia, from where Ayn Rand fled. This is a fascinating book, well written, on 50 cd's in audio.

Now here we are, smack dab in the middle of exactly what Ayn Rand was trying to warn us about. Published in 1957, it could have turned America around if taken seriously at the time. The dead on accuracy of her dire predictions will astound you. I couldn't believe it when someone in the book gave the \\"You didn't build it\\" speech!

It is far too long and windy, the characters and pseudoscience are unrealistic, and everything is almost comically black 'n' white.There are some good ideas within, but it's probably not worth your time to wade in and find them. Read Rand's earlier fiction for somewhat better stories, or her nonfiction if you really want to get into her head."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written..","review":"I was always curious to read Ayn Rand because I know she has had a powerful influence on many successful people. Now I can't comment on her philosophy because in all fairness I didn't read the entire novel. In fact I gave up on about page 200. I got a sense of what her philosphy is, and I was somewhat drawn to it. Her writing, however, I found to be atrocious. Where the heck was her editor? And here's a handy rule of thumb: anytime you come across characters named Dagny, Francisco and Orren, run, don't walk to the exit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing New, Really","review":"As an anarchist opposed to capitalism (as all true anarchists are), I found Atlas Shrugged to be tedious and half-baked: sure, if the world were made up of nothing but statist liberals and \\"communists\\", there might be some truth to the assumption that either you're an individual out for yourself, or had to be a member of the \\"unwashed masses\\". But the reality is that for over a hundred years before Atlas Shrugged was written, anarchists like Peter Kropotkin, Mikhail Bakunin, Errico Malatesta, Max Stirner and others were affirming that the rights of the individul were paramount, and that even capitalists were oppressing people, not just government. This fact was lost to Rand, who saw a Bolshevik under every bed. Rather than be drawn in to the Ayn rand cult, read a book by Kropotkin, Proudhon, or even Noam Chomsky."},{"rating":"1","title":"As unrealistic and dangerous as Marx","review":"I found this review of Marx:\\"How can anyone actually disagree with what Marx said?

There were certain things that I had questioned at the beginning, and wanted to find out by the end. I am not into politics, so that sort of kept me at a distance with the book.

Unsurprisingly, characters are psychologically flat. Everything is way too simple for the author, the people, the values, the economy.

For those who desire such, it has graphic sex. However, the lessons about Conservative virtues are and continue to be unsurpassed, even after almost 60 years.

Like anything else you take what is good from it. I was never an Objectionist, I just love the individulaistic ideals presented in the story and I loved the heroic characters who did what they felt was right in spite of the world being against them. To me that has always been the theme of the book. But what is amazing is how over the years I have seen the very frightening government policies which were parodies in the book come to life. In a way it has been quite prophetic. Ayn Rand herself was a very flawed character so I would never want to emulate her life. But the idea of individuals standing against a world which wants to destroy the sanctity of freedom of thought and ideas is very attractive in an age of political correctness and government intrusion into private property, businesses and lives."},{"rating":"2","title":"Practical and Interesting..","review":"A nice philosophy.

The underlying philosophy is contrary to Christian values (yet this is oddly very popular with conservative Christians). I honestly had to force myself to finish this. It is a cynical view of life that reflects an extreme \\"me first\\" view of humanity. How that meshes with the words of Christ (compare with the Sermon on the Mount, for example) or any religious tradition or humanistic view is totally unclear to me. Unfortunately, the children of the greatest generation (the baby boomers) have instilled a sense of extreme self-centeredness in our society. The hippies became Regan era yuppies and then morphed into angry and aging tea party members. The self-centered objectivism philosophy meets the needs of this very spoiled generation perfectly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trash,... just trash","review":"This book starts bad and ends worse. It's dull, preachy, and filled with flat charaters, who are either all good or all bad.

Aristotle! the idiot who kept women and men in chains for thousands of years. As if a slave has the opportunity to be selfish!

Second, her \\"philosophy\\" is so mind numbingly shallow, and politically motivated (!) that you have to be the least read person on earth to think it thought provoking. Worst of all, she writes like doo doo. IF you can get through the 1,000 pages, and good luck, you are the all time attention span world champion. Rand probably isn't all that controversial, just insipid and dull. The characters stink! The revelation: The Government is bad! Take care of your own needs! Believe in yourself!

It's best purpose is as a doorstop, or kindling.The plot is childish, the characters are thin, and writing is generally poor.It is apparent, that by this writing, English is Ms. Rand's second language, because she fails, in so many ways to convey her story line convincingly.Why so many people are using this as their political bible, is way beyond my comprehension. This is a book of pure fiction, and people want to base real life on it. This is quite absurd, in that there are few details on how all this should be accomplished in this book, which is on a level of reading and understanding which should be achieved in third grade."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply Awful","review":"Don't waste your time reading any of Rand's shrill garbage.

If you agree with this book then you have a problem. Part of the stupidity of the book is that if you buy into Ayn Rand's relativistic (ironically, she refers to it as Objectivist) philosophy, it is impossible to believe in anything, including Ayn Rand and her trash that glorifies greed. If you don't serve others, then your efforts are wasted because you, in the end, are nothing. Greed is the definition of futility."},{"rating":"1","title":"We all say stupid things","review":"We all say stupid things. It is part of the human condition. No one is immune. Most of us try to avoid saying stupid things. Ayn Rand though has managed to string together twelve hundred pages of silliness. It is a singular achievement. Everyone should read this thing at least once. Don't let the 'sales' figures fool you.

Interestingly, liberalism has been dead since 1980, and our political system is rotten with campaign pay-offs, revolving-door lobbyists, deserted factories, and corporations face down in the public trough...something like James Taggart's Washington!

It speaks to us today about the state of our contemporary world as much as it did when it was written. Rand is not a subtle writer, as anyone who has read any of her non-fiction work can tell you. She has a tendency to lead the reader a bit, but that is one of the effects she sought in writing this and her other fiction works...she wants to share with you what she thinks and doesn't want you to miss her points!Today, the looters are alive and well. Those people who choose not to think for themselves and those who choose not to produce for themselves (while taking from those who do), are those looters.

So, in my old age, I decided to try it again and see if I would have the same reaction. When the book came, I was shocked again, but this time by the length of the book. I'm sure it was the same length before, but then I had no trouble with long books. I just didn't remember. But the size of the print in this edition made me wrap it up and send it right back to Amazon. The print was tiny! (And I am still reading without glasses so it wasn't my eyes.)

There are a great many themes in this old, memorable classic that are very relevant in today's political and economic atmosphere. I was amazed at how a 50 year old novel could hit these themes so perfectly. Rand has a unique historical perspective that she has turned into a fascinating novel that touches on politics, business, free markets, as well as traditional novel themes such as love and competition. This is a must read for any novel buff, and it is a timeless classic that every generation should be required to read.Enjoy!

I also wish Ayn Rand would develop her heroes a bit more thoroughly, as they come off sounding exactly alike (Roark of The Fountainhead included). These are the main flaws I can see. For those critics who have asserted that the plot is unbelievable, the development of the plot and the rationality of the steps taken is a great part about this book. Ayn Rand's heroes are truly inspirational and the essenece of Ms. Rand's philosophy is made crystal clear - reason, purpose, and self-esteem, as man's values.

Suffice it to say that I consider the reading of this book as a defining moment in my life.Why then did I rate this masterpiece as merely two star? Quite simply to deter people from buying the paperback edition - mine fell apart. I am by no means a rereader of books, in fact, the only books I've ever read more than once are Snot Stew (don't ask) and The Wheel of Time series (Robert Jordan).

Three of them to be exact.So if you are considering buying the paperback version, please, reconsider and buy the hardcover. You will not be disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Use your brain","review":"Contrary to what some readers below have claimed, Ayn Rand never suggested that she published her book on her own, or that life consists of individuals producing things entirely of their own capacity. Read her books and this is clear. Every one of her heroes uses resources that other have produced. What Rand DID advocate is that individuals should have the right to exchange goods and services as they choose, and that no one should be forced or obligated to sacrifice his products to anyone else. That's what free market capitalism is.

After I finished it, I tried reading something else, but nothing seemed good any more. It then dawned on me that I would have to read the only book ever published that's better than the Fountainhead, Atlas Shrugged.

The \\"philosophical musings\\" are essentially a direct refutation of the philosophy of Jesus Christ. Instead of \\"do unto others as you would have them do unto you,\\" Rand's essential philosophy is \\"whatever you want to do is right\\" (this is also called \\"egoism\\" or \\"ethical egoism\\").Worth a read (if you have the stomach for it) if you want to find out what our society's moral refuse use as justification for their actions, otherwise I'd stay as far away as possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outrageous pricing","review":"Never should anyone pay a 50% penalty for reading on a digital device.

In Ayn Rands fictional narrative there are only hard working industrialists and lazy parasites who attempt to cripple the noble efforts of the working capitalists. It's a libertarians wet dream. A magical place where all of their deluded pet theories actually work. In the universe Rand has created there are no people dying of cancer from having ingested water polluted with industrial waste such as cadmium and mercury. There are no thalidomide babies or stupid, greedy investors or bankers causing market crashes. Oh and greedy energy companies who ignore safety recommendations from consultants and cause enormous oil spills? Nowhere to be found in Rands world.

I expected an incredile conclusion full of action and adventure, maybe a train-robbing scene with pistol shooting and car jumping or a huge civil war in the valley among all the creators, but all I found were shallow characters spouting off a bunch of dull endless monologues, the majority of which seemed to imply that being a greedy selfish jerk ( sorry, a \\"self-actualized person\\" ) is the most moral path a person can take. In the end the \\"good guys\\" willingly let millions of innocent people suffer and starve to death for the sake of their muddled contradictory \\"principles\\".

I have a rule of not criticizing what I have not read but I was tempted with this treatise, all 1200 miserable pages of it. At times the redundant comic book style became all too weary. At first it had the welcome of an adventure but quickly dissolved into a propaganda piece, ad nauseum. The overiding feeling while reading was depression. I actually had to stop for two weeks because it bummed me out with its simplistic disjunct logic. But, not wanting to be a looter I plodded on hoping it would reach a point, a reason it is presented as a defense of capitalism. The philosophical guts finally come at about pages 900-1000 and presents a \\"believe our greatness or you are death\\" theme.

I won't go into great detail because I'm sure others have, but this book is totally unbelievable and the characters don't engender any sympathy. I could care less what happened to them. They never came alive to me.As a philosophy, objectivism as expressed in this book seems to be little more than complete selfishness. It's alright to do anything to anyone to achieve what you want. It's ironic to me that so many Christians have adopted Ayn Rand as their hero when her philosophy so closely resembles Satanism.If you are in the market for a novel there are many good ones out there.

The ideas and questions I found myself pondering after putting it down have never really left my mind. To me this is a book of ideas that really gets your brain working.

The central point is what would happen to the world if the thinkers, inventors and business men and women went on strike, simply refused to keep doing their work. Everything would be fine, right? The world survives on the back of the common man, after all...doesn't it? The reader is also introduced to Rand's philosophy as her characters ponder the moral ambiguity in the world that surrounds them.

Very convincing to the naive--I could even feel the persuasion tugging at my mind. However, I feel the characters are too cold. Big business is glorified unrealistically and altruism is spit upon. The virtue of altruism is certainly exaggerated but it shouldn't be spit upon. If someone gives a starving child on the street a piece of bread, should this person be chastised. yet this is altruism.

I felt the pain and frustration with the characters and hailed Ayn Rand for her courage and insight most of the way through. But then all at once she fell far from the mark in my estimation - totally one sided - out of balance with unreasonable conclusions. I found her lack of touch with the reality of human psychology and intimate relationships almost maddening. And as for that 50 page speech - so boring and further more incomprehensible that anyone would sit still to listen to that endless, repetitive summation of \\"true value\\" etc. let alone an uneducated general public.

This story has a futuristic setting like non seen in Orwell's \\"1984\\". The story focuses on Dagney Taggart, owner & operator of an expanding transcontinental railroad organization who's faced with the United States's economic deterioration.The underlying idea to the story is Rand's philosophy of Objectivism. She illustrates, through Taggart, Galt, etc., how one's self-interests are what make up the soul of the individual. Furthermore, she expresses to the readers how individuals are responsible for thier actions, and how we must fight to keep true to our ideologies, even if it means letting others suffer for thier wrong-doings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kindle version","review":"This is a great book that I would love to have on my kindle but the price is just to high.

I do believe in (small \\"L\\") libertarian ideals, and I believe that socialism is fatally flawed. I think she over-simplifies things, and ignores many facets of political realism, but I don't think she's that far off the mark overall. This is to be, however, a literary review:This is a truly awful book. I mean it is horrid prose. The characters, the dialog, the ridiculous plot, interaction and simple-minded storytelling in this book are just dreadful to read. It's like a bad, bad romance novella, except that it is an excruciating 1200 pages of close-set, small type with very little margin. It is a brick!Ayn Rand's philosophy could be well covered in a few pages (technology is good, personal achievement is good, profit is good, etc.), and I would challenge any of these other reviewers to say that they'd still love this book simply as a piece of writing, and not as a manifesto reflecting their own beliefs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rip off","review":"The beauty of the Internet, electronic books and all of the efficiency's gained by not printing should be reflected in price, but alas the greedy Penguin publishers think that they will charge more and make up for the poor sales they have recently.

Junk, illiterate nonsense and generally disregarded trash and rather than develop new authors they try and make more money from an old classic.

Rand DID write some very helpful things, but also some nonsense. There is a lot of evidence around that she was not a very pleasant person to be around unless you treated her like a omniscient prophet. The problem is that her legacy has been transformed into a dogma by some people who refuse to see her dark sides. I strongly urge you to read Jeff Walker's The Ayn Rand Cult. It's not a great book, but I believe his research is sound. He has read most of the literature about Rand, as well as interviewing Objectivists and ex-Objectivist that knew Rand. Then ask yourself this question: Which one is most truthful, Jeff Walker's book or the hagiography Ayn Rand: A Sense of Life? I guess reason requires you to read both before you make up your mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Masterpiece\\"?","review":"I couldn't get through much of this book. Her contempt for anyone not wealthy and privileged was so obvious, it made me physically ill to read it. I threw it in the trash after the first chapter. No way was it going in my bookshelf. Ayn Rand is what fundamentally selfish people read to make themselves feel better about being themselves. I'm also laughing here at people being mad at the Kindle price for the book. OMG seriously? Her whole philosophy was about selfishness and no government beyond police and military (nevermind who was going to make the laws that the police and military enforced....tosh). BUT YOU CAN PROBABLY GET THIS BOOK FROM YOUR LOCAL LIBRARY FOR FREE. However, if Ayn Rand had her way, we wouldn't HAVE any public libraries, and there wouldn't BE any public education, so most of you probably wouldn't know how to read anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shockingly... disturbing.","review":"A striking irony concerning Ayn Rand's work is that it generally appeals more to the mindless and ignorant, rather than the free-thinkers she claims to champion. I suppose one reason for this is that her philosophy leaves no room for dissent or original thought - you either take it all or nothing. Even Rand herself has trouble overcoming her lack of ideas as she struggles (rather unsuccessfully) to fill out an original monologue for each of her heroes through the course of the books 1000 pages.As for those willing to read Rand objectively, the most I can say for her is that she makes sense -- sometimes. Rand starts off simple enough (\\"A\\" is \\"A\\"), but soon thereafter cooks up such a furious mess of twisted logic that you'll either write it off immediately or become hooked. Don't worry though- like any fine narcotic, Rand's effect will wear off once you realize you've become miserable and peerless. Just don't overdose."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 Rand = 1 nano-Hugo","review":"Was there ever a more vile and monstrous piece of literary excrement foisted upon the world? I don't know of one.

During lunches together, Atlas Shrugged frequently if not always comes up and is always held with esteem as a very influential book.In addition, I have also give Atlas Shrugged away as an accessory gift at many weddings to some of my highly successful people or those that want to be and they always come back and tell me how much this book has changed their lives.Great book.

If Ayn Rand were still alive I would send her some punctuaion marks. The sentences are so interminably long that I thought she was trying to conserve periods.

To be honest there were some things in the story that surprised me. I thought that the story would have been a little different.

It is amazing that this book was written so long ago and has insights to what is happening today in America."},{"rating":"2","title":"My boyfriend's nuts about it!","review":"Atlas Shrugged, the second part of a 2 part series, follows The Fountainhead in an exploration of corporate America in the stranglehold of government-sanctioned creation and regulations that stifle the creative spirit. The hiding of the greatest minds in this book show that industry cannot be successful unless it is given free reign to create and bloom. A good read for anyone who's willing to think higher than a 5th-grade level, and should be required reading for High School levels!"},{"rating":"2","title":"More than just a long book","review":"Like \\"War and Peace\\", or \\"Rise and Fall of the Roman Empire\\"; this is one of those really long books that all \\"big-time readers\\" should tackle at least once in their lifetimes.While there are some overly long-winded and boring parts - most notably Galt's speech near the end of the book - the book manages to keep ones interest, and there are some decently exciting moments... and I got a laugh out of Francisco's hurried response to the Guard's question; \\"What's your business?\\" - \\"Copper Mining!\\".If you are really left-leaning, you will probably find this book insulting, as the government and anti-business types are made to look like dopes, weasels, and/or out-right thieves.In any event, the basic premise of the book (of looters, moochers, and beggars taking advantage of the producers) has merit, and there were many instances when I was made to think about real-life analogies.You know, I'm willing to bet that Ronald Reagan read and enjoyed this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Was she psychic?

I enjoy reading books that are 1000+ pages which contain a great story but Ayn Rand seemed to be over verbose just for the sake of taking up more space. Atlas Shrugged could have been written in under half the number of pages and still could have been equally enjoyable. My other wish was that Ayn Rand would have used a Thesaurus to find another word for shrugged. Did anyone notice the number of times Ayn Rand used the word \\"Shrugged\\"??? Too many."},{"rating":"2","title":"Atlas Shrugged - A Prophecy?","review":"This is an outstanding work and should be required reading in all high schools and colleges in economics or government courses. The stark delineation between the values of the main camps of characters made it easy to relate to people one would encounter in daily life. It absolutely affirms that exceptionalism is a virtue, not something for which to apologize. Reading through this novel, it was unnerving to see the similarities between the events in the book and the events that are taking place today in the U.S. and the world at large. Several times I put the book down and thought that this could be written about the economy and the socialist path on which the Obama administration has this country. It seems at times that Ayn Rand was writing a prophecy that is unfortunately coming all too true."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book review","review":"Print too small for my old eyes and book is well worn.

Should picture the version of the book being sent to the customer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely Worth One's Time","review":"The huge gap between star ratings (either one star or none, hardly anything in between)of the book Atlas Shrugged, is an excellent indication that one either hates this book or loves it. Independent of what your end-reaction may be, I believe it will be worth your time if you ever ponder about the past, the present and the future of the human mind and of the human race in general. It _does_ make you think and think hard which is an accomplishment all by itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Frightening Foreshadowing...","review":"Does the recent Microsoft ruling seem familiar? It is exactly what Ayn Rand predicted would happen. Even 60 years ago, she could identify the American hatred of wealth and success, the hatred of anyone working or living for his own interests. So Microsoft creates a product that consumers want. For that, it is punished. What the Justice Department is essentially saying to the country is, \\"You can create a product and sell it, but don't dare be too successful at it.\\" So much for free market capitalism. My only hope is that Bill Gates has read Atlas Shrugged and will close up shop, depriving the world of all Microsoft products. How dare the U.S. government attempt to dictate to him how he must sell his products. Is this the United States or communist USSR?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Way Too Verbose for the Casual Reader","review":"Oh dear, where do I start? It's a shame Rand couldn't have written this book with about one third the words. Whether we agree or disagree with Rand's philosophy, this book is for the patient few. For the most part, the story flows slower than cold molasses; patience and intellect are prerequisite to enjoyment of this tidal tome.Can I recommend it? Yes and no. If you are a thinker, willing to invest the dozens of hours of intense thought necessary to understand Rand's rather unique, very interesting (and highly flawed, IMO) philosophical and societal messages (spread over nearly 1200 pages), then this book is for you.If, on the other hand, you are looking for a fast-paced action thriller, you will not find it here.In hindsight, reading this book was very uncomfortable. Only after I fully understood what it represented as a whole, was I able to enjoy it. I read it twice.To sum it up in one line: Too many words."},{"rating":"1","title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Don't buy a book by its hype. The pushing seems to be by conservatives who think it tells a story they would like to believe is really the way people act and think. It's hogwash. This novel has an amateurish plot, little character development. Bulk is not quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous Price for Ridiculous Philosophy","review":"What I've said in my title pretty much says it all. First, the price......why should an ebook be more expensive than a paperback? Does Penguin want to punish us who have ereaders? Don't understand why they want to turn off any readers. I certainly won't buy it and I'll think twice about buying any other Penguin books.As for Rand's philosophy....for those who are \\"ME, ME, ME!!!\\" people it will just confirm their self-centered, selfishness. For the innocent who can't think beyond the words, it probably will be accepted without being questioned....though questions are what are most needed when assessing a philosophy.Me, I read it when it was first published and the years since have only confirmed that it is a philosophy for those who care only for themselves and who are devoid of any sense of reality. (In fact, it might have been this kind of philosophy that caused Penguin to charge such a ridiculous price.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"If human nature didn't exist...","review":"For the idealistic narcissist. A story about a group of greedy narcissists that think they are indispensable. In a fictional world where capitalists actually care about making the best product--instead of the best profit, running away is supposed to make everyone realize those greedy capitalists were not so bad after all. Exposes the flaws in a certain strain of modern-day economic conservative mind-set.A bit of a strain to read, but not bad fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grow up","review":"Consulting Ayn Rand on economics is like consulting Edgar Rice Burroughs on astronomy. At a certain point one must grow up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly a Novel of Ideas ...","review":"I counted two of them. Even a John Grisham novel has at least four ideas.I greatly enjoyed Ayn whacking me on the head with the same two notions every page for over a thousand pages. Whack! Whack! Do you got it yet? You sure? Whack! I want to make sure you got it. Whack!Thanks, Ayn.Prerequisites for reading this book are either a helmet or a naturally thick skull.If you have any respect for the art of writing or any background in philosophy, don't waste your time. If you've read the reviews here, you've read the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't finish it","review":"I read over 200 pages (of 1000+) waiting to get interested and never did. I got to what I suppose is a minor climax in the narrative, the launching of the John Galt Line, and realized that I could not care less about any of the characters. So rather than waste more time reading this bore, I took it back to the library. I left my page mark in, just like one of the people who had it before me. (She left hers somewhere in the 100s.)If you like a world where all the heroes look like (and are just as deep as) the stoic figures in 1930s German propaganda posters, then Atlas Shrugged is your book. Otherwise don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clever propaganda, terribly dated and shallow","review":"What a waste of time this book was. 1100 pages to convey a message that is \\"do what's best for yourself, and to hell with everyone else.\\" Rand's foolish excuse for philosophy is exceeded only by the clumsiness of her prose, which features such winning phrases as \\"When asked what he would want to do he answered at once, 'Whatever is right.'\\"This book is a product of 50s McCarthyism and anti-Communist fervor, and uses a remarkably dull method of repeatedly constructing straw men to have them torn down by Rand's superman.This is indulgent candy for the mind, and utterly lacking in both literary and intellectual merit."},{"rating":"2","title":"What would John Galt do?","review":"I love this book. There are questions about whether God is necessary for ethics, and this book is pretty straightforward about why religion and God aren't. I've actually been quite impressed with the motivation this book has given me to think right and do the right thing. It's about taking responsibility for your actions. Before you get too wrapped up into the size of this book, it is actually 3 books in one. You can take breaks between books if you get exhausted. Rand's Utopia suffers from what every Utopia suffers from...it's her utopia and no one elses. This makes it somewhat boring as it is a place where everyone and everything seems flawless. The ratio of women to men in Rand's utopia is much to small to be mine. This book probably didn't need to be as long as it was, but it has inspired me to take action and use my head in each decision I make."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Great Books","review":"This is one of the books that affected my thinking. It's a powerful dramatic illustration of how we are coerced to march in lockstep with the dominant culture, and thus forfeit our individuality and ultimately our freedom and humanity. It's interesting how Ayn Rand has become for many people a political symbol of all they love or hate. I would caution the reader to avoid this trap. This book is not a blueprint for utopia. It's a work of fiction, and, like all fiction, it mirrors certain aspects of our reality without being completely realistic. I value this book because it illuminated some of the social snares and pitfalls we face, forces that I had been dimly aware of but could not previously bring into focus. Because it meant so much to me, and because it has things to say that no one else had the courage and passion and skill to articulate, I'll call this one of the Great Books. It is not without flaws, but it is important and it is unique."},{"rating":"1","title":"A dissapointment","review":"Atlas Shrugged seems to be an apology by Ayn Rand for writing a devastating account of an individualist in \\"The Fountain Head\\".

I think this book is best read while you are in college and are scratching the surface of reality"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mind numbing","review":"I applaud those of you who hated this book, but still managed to get through it. I was able to pull off that feat with the awful \\"Battleship Earth,\\" but could not manage it with \\"Atlas Shrugged.\\" This time the tedium was too thick and cloistering, the ranting narrative overwhelming in its scope. Consequently, I can't speak intelligently about how truly bad this book is, but again, I'm proud of those who trudged through. I leave it to you to criticize it appropriately."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many pages","review":"This book is a parable. It would be pretty good if it were fifteen pages long, but instead it's about 1,200 pages long. The characters are two-dimensional, the plot is incredible, the whole thing is...ridiculous. Fine for a parable. But this thing is 1,200 pages long. Save your strength. Read Hayek instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute Excrement","review":"This book is not only morally reprehensible, worse, it is bad fiction. Rand was a maniac and has almost no understanding of philosophy. In fact, she gets it almost uniformly backwards.

I started with Anthem, then read Fountainhead, and just finished Atlas Shrugged. Fountainhead may be one of the best books I have ever read. While I loved Atlas Shrugged, half of me finished it just to finish it. I love reading Rand, however, as any Rand fan will (or at least should) admit, she can go off on rants and become extremely long winded. Galt's 60-70 page speech is a prime example. I found myself saying out loud, \\"I get it, A is A.\\"Don't get me wrong, I actually loved reading this book for the most part which is why I gave it 4 stars, however, if you are wanting to give Rand a try, I would suggest cutting your teeth on the Fountainhead instead. Its a better story line and I found myself getting involved with the characters more during the read. Not to mention its about 500 pages shorter."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite book","review":"As many people have written this book changed my life. I recommend it to friends often.

When they choose to run rather than serve, this slowly undoes the country, city by city, town by town, person by person, until there is nothing left of America but chaos, starvation, and murder. It sent chills up my spine because this kind of thing CAN happen. I enjoyed the rich imagery she used--it was like reading a very, very good movie script.If you ever detested welfare mommies and people who think they deserve your money JUST because you have more of it, then you'll find a sympathetic voice in Ayn Rand's \\"Atlas.\\" I took off one star only because the book is very extreme and often unrealistic in it's views.

I will admit that there were times when I really wanted to keep reading because I was waiting for something to happen. Eventually something did, then it got boring again. Ayn Rand has writing skills I could only wish to have, although it doesn't save the content.

Try a real \\"novel of ideas\\" or two. Lean to think critically. Don't waste time reading or debating this turgid non-novel illustrating a non-philosophy.It's odd there's such enthusiasm and rancor in the reviews below. This work and its associated \\"philosophy\\" falls of its own weight. Its main appeal is to teenagers, either just before they enter college or in their freshman year. And that's great, because it can lead to some of them taking a real interest in philosophy and literature.Rand's philosophy has not had any meaningful effect on society, philosophy, or literature. Ranting about it is a waste of time.

Amazing that Ayn could have foreseen the events were going through today back in the 1950's. Her analysis of the common statement that \\"Money is the root of all evil\\" is amazing.

It is full of youthful angst and energy, the same self-centeredness of adolescence and the profound ignorance of those who haven't travelled beyond their own safety zones, much less began university-level studies of politics, psychology and economics. Every high school student should read it - sophmore year! - so that he or she can more deeply appreciate the benefits of knowing something of the real world conveyed by higher education and how ideologues like Rand use ignorance to warp perceptions and sooth the guilt and greed of the Taggarts and Galts of the world while fluffing their own nests.

Just finished listening to the Highbridge edition on cassette.I think 14 was about the right age to read the book. My capsule review now is as follows:An empty shell of a half-baked philosophy, borne along by a river of the worst sort of romance-novel prose and story structure.The story was well-read by the narrator and entertaining enough on a long car trip. There are certainly better-fleshed-out versions of the philosophy espoused here, and the love story aspect is mushy and starry-eyed enough to make any post-teenager cringe.

Granted it is a philosophical novel, it still is a novel, and the characters should have been made more believable. Too much repetition as well.

The writing is absolutely horrible. The characters have no depth. Ayn Rand could have saved herself a lot of time by cutting half the speeches, which are endlessly redundant.

It is too long and too repetitive to be enjoyable by the end, which I found to be very predictable.

To answer Spencer's complaint below about Objectivism being \\"whack\\", because it promotes people from being uncaring, I have to say that is false. The basic premise of Objectivism is that you are your highest value, you care about yourself foremost. You care for and love other people when they add to your life, (i.e. you buy your kids presents for Christmas because it makes YOU happy to see them happy, you are doing it for yourself). That may or may not clear up that issue, I am far from a good writer. After reading this book I reccommend reading other Objectivist works such as The Selfish Manifesto, or one of Peikoff's many books explaining basic facets of the philosophy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must Read! GIVE YOURSELF THE CHANCE TO MAKE UP YOUR OWN MIND","review":"It only goes to show that the reason this book has to exist is due to those whose philosophy leads them to leave such negative reviews. This is the story of the welfare state accelerated to the point of exhaustion, among other things. I don't think it is meant to be touting an extreme, just showing how one extreme will not solve all of mankind's problems, that we need to find a balance and common ground. It is superbly written and you don't have to be a political intellectual of any faith to enjoy it. Even if you don't agree, it is still a fantastic story. At least see the movie out in April.

There's something going on more than coincidence: it's the fact that Ayn Rand's work is the same kind of junk philosophy that is found in Zen & The Art of Motorcycle Maintenance and the Celestine Prophecy--all are muddle-headed attempts that really only should appeal to young men and women between the ages of 17-19.

So that may be one reason why I found this book was so intellectually tepid. Second, I returned this book halfway through because it was so silly. While I am an Independent who favors economic liberalism, I found Rand's plot and arguments sooo corny and contrived. It was like those horrible late-night info-mercials were the players act so over-the-top excited about a product. Rand did not develop counter-agruments to her thesis to the degree expected in a serious philosophical work. Thus it lacked any ability to stimulate or convince me, due to its mind-numbing use of straw man fallacy and abysmal employment of dialectic.I must say in defense of the book that it's most interesting part, contrary to what others have said, was John Galt's oratory."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book","review":"This is a book, if your not really all that interested in the subject then I suggest you carry on, if you need it for class then buy it..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed in Atlas Shrugged paperback!","review":"I got great service in getting my copy of Atlas Shrugged, but I was very disappointed in the size of the book and the font size in the book.

This book is a perfect of example of every literary mistake conceivable. Although there are numerous characters in the book, there are truly only two: GOOD GUY and BAD GUY. Rand just shuffles the names around and gives them all the same party lines. The characters (both of them) are cardboard cliches with nothing compelling to recommend them. The philosophy is simple-minded and naive beyond belief. The 'real' men are hijacked directly out of a romance novel, and the requisite woman character is hopelessly dependent upon them in spite of her supposed independence and intelligence. If you like to read books by authors who present a story and let you form your own judgements of her characters, look elsewhere. Atlas Shrugged is an excellent door stop. I gave it one star because the system won't allow me to give it zero stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written, overly long, political screed","review":"Please note: I am writing this purely from a literary standpoint, this is not a commentary on objectivism.I found \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" to be one of the most boring, poorly written books I have ever read. Ms. Rand attempts to make up in volume what she lacks in talent, and that makes for a series of very tedious evenings for the casual reader.The characters are flat and hackneyed, the plot is tedious, and the long pages of political diatribe, while sure to please the acolytes of the author, do nothing to move the story along.I was disappointed, for I truly enjoyed \\"The Fountainhead\\" - a story that, if you skip over the speeches, is a rather enjoyable romance novel about architects.

I picked it up because my brother suggested it, and he usually reads some interesting books. After the first 250 pages, I wasn't exactly excited about what I had read, but I figured, given the size of the book, that I was only through the introduction. I read the next 250 pages and still the book sucked, but along the same rationale I finished it, my brother had to have seen something. The main problem is that the book continously repeats itself, conversations are the same, plot twists are the same, and it is all flawed capitalist extremism. At the end, the protagonists take off their everday clothes to reveal the tight spandex, capes, and a letter C in the middle chest to save the day.

For after all doesn't events like the holocaust happen when people are as selfish and hateful as Rand wants us to be? For Rand's philosophy to work man would have to become a heartless, cold uncaring being and from the number of positive reviews for this book we are just about there. Those that agree with Rand should take some time to reflect on what the world would be like with out compassion for those less fortunate. This belief that those unfortunate are only unfortunate because of their own shortcomings is a conclusion derived from false premesis and as primitive as believing in curses. For those who want to live with sefishness being your greatest attribute, just get a flat tire on a lonely road one night and see how fast you convert.

I had reached about three quarters of the way through when it dawned on me that this was just a filler section in the story, and an unnecessary one at that.

In the 21 years since my first reading, I've read it cover to cover 3 times more and keep referring to it for quotes.Few books have been able to define so clearly what's right and what's wrong (of course, from the authors perspective)and it constantly challenges the reader to agree - or not.

The story is fascinating, the world is believable (Rand's portrayal might even be called prophetic), and the characters are interesting and well-developed. The only down side to the book is that it runs a bit long. If the book were published today, it would probably be broken into a trilogy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A dedication to the glory, goodness, and potential of man.","review":"Atlas Shrugged is the only novel representative of a complete and clear philosophy of life. To summarize the novel in two words: brilliant and inspiring. Brilliant in that it demonstrates Rand's complete grasp of the proper role of politics, economics, psychology, sexuality, and morality. Inspiring because it's protagonists embody the saying, \\"Our accomplishments are not the result of priveledge or of the favor of a higher being, but because of our adherence to objective principles, our determination to improve by hard work and our love of man.\\" This book champions the ability of the mind, and the morality of Capitalism. In doing this, and doing it expertly, Rand demonstrates that we are responsible in bringing out the best within us."},{"rating":"1","title":"tired social darwinism","review":"This stuff is not total BS, but I would be hard pressed to give any novel so aestetically displeasing as this anything more than a 7, even with some great passages.

A slow plot would be OK, if the characters were capable of some Joycean epiphany, but epiphany is made impossible by the philosophy"},{"rating":"2","title":"This Book Shouldn't Be a Great Book, But It Is","review":"This book violates every canon of literary excellence. It's simplistic. It's overly long. It's preachy. The characters give long speeches explaining the book's action and theme. Not one character has any great complexity (although some are more complex than others). And its philosophy is very extreme, as extreme and as unrealizable as Marxism (to use an example from the opposite end of the ideological spectrum).Yet you can't stop reading this book. You can't forget it. And at important moments in your life, you keep flashing back to it, and remembering its message of hope, triumph, and self-reliance.Every human being should read this book. May it endure into the next century!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A laugh riot","review":"Here's the idea: There is only one correct way for people to relate to the world around them, and that's through reason. There's only one correct way for people to relate to other people, and that's through reason. Those who understand this are superior to everyone else in every human endeavor, including making hamburgers. The rest are just annoying obstacles, also-rans. The joke is that Rand explains all of this in the context of an incredibly bad science fiction novel, thus placing herself squarely in the camp of the also-rans by her own definition. Whatever the merits of the philosophy, having the main character explain them in a 60-page speech is just a wretched plot device. And the philosophy ultimately reduces to a tautology, although it takes an awful long time to do so."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Ayn Rand recycled cult of selfishness","review":"Those who read this book need to follow up with \\"The Ayn Rand Cult\\" by Jeff Walker. Ayn Rand is a typical reactionary who radically overreacted to Russian Communist oppression. Young Russians who have been influenced by Rand and other \\"Objectivists\\" are like Super Capitalists on Steroids. What they fail to learn is the fact that ultra-capitalism (capitalist purism) eventually leads to a Plutocracy where the richest of the rich have the most power. Those who believe in God and come from a Judaeo Christian faith need to seriously consider where Rand is coming from and the cult following that is now being recycled in the 21st century (a modern cult of selfishness) and having a deleterious affect on Democracy and balance in the United States of America. The greatest teacher is one that Rand completely ignores.

It's overlong, bloated and filled with incomprehensible dialogue that really takes me out of the world the author's trying to create.

It is a great work nonetheless. Ayn Rand used her tremendous writing skills to forcefully express her (somewhat extreme) social views in the form of a novel - perhaps the most effective way to touch the minds of a lot of people.Atlas Shrugged has a great plot, the characters are vivid and engaging.

It's an excellent book, one that will probably leave you mor einterested in Rand's other stuff too. A lot of the other reviews mention corporations and their \\"inherent evil,\\" and it is as if the individual working in the corporation does not exist. This book shows that the individual does exist, and is the primary concern. We don't blame white america for John Gacy, why blame corporate america for kenneth lay?

More precisely, she believed in two of them: the 'benevolent universe' ('existence', the 'facts of reality') and the human being (including and especially herself).In her attempted rejection of G-d she merely parcelled out the Divine attributes between these two 'higher powers' (for example, 'existence' is eternal, and 'man' is self-creating). I object to the foundations of her 'philosophy' not because she failed to believe in any 'higher power' but because she believed in the wrong one(s).Miss Taggart's own Member Page includes the following remark: 'My whole life is a contradiction'.

This book tries to justify selfishness, greed and megalomania. You can't both believe in the selfishness this book pushes AND be a Christian. The two do not mesh. I understand that Paul Ryan requires those who work for him to read this book. I guess that explains some things about him.

I was left wondering what to do with those people in society who cannot provide for themselves (invalids, elderly, special needs, etc.) I don't think that the author dealt with that, except that I got the feeling those folks would be on their own.Also, not all giants of industry got there because they were the smartest and hardest working - some go there for very different reasons.That said, I'm reviewing the book, not the author's philosophy.

I thoroughly enjoyed experiencing the genius of the author which was apparent with the turning of each page, and absorbing her thought-provoking ideas in subjects ranging from sex to capitalism. Whilst the plot was complex and the themes ran deep, Ayn Rand is definitely a story-teller in the true sense of the word, as I was kept spellbound right to the end of the 1000+ pages. Atlas Shrugged is essential reading for anyone who loves genuinely unique stories that are superbly plotted and is deeply serious about philosophical questions relating to human life, morals and society."},{"rating":"2","title":"Applicable to today","review":"My father recommended this book long ago.

This is thin propaganda.","review":"Atlas shrugged and I yawned. I'm Bland aka Ayn Rand was no artist. Her characters were one-dimensional caricatures that took turns reciting her beliefs. I've seen better development in Saturday morning cartoons. The outright *simplicity* is what makes this book so boring. And what makes it condescending is the fact that Bland/Rand congratulates herself for stating the obvious. Bland/Rand was not a philosopher. She was simply a lady out to make an easy buck. She was not a novelist either. In fact, her name was actually laughed out of a university literature class I once took. This is a wonderful book if you're just learning how to read.

I, personally, would much rather be thinking about my family, my friends, and how I had enjoyed my life thusfar.

However, I did find her philosophical stance and characters a bit too black and white, you would hang yourself with guilt for slopping together a peanut butter and jelly sandwich or feel like a rotter for taking the day off work without being productive if you followed the philosophy to its core.

I realize now that there are people who think, act, feel, & reason the same way I do. Ayn Rand and her Objectivism philosophy have helped me embrace my ambition, achievement-oriented personality, and desire to always do my best. She's helped me lose my guilt of finding deep satisfaction in pursuing my own self-interest, my own wealth, and my own empire in business. She made me see that my self-interested actions create productive value in communities, create jobs, & create wealth. Ayn Rand celebrates those who take full advantage of the democratic, capitalistic, free society Americans are fortunate to live in while exposing those that take it for granted.

It's huge, and it scared me just by its size. But, with all that's happening in the world lately, I felt compelled to read it. That took me a few months, but it was worth the effort. The similarities with what's happening in the economy today are just plain uncanny. But I suppose human nature never really changes. That's what makes this book written about the early 20th century very relevant for us in the early 21st century.

She has a kind of denatured creativity and the capacity to get people thinking about certain ideas, which is not easy to do, so I give her book 2 stars (instead of just one)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well written with a dreadful underlying philosophy","review":"I would reccommend this book to anyone who wishes to understand why people believe in Capitalism. It is unpersuasive, mainly due to the fact that it is fiction, and therefore Rand can have the economy of her world act on her every whim. She also fails to present decent arguments of the other side of the \\"utopian economy\\" question, and therefore Rand falls into the Straw Man logical fallacy.The plot of Atlas Shrugged is very good, and it keeps the readers attention.

It's an entertaining epic of a nation in crisis, almost as good as \\"War and Peace\\". Before 2006, I would have found the politicians' characters idiotic beyond belief, but they talk and act exactly like the people running America today, and it feels great to see them humiliated and destroyed.Although primary and secondary characters do have sex, none of them ever have children. Unlike \\"The Children of Men\\", no one in the novel seems to notice this or think it a problem. All socialist societies ultimately contracept themselves into extinction, but the Strikers must aspire to something better.

Reading and understanding the values presented will change your world outlook.Amazing to me is that the situations encountered in the story, are happening today. it would seem that our present administration and the opposition party seem to be taking us down the path that the government took in Atlas Shrugged.There is a reason that this book has been read by more people than any other work of literature that is based on rational thought.J."},{"rating":"1","title":"So disappointing","review":"I think that an edited version would be preferable.

It's almost $5 MORE than the library binding and almost TWICE the cost of paperback! In fact, the Kindle version is now the most expensive way to read this book! Something is wrong with that! I've seen this several times recently, and it will kill the e-book market. The main advantage of the e-book has been that it's been a great deal for everyone. Publishers expand their market with very little additional expense, and readers get the book for (often) about half-price. Now that the Kindle has become popular, however, several publishers are trying to charge MORE for the privilege of reading their book on an e-book format. I love my Kindle, but I will not pay more for a Kindle version than a hard-copy.

So I read it with an open mind, without expectations or preconceptions.Half the book later, I was forced to put it down in disgust. The characters are shallow, the plot is shallow, and the so-called philosophy is shallow. The heros and heroines of the novel - icons of her philosophy - are given godlike physical and intellectual attributes, while the chosen strawmen are bumbling, incompetent and evil.As a simple piece of fiction, this might have been semi-readable. But the consistent attempts to paint this as a profound philosophical work (complete with advertisements for her Objectivist school of philosophy lodged between the pages) make it completely repulsive.The true condition of life is much more nuanced than can be captured by her one-dimensional characters or one-dimensional philosophy; for understanding, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stalemate","review":"If you don't vote republican, you probably won't agree with Ayn Rand's philosophy. And if you don't agree with her philosophy, chances are you'll find this story unnecessarily long-winded and boring. That, at least, is my personal impression of this particular work.This story is a collection of plots and sub-plots, which all drive home the same point: pure capitalism is the way to go, and any attempt at governmental interference will stifle growth and hurt society as a whole. I'm afraid my attention and interest waned after experiencing blunt trauma to my head from this mantra for the hundredth and seventeenth time - particularly since I do not agree with it and believe there's ample evidence to the contrary.This is probably one of those literary works you either love or hate. I'm afraid I find myself on the latter end of the scale."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck!","review":"Rand must dwell in a special kind of a world -- one that discounts 99.9% of its inhabitants contribution to a functioning society.

I've read almost all of these reviews--the ones that proclaim it a new Truth and Light, and the ones that say it's inspired by Satan himself--and my primary issue is that the prose is tortured and unimaginative.By the middle of the book, I was so tired of people saying things \\"coldly\\" or \\"mockingly\\" I was ready to throw the book across the room. Yes, yes, yes, and Jim Taggarts lines are always \\"screamed\\" or \\"whined.\\" We got the picture by page 40, Ms. Rand.She needed a very good editor, and she undermined her own philosophy by claiming to value only the best of everything and then submitting a work of \\"art\\" that is in every way artistically inferior.Too bad.Incidentally, I adored \\"South Park's\\" recent take on this book.

Although the book was written following FDR's administration and its impact on our country, it is as timely today as it was then. Many reviews that I have read focus on the philosophical views of Ayn Rand rather than on the the novel itself. The novel develops a scenario created by a progressive form of government. It helped me to understand, not only the difference in values between people, but also how a progressive form of government (rule?) functions. The scenario painted is to rule, not by government, but by a coalition of elected officials, bureaucrats, industry, academics, \\"scientists\\" and the press. It is a novel. It is fiction.

I bought it up to the point where she hooked up with Hank Rearden. Then she hooks up with John Galt and Eddie tells her he loves her (no hookup there).

This is an interesting and currently, widely held philosophy that represents the basis for some political platforms. While it is not important whether I agree or disagree with this perspective, it is of note that the book appears to be written for a 6th grade audience and has simplistic, sometimes child-like characters that become of little interest as the book drones on.I guess that I was expecting more and can understand why this book didn't do well with an educated public."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really?","review":"I agree that you don't have to own a philosophy to read and understand it. But this was some of the worst writing I've encountered, turgid prose at its best. Women who only want to be \\"taken\\", an elite group who believe they have the only answers and of course, a saviour who comes to take them away from a world that doesn't appreciate them. Really?

The more I learn about it, however, the less and less I can agree with it.I've read The Fountainhead, and enjoyed it. There were parts that I had trouble swallowing, but I felt the character of Howard Roark was a great emblem.Compared to The Fountainhead, Atlas Shrugged is just oodles of excuses that money-crazed capitalists use. The characters aren't nearly as thought out, and all of them are radical. And truthfully, none of the characters seem like very happy individuals, even though they're Rand's \\"ideal\\" humans.Yes, I understand the main theme of this novel very well, that technology would stop if we didn't have materialistic, selfish people running the world.My point is that faster trains or taller buildings or stronger metals aren't nearly as important as Ayn Rand seems to believe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak, even for a Nietzschean","review":"Atlas Shrugged is neither a masterpiece of philosphy nor a great novel. I do not hate Ayn Rand, I just pity her and her followers, for they consider this book one of the greatest works of philosophy ever written. This is just a popular novel, and as far as philosophy is concerned, Nietzsche's philosophy on the individual remains unmatched to this day. Thanks to posterity, Atlas Shrugged and the other works of Rand will, sooner or later, fall into oblivion, for that is what happens to everything that pleases only the common herd and the pseudo-intellectuals."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some good ideas, but lacks subtlety","review":"I thought the whole premise of the book was interesting. Rand objected to the belief that economic freedom should be sacrificed to some vague higher goal of \\"fairness\\" or \\"brotherhood\\" or \\"leveling the playing field\\". But I don't agree with her extreme philosophy of \\"every man for himself, let the strongest and smartest survive.\\" I was quite disappointed that someone who was supposed to be so smart and such a deep thinker didn't argue both sides, or apply her philosophy in a more subtle, complex manner. It was more just \\"You're a loser if anything you do is not motivated by self-interest.\\" One can't really enjoy the book, or be provoked to thought, because the book is so overstated, black-and-white, villain vs. superhero."},{"rating":"1","title":"propaganda disguised as a novel","review":"In _Atlas_, Rand earnestly seeks to illustrate that rich people deserve their wealth--that there is a direct correlation between virtue and earning power. This is a hopelessly simplistic philosophy, little more than propaganda.Rand seems to have no grasp that the social circumstances one is born into has a huge impact on how far one can climb. She tries to avoid such an objection by having Dagny Taggart refuse to cash in on her inherited privelege, choosing instead to make her own way.But inheritance isn't always privelege. What if Taggart's \\"inheritance\\" was a disabled mother and three younger siblings? Would we cheer when she disavowed them to strike out on her own?Close your _Atlas_ and pick up George Eliot's _Middlemarch_: she is a writer that understands not only that human interdependence a fact, but that it can be an ennobling one."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Torah of the Objectivist religion","review":"Ayn Rand was not a remarkable philosopher but a rather a pathetic demagouge who lacked any well-formed, decent ideas. By all means, read this book if you are interested in the development of right wing ideas, but understand that this is not the work of a woman who knew much about what she attempted to describe. Influenced not by reason and truth, but by absurd fascist Ubermensch philosophy, Atlas is terrifyingly devoid of clarity. That it has become a holy book of a cult movement for 40 years is a testimony to the unholy persuasive powers of the author and to the dreadful pathology of her followers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why is the publisher gouging us for the Kindle edition?","review":"My daughter read this book recently and became very interested in government and philosophy. She has 17 year-old eyes that can read the tiny print. I really would like to read this book too, but wow the font is tiny! Thought I'd get it on my iphone, where I can enlarge the text a little. Well, I'm not spending $18.99 for it! Why is the publisher setting such a high price?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dime-store philosophy disguised as a dime-store novel","review":"Atlas Shrugged has a great plot premise. In the hands of a decent author, it could be a great book. Instead, characters with no ambiguity speak in philosophical lectures about Rand's objectivism. While one can make a good case for objectivism in running a business, such as a railroad, Rand tries to apply it to art, family--and even love! She criticizes those who do not take an extremist stance, but that's exactly the problem with the book. It's an all-or-nothing theory in a world that's far more complex than her theories allow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Isn't It Ironic?","review":"For a book that celebrates excellence in workmanship, it is ironic that the Kindle version of this book is so poorly formatted. The main problems seem to be centered on punctuation although there are some typos.I first read this book in high school and wanted to see if it made the same impact 40 years later. While I enjoyed it again I found it to be bloated - saying the same thing over and over again. What could be said in a paragraph or two is stretched over 5-10 pages. All right - we get it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Great story line, fascinating characters.

I've read some ofAyn Rand's writings and am familiar with her philosophy but I've not read one of her novels.After wading through 1,000 pages I have to say I'm amazed that this novel is so popular and enduring. OK, I get it that Rand is a materialist, but she's sucked all the life out of this novel by making it such a relentless polemic. Quite ironically it occurred to me while reading \\"Atlas\\" that it has all the esthetic appeal of socialist realist art from the Soviet era.There's NO nuance or subtlety here. The characters lack the complex motivations and emotions of real life. The individualist heroes are flat prototypes and all other characters are weak, conformists totally lacking character and virtue.I just can't take this tome seriously as philosophy or literature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Philosophy for the Tea Party","review":"Reads like a work of *ideology* written by someone who didn't quite grasp any of the great European *philosophers* that she apparently read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overpriced","review":"Since when have electronic books become more expensive than hard copies?

Some will think it is the best book they have ever read, actually calling it life-changing and others will think its utter and complete garbage. But I have yet to meet anyone who thought it was mediocre. This book has been voted the 2nd most influential book ever(after the Bible!)in poll after poll. For that reason alone I think you have to read it just to consider yourself literate. Now admittedly Rand's narrative occasionally degenerates into a lecture but the lecture is interesting in and of itself. And when you get to John Galt's ENDLESS speech you may start to wish that someone had edited Rand a little, say a few hundred pages!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspires thought","review":"If you follow politics at all in modern America, then you will be surprised at the prescience of Ayn Rand in Atlas Shrugged. What incredible foresight she had, considering that this novel was published in the 1950s.This book will challenge your values and force you to question your assumptions as to how society functions, and what citizens should expect from their government.The book also a good mystery and it contains some nice science fictional elements as well. Who is John Galt? :)Overall: a very interesting and enlightening read. Some of the monologues are way too long, however, and can't be read without taking a break."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brisk, well-plotted, and insightful...","review":"\\"Atlas Shrugged\\" is Rand's masterpiece achievement. It features brisk pace (despite its large size), well-crafted plot, piercing insights into modern political and philosophical problems, plus (as a bonus) slightly dubious character motivation. In fact, I thoroughly enjoyed the novel and agreed with most of the things it had to say, but frankly, John Galt put me off. (John Galt is almost the sole reason I use four rather than five stars). He is a totally one-sided character, and he has become such a myth by the end that the mere mention of his name as an actual character seems bald and brazen. (My favorite character, admittedly, was Ragnar Danneskjold). The villains were portrayed well, especially as character prototypes (I am sure Ms.Rand had a lot of experience with them). But nevermind that, its well worth the read and the thorough round of contemplation that it invariably brings with it. A fine work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Try \\"The Fountainhead\\" instead...","review":"...it's shorter and reads better.I managed to get through about three quarters of this very long book, but it finally defeated me. Rand's ideas are worth understanding, but the speechifying finally wore me past patience and stamina. The \\"tragic\\" heroism of the main characters ceased being interesting pretty early in the book.If only Rand had cut this monster down by a third... the writing might have been tighter; the characters, limited in depth though they are, might have had more sharply drawn and entertaining trajectories; and the terribly dated \\"bogey and bacall\\" posing might have held me if only for historic and nostalgic reasons.I reached a point where I no longer cared how it all turned out.With no small sense of release I quit this volume for good and will not be back."},{"rating":"1","title":"perfection","review":"perhaps the greatest combination of bad philosophy and bad writing in the history of literature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Childish","review":"There are two novels that can change a bookish fourteen-year old's life: The Lord of the Rings and Atlas Shrugged.

The other, of course, involves orcs."},{"rating":"1","title":"if you need someone to justify selfishness, look no further","review":"Ayn Rand has to be one of the most verbose yet immature philosophers I've come upon. She seems to fit the classic definition of a psychopath, as her \\"philosophy\\", objectivism, amounts to little more than a \\"do what you feel if it benefits you\\" and \\"greed is good\\" mantra.There is nothing of value in her works if you are one of those people who consider themselves to have morals, even if you're not a religious person."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worship of Cruel, Over the Top Greed","review":"If Ayn Rand was a philosopher, Elmer Fudd was an astrophysicist. Her inane, yammering works of interminable length are adored by freaks looking to excuse their fear and loathing of humanity and pathological worship of wealth and greed.

I found it very engaging at first, and tugging at the emotion of those who feel the system is taking advantage of them. After awhile I became largely bored, but driven on by the hope of some very important message. Overall I liked the expression of thoughts, but I don't share the same ambition to have the pendulum of society swing in this direction. I have a hard time correlating this with all the positives of the society I have been blessed to be apart, and I don't feel that the extremisms of this philosophy have a long term benefit to the human condition.In the end the message was based on a search for a Utopian society that so many before have espoused. I can't predict the future, but as times change and become pregnant with new ideas, I pray for a less narrow vision of humanity is embraced by society."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast delivery, Great Book","review":"This book written in the 50's is still relevant today.

It will definitely make you think. Rand hit a home run on her epic tale of the struggle of man living in an American dystopia. Taking place where the government controls everything, and punishes profit and success as greed, by distribution of successful peoples wealth. Even though the story was published over 50 years ago the themes and plot still ring true in America today, and even mirror our current economic struggles!

While sometimes wordy, everything written was done so with care, and even the \\"long speeches\\" of which she is denounced for are interesting. This is a good look at a way of thought not popularized on television, the radio, in government, or even other books. It isn't a long standing seller through a quirk of fate.The book is not too long at all, as some might lead you to believe. This book was intended to give a world-view of what's wrong in today's life. This is no small feat, to say the least. I have read many negative remarks about both this book and her philosophy, and let them continue to say such things. Les Mis is considered great, too, but I couldn't stomach it. I couldn't even watch the movie. If you like philosophy, melodrama, and thought-provoking literature, then there is no way you should pass this up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worthwhile read","review":"After catching a review in the Wall Street Journal, this book made my list to read. It is intimidating at close to 1100 pages of small print, but I am glad I gave it a go. It is an engrossing story that held my attention. Rand tends to get a bit preachy at the end. There is a 50+ page monologue by one of the main characters that quite frankly could have been said in about 5 pages and doesn't add much to the point she is trying to make. Overall I would recommend the book but you have to be willing to commit a good bit of time to getting through it."},{"rating":"1","title":"100 Words or Less","review":"Rand appeals to our basic selfish instinct: The strong succeed, the weak leech.That premise is the bulk of her intellectual prowess and many many years ago I found it interesting and alluring. Yet, with maturity, comes a better sense of how this world works.Regardless of all the political focus Rand seems to be getting lately, as a literary work this novel is mildly entertaining two-thirds of the way through and then falls apart. Then it's not about story or plot, it's about indoctrination. It's about propaganda. Okay, that's fine for the pulpit. But really sucks for a novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"thought provoking novel that hits a lot of buttons.","review":"I have read this book no less than five times. While Rand and I differ on our ideas of a higher power, I admire her courage to put into words what most productive, self-driven people think every day as they drive to work. What would happen if all the productive, thinking people of the world were to simply...disappear, leaving the world to be governed by mediocre bureaucrats? This book does a great job of illustrating just that. The first time I read this book,it almost killed me, due to the length, and I didn't get a lot out of it. Later, an older and wiser me was able to glean much from the subtle ideas portrayed here. I won't say this book changed my life, because I was a card carrying Libertarian long before I grasped its meaning, but it helped mold and reinforce ideas I already held. Read it with an open mind, and take what you can from this thought-provoking prose."},{"rating":"2","title":"Suspend Disbelief and Enjoy","review":"look, if you want to read a novel on the dangers of creeping statism ,then buy this book.

And it's (surprise, surprise) very popular....This novel is overlong in the extreme, full of one-dimensionals, and horribly written. Pure bad with a capital B. BAD.Objectivism (I cringe even dignifying Rand's vision with its proper name) is the purest form of skunking, existentialism's great sin, creating yourself as unique and vital to the world. So even though the two philosophies are often linked (mostly by idiots), they are in direct opposition.If you're looking for literary developments of competent philosophies check out Sartre and Camus. These guys don't pull their punches, and they don't ignore the areas of life that pose problems for their ideologies.To ease up on Rand, she did write a novel I really enjoyed: Anthem. At just over a hundred pages in length, I didn't have time to puke, because she didn't have time to rant, and her constant deployment of first person plural was amusing."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the most awful books I've ever read...","review":"For a number of years I kept hearing what a classic work of American literature Ayn Rand's \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" was.

Classic work of American literature? Hardly. What a long-winded, confused and throughly terrible piece of tripe filled with characters you couldn't care less about, all of whom are totally devoid of normal human emotion, and ridiculous situations that were obviously contrived simply to prove a point or make some grand 'statement'.

Can anyone who loved this book point out a significant difference in the characters of Wesley Mouch, Orren Boyle, Jim Taggart, Paul Larkin, Dr. Ferris, etc. ad nauseum?Of course, there are the \\"romantic\\" scenes!

There is nobody who was more anti-socialist than he. I am completely anti-socialist, but there is one thing I loathe more than it: mediocrity. That is what Nietzsche most hated.

Be warned this is not a narrative. it is forst and foremost Rand's philosphy in the form of a narrative.While the book explains, again and again and again, the principles behind Rand's Objectivism, basically every man for himself, it is woefully lacking in every other aspect of good writing. The characters are all one-dimensional, they are either really good or really bad. They do no speak like real people, their interactions with each other, especially the romantic interludes are worse than cheesy.This book could have been at least half the length if it weren't for the endless pages of speeches extolling Objectivism.Just research Rand's theories and save yourself a lot of hours."},{"rating":"1","title":"How did this happen?","review":"How in the world did this novel end up in the non-fiction section?

As it has been 15 or so years since I've read it, the fact that I still remember as much of it as I do is a plus.My one star grade is based solely on my distaste for Ms. Rand's philosophy of Objectivism and hedonistic, winner-take-all capitalism that is presented as though it were a religion.Read it, but don't buy it.

She will convince you that she is being perfectly reasonable when she says that selfishness is a virtue, and that \\"man's ego is the fountainhead of human progress.\\" As a matter of fact, she will make YOU feel like a brainless idiot for NOT being a \\"capitalistic pig.\\" Some significant observations in reviews I have read here on amazon.com are that this book is second in popularity only to the bible, and Rand is wildly anti-religion.

It's a MUST for anyone in this day and age of politics where Obama is seen as a socialist (he's not) and the real socialism in France, England, Canada, Germany is being challenged, but not as Ayn Rand challenged it. It's being challenged by the benefactors of socialism for their respective Government cutting their socialist benefits!

Also, the view of cigarettes, which play a large role in the book, is a symbol of the power (fire) which is controlled by man while he thinks.Thinking is the greatest of man's gifts.

It's a long-winded and malicious treatise by a second-rate demagogue who was about as dense as her devoted followers. She considers the majority of people in this world to be parasites, but it is her self-centered philosophy that is truly parasitical. I would like to say this, but the pro-Rand forces might make enough of a stink with Amazon to censure me, just like they did many of their previous critics. Like Rand, it seems, the Objectivist notion of freedom applies only to the few they select."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Brutal Read","review":"I had heard so much about this book that I had to read it to see what all of the fuss was about. First I read Fountainhead and found it interesting, even though it was a bit heavy-handed. I think Fountainhead was a much better book; probably because I could see some depth in the characters and it was the first time I had been exposed to Rand's point of view. Sadly, Rand covers a lot of the same ground with Atlas and the characters in Atlas are one-dimensional. The reader gets to choose from strong,smart, manly heroes (Dagny included) and the smarmy, wimpy, whining losers that make up all of the characters with few exceptions. I understood early on that Government was bad, the Creators were good, and the rest of the people were pawns, but Rand goes over and over and over the same territory. Did I mention that she goes over the same territory again and again?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great timely read","review":"This book is so appropriate for the voters of the past election. It is exactly path we follow toward Socialism as Obama takes office. His \\"share the wealth plan\\" is just as the author outlines as \\"for the good\\" of the country, which is nothing but disaster for our nation. Ayn Rand had Socialism tagged back in the thirties and we keep moving toward it as the left leaning liberals gain more power. We are a Capitalist nation and GOD help us if we don't soon turn to a degree od sanity in our voting system!"},{"rating":"2","title":"the story","review":"I love this story. I understand that it is really about objective capitalism but I don't care. I'm a sucker for a long and detailed story about people, about life. The characters are expertly rendered. The fashion is used in a truly inspirational way. It brings a whole new layer to the characters, especially Dagny.Rand makes you think about your life and how you react when faced with a challenge or decision. It makes you question charity and welfare. It makes you wonder why some people are in destitute situations when there are always jobs to do, even if they are less than desirable or require more work than one might get paid for."},{"rating":"1","title":"$18.99 for a Kindle Edition????","review":"Atlas Shrugged is my all time favorite book.

As philosophy, it is childish and cruel. As a work of fiction, it is bloated and dull.

The philosophy of Ayn Rand however leaves alot to be desired. What a complete narcissist she was.

I also this that her talent as a writer is questionable too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zero Stars","review":"I read this thirty five years ago and actually thought it was good at the time. It is said that the only true judgment one can make it to judge who you are today against who you were in the past. Thank you Ayn for revealing to me how I have grown. I recently purchased the CD version for a ten hour drive. The CDs are very well done. It is just too bad about the content. Today this material is pure paranoid dribble. Rand exhibits the fear that existed in the 1950s toward socialism AKA thinking with your heart.

I don't blame him","review":"A very tedious read (1200+ pages). I can tell that Mrs. Rand is Russian. She may be a great writer but, my god, would these characters pleeeeze GET TO THE POINT(!) in a hundred words or less. No wonder her America was dying. Who wants to listen to all this drivel. People, even in the fifties, didn't express themselves as her dialogue (?). To be fair: Yes, there are moochers and looters. Yes, we punish success. Yes, jealousy is a huge motivator in many. But say it in fewer words and clearer sentences. Work on a realistic solution. Maybe this story would work in Russia where they love to talk, but not in the good old USA.

Masterful on so many levels, I particularly enjoyed the depiction of parasitic intellectuals - the writers who can't write, the artists who can't draw, and composers who write noise instead of music. Given the political events of today it is especially relevant. It makes a great graduation, birthday or Christmas gift."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best","review":"I should have read this when I was in high school because it would have changed my life. It is the finest book about self reliance I have ever read and one of the very best of any genre.

We all need John Gault more than we know. The more I read, the longer I wanted the book to be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome. Life-changing. Why greed is good.","review":"\\"Greed, for the lack of a better word, is good. And greed will save the United States of America.\\" One has to suspect that Gordon Gekko's famous speech in Wall Street was inspired in small part by Ayn Rand's masterpiece. Reading it, even a dyed-in-the-wool Communist will understand why free markets work and government intervention and planned economies do not. Rand's masterpiece is timeless and a must-read for every political-science and economics major in our colleges. Unforgettable (if somewhat one-dimensional) characters, a purposeful plot, and an unquenchable belief -- the freedom to choose one's own destiny, good or bad -- make this not just a book, but THE Book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ayn Rand's great read.","review":"Not being a speed reader, this book took quite a while to read. It's an interesting concept on the possibilities of a runaway society. I don't agree with all her thoughts, but an awful lot of the scenarios seem to hit home. It has caused me to start giving the political situation in this country a lot more thought. I first checked this book out of my city library. After trying to hold it up while reading for 2 hours I decided to buy it for my Kindle Fire. A good investment. I would recommend this book to anyone who has given more thougth to life than getting up in the morning and going on Facebook."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindle Edition is HORRIBLE","review":"My one-star rating is purely meant for the Kindle edition, which is so filled with distracting typos on almost every page that it is almost impossible to read.

Very few books or ideas change how I look at the world; this one did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Atlas Shrugged - Turtleback Binding","review":"As to the story, it is magnificent. Amazing that 54 years after release it still relates to today's economy. I will not review the story - it has been rated the 2nd most influential book on the planet, after the Bible. I'll leave it there.Physically, the book is nicely hard covered. The cover has a glossy finish and the spine is strong - too strong to lay open on a table while you eat lunch, but not obscuring the spine side text. 1079 pages of small print - looks like 0.0032\\" thick paper. The paper feels thin to the touch, almost like newspaper. There are 51 lines/page on the even (left) pages, 50 lines/page on the odd (right) pages. (Does anyone know why that is? I'd like to know.) Computes to about an 8 point font. Hard on old eyes, but readable. The cost was very reasonable (about $14) and better if you get free Prime 2-day shipping."},{"rating":"1","title":"Attempt To Justify Fanatical World-View With Cheesy Novel","review":"Rand has a lot of interesting ideas in this book--what she doesn't have is a novel. This story is NOT interesting, with its 2-D characters and 50pg philosophical diatribes interrupting, of all things, a RAILROAD DRAMA. She just has no idea how people--any people, including herself--operate and why. She seems to think that when people fail in business it's because they are stupid, lazy misanthropists. What makes it worth reading (regardless of your political beliefs) are the ideas and arguments about the nature of human greatness and government. Not that they are right, but that they get your mind zinging, focusing your own beliefs as you say to yourself \\"What the? But that's not true because...\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Jeez... Did I read a different book than everyone else?","review":"The philosophy is right on, and I do not understand those people that call Rand a Nazi or just plain sick. My problem was with the story. I never have cared so little about what happened the chacacters. This could have been a great 200 page book if Rand had quit repeating her ideas over and over (Noone can deny she does this).

Though there are many people who take Ayn Rands philosophies to the extreme, and who will insist that this work of fiction is a tome to base your life upon, the basic philosophy in the novel is simple. . . work hard for what you want, and dont expect others to carry you on their shoulders by freely giving you what THEY earned. This is a simple message in an entertaining book, with the benefit of being one of the very few novels that invites you not simply to escape into its world, but to relate it to your own world and to think about your own place in it. Reading this novel is truly an experience I would recomend to everyone, especially those who are looking for a book with a great amount of substance and character."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lesson in writing","review":"I've based this review on the incredible writing style, pacing, and plot development. While Ayn Rand is perhaps best known for her philosophy, I am very much taken by her writing abilities. Whether or not you agree with her premise, Atlas Shrugged is a well written character study, and an engrossing read. If you are an aspiring author, you will do well to study her style."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Reading","review":"I read this book for a reading assigment in high school. I thought that it would be a real drag but once I got started, I discovered that it was really interesting. Ayn Rand is a brilliant writer and her characters are very intriguing. I found it hard to put the book down! Rand also gives you a new perspective on life through her theory of objectivism. I highly recommend that everyone read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A disturbingly correct view of life","review":"This book struck somthing inside me. I see the disturbing reality Rand described every day in my work (health care.) The intense efforts by government and quasi-government regulators to control everything we do and then consider us as blooodsuckers for making a profit (or even breaking even) comes right out the book.This is a MUST read for any educated adult. It made what is happening in the world so much more clear to me.The only drawback is the wooden, repetitive writing. Many of the characters are overdrawn charactitures. The main characters are quite good however. At 1000+ pages the book is quite a struggle especially with the long speeches the characters have (don't skip them- they are the meat of the book). Well worth the effort. Would have been 5 stars but for the excessive length. With better writing this could have been 400 pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well theres six weeks of my life I will never get back","review":"Does this woman believe in editing?!?!?

I don't like not finishing books that I start, although this one truly tested my commitment. I found the book extremely boring. It keeps repeating the same point over and over again, literally for over a thousand pages. I fail to see why this book is so popular. It didn't really change my point of view, but it did bore me a great deal and I was happy when it was finished."},{"rating":"2","title":"Could not put it down","review":"This book by no means needs my approval. It has stood on its own as an excellent work for a long time. However, it may be possible that enormous quantities of positive reviews may convince someone to read it, and that is what I want, because people who understand this book will benefit me in the long run. You may not agree with everything in the book, but I would be amazed by anyone who could put it down after reading it and still think that legal plunder is a sound foundation for a nation. The exciting story will carry you along with ease, despite the fact that the book takes several days to finish. Although this book was written in the late 50's, it seems like a near perfect description of what is happening now. I think that if you distilled this book down its essence, and scraped the atheism off to the side, you would have The Law, by Frederic Bastiat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dated","review":"I know that this book is revered by economists, political scientists and futurists, but I found it dated and odd and not at all informative. I heard Alan Greenspan was a student of Ayn Rand and even read drafts of the book as she wrote it. So this was a must read which I wish I had not. I especially have a problem with the length of the book as it seems many episodes are repetitive. At least the price is right."},{"rating":"1","title":"Abominable","review":"Abominable selfishness posing as a philosophy, perhaps from the very same demonic muse that infected/possessed Nietzche.I couldn't even get into the actual prose, so hideous was the author's hatred toward her fellow people.Rand's philosophy was a mixture of cartoonishness and arrogance--the kind of stuff usually seen only in straighjacketed philosophers or totalitarian dictators.By the way: IF ANYBODY WOULD LIKE TO ENCOUNTER A QUAINT, SIMPLE, YET UTTERLY RUTHLESS DESTRUCTION OF RAND'S PHILOSOPHY, READ \\"OLD SCHOOL\\" BY TOBIAS WOLFF. Wolff destroys Rand in one fell swoop, and does it through the voice of a near child."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Evil Book Written By An Hypocrite","review":"This is one of the vilest pieces of crap to masquerade as a novel written by a woman who strings words together and calls it writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plainly bad.","review":"Let's skip the \\"philosophy\\" debate-- judged as a story, this book sucks.

I read about 250 pages and then could not go on anymore. Truly if you finish this book you deserve a medal(like one reviewer said,it should be in the back inside cover).The theme is gray and depressing-heavy industry,railroads and mining in a fictional 30's like era with the main character being a woman who is really a superwoman.Sentences can be super long.Passages super long with long winding philosophical nonsense talk.

Don't turn your head and cry, \\"No, I don't want to listen.\\"I can't recommend this book highly enough. I can't conceive of how it could NOT be a learning and enriching experience for ALL readers. It stands next to \\"The Man Without Qualities\\" and \\"The Brothers Karamazov\\" as a masterpiece of philosophical literature (a difficult genre)... Umberto Eco and Albert Camus are little tiddly! -wink players in philosophical literature compared to Rand.

This book is quite small, subsequently has small print, and is not library bound as it says. While the size is definitely listed in the particulars, I simply didn't realize it would be smaller than my hand. If you are expecting a good stitch binding, you will be disappointed, as this is apparently a paperback simply glued into a hard cover, which wouldn't last long if available for public use. Additionally, there appear to be some issues with the formatting, with varying margin widths and chapters that begin mid-page. Not having read this book yet, I don't know if that is part of the intended format or not. If none of these things are issues for you, then this book is probably fine. At any rate, I'm returning this one, and will be looking for a larger print version with proper binding."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bought it for our son who had lost his copy. He liked it.","review":"I really don't know much about the book since I haven't read it. It seems to be a very popular volume generally speaking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it or hate it!","review":"Ayn may not be a literary genius, but her ideas have genuine merit. Many of her characters are paralleled in the conservatives of today who are tired of being dragged down by close minded bureaucrats who want only power and money and misuse their authority to get it rather than do the job they were put in place to do. I've read most of the reviews just to get a feel for the opinions of others who have also read this book. If you are a socialist liberal democrat (or just a democrat since they are the same) you will hate this book! It is not for those who think that society owes them a handout when they have not earned it themselves! On the otherhand, if you feel that you should achieve for the sake of doing your best at something (rather than being a parasite off of those who are the best) and that you deserve to the reap the rewards for your achievements with limited government intervention or extortion in the form of taxes, fees, and regulations; then you will love this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whew! It's a long read.","review":"I don't read very fast, so this took a real commitment. It's really scary how this book reads just like today's headlines, only written 55 years earlier. Rand writes a good book, but sure goes to the extreme in \\"describing\\" things. Adds a lot of fluff. Enjoyable read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Philosophy in novel form","review":"An amazing book written based on the practical yet innovative ideas of Rand. I had read Anthem, and this book is a lot more interesting, both in plot and philosophical implications. I had just taken a macroeconomics course, and I believe knowing a little about basic economic theories enhances the book. It was hard to stop reading, because you want to know what happens to the characters, and at the same time you flinch because of the quasi-communistic and self-destructive ideas of the society. The reason why I didn't give this book the full 5 stars is because while an incredible book, it is really long, and kind of unnecessarily so. Rand uses long monologues to repeatedly hammer her ideas into your head in case you didn't get it the first several times. But a good book just the same, check it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book about conservative values and work ethics.","review":"would recommend to read to anyone with a week or so on their hands.

This book could have been EASILY edited to half the number of pages and lose nothing.You might like the book if you find the next paragraph exciting...Money good, hand-outs and government intervention bad.

The characters are abhorrent. And if you don't tire of the way they are always described as having \\"a hint of a smile\\" you will breakdown midway through the zillionth repetition of her dogma. But you can look forward to the 100 page John Galt diatribe...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who is John Galt?","review":"Well, kids, John Galt was a character in a silly old book, written by a woman who was a notorious crackpot. Few take her seriously today but a few benighted reactionaries and a lot of high-school students who have never read another book but believe themselves to be misunderstood geniuses. (Oh, and Alan Greenspan.) No kids, pay John Galt no mind. Seriously though, I've read Atlas Shrugged, and it depresses me to hear praise showered upon it. That people consider it literature, with its wooden prose and cardboard characters, shows that they know nothing of literature. That people consider its pernicious ideas sound shows that they are anything but \\"objective.\\" The world simply does not work the way Ms. Rand's cultists believe it does. If you like big books, read Gravity's Rainbow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Objective-tastic!","review":"Objectivism isn't philosophy folks. It's like, \\"Philosophy for Dummies.\\" My first day of my Social Sciences class at college, I, having read AS, I piped up and said that Smith's \\"Wealth of Nations\\" was similar in a few aspects to Atlas Shrugged and Ayn Rand's views on objectivism. They looked at me like I had just thrown up all over the floor. No one who has anything to do with academia takes crap like Atlas Shrugged seriously, and if you asked them to belt out a list of philosophers, Ayn Rand might make the top 1000. Anyway, Rand does an... alright job of synthesizing some broad ideas, but another thing that bothers me is that it's not very good writing. It's not awful... it's just mediocre, and trudging through over a thousand pages took it out of me something fierce, like having to read 3 da vinci codes, only, you know, less action-packed.Anyway, don't delude yourselves into thinking Ayn Rand is a philosopher, because she's not. She's an AUTHOR."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow, not revolutionary, not interesting.","review":"I didn't like it, I was looking for some profound thoughts to be spilled into my lap but I didn't get them. I am not sure if in the time that it was written it was completely out of the ordinary with its contraversial \\"philosophy\\" but I didnt get much out of it. It seemed to be steared towards a more self loathing, unhappy and hermit crowd. I prefer something more thought provoking and honestly different. But maybe I missed a lot, I was almost falling asleep through most of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Preconceived Notions","review":"I have read a ton of reviews people have written on this book. In this day and time, I can't really seem to find any thoughts on the book that are written without preconceived notions. Today, people tend to read this book for one of two reasons. 1) They read it to bolster their own views of politics or 2) they read it to find fault within its pages and philosophies.As far as comparing this book's ideas with the political philosophies of today, there are some parallels and there are some far-fetched notions. The one key idea presented within the pages of this book that is required for any political philosophy to be successful is that of high moral standards. Good people do good things.That is all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gotta read it to believe it","review":"Well, If you really like novels that are long, complicated, far fetched, unrealistic, with a bad ending your going to love this novel. I believe Ayn exaggerated a little to much throughout the book. If she made it a little more believable I think I would of liked it. She also need to create some more likeable characters. They all came across mean and selfish, I know that was Ayn's point but that doesn't make a good book.I do think it was interesting to read just because of the different approach she took in the novel. Ive never read such a thick book before and it was very rewarding and although I felt the ending needed some work, the book did keep my interest until the end. So you decide whither you want to read it or not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasn't a fan","review":"I found it to be somewhat of a diatribe preaching to type A workaholics.

I would recommend Atlas Shrugged to anyone. But the print in this particular edition is very small and strains my eyes. Get another edition with larger print for comfort in reading this very good book and very long book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Noble attempt by a Confused and Frustrated Author","review":"Ayn Rand lived a tough life, there's no doubt about that. She suffered through the Russian Revolution and somehow survived in America and managed to make a semi-successful career as a writer. All of that aside, her writing reaches average at best. Her dialogue and character descriptions are so out-right and blatant and the philosophy she bases around reason and creative thought contradicts itself with her dogmatic forcefulness. She herself scolded any of her followers for questioning her. This book has a place and a time, appropriate for teenagers finding their way through adolescence. Otherwise, it is a drawn-out work of average merit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over-rated Right Wing Pablum","review":"This book is only good if you buy in to right-wing BS.

This government currently running the country keeps saying that the wealthy which have been more blessed and fortunate need to pay there fair share.What is fair and who decides?There is a tipping point that can become unfair,and those that are not fortunate but are successful will begin to feel like slaves to the needy that keep needing .The successful eventually will grow tired of it and stop producing.America is $16 trillion in debt and still spending.If the successful stop producing and America keeps spending we will know how things play out in the end.Atlas shrugged lays it all out very well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great audio book","review":"Wanted to read before I saw the movie, but ran out of time.

At first I was deeply dissapointed to have to read a 1000 page book, but once I started reading it, I could not stop. I personally do not agree with objectivism, but Ayn Rand, brings you into Dagny's life. You find yourself w/ relating to the characters and their struggles, and dreams . I have also read Anthem, by Ayn Rand, and find Atlas Shrugged her best work, by far. Atlas Shrugged is now a beloved book by me, and the rest of my english class. John Galt will live forever!"},{"rating":"1","title":"wake me when it's over","review":"I'm sorry, but this book is boring the pants off me.

I found the one star reviews more thought provoking than the book itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked it.","review":"I heard several people talk about this book but never really thought it would be all that interesting. With the dust settling from the 2004 election and my interest in logic, I picked up a copy and read the first few pages. It grabbed my attention from the start and kept me plowing through until the end. Finishing the book was not the easiest of tasks but a good accomplishment. It definitely changed my outlook on some things and provided me with a better understanding of philosophy and conservative thought. I recommend this book to anyone with an open mind and thirst for knowledge. Try it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing, Life-Changing Book","review":"There are no words I could write in this review that would do justice to Atlas Shrugged. There's nothing I could say to express how life-changing this novel was for me. If you're willing to give it a chance then please do so. You owe it to yourself. The book was written in 1957 but in many ways talks about the very same issues we're seeing today. If you're not willing to commit to the price (though this book would be a steal at any price) then go to your local library instead. This is the first book that made me excited for my daughters to learn how to read. I have yet to see any logical complaints about the ideas expressed in this work. Read it, understand it."},{"rating":"2","title":"READ \\"THE FOUNTAINHEAD \\"FIRST!","review":"This book explores the same concepts as the Fountainhead in macro form while using characters to act out the important philosophical concepts at stake. It is aflawed book though. For one thing,It is too long.Plus, Ayn rands view Male /Female relationships is ...odd(this book like the Fountainhead has a rape/love scene). That said ,she shows us how one government edict begets another bringing us down the slippery slope towards tyranny and poverty. I think she really does a fine job of showing us a how an FDR-like President with \\"emergency powers\\" could do it here. I say all this having read the book 4 times. Flawed but magnetic."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book.","review":"Now, you do not have to be an Objectivist to like this book, you can even hate the ideas that Ayn Rand embodies, but you still will love this book. To me, although wordy at times, this book is a goldmine of character development at it's best. Every character, even the minor characters, have a immense amount of depth to them that most authors have a hard time achieving with their lead characters, not even mentioning the minor characters. This book makes you think, the syntax is amazing. Not to mention, it's full of great quotes. The only part of the book that I found taxing was the 20 page (if not more) speech, but if you've understood the book up to that point, you really don't need to read it. I think everyone should read this book at least once, it's an eye-opening experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another masterpiece!","review":"This is another of James Baldwin's literary triumphs. Here he weaves the deepest hopes, sorrows, fears and desires of the human condition into an unforgettable tapestry. The story centers around an actor named Leo Proudhammer and the choices he made in his life, the results that followed and the people he shared his life with. Here we read about Leo as a youngster growing up in Harlem, his struggles as a young man trying to break into showbiz amidst a multitude of obstacles and his successful rise to stardom. This is a very poignant and tender but, powerful and gripping story that will hold your attention. Also recommended: \\"Giovanni's Room\\", \\"Another Country\\" and \\"Going to Meet the Man\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Baldwin!!!","review":"It is thrilling to read such an amazing story from one of the Greats!! I love his creativity and inspiring literature!

It goes back and forth between dreams and reality and it is hard to tell which is which. I didn't even finish reading the book, although, I must admit, I did read the last chapter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good","review":"I loved Emotionally Weird, which was the first novel I read by her, so I decided to check out the novels she wrote before it. Human Croquet sounded interesting and weird so I decided to give it a shot. I'm glad I did. While it took me about eighty pages to really start getting into it (Isobel's first-person narration was a bit off-putting at first), I'm glad I kept reading. The past sections (written in third-person) were very good and as weirder and weirder occurrences started happening to Isobel, I liked her sections better as well. Overall, while I liked Emotionally Weird more, Human Croquet is still a worthwhile read, especially if you're in the mood for something a little different. I'm looking forward to getting hold of her first novel, Behind the Scenes at the Museum, sometime in the future.Recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Patchy writing, scattered story","review":"I wouldn't recommend this book. Although I like the author's language and writing in general, this book did not live up to its promise. The story plods along and then skips suddenly somewhere else, and somewhere else again. I liked Emotionally Weird very much, though, and look forward to her other books."},{"rating":"2","title":"a modern Wonderland","review":"Human Croquet is a great summer vacation read. The story is a contemporary Alice in Wonderland, where nonsense reigns and the only rule is that rules don't apply. Highly entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"interesting, but very scattered","review":"although i enjoyed this book, i found the mix of past and present was a bit confusing, and i never really knew what was going on during the last half. the ending was too vague and i did not come away satisfied. all in all, it was an interesting book, but not a phenomenal one."},{"rating":"1","title":"ends in obscurity","review":"I was sorely disappointed with this book after reading all the rave reviews. This magically written and initially captivating story about a young girl and her eccentric family turns into a jumbled mess of confused ramblings in the last third of the book. The book seemed to stop in midsentence with an affected summary attached on for explanation. I had absolutely no clue what was going on and what's more I do not think the author did either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Human Croquet","review":"I found this book extremely difficult to read because of the constant time shifts. I expected complex plots from Kate Atkinson but usually it all makes sense in the end and one can appreciate the journey. However, in this book, parts of the story remain unclear at the end. None of the characters really seem to matter. Moreover, it is never entertaining enough to warrant the time spent trying to work it all out."},{"rating":"2","title":"very enjoyable","review":"It is always a bit scary to try a second novel when the first one was so overwhelmingly wonderful, but Human Croquet is another special novel by Atkinson. It is funny like Behind the Scenes at the Museum, but in quite a different way. The tragedy is more apparent here and accompanies you like a perfume through the book. The way Atkinson plays with time throws you totally off balance and makes you look at your perceptions and interpretations of the story in a very different way.I love it when I can submerse myself in a novel to that extent as if I am diving underwater and all day to day sensations are blotted out. All in all it is a wonderful book which makes you long for her next novel!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Magically Delicious","review":"A captivating and bewildering-in-a-good-way beach read. I couldn't stop thinking about the book after I'd finished.... The title is very apropos to the plot. And though, with all the time-jumping and flights of fantasy going on, I am still a little confused as to what *really* went on, I don't think reality is necessarily the point.Good show."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Kate Atkinson has the potential to be a great story teller. The plot of this book was unique and interesting and I liked how she brought it all together near the end. The story had many areas that just dragged on and on and on. She spent extreme amounts of time focusing on insignificant details. There was one section of the book (about 50 pages) that was execeptional and I wanted to continue reading. If she could keep the momentum going throughout the book I would definitely be a fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brace Yourself!","review":"As Tartan Noir goes, this is awfully good, and also awfully Noir.The pleasure with Kate Atkinson is characters that leap off the page. Notonly do you know them, you want to know them, and keep knowing them longafter the story ends, even though they have enough dramas going on in theirlives for a few dozen Coronation Streets.The setting - Edinburgh, the lowlands of Scotland, sometimes northern England,is equally vivid, foggy, gloomy and sometimes menacing (does the sun NEVER comeout over there?)Kate Atkinson is a terrific writer, smart and sometimes wickedly funny but...warning: You don't read her stuff when you want cheering up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ewwww YUCK!!","review":"I had to sign online just to find out who sings the DREADFUL remake of Talk Talk's \\"It's My Life\\".

It seemed that the art style was changed, in a way I personally did not like. Also I noticed that they used stills and drawings in the movie, which left me feeling sort of cheated, as if the movie wasn't worth the cost. Since I own the series, I will probably sell this movie. For me it didn't add anything new other then annoyance. I felt much less connected with the characters, etc, which while it does make sense it still does nothing to justify my buying it. While I understand that many have an opinion different from mine, that is how I feel. If you own the series, you certainly don't need to add this to your collection as it adds nothing new. And if you haven't seen the series, buy it first. S.A.V.E packs are really cheap, and it's only $5 more for a much better product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth your time","review":"MILF: Cheap story line. Poor acting. Not worth your time.

In the beginning they get shot down by everyone, yet somehow find women drunk enough to have sex with them. There is one good looking woman in the film. She is not a milf she is a student. Don't get excited. You are led to believe you are seeing her exposed breast after someone bumps into her at a party and her breast slips out of her halter. They actually used a boob double. The mystery boob is only shown in a closeup. I gave this a one star rating because I don't think they allow a zero star rating. The only redeming quality would be if you have never seen a woman's naked breast before you will in this movie. I already tossed my copy.

I started learning more by reading many about divorced men. This book certainly explained some struggles of the divorced men and helped you be more understanding to him but it is a bit too encouraging the woman to put effort in some part of the books...this part is making me uneasy because I believe that men, divorced or not, want to please woman and feel that it's him who wins the woman, not the woman wins him. The biggest turn off or pressure to them is that the woman is doing more than he does.This book is also written for those single women with no children. This book will be more helpful if it tells single women to take things very slowly and be very patient WITHOUT trying too hard.(the book has some mixed messages so perhaps the author did tell this I m not sure...hah hah.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Try again...","review":"Anyone who has experience with HTML, XML, JScript, or VBScript, should avoid this book. The first half is introductions to the above languages with very little or no ASP.

While the book does baby step the reader towards more complicated work, I believe it doesn't cover the fundamentals it mentions fully. I suggest reading books on HTML, then CSS, and then ASP.

Now that I own it my opinion has changed. I'm a big fan of this style of music, but I find this album kind of sterile and claustrophobic. I think if this band evolves and lets their tunes open up and breath a little they could be great. The band can play and are as tight as a drum but I have one question. Does this band even HAVE a bass player? IMO if you're going to concentrate on heavy riff rock like this you need a bass player who can really groove behind all that riffage. The bass player is just locked in too tight with the rest of the band and is playing the same riffs as the guitars. Which IMO makes it kind of uninteresting. Also, they need to find a stronger vocalist. Period. The weak vocals totally take away from the heaviness. I would suggest go with an Orange Goblin record and bypass this. But I'm defnitely going to keep them in my radar."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good music; Hard to listen to once you see what the band looks like.","review":"Very easy to get into.

Her case is circumstantial at best. The problematic mtDNA evidence and links to numerous JtR letters that are undoubtedly frauds and the fact that Sickert may have been in France in September 1888 are all problems that would have to be dealt with much more seriously. I think it was a noble attempt, but her argument ultimately falls short. While it's not totally worthless, it is definitely not \\"case closed\\".

But this book was awful. The author blatently states that \\"Ripperology\\" is just something she picked up one day and decided to write a book on, and she didn't seem to to a very good job getting her research on the cases and the theory she has. After reading the speculations of Ripperologists, much more creative, I found her speculations boring, and it was the same old thing over and over again for pages, just \\"look at the watermarks! Look at his pictures!\\" This was the only real evidence the author had. This book was very boring. If you want a good read on Jack the Ripper try Donald Rumbelow's The Complete Jack the Ripper, it's a much better read and better written as well. Save your money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good","review":"Ms Cornwell's novels are interesting if you have an interest in forensic science and detective novels. They appear to be well researched and flow smoothly which brings about a pleasent read. After reading Portrait of a Killer though, it is my conclusion that Ms Cornwell should stick to fiction. I have no doubt that she investigated the case thuroughly, but her narrative is confusing and unorganized; I can't believe an editor let this fly. I think that a plausable case against Mr Sickert could be made with the \\"evedence\\" that Ms Cornwell presents but it is doubtful that she would be able to convince a jury simply because everything seems to be out of order.Ripper buffs may get a kick out of her take on the facts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cornwell should stick to fiction","review":"I love Patricia Cornwell's books of Kay Scarpetta. But this book is a long, boring, monotonous read of her view that Sickert was Jack the Ripper. I saw nothing in this book that convinced me that he was Jack the Ripper and her conclusions seemed to me to be more guesswork than fact. I also found that her determination in presenting Sickert as the only possible killer and nothing could deter her from that idea (even the facts) to be annoying, frustrating, and slanted to her views. I do not recommend this book to anyone. I waded through, but wouldn't want to put anyone else through the agony if I could prevent it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Teeeee-dious","review":"Let me start by saying I was a big Cornwell fan for a couple of her books, but decided her fiction was a little dark and her protagonist self-righteous and unsympathetic. I've continued to read her books hoping that she'll temper her holier-than-thou narrative style. Thus the purchase of this book.\\"She doesn't fail to disappoint\\" comes to mind.Her narrative here is disjointed, she has no definitive conclusions and page after page of speculation. There were times I had to check the page numbers to make sure I hadn't skipped a page. Could she be absolutely correct in her assumptions? You betcha. Does she \\"close the case\\"? You decide -- but don't buy this book, just borrow one from someone who's pitching it."},{"rating":"1","title":"sending letters does not make you a murderer","review":"I almost didn't get this book because of the bad reviews. Mrs. Cornwell did a good job in telling her story and in giving her views. I think she has proved that Sickert probably sent several of the ripper letters. However, sending a letter and taunting the police seems like a sick joke Sickert would enjoy playing. As far as him being the Ripper that's a joke. I suggest picking this book up if you can get it for a buck or two. However, if your wanting the straight story you won't find a better book than - The Complete History of Jack The Ripper by Philip Sugden. By the way, Mrs. Cornwall has been buying Sickerts paintings. If she can make people believe this man was Jack the Ripper - what an investment."},{"rating":"1","title":"ego unleashed","review":"When admitting that her assumptions are in no way demonstrable as fact, Cornwell puts the word \\"proof\\" in quotation marks (p. 192) \\"Proof\\" therefore becomes questionable, as in 'so-called-proof.' As in 'let's not allow PROOF to get in the way of a good story.' She doesn't. I believe the well-intentioned author could have saved herself some embarrassment by reviewing some of the Ripper books published over the years.

I was sorely disappointed. _Portrait of a Killer_ was 400 pages of asides, with occasional installments of an interesting story that could have been told in 100. Perhaps a reader truly obsessed with the Ripper case would appreciate the extensive biographical information about Sickert's father-in-law and other quasi-relatives and the historical details about art exhibits, etc, during the time period of the killings. For most, it is too much detail and not relevant enough to hold a reader's attention. I finished the book, hoping for some suspense, but there was no climax. It seems that Cornwell was simply told that 400 pages was enough, so she stopped there. Thank goodness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as pitiful as Isle of Dogs","review":"After Isle of Dogs which I pre-ordered, I will never buy Patricia Cornwell without checking it out in a bookstore first.

Unfortunately, I had to force myself to finish what I felt was a poorly organized and hard to follow jumble of thoughts.I found the actual facts regarding the murders themselves slightly interesting and could even be convinced that Sickert was indeed the murder. But I felt as though I was reading a thesis written by someone half-heartedly.My advice to anyone interested in this book is to skip it. Save your money. I wish I would have. My advice to Cornwell... stick to Scarpetta."},{"rating":"1","title":"jack the ripper, case closed. My personal review","review":"The book started off interesting enough, But the details and evidence linking W.R.S. to the crimes seem more than circumstantial to me, and as the book goes on the author fills the pages with uniteresting facts and life stories about people who have really no importance at all in the big picture. The thing that irritated me the most was how she compared crime scene investigation in that era to crime scene investigation now, I for one am aware that we've advanced considerably, Like I said earlier, there was alot \\"page filling\\" with unuseful information. I for one was not impressed nor do I believe the alleged and certainly unreliable police reports and eye- witness accounts documented over 100 years ago forming the basis of this book, It seems the documentation would have been unreliable even then.. There are some interesting things to consider in this book though, If you have any interest at all in \\"Jack the Ripper\\" its worth the read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Patricia Cornwell is a fraud","review":"I was lead to believe this book would be worth a read, but having done so, I realize that my money was wasted. Ms. Cornwell is NOT a forensic scientist, as the jacket and reviews would have one believe. She worked in a forensic lab. Using that as a basis for schooling, I cannot wait until the janitor or plumber from the lab spews his solving of the infamous murders. She immediately starts the book off by stating that Sickert had sexual dysfunction. In no way does she prove this, its just her hunch. She then goes on a wild run about his art featuring death, etc. At the time he was an artist, an entire movement in the art world was rebelling against the Impressionists, though not one (Oscar Wilde included) was ever thought of as a murderer. This group actually studied death, murder and the like. Before you waste your money on this title, check into Patricia Cornwell's own history and her own involvement in the judicial system. Its good to know where an author spawns from."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't get ripped off!

Well, to close a case you need some proof. To put it simply, Cornwell has none. Beyond that simple fact, you should be aware that this book is rambling and poorly organized. Don't waste your time reading to the end thinking that Cornwell will finally come to the point and prove her case. She never presents one shred of meaningful evidence, not even with her dubious DNA testing. A total ripoff of a book. I can't imagine that she isn't being sued by someone representing the artist Walter Sickert, whom she accuses of being a serial killer."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON\\"T GET THIS BOOK","review":"This is an amateurishly written badly organized mess of a book. The author should either avoid non fiction or get a ghost writer. I don't know if the authors theory on the rippers identity is a good one or not as she made such a mess of presenting her facts. If she is correct hopefully someone will come along and do a better job of presenting the theory. I'm propably being overly harsh but this was a huge disappointment as I had high expectations of this book based on the authors reputation. If you must read this book get it from the library don't pay for it, it's not worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting but very unconvincing","review":"Patricia Cornwell tries hard to separate herself from the usual run of Ripper books. And, she has some interesting conclusions to offer: usage of DNA testing on possible Ripper letters and the introduction of a possible new bit of evidence with the guest book of an inn in Cornwall.However, none of it is all that convincing. Her DNA testing may show that Sickert actually wrote a hoax letter, but it's a long step from there to calling him Jack the Ripper. The watermark evidence is interesting, but not conclusive at all. Her art analysis shows that Sickert was interested in death, nothing more.Ultimately, there are a number of independent sources that place Sickert in France during September of that year, quite possibly including all of October.Much of this seems to be the case of someone picking a suspect and doing their best to prove he was the one, rather than reviewing all of the information available."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shameful and Farcical!","review":"ln its critique of this book, the NY Times pointed out that the author violated every principle of valid research in hersimplistic endeavor to \\"prove\\" her absurd theory.

Patricia Cornwell always does her research thoroughly on forensics and behavorial science, the FBI. She is very good at being accurate and a good story tellerIn Jack the Ripper Case Closed Cornwell is thorough. She takes modern day technology, science and evidence to reveal who Jack the Ripper really was. And in reading I find that she may have actually solved the case. But that is the problem with the book. Cornwell describes how she approached the case and reveals the true Ripper...but now you're still left with three quarters of a book to read.

Borrowed my sister's copy of this book. Not history, not fiction. Just pure exploitive, gratuitously gossipy character assassination. Cornwell is fortunate that Sickert has no living heirs to silence this destruction of an artist's reputation.No footnotes, a lot of opinion and little else to persuade the reader of Cornwell's illogical conclusion. And, even if Cornwell could convince her audience (and she doesn't) that Sickert authored the Ripper letters, it is still a huge deductive leap to assume that the author of the letters was the killer.I was also shocked to learn that Cornwell bought some of Sickert's paintings and destroyed them in the failed attempt to extract forensic evidence.Cornwell is not a scientist, art historian nor historian. She should stick with her brand of weakly written fiction.Do I have to give it even one star?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak, weak, weak","review":"Repetitive conjecture posing as fact does not make fact. I came into this book expecting to be fascinated and convinced. Sadly, I was very bored (which rarely happens to me with ANY book) and finished feeling Cornwell had made a very strong case that the individual she accuses of being Jack the Ripper most certainly IS NOT. Weak, convoluted writing; repetition after repetition of the very same \\"facts\\" in nearly every other page. Exhausting read that left me disappointed beyond compare. Worst book I have read in years."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Exercise in Self Absorbsion","review":"I found the author to be verbose. Too much of the book is information that only serves to fill pages with words. I found her research to be excellent, but her interpretation of this evidence takes one too many a leap of faith that is just not supported or justified. Time and again she says that she has no evidence to prove Sickert did certain things or was in certain places. She then turns and says she has no evidence to prove the opposite. When you base an entire book on the premise that it is impossible to prove a negative, you end up with the self absorbed clap trap that is the logic this author has produced in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"It won't hold my interest","review":"I am a person who HAS to finish a book once I start it. I am one third through this book and am considering putting it away. It is full of phrases like \\"he may have...but he may not have\\" in many MANY MANY different chapters and contexts. It is a long book of speculation with a few thought provoking clues here and there. Also it goes into a lot of information that has little to no relevence to Jack the Ripper. What in the world did the 4 pages refering to \\"the elephant man\\" have to do with anything?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't watch her on C-SPAN","review":"If you're a fan of Ms. Cornwell, whatever you do: DON'T watch her discussion of the book on Book TV. You will be embarrassed by a semi-literate know-it-all who sprinkles her sentences with \\"dese\\" and \\"dose\\". A loyal reader may be shocked that this writer has actually been able to compose sentences and create an interesting novel or two. Unbelievable."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Case Is Still Open","review":"Cornwell seems not to have read the large body of research done on Jack the Ripper. She proposes a case which hinges on the idea that many, maybe most, of the several hundred \\"Ripper\\" letters that were sent to the authorities were written by the real Ripper who was, in fact, Walter Sickert. She asserts that an artist could easily diguise his handwriting but offers no expert corroboration or proof. The touted DNA evidence is equally suspect. This is a disappointing book for anyone who has read anything about Jack the Ripper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Case not even close to closed","review":"Portrait of a killer is a poorly written book based on Patricia Cornwell's theory that Walter Sickert was the infamous killer, Jack the Ripper. I read the entire book waiting for the proof positive, but it never came.The so called evidence that Cornwell puts forward is nothing more than poorly drawn conclusions based on similarities in Sickert's use of certain phrases in his correspondence and that of the Ripper in his taunting of the police. She also makes much of Sickert's style and subjects in his paintings.This book was difficult to read because of its lack of a chronology of the murders, and because of its disjointed style.Based on this book and Cornwell's \\"evidence\\", Walter Sickert is the least likely suspect I've come across."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Bother Reading This Book","review":"Do not waste your money buying this book. Do not waste your time reading this book. A friend let me read her copy, but I could not finish it.As a scientist myself, I was appalled at the terrible psuedo-science in this book. The author has obviously never heard of \\"the scientific method\\" and \\"the null hypothesis\\". Instead, she sets out with the idea of proving that the killer is someone nobody else has considered and then interprets scant pieces of evidence that support her thesis as \\"proof\\" and ignores or brushes off any evidence to the contrary. There is so much speculation and so little real evidence that an intelligent reader will conclude that this book comes no closer to solving the ripper riddle than any of the other numerous books on this subject. Indeed, there are many more convincing books on the market."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cornwell's work is fiction, in my humble opinion.....","review":"Cornwell has written a fictional account of \\"Jack the Ripper\\"-it isn't even a \\"good read\\" in my opinion-yet she sells it as nonfiction. She provides no footnotes, et al.FACT: I wish I had my $$ back and Amazon had her book back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hideously off-track","review":"This is a book is more fiction than fact. It seems like she chose a suspect before she even did any research and then tries to piece together anything she could to try and point the finger at her target. A lot of her evidence is sketchy at best and completely wrong at worse. There has already been a program on tv that completely discredited alot of her supposed \\"evidence\\". Don't waste your time or money of this book unless you're looking for another fictional mystery book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The case is certainly not closed","review":"If this book reveals anything it is the grotesque hubris of Patricia Cornwell herself in giving her book such a ludicrous title. She had added nothing to the debate as to the identity of Jack the Ripper and has instead pushed her theory about Sickert, irrespective of the lack of real evidence. The author truly seems to believe that if she could prove that Sickert wrote the ripper letters, which she can not, then it would prove beyond a shadow of a doubt he actually committed the murders. The fact it has subsequently emerged that Sickert was almost certainly in France with his family the night of the double murder also makes her conclusion dubious in the extreme. I have never read any of Cornwell's fiction but I assume it must be somewhat more worthy than this drivel. A feeble effort and a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Was Forewarned","review":"Despite all of the negative reviews I wanted to read this book to find out for myself if it was really as bad as the critics have said. And.....it really was. I was most surprised that, for an accomplished writer, Patricia Cornwell wrote with such a lack of focus. It was as if she took a shotgun approach - blasting out clusters of speculations in hopes that some might randomly find the mark and stick as facts. The previous reviewers have all done a thorough job in delineating all of the non-facts and fallacies in her argument for fingering Walter Sickert as the infamous Jack the Ripper. No need to be redundant here.I did give \\"Portrait of a Killer\\" a generous two-star rating because a) I did finish the book, and b) it did contain a modicum of interest for me. However, in the end it was a totally unconvincing and unsatisfying read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Dull Reading","review":"I received this book as a Christmas present, and was very eager to read it. That enthusiasm began to fade with each passing page of this book. I have enjoyed reading this author's other works, but this was like watching paint dry. There is no suspense, and nothing in this book really grabs your attention. The evidence offered is, at most, inconclusive, and I don't think people need to read this book to realize that forensics in 19th century England was not as developed as it is today.In light of the content of the book, I find the title misleading. If you feel you must read this, get it from the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Much Information. Not Enough Substance","review":"Endless and tedious investigation of circumstancial evidence. I am convinced that Sickert may well be \\"Jack\\" but the case is not closed. Mostly I was irritated by the author's description of his paintings as evidence of his murderous personality, but without the corresponding illustrations, the basis escaped me. An okay historical perspective on the times of Jack the Ripper, an incomplete biography of Walter Sickert, a good but not complete attempt to convict him (the case is not closed). I only finished it because I kept hoping it would get better, but the last few chapters became even more rambling and disorienting."},{"rating":"1","title":"ANOTHER RIPPER MURDER!","review":"I belong to a book group, and this is our pick for June, Cornwell's Portrait of a Killer -- Case Closed. This is my first reading of any of Cornwell's books and will likely be my last. I did not find this book gave me any concrete evidence, but, lots of circumstantial evidence. I couldn't find any hard evidence to support her contention that WS was the Ripper. I suppose I expected something quite diffrent from a woman who is a forensic expert and should not jump to conclusions. Besides, who wants to know who the Ripper really was, not me. I prefer to keep on reading various books about Jack and drawing my own conclusion. I am going to London on June 1st and I will take in the Ripper Walks, the London Dungeon and Victorian London, I am sure I will enjoy this more then I did Cornwells book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not One Shred of Real Evidence","review":"Cornwell's attempt to name the person who was \\"Jack the Ripper\\" fails miserably. She does not have one shred of real evidence to back up her theory. My recommendation is that she stick to fiction. Oh, wait! That is what this book is!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dumb dumb dumb","review":"Cornwell claims she can 'prove' Sickert was the killer by comparing his handwriting with the Ripper letters, which are widely regarded as hoaxes. She also insists that to have painted his famous autopsy pictures Sickert 'must have viewed the body' as 'he never painted anything he didn't see.' Any casual student of his art is aware that Sickert painted from photographs throughout his career.Sickert experts have also refuted Ms Cornwells claims by providing extensive documentation proving Sickert was on vacation with his family in France when the Ripper killings were taking place in London.Cornwell should be ashamed of herself, as should anyone who concludes that Sickert was Jack the Ripper from the 'evidence' contained in this very poor, flimsy book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little organization, please","review":"I suppose that Ms. Cornwell's choice of who Jack the Ripper was is just as plausible as the other suspects (if not more so). However, I thought that the book was poorly put together. The book was just not that well put together. It just seemed as if the chapters were just arbitrarily put into the book. The ending about the events at Sickert's second wife's funeral had absolutely nothing to do with the book (unless Ms. Cornwell was trying to input some type of symbology into the end, which I didn't catch). Ms. Cornwell did do what she wanted to do in this book because I am sold on the idea that Sickert was Jack the Ripper, I just don't think that this book was very well written. I do think that Ms. Cornwell did the best she could by going over what little evidence that was left in a case that is over 100 years old, but reading this book makes me hope that her fiction books are better written than her attempt to write non-fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"save your money","review":"the early consensus is that this book is a lot of gibberish from a supremely arrogant, self-important charlatan; save your money and visit casebook.org for all the informations you would ever want on this subject. if you must waste your money on this, wait a few weeks until it's remaindered."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz","review":"This book was a Christmas present.

After the first few chapters in which Ms Cornwell attempts to make her case the book becomes a boring restatement of the premise. The book should have been no more than a 50 page magazine article. Ms. Cornwell should have saved the millions of dollars she spent on this project and donated it to something more worthy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Nonsense","review":"There is not a shred of evidence linking Sickert to these killings.

While the basic theory may be interesting, it is haphazard at best in this book and is not convincing at all. Just because Sickert painted scenes that could be construed as \\"Ripperish\\" does not mean he was there. Another poster has stated that artists paint what they are interested in..... This does not necessarily mean they were INVOLVED. While I did find the book to be a good read, I did not find it to be a good work of non-fiction--too much speculation and too many \\"What ifs\\" for that."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Ripper\\" not a \\"barnburner\\"\\"","review":"What's not to like? Murder fans' favorite unidentified serial killer and America's bestselling crime novelist together at last? Who could resist such a pairing! I read the much-anticipated latest from Patricia Cornwell with a great deal of disappointment. The style is tangential (or the organization of the material just escapes me); the evidence to support Sickert's guilt is compelling, but doesn't make for a good read, interspersed as it is with Ms. Cornwell's insistent speculation about his behavior and the meaning/connection of events. There is no tension in this book and, despite her success as a novelist, Ms. Cornwell is neither a forensic pathologist or a psychiatrist--how does she become such an expert on the evidence, then? And where is Kay Scarpetta when we need her most?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cornwell needed an editor with a big, sharp knife","review":"That letters written by Sickert and Jack the Ripper came from the same batch of stationery, and a batch of only 24 sheets, is Cornwell's best evidence--and pretty good evidence, at that. But you could easily miss that skimming through because nobody's going to read this book word for word. Do we really need every speculation that's ever crossed her mind about what a sicky Sickert is?I guess she couldn't get permission to reproduce the paintings of mutilated women which support her argument. Instead we get several photos of Sickert which \\"show his many faces\\"--Not. Frankly, he looks intelligent and kindly and not a bulgy-eyed maniac like, say, Ted Bundy.My suggestion for further research: get Don Foster to do a professional comparison of Sickert's and Jack the Ripper's language and publish an article about it rather than a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unconvincing, poorly edited, dull, confusing......","review":"What was Cornwell thinking? She might really have something with her Sickert theory but the organization of the information in this book is so poor, I really can't tell.

This thesis would have garnered an \\"F\\" in my class."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do your research before you accept this as truth","review":"Patricia Cornwell should stick to fiction as legitimate historical scholarship defeats her, her matter of fact claims are based on opinion not tangible evidence.

Sure, she has a fairly impressive pile of circumstantial evidence, but none of it, by itself, is at all convincing. She goes out on several limbs (the rather benign guest book at the end, which is owned by Cornwell. How's that for conflict of interest!), and leaves Sickert dangling from a noose she so eagerly wants him to fill. Some of the \\"evidence\\" is so speculative, her case would have been stronger if she left it out. The book takes the form of Cornwell playing prosecutor, agressively cross-examing a witness who is not alive to respond. In addition, the book is so poorly organized and so full of digressions that it is difficult to read. On the other hand, her descriptions of the East End of London, while derivative of other works, are well done, informative, and compelling."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISAPPOINTING!","review":"I generally enjoy Cornwell's Scarpetta novels, finding them well-researched and intriguing. I also enjoy historical discussions of the Jack the Ripper murders and his possible identities. I found this book to be completely unorganized and poorly written.

I shut the book believing that Sikert was indeed a disturbed individual, but unconvinced that he was beyond a doubt Jack the Ripper."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Ripper Remains At Large","review":"I divide my personal library into three categories: fiction, biography and history. Having just finished Patricia Cromwell's Portrait of a Killer - Jack the Ripper Case Closed,I tucked it away in its proper section - fiction.You may want to purchase this book if you have a morbid interest in forensic science or a very casual curosity about street life in late 19th century London. But a serious study of the \\"Ripper Crimes\\" it is not. Conjecture, speculation, unfounded conclusions and wild flights of fantasy characterize this work of fiction that takes a misplaced stab at solving an historically significant series of crimes.Jack the Ripper's true identify remains at large."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did anyone edit this book?","review":"As I read this book, I just kept wondering if anyone edited this book. And if so, has he or she ever heard that a narrative should have a certain flow and cohesiveness?

Needless to say, I was not impressed."},{"rating":"1","title":"A one star book only.","review":"So many assumptions, from such little factual basis, made this book a very difficult read. I expected much more . A very disappointing book that, sadly, I cannot recommend.

Her continual statements such as \\"I see no reason why Sickert wouldn't have been there. . .\\" get extremely tedious and increasingly unconvincing. She can't prove Sickert was in Whitechapel by failing to find him elsewhere. She can't prove he wrote the Ripper letters just because he was a talented artist who could have written in many different styles.

As the CASEBOOK website on the ripper crimes argues, there is much wrong with Cornwell's evidence and her use of it. For example, she ignores evidence that her suspect Sickert was in France during the commission of several ripper crimes. She also provides absolutely no evidence that Sickert had violent tendencies or ever had any residence or spent any time in the area of the killings. Her emphasis on the ripper letters is largely useless, since there is no way to determine their authenticity.The preimier book on the ripper is Philip Sugden's THE COMPLETE HISTORY OF JACK THE RIPPER.

It is really THE book to read on the ripper case."},{"rating":"1","title":"willfully naive","review":"Michael Crichton said he became a novelist after being a doctor because he would imagine--incorrectly--all these extreme things that were wrong with his patients. He realized his imagination would be better put to use writing novels, since he had too much a flight of fancy for the objective life of a doctor.

I have never been so disgusted with a book in my life. Both Cornwell's writing and her \\"evidence\\" are just embarrassing. All this book proves is that her ego has far surpassed her talent. The majority of her \\"evidence\\" consists of: \\"There's no reason to suspect he wasn't in London that night,\\" or \\"he might possibly have walked home this way.\\" Her so-called forensic evidence (DNA and handwriting) are inconclusive and less than convincing.

She is not a forensic expert, not a psychologist specializing in abnormal or clinical pathological behavior, not a specialist of brain dysfunction, and not a historian, yet makes claims to all of the above in her audacious statement of having \\"solved\\" a hundred plus year old historic event. She handles history clumisly, ignoring context (e.g. suggesting fear of blood-borne pathogens, hardly a concern for the Victorian age), gives misleading neurologic information (cites frontal lobe deficit as tantamount to homicidal profile), and uses terms like \\"psychopath\\", couched in psychiatric jargon that is no longer current. What we have here is speculation, albeit interesting, with very little actual evidence. She is afterall a fiction writer. Perhaps she should stick to that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Interesting Revelations","review":"For what can be described as one of the \\"coldest cases\\" known, as far as evidence is concerned, Cornwell makes a compelling case. I read this book in four days, and could barely put it down. Some previous reviewers have made comments regarding the use of profiling in this book. Profiling has, on the whole, been a very useful tool in solving crimes. Roy Hazelwood and John Douglas are experts in the field and have been instrumental in solving some of the most violent and shocking crimes of our lifetime. The extensive research, thoughtfulness, background information and care put into this work shines through on every page.

When you write a story that really happened you don't compare what would happened if that story would be in our days.I wrote a book of the story of Cleopatra and I wrote my novel in the Antarctica, but I never made any comparison if Cleopatra were alive today, you just can't do that.I put 2 stars to this book because I just can't put one star to a book.But at the end you really think that Patricia Cornwell knows who was Jack the Ripper?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad logic...","review":"Although Ms. Cornwell does provide much of the common data used by modern \\"Ripperologists\\" and provides a handful of new propositions, the book is fragmented and redundant in tone. Huge liberties are taken in her deductions and square pegs are forced into round holes more violently than the Ripper dealt deathblows. I imagine the only reason this book was released was to offset the losses she occurred in her obsessive and extravagant research of the case. IN SHORT: I would not recommend this as a Ripper primer, but only if you are interested in the greater span of Ripper theories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Little Substance, Much Inuendo","review":"Cornwell presents absolutely no facts for her case. Moreover, she reveals an overall lack of knowledge about the case; not suprising since before she started the book she admitted she knew hardly anything about the Ripper murders.Instead of presenting facts, Cornwell shamelessly maligns a great artist with her blind, baseless assumptions. At best, she might have a case for Sickert having written a few hoax letters, but there were thousands of such hoax letters and absolutely none of them have ever been successfully tied to the killer.I think Cornwell should stick to writing fiction, for she certainly is no journalist and doesn't seem to understand the difference between investigative reporting and stroy telling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Use it as a reference book, not a novel","review":"Patricia Cornwell's attempt to pinpoint Jack the Ripper is presented in this novel. However, this account is somewhat presented as a reference novel; that is, this book goes through historical material and heresay.What \\"Portrait of a Killer\\" is not is a historical fiction novel that takes you through the events as if it is 1888 and you are able to see Scotland Yard unfold with Sickert as Jack the Ripper.

However, upon conclusion of the last page, I was still asking the question, \\"Who Dunnit?\\"As a few other reviewers have already noted, Ms. Cornwell bombards the reader with a more circumstantial \\"evidence\\" like similar handwriting and watermarks used by Sickert, and an overabundance of verbiage. The closest she comes to any type of proof is a few traces of mitochondrial DNA on an envelope which does not even lead back to Sickert himself. She seems to spend most of her time with quotes such as \\"Sickert most likely was here...\\" or \\"Chances are Walter Sickert used the same...\\". It appears she felt more of a need to prove to us her knowledge of foresnics rather than prove the case."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cornwell the Ripper","review":"Ms. Cornwell rips apart Walter Sickert's reputation in an attempt to sell a book about Jack the Ripper. The only things that is made entirely clear in this book is that Ms. Cornwell really hates a dead artist named Walter Sickert and she has no proof that Sickert was Jack the Ripper. Apparently, it is not that difficult to pin a series of crimes on a dead man when one uses unreliable evidence.Ms. Cornwell does offer some interesting circumstantial evidence which makes me wish I could hear Sickert's side of the story. Or that there were any information about his location at the time of any of the crimes of which she accuses him. Or she had anything other than evidence that he may have written some letters signing them as Jack the Ripper.I hope she plans to return to righting full out fiction like the Scarpetta books and stays out of the historical fiction realm where she trys to be her character Kay Scarpetta."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"I got a headache before the first fifty pages.By the ,,,, next ten I know I was wasting my timeI hope you find much better Books to buy and read"},{"rating":"1","title":"Case Closed?

However, this book is so poorly written and so completely unorganized that it takes away from the incredible research and the exclusive story. The editor within me wanted to take this material and organize, re-write and give it some continuity and congruence.

For example, a murder would happen on September 1, years would pass, and then we were back to another murder that happened around the time of murder one. I like things to go in chronological order. Call me crazy, but my brain works better when things are laid out in proper order.Kudos on the great detective work, but the lack of organization made the book a pain in the butt to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truthful...Case Closed!","review":"Oh, please. I detest armchair critics, amateurs who purport to know more than the author of a well researched, and well written book. Ignore such wannabes, and read this book. Ms. Cornwell's expert, investigative, and convincing expose on Mr. Ripper, is one of THE MOST exhaustive of the many books on the subject. The problem is, people have such entrenched notions, and narrow minds when it comes to new information that might possibly render their \\"knowledge\\" obsolete. So, they write negative reviews like the ones above. They are wrong. Yes, this book may challenge every preconceived idea you have had about the killer, but truth doesn't really ask anyone's opinion. It is what it is, and this book is worth considering truthful. A job well done, Ms. Cornwell. Jack the Ripper would be proud."},{"rating":"1","title":"Case Closed?","review":"Cornwell has uncovered some suggestive but far from definitive evidence, which leads her to conclude that the artist Walter Sickert was responsible for the Jack the Ripper murders, as well as others never ascribed to the Ripper. Her approach is inflated and highly speculative--lots of \\"would have-could have-must have\\"--and rests to a surprising degree on pseudo-Freudian \\"profiling\\" of Sickert. Illustrations that compare known drawings of Sickert's to Ripper letters are interesting, but also be prepared for some gory and (I think) gratuitous crime scene and autopsy photographs. The book was a disappointment, and I returned it to Amazon less than 24 hours after its arrival."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful book, but far too conclusory","review":"A little too conclusory for my taste. Shouldn't have titled it \\"case closed\\", but a wonderful book nonetheless that poses very interesting theories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong fact from chapter 2","review":"Despite Cornwell's claim on page 22 that she actually went there, any map shows that there is no frontier whatsoever between Argentina and Peru.As for the rest of the book, I only hope that her account of events that took place more than a century ago are more thoroughly researched than her notions of 20th and 21st century geography..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read! Could not put it down!","review":"I read this after returning from London where I had taken a \\"Ripper Tour\\" one night. The guide dismissed Ms. Cornwell's conclusions but I disagree. Ms. Cornwell has made the best case for the Ripper I have seen. She offers a lot of evidence but I was still left wanting more. It does not offer an iron clad conclusion but if I were on the jury, I would vote to convict."},{"rating":"1","title":"Case Closed - NOT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I am sorry, this is nothing but sensationalism. Cornwell is being manuplitive, cashing in on the Jack the Ripper interest to push her books. It makes nice fiction, but she is off target in labelling Walter Sickert as the Ripper and borders on foolishness in saying case closed and Sickert was Jack.If anyone bothered to see the BBC interview or read Stephen Knight's Book, you would have learned Sickert was involved in the whole mess, but she totally missed the point. Sickert was a player, a user, possibly a blackmailer - and conceivably was pointing out the targets as \\"Jack\\" hunted for Mary Kelly.But to claim 'case closed'....that is as false a claim as Sickert was the Ripper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Is it possible to solve a murder 100+ years after the fact?","review":"Cornwell does an amazing job of research and applying modern technique to this case. The possibility is very probable that this man could very well have been Jack the Ripper.The reality is, we will never know. For true Ripper enthusiasts, I think half the intrigue is not knowing.I think the book was a little chaotic and unorganized. Her theories are amazing and well thought out. I could not put the book down. It is a great read, however, I don't think the case will ever be closed."},{"rating":"1","title":"A complete wate of time and paper","review":"I bought this book 2-3 months ago in an airport. It has taken me this long to finish it, because I kept putting it down in disgust. I kept coming back to it assuming that it wouldn't be a best seller if it didn't have some good qualities....I was wrong.I have never reviewed an item at Amazon before, but this is such a shoddy piece of journalistic trash, that if I can save someone some money, then it is worth the time and energy.Cornwell does a terrible job of presenting any kind of case. Her \\"suspect\\" may have been a terrible person, but there is no evidence in here at all. If someone has the time and energy to go through and and count up all of the times \\"maybe and possibly\\" show up inthis book....you'd get some sense of how poorly this was investigated.Bottom line, skip this book at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Case Closed or Fabricated?","review":"First, let's just say Cornwell needs to stick with fiction. After reading this farce I believe a novel would have been more appropriate considering the abundance of speculation and juggling of the facts. To say the least I was disappointed. From claiming Sickert's artwork gives clues and mirrors the murder scenes is just one leap of fantasy used. I really don't want to state all the issues I have here, just know that if you want revelations about the case you won't find them in this charade."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intriguing","review":"Loved it.

It was SOOOOOOO boring and slow and repetitive that I found myself having to go back and re-read passages I had just read because my mind wandered off. I finally had to throw in the towel when I reached my 100-page limit on a book. If I am not hooked by the first 100 pages - or at least somewhat interested! - I give it up and go on to the next.

Based on her presentation, the case is not closed! She offers many circumstantial bits and pieces, but is far from proving her case. I am surprised that she would weaken her reputation for careful work by releasing this volume and even more surprised that a publisher would print it. While offering some interesting insights into police work and crime during the era of Jack the Ripper, and while possibly eliminating one or two of the traditional suspects, this work fails to convince and had her \\"evidence\\" been presented at trial, I suspect he would have gone free.

I also found the book to have to much irrelevant information. However, I did find the book interesting but I am not convinced that Walter Sickert was Jack the Ripper. I have read other Jack the Ripper books which in my opinion were much more conviencing.I anxiously await the release of BLOW FLY in October and remain a huge Patricia Cornwell fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper -- Case Closed","review":"While I don't disagree with Cornwell's assessment that Walter Sickert could have been Jack the Ripper, I found the book a very disappointing read. From her Scarpetta novels, I expected a tightly wrapped story. Instead I felt she was all over the place -- her personal struggle with the material, as ourlined in her conversation with her editor in the 1st chapter, added nothing to the story in my opinion. Her constant harping on what would be done today in an investigation did not add to the original thesis of the book -- to prove that Sickert was the killer -- and was distracting. Her laundry list of unsolved murders post 1888 was reptetitive and redudant."},{"rating":"1","title":"But is it true?","review":"I found the book interesting reading, but not powerful science as the other reviews would indicate.

I too re-sold my book, which is something I have never done with a brand new book before. Sure I lost money, but I also lost several hours reading!! I've enjoyed the author's fictional books and couldn't wait to read this one. How disappointing! Disjointed, full of conjecture, information notated under photos that was never mentioned in the text, with a totally lousy ending that kind of petered off. The book felt unfinished, like that of a pre-teen writer who had to turn in a book report on Monday morning and wasn't quite done. (I've been there, so it was easy to recognize.) I was unfamiliar with Walter Sickert and would have really appreciated seeing at least one picture of his work to realize what a talented artist he was and why he was famous. Maybe he was Jack the Ripper, but Patricia Cornwell's argument was absolutely unconvincing. I think she's damaged her reputation with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"IMPOTENT FURY!","review":"\\"I knew the identity of a murderer and couldn't possibly avert my gaze\\" so states Cornwell. Give me a break. Enough people have spent their time defending Sickert now, so I won't take up the space. Though he could be a suspect... The Jack the Ripper cases will most likely never be solved. Some people kinda' want it that way.This is a good book for its documentation of the killings. Its also good for its in depth, yet ungrounded Sickert accusations; such as him having had a fistula. Pure speculation. I don't know if that would really be enough to drive a man to mutilate... but it doubtlessly would drive a person mad with \\"impotent fury\\"! And other phrases that will leave you giggling."},{"rating":"1","title":"interesting theory, but........","review":"I'm an amateur ripper-ologist and am interested in who everyone thought did it, so I picked up Patricia's book at the local library. I was sadly disappointed. Patricia is an excellent writer, I'll give her that, but the way she put this book together made me think, \\"HUH?\\" She says, \\"Here's who did it,\\" and that's about it. She had a theory and nicely fit all the facts around it, which is the WORST case of detecting I've ever seen. Every good detective, professional or amateur, knows that you never fit the facts to fit your theory. She doesn't even explain how she came to figure out Sickert was Jack. She just says, \\"He is, and here's why.\\" I've read other books that gave just as compelling arguments for other suspects, but at least they explain why they believe their choices are right.Ah well, can't wait to get to heaven and find out who the real Jack the Ripper was. Believe me, it's the only way ANYONE's going to find out for sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow read","review":"I found this to be a hard read.

Most of it was speculative at best with little or no hard evidence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did she really put genuine effort into this?","review":"With such piercing logic along the lines of \\"I can't find any evidence he was there, so that proves he did it\\", is it any wonder I have no desire to read any of her other books?"},{"rating":"1","title":"portrait of a killer, jack the ripper case closed","review":"By far the worst book Patricia Cornwell has written. Instead of a compelling story, this one is fragmented and a real chore to read. The font is so tiny that it is hard to read. I love all her books except this one. Her Sarpetta series are hard to put down, this one I cant wait to put down, in fact I may not finish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"No, the Case is NOT Closed","review":"Just because Patricia Cornwall spent a lot of her own money investigating Walter Sickert, does not mean that Walter Sickert was Jack the Ripper. I got sick of her writing style, especially when she told the reader NUMEROUS times that you can't get DNA from ashes (Sickert was cremated). Okay, I think we get it, once was enough. I didn't see any conclusive proof presented. She would say things such as, \\"There was no evidence that Sickert was in town the night of this murder, but there's no evidence that he wasn't either.\\" Well, that certainly narrows it down. He must be The Ripper!A long-winded waste of time. Can't recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Case Closed? -- Hardly!!!","review":"This was by far one of the most disappointing books I have ever read. With all the publicity and build-up going around about this book, I was eagerly looking forward to reading it. What a let down! This case is closed ONLY if you buy into theories and circumstantial evidence. The author presented not one bit of hard evidence to support her contention of who the Ripper was. Her book is full of innuendos and possibilities: He could have done this... He was in the habit of doing this... He would most certainly have known this... and so on and so on and so on. I kept reading because I kept waiting for a payoff that never came. Don't waste your time on this one!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cornwell steals from Steven Knight","review":"Stephen Knight first formulated the Walter Sickert connexion to the Jack the Ripper slayings in Knight's book \\"Jack the Ripper: the Final Solution.\\" It's nothing new.

It's dishonest."},{"rating":"1","title":"I love me, who do you love?","review":"This book is an arrogant, self-indulgent, ego trip from title (Case Closed??? Not by a long shot) right through to the final page. Even the dedication comes off as insulting. \\"You would have caught him\\"...if what? He had been as good as you are? Oh, please!I think that her theory would have held much more credibility had she arrived at Sickert as a suspect from the evidence, as opposed to presenting the evidence only as it related to Sickert. And even with her I'm-right-because-I-say-so investigation, she still couldn't make a case that a first year law student wouldn't blow out of the water.Ms. Cornwell writes excellent fiction. That is a world that she can control right from the beginning. But it seems that Investigative Journalism isn't what she is cut out to do. Things don't always fall into place quite the way you may want them to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Case Still Open","review":"After expending a great deal of ink and, reportedly, a large amount of cash, Patricia Cornwell has succeeded in proving that some of the hoax letters purportedly written to the authorities by Jack the Ripper MAY have originated with the painter Walter Sickert. Hardly an earth-shaking discovery...hardly worth writing another book about. (Sickert was previously identified as a suspect by Stephen Knight in 1976 and by Jean Overton Fuller in 1990.) Absolutely no new evidence linking Sickert to the murders is presented. Ms Cromwell would have been better advised to save her money and our time."},{"rating":"1","title":"So much speculation.","review":"Wow, this is so weird and - I'll hand her that - imaginative. If I will ever commit a crime I'd want her to prosecute me - that would make a jail-free card.

She might have even had the real Jack the Ripper and messed things up by jumping to different conclusions that are irrelevant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Portrait of an idiot!","review":"I really have enjoyed nearly all of Cornwell's fiction. I have admired the versimilitude of her work and respected her as a former coroner in Virginia. I have even enjoyed some of her non-fiction as well--\\"Recipes to Die For\\" is a hoot and I have enjoyed using her mandatory literary cookbook.Portrait of a Killer, on the other hand, is a sad effort. If you enjoy sophistries, non sequitors, logical fallacies, and a myriad of assorted inanities then this is the book for you. I found this one of the most annoying books I have ever read.She spent a lot of money producing this book and seems to have gotten caught up in the process. Poor Walter Sickert and his descendents! I hope that the family successfully sues Cornwell.One piece of advice: Don't Bother!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull and a Boring","review":"I can only get through 3-5 pages before my eyelids get heavy. This book lacks organization. Each chapter jumps from one topic to one another. If Cornwell is trying to confirm Jack the Ripper's true identity, the organization of her case is haphazardedly done. I think I will use the pages to start fires in my fireplace."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not all that convincing","review":"When I picked this book up I thought that it would be fascinating, if a tad morbid, to learn a bit about the Ripper murders. After slogging through Cornwell's book however all I feel is certain is that there isn't actually much left to know. Little to no evidence is left to examine, police reports and other key papers have long since disappeared, and forensic examination performed by the doctors and policeman was woefully insufficient to build any kind of case against a suspect. Yet Cornwell persists in arguing that Walter Sickert, a painter and student of Whistler, was the true identity of Jack the Ripper. She sounds definite in her opinion, but I fail to see how such specious reasoning could convince anyone else. All in all 'Portrait of a Killer' is an unsatisfying read. The reader comes away with scant information about the killings other than that it was a forensic nightmare, and no more of an idea who Jack the Ripper was than they had when they began the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"choice of suspect is suspect","review":"I was really curious about this book. I have had a moderate interest in the Ripper case for a long time. I have to be honest, I was disappointed with this book. It feels to me like her choice for the killer was predisposed, and she tilted the evidence to support this.I also think that if you are going to take the time to research a subject and write a book of this size, it would be better to site the sources as you show the evidence, not just list sources at the end.I think Ms Cornwell should stick to fiction, which is what this feels like to me.If you want a better book on the subject, read From Hell. At least the authors of that don't make the claim to have the only answer, and they wrote something entertaining, not dry and boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor - at best.","review":"A poorly written account of an interesting subject. The editor should be ashamed at letting this one go to the presses.All of the \\"evidence\\" is circumstantial at best - and more precisely; ridiculous.

After reading it, I understand -- it was probably intended as a sort of \\"apology\\" to her readers.This book desperately needed editorial intervention. It is incredibly disorganized and meandering. Cornwell starts on one area of evidence and then suddenly drops it, veering off to a new topic. Then chapters later she may raise the same item of evidence again. There are no transitions and the whole thing is confusing as heck.Her overall argument is not convincing. It is particularly hard to believe that all of the Ripper letters were written by one hand. Her analysis of artwork is just plain laughable.Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cornwell does injustice to her subject","review":"Cornwell's book, as can be seen by a quick look at the posted reviews,has done a sloppy job of examining the Jack the Ripper case. Those in search of better and more imaginative work on the Ripper case should look to From Hell by Alan Moore and The Complete Jack the Ripper by Donald Rumblelow. Moore's From Hell shows a much deeper insight into the English culture surrounding the Ripper slayings and Rumblelow's book has a much better collection of reliable facts. Cornwell would've done better to have written another cookbook; it would've cost her less money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly reasoned, poorly written","review":"Cornwell's attempt to prove painter Walter Sickert was Jack the Ripper left me not only unconvinced, but confused. Her book is full of irrelevant digressions and unfounded assumptions. A good editor should have helped Cornwell better focus her ideas. (Perhaps an editor tried, and Cornwell's baffling book is the result.)Cornwll flits from one subject to another every few pages, rarely stating a hypothesis, offering supporting evidence and reaching a conclusion. She offers far too many \\"could haves\\" and ignores or dismisses any evidence that doesn't support her ideas.Writers far better than I (Stephen P.

I read the excerpt in Vanity Fair and found it less than compelling but I was certain the actual book would be better. It was not. Cornwell does not prove her case scientifically as I had hoped. She does create a strong circumstantial case. Her writing is cloudy and she harps on the same points too many times--almost to the point of making them ludicrous in the reader's eyes.This book will certainly be a disappointment for Cornwell fans. It also will not do much for Ripper scholars. I would check it out at the library but not purchase a copy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzz!","review":"I admire the intrepid readers who were able to slog through this tedious book long enough to form a conclusion as to whether Sickert was or was not Jack the Ripper.

Although Ms. Cornwell's prose is well-written, the ideas in this book jump around in a very distracting manner. Just when she is developing one idea or factual scenario, she will go off on a tangent and either not finish the first idea or come back to it so much later that the reader has forgotten where he was. It's as if the whole book were written as an initial draft and any ideas that popped into her head (\\"that reminds me\\") were added right then and there.I thought her premise and much of her evidence were quite interesting, and I learned a great deal about the Ripper cases, which I have always found fascinating.

The facts were all there to believe entirely that Walter Sickert, the supposed \\"Jack,\\" murdered these 19th century English prostitutes. However, the book doesn't allow much room for making an educated guess on who the murderer is. The book is somewhat biased in that sense, but the author was able to back up any assumptions with clear, logical evidence.The book is an enticing, titillating thriller, but unlike other murder mystery stories, this one is entirely fact, thus increasing the excitement of the reading process. The gruesome pictures of the four dead women, as well as Sickert and his family, could make a statue bend over in queasiness. The detail of the women's sufferings are graphic, but to a point that makes you feel for them but not pity them. It is a great book and especially good for fans of notorious murderers and the crimes they committed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ok...so the case isn't closed","review":"Even Patricia Cornwell admits that the case isn't closed when it comes to Jack the Ripper but she does come up with some hard and convincing evidence that Walter Sickert could have been Jack the Ripper.

I have to say, however, that I don't believe she really makes her case. She uses bits and pieces of data to support her theory and dismisses others out of hand when they don't suit her needs.

It offers little more than an ego trip, with occasional salacious details, often unrelated, to keep the average reader titillated. She offers little of substance to prove her case.

To give an example she shows a drawing by her suspect Sickert entitled \\"He killed his father,\\" and states that the \\"wooden bed\\" in the drawing is the same as that in the photo of the Ripper's victim Mary Kelly..... Well duhhhh.. as if wooden beds were rare in the Victorian age! To top it off when one looks at the bed in the drawing, and the bed in the photo you will see that there is NO similarity between the two at all!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ummm....Case Still Open","review":"Are you obsessively interested in the life, work and anatomy of Walter Sickert? If so, this is the book for you. Chock full of psychobabble, purest conjecture and self-congratulation, this analysis of a possible candidate for Jack the Ripper manages to make perhaps the most famous series of brutal unsolved crimes in history positively soporific.If you're interested in Jack the Ripper, there are lots of very good books actually about the killings, the investigation and the many possible suspects. Go pick one of them instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who do you think you're kidding?","review":"Until now I've been a big fan of Patricia Cornwell and her Kay Scarpetta novels - but this book is [not good]. The only reason I read it through to the bitter end was to see if it could really get any worse - and it did. I have never come across so many examples of \\"may have\\", \\"possibly\\", \\"perhaps\\", \\"could have\\", \\"no reason why not\\" in a single book and, on this showing, I would hate to be on the receiving end of Patricia Cornwell's notion of \\"conclusive evidence\\"! However, more than the fact that the book is entirely unconvincing, it's extremely badly written and put together. In places it seems almost thrown together at random. In short, it's one of the worst books I've ever read: a complete waste of time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disjointed, disgusting, and disdainful.","review":"This dismal tome is the worst book I have ever had the displeasure of reading. So disenchanted have I become with Ms. Cornwell through reading her disputatious novel regarding the dismasting of some disordered artist that I will likely never again read her disposable crime fiction. Most reviewers have noted the disorganized and repetitive nature of the book as well as the arrogant voice of the author. But as difficult as these significant barriers to crafting a readable book may be, worse is her overuse of disturbing violent, sexual and medical imagery which Cornwell evidently thinks can substitute for a compelling argument. A discerning reader will pass on this disagreeable little work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book Review Jack the Ripper Case Closed","review":"I'll make this short and to the point. Cornwell needs to stick to fiction because this is the worst book of her's I have ever read.

I wont buy her books again for sure!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Speculative and disappointing","review":"I love Patricia Cornwall's \\"Kay Scarpetta\\" mysteries...they are well written and entertaining fare. I was so overwhelmingly disappointed with her \\"Isle of Dogs,\\" as a departure that I decided to give her Jack the Ripper foray a read. I found it rather dull and, more strikingly, short on fact and rife with conjecture. That's no way for a criminalist to report!Most of the 350+ pages are spent with \\"what if's\\" and extranneous fodder on modern CSI. She does not make a solid case against artists Sickert.The Ripper slayings remain fascinating and, as many believe unlike Cornwall, unsolved."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad","review":"Can anyone say \\"redundant?\\" Do publishers no longer employ editors?

While the title promised that the Jack the Ripper is now \\"case closed\\" the \\"evidence\\" presented in this book is hardly convincing. Perhaps worth reading if you are interested in a description of the Ripper murders or to get a sense of what life was like for the poorer classes in London in the 1880's."},{"rating":"2","title":"The more I read, the more I agree","review":"The first half of this book was difficult to get through. It was like reading a college textbook. But, once the scene was set, and the characters were introduced, the pace picked up to the point where it read like fiction. I'm sure some people would say it IS fiction. As I read this book, I thought the author was really making leaps of faith to prove her point. But, as the book moved on, I couldn't help but agree with her conclusion. There is just too much evidence (circumstantial or not) to disagree with Cornwell. All right, maybe it wouldn't fly in court, as OJ learned, but I think Sickert did it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Case closed...Indeed!","review":"Ms. Cornwell's enthusiasm for detail, whether fictional or non fictional, is readable and almost poetic.

She convinced me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Read","review":"To start with, this book is very good. It tells you who, when, and where the whole time. Cornwell always let you know what she was thinking and wrote her side of the story and never left anything out. If she was unsure, she would say she was. She never led me down the wrong track. I'm a big fan of her and so is my mother.This book had it all. The only reason I didn't give it a perfect 5 stars is because she sometimes started talking in so much detail about something that I felt like I was in school again. It was a good read. I would suggest this book to adults, not children."},{"rating":"1","title":"PortraitOf a theory.BringSickertBackSoHeCanSueForLibel","review":"I read the book and thought it was quite convincing... until I later listened to the book on tape. She does take a methodical and forensic approach to the subject, as I have read in no other.For those who read the book and were convinced, do us a favor listen to it unabridged in tape/CD. Listen to it as if you were a juror in a modern day courtroom. It was then that I started noticing the leaps she takes from forensic theory to actual application to the man Sickert.I give it 2 stars because it is a theory as other investigations of it are theory and entertaining at the time. However ALL other theories, such as the one proposed in the \\"From Hell\\" graphic novel and movie (which is based on someone else's theory, i forget who) should not be viewed as superior because they are just that, theories.One is just as plausible and/or implausible as the other."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jack the Rippper","review":"I was unhappy with this effort from Patricia Cornwell.

Also a big fan of any real crime writing or program, I was THRILLED to see that Cornwell was tackling Jack the Ripper (I had read a couple of things about the case before, including the hoax diary). Unfortunately, this book has done nothing but long for better Scarpetta days. The evidence she provides, while sometimes interesting, is somewhat absurd at times. There are awkward and forced connections made throughout. I had to force myself to complete the entire book. Even the writing style and organization of the book was lacking. If you are looking for a book measuring up to Cornwell's normal standards, or a great and conclusive book about Jack the Ripper, THIS IS NOT FOR YOU. Keep on searching."},{"rating":"1","title":"First and last time.","review":"I've read many of the reviews already posted here, and there isn't much more I can add. This is the first Cornwell book I have read, and it will likely be the last. As a former police officer, I was always told to be careful \\"not to make the evidence fit the suspect\\". Cornwell seems to draw as much from her imagination as from the facts. Did she research other suspects as thoroughly as Sickert or did she mold her evidence to suit her literary needs? I found the book poorly written and badly edited.I'm glad I waited to borrow it from the library and did not spend money on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I have no respect for Particia Cornwell","review":"Firstly the case is not closed, she merely provides a hole filled theory. I lost all respect for her when she was interviewed regarding people refuting her claims. She repiled that people did not aggree with her because \\"I am a woman and an American\\". Grow up, how embarrasingly sad. Just write, don't talk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many \\"maybes\\"","review":"While the Walter Sickert theory presented in this book does seem quite sound, Patricia Cornwell seems not to have known where she was going with the story. Halfway between a crime novel and an exposé, she presents some valid facts to support the theory, but returns much to often to pure speculation. Maybe he was at the funeral, maybe not. Maybe he spoke to her, maybe not. In a book like this, the point is not to speculate and imagine, but to give concrete answers. Why call it \\"case closed\\" if there's still so much that's unclear?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Can Writers Write?","review":"Given that she is a successful novelist, one might think that Patricia Cornwell would have a clue as to how to organize her arguments into a cohesive whole. However, \\"truth\\" must be harder than fiction, as this book rambles about without any rhyme or reason. It's hard to see why she even divided it into chapters, as each one contains a multitude of thoughts, facts, and surmises on a number of Ripper-related subjects, without ever making a specific point or building on previously made points to bolster her current argument. Does she prove her case? Well, she presents some interesting information, but never proves anything other than she is a better novelist than a writer of non-fiction. Was Walter Sickert the Ripper?Let's just say that the case is still open."},{"rating":"1","title":"Case Closed-- leaves much to desire","review":"I bought this book thinking it would be the ultimate read but unfortunately been unable to finish it becuase I keep falling asleep. I had never purchased a book from this author but was familiar with her reputation as a good writer. Unfortunately, that's all it is. The book reads like an instruction manual and the author skips from the present to the past without giving the reader any transition information. The vocabulary can get a bit tricky at times (u might need to get a dictionary at times if you are not a lawyer or in the criminal justice field) and it just reads poorly. I found it to be boring, not what you would expect from Patricia or a book about Jack the Ripper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Case Closed? I Don't Think So.","review":"What a huge disappointment. Even after reading this book, I don't know how Cornwell can say, with confidence that Walter Sickert was Jack the Ripper. I've never read a Jack The Ripper book but I have seen a few documentaries on TV and I'm not convinced at all with Cornwell's conclusion. I think that when she wrote this book, she did so with blinders on. It seems that she was so focused on Sickert that there could be no other possibilities. I don't know that the Ripper identity will ever be solved, and it surely hasn't been with this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull","review":"I have listened to a lot of Patricia Cornwells books.I could not believed she wrote this one. I have theunabridged version and I was never so disappointed ina book. There have been other books that I didn't carefor but this one drags out to much and is borning.I know a lot about watermarks on paper or handwriting thatI don't think I need to know. Everytime I changed thecassett, I kept thinking it had to get better, but itdidn't. She jumped around so much it was hard to keepup with who she was talking about. I belive the painter is probably the killer. I have read several books on Jackthe Ripper and most of them at least kept my interest,not this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Case Not Closed","review":"All this book did was convince me that Walter Sickert was a creepy guy. There is no evidence that concretely links Sickert to the Ripper murders. It's a pretty heavy blame to lay on someone without anything more than circumstantial evidence."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is all over the place","review":"I just finished reading this book, and while there were some interesting points, it was difficult to read. The author is all over the place in this book. She jumps around in time and the events are hard to follow. Many things described in the book seem to have no relevance to the story. I can't say that she convinced me or didn't convince me. All I can say is that it's possible that she is correct in her enormous claim to have finally cracked the case, but she also may be way off base.I have to add that I think the size of her name on the cover of the book is a little much. Tone down the arrogance, Ms Cornwell."},{"rating":"1","title":"Case closed? Not really!","review":"Patricia Cornwell's non-fiction offering, \\"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed\\" is filled with meticulous detail about Jack the Ripper's murders. Cornwell brings modern forensic techniques into the investigation of this 122 year-old case in an effort to prove that Jack the Ripper was Walter Sickert, an artist and actor. Although the detail made the theory interesting, the book was quite slow-moving in parts. While the use of mitochondrial DNA and handwriting analysis may seem to implicate Sickert, I didn't find it convincing enough to merit the descriptor \\"Case Closed\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Case not closed","review":"The major mistake of this book is the arrogance in thinking that century old circumstancial (and controversial) evidence can close any case. Maybe with a little more caution she could have achieved more credibility, but I'm afraid a rash statement such as \\"case closed\\" doomed this book from the start."},{"rating":"2","title":"Is the case really closed?","review":"\\"Overall \\"Portrait if a Killer\\" was a very interesting and rather compelling.

Talk about the pot calling the kettle black!This book reveals more about the neuroses and obsessions of Cornwell's own sick mind than it does about Sickert. Rather than 'case closed' on Sickert, it is 'case closed' on Cornwell.Cornwell's reputation as a writer of FICTION remains intact."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the Science?","review":"Apologies to all you Patricia Cornwell fans, but I find this to be the worst book to have been written on Jack the Ripper - and the book's subject aside, from a structural point of view, it is a badly written book by any standards. Bearing in mind her background and vast forensic experience, I do not know how Ms Cornwell can justify claiming to have solved a hitherto unsolved case when she puts forward absolutely no evidence beyond her own suppostions, which are based on considerable experience admittedly but which remain shakily founded suppositions, none the less. Add to this that Ms Cornwell is, anyway, not the first person to have connected Sickert to the Ripper killings. I am not, at the best of times, a Patricia Cornwell fan but I bought and read this book with an open mind, believing that she might, indeed, have finally solved the Ripper murders. The book was an enormous disappointment and has certainly not persuaded me to reconsider her offerings in crime fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Reader from Coeur d' Alene Idaho","review":"I have just managed to get through this book, though it wasn't a noteworthy experience. Cornwell's tone throughout the book suggests grand arrogance and her deductions are based more on supposition than fact. The use of \\"may be,\\" \\"could have been,\\" \\"quite possibly,\\" and a host of other statements of supposition are rampant in the book. To repeatedly refer to Walter Sickert as Jack the Ripper in her unabashed tone--without more concrete evidence--could be potentially liablous. In fact, I would not be surprised if Sickerts family or estate took legal action against Cornwell.Cornwell is obviously out of her league when writing a book of this nature, and she should stick to what she appears to know best: fiction.Bottom line: From the literary point of view, the book drones on in a rambling manner. And, as stated, the facts don't match her conclusions. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"True or not, it's a page-turner","review":"Ok, I admit I'm not totally convinced Sickert was Jack the Ripper, although Cornwell does make a very convincing case for him. What I will say is that the book is extremely interesting and I had a hard time putting it down. I think many of the poor reviews here spring from the fact that a lot of the fascination with \\"Jack the Ripper\\" is that his identity is a mystery - do we really want to know who he was? That said, what we do get with this book is a very well written account of a 19th-century man who could have been JTR. The author also does a great job of immersing the reader in the Victorian era - her research into her subject matter is suberb."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge Disappointment","review":"This book is garbage. Cornwell labels Strickert,who is obviously dead and not able to defend himself, a serial killer. She ought to be ashamed of herself. Cornwell's book is called \\"case closed.\\" What a joke. You could never get a conviction in court on the evidence she presents. Furthermore, she's a boring writer. ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip It","review":"Although at times entertaining, this book was a real chore to plow through. In fact, I found myself skimming the last few chapters just so that it would end quicker. I agree with earlier reviews that call the book disjointed and disorganized. Cornwell makes no effort to put anything in chronological order, which is not necessary if there is another type of organization to take its place. But there isn't. Within each chapter, the information is haphazardly put together; many times a few different topics would occupy the same chapter. I wondered aloud if the editor ever even read the book.All of this really takes away from any that might be interesting. Cornwell's argument is so confusing and has no direction. She never builds up a case. The writing itself is poor and simplistic.That being said, her research has some merit, and I did learn a lot about law enforcement in London in the 1880s. However, I was VERY VERY disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Very Difficult Read","review":"Although I enjoy her fiction very much, this book is extremely difficult to read. Her thoughts appear jumbled and disjointed. Very difficult to follow. I seriously considered not finishing the book.In addition, although she does provide some interesting information, it is clear the she is overreaching to \\"prove\\" the identity of Jack the Ripper. Too much speculation to be of any real worth.However, the photos she provides are intriguing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Far from closed","review":"Cornwell's theories about Walter Sickert, where based on evidence, are reasonable and worth a look if you're a Ripperologist open to considering all theories. If your interest in Jack the Ripper is more passing, you'd do well to pass on this book. Cornwell undermines her case at the start, when she describes her feelings while walking on a city street at night. Her statements that she knew who Jack the Ripper was and that she wasn't wrong, especially as described in such an emotional context as urban fear, outweigh any sense of objectivity in the rest of the book.In the end, Cornwell offers more insistence than evidence that her theory hits the mark, let alone that it closes the case."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well Researched Speculation","review":"While exhaustively researched, this book makes only a midly compelling case that Sickert is Jack the Ripper. It is extremely long on speculation and forensic detail, and extremely short on deduction or evidence. A great deal of time is spent discussing the Ripper letters and postcards and their watermarks, but there has long been questions about the veracity of most of these documents. At best, Ms. Cornwell paints Sickert as an unlikable individual who may have indeed taunted police for his own perverse pleasure without having anything to do with the actual crimes. After all the hype, I was more or less disappointed in what this book actually delivered."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expected better from Cornwall","review":"I was highly disappointed with this book. I expected much more from Cornwall as a writer.The subject of Jack the Ripper is immensely interesting but the tale told in \\"Portrait of a Killer\\" is dull and drags on with no end in sight.I was so excited to finish this book even though the next book I had to read was for my PhD class.From now on I will definitely stick to Cornwall's fiction, if I even read anything written by her again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hardly case closed","review":"I was very disappointed. Patricia Cornwell is a gifted writer and her research was extensive, but she really missed the mark on Jack the Ripper.

Borrow this book from a library if you really want to read it but don't waste any cash on it because you will probably be disappointed.PC's smugness is now repugnant, her condescending attitude has simply worn me down and bored me to tears.

Here is a stunningly terrifying description of what he went through and how it rendered him impotent and with a lifelong need to murder women. By the way there is no actual proof for anything described (though none of his wives or mistresses specifically denied it). Now that we have these facts let us draw some further conclusions to prove his guilt....For example, Jack the Ripper was in a certain borough on a given date and although correspondence indicates that Sickert was out of the country who's to say he wasn't lying?Are you convinced by these arguments? Good. Neither was I. The case is most definitely not closed.Having said that I enjoy Patricia Cornwell's fiction including this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not convinced from page one","review":"Having never read a Ripper book before this one I was not sure what to expect. What I didn't expect was a biased conclusion on who the the Ripper was from almost page one, based on flimsy and circumstantial evidence from the start of the book. The author tried to convince and convict from an early point in her book that Walter Sickert was the murderer of the East End London women who had the musfortune to cross his path in late Victorian London. Evidence is circuital at best and far reaching at the worst; there is not a shred of direct evidence linking Sickert to the crimes he is accused of. If one eliminated the \\"could haves\\", \\"might haves\\",\\"possiblys\\" and \\"maybes\\" this would have cut the book in half; having never read this author before I sincerely hope this is not her best effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly edited, poorly written!","review":"Did this book have an editor? It is so jumbled, it's hard to read. In my view, Cornwell MAY have proven that Sickert wrote one or more of the Ripper letters, but does that make him the killer? Otherwise, she seems to read a lot into his \\"dark, violent\\" art work- so much so that it almost becomes laughable. Does every drawing or painting of a woman really look dead? I don't think so. What Cornwell proves is that Sickert was probably a sicko, but she really stretches and uses a lot of supposition to link him to the kiilings.Aside from all that, the book is just plain poorly written- jumping from subject to subject with a few paragraphs thrown in that have nothing to do with the surrounding text.This comes off as an unworthy vanity work by a successful novelist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"What could have been a fascinating topic and analysis of evidence turned out to be a poorly organized and awkwardly written account of the author's attempt to \\"expose\\" Jack the Ripper.

If the author is a student or intern, this should have been her thesis.

There are tons of horrid books about Jack, but they are still better than this load of dung. For people who really want to learn about and read some excellent books on the subject, pick up anything by the following authors: Philip Sugden, Donald Rumbelow, Keith Skinner, or Stewart Evans.This book is horrid for true students of the case because Cornwell, with this pathetic stinker of a book, has put in the minds of casual readers that the Ripper case is solved when it is so obviously not.

The book by Greg Pack and Greg Land does not deliver the same feel you felt when reading X-Men: The Dark Phoenix Saga. Chris Claremont and John Bryne understood the Jean/Grey Phoenix storyline better. The triumph and the tragedy of Jean Grey is beter explored in Chris Claremont's X-Men comics. Greg Pack and Greg land was maybe hired by Marvel comics to make money of the X-Men/Pheonix storyline. How many times did Jean Grey have to die? Please let Jean Grey rest in peace and give her a real conclusion to her story. Between X-Men: Endsong and X-Men:Dark Phoenix Saga, I recommend X-Men:The Dark Phoenix Saga.

Yeah, there's a wealth of information about progression in story telling and the importance of theme/subtext/meaning. However, this book lacks insight on how to write and structure a SHORT film; something it's title more or less promises. To top it off, the chapters are poorly organized and many sections consistently introduce \\"new\\" subjects which are nothing more than recycled ideas from previous pages. I'm surprised it's staple in so many classrooms.In lieu of this book I'd recommend \\"Writing Short Scripts\\" by William H.

The African instrumental intro to the opening track, \\"Sharkey's Day\\" sounds just like the opening, rallying whistles of street gangs 'The Sharks' and 'The Jets' in the Broadway musical, \\"West Side Story\\" and the album seems to use that Leonard Bernstein and Stephen Sondheim score as a blueprint for a radical musical concept of city sidewalks and African pathways cutting across the imagination like a shark on the beach.

The acting sucks the story line is ok but if done with a higher budget better effects, better acting and a better director could be a good movie and with more gore would be good. But to buy this movie as it is its not worth it at all. Its not scary infact quit silly and retarded and the whole time has you saying what the hell is going on here.

The movie also loads itself down with in-jokes to assorted movies...The Beyond most blatantly but City of the Living Dead, The Evil Dead, The Fog, Dawn of the Dead, Make them Die Slowly, and numerous others get playful nods as well. I haven't seen this much love for a genre and its cult icons outside of a Joe Dante's movie Matinee and it made The Dead Hate the Living all the more refreshing and endearing.

The first books I read by this author were about Italy, because I read everything I can about Italy. Morton wrote during the early 20th century, so there is a definite feeling of not just travelling, but travelling to another time. This is even more noticeable in the books about England and London. \\"In Search of England\\" takes the reader back to England of a few generations past. Morton is fascinated by the England of HIS past, and he speaks with English country folk who were old-fashioned even to his generation. There was a man who chipped flint into tools, for example. For readers like me who were fascinated by books like Rudyard Kipling's \\"Puck of Pook's Hill\\" and \\"Rewards and Fairies\\", Patricia Wright's \\"I am England\\", and the more recent \\"Sarum\\", this book will be a great source on England as it was in the last century. Very charming."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great armchair travel book","review":"If you are an Anglophile, you will appreciate the rich, buttery smoothness of Henry Morton's words in In Search of England. Like tea with shortbread cookies, this compilation of travel thoughts and experiences is timeless, even though it is technically out-of-date. This is the point of Morton's work, though, that there are many things about the \\"Old England\\" which the traveler, or the British citizen, can not find today, except through searching over an interesting hill, down a mysterious lane, or in conversation with a stranger. Today's reader can appreciate how many things about England have passed out of fashion, but are still loved. It makes for a visit to a time and place where there was a lot to learn from this sceptered isle."},{"rating":"2","title":"When you read a pure truth, it touches your heart profoundly","review":"My husband of two years and I have wrangled endlessly about how to make our marriage healthy. We were at the point of divorce for the twentieth time when this book was recommended by a friend. The one hour it took to read was the most powerful I've experienced in ages! My sweetheart agreed to read it as well. We sat down and discussed several of the chapters (none more than 3-4 pages long) which were especially pertinent to us. The book opened dialog we've failed to have before and led to a reconciliation of true strength. We were clearly able to see the simple principles we'd managed to miss in creating our lives together. The book is very readable, very quotable, and very, very powerful. We dare you to live your lives with the full passion Barbara suggests."},{"rating":"2","title":"Small book, powerful message","review":"I picked up this little red book knowing nothing about DeAnglelis and too little about some of my own confusing emotions and experiences. Perhaps its brevity and simple truths are part of its power and charm. Don't expect an intellectual masterpiece but it's well worth the hour it will take to read. If you are passionate, you will love it and laugh with DeAngelis. If you lack passion, it could open your eyes to a new truth."},{"rating":"2","title":"FANTASTIC VIDEO!

This is one of the worst \\"flap books\\" I've seen. The illustrations under the flaps don't correspond to the illustrations surrounding them, and it features truly boring and inane text: \\"A friendly brown monkey, so happy is he.\\" There's very little interesting information about the animals.

On both machines it covers 4, yes 4, USB ports no matter which position they are plugged in. It's so wide and tall that the only thing I've managed to plug in in a port diagonal from it was a wired USB plug for a mouse, but then actually still bends the PS2 adapter.This works on my laptop but in that case if I want to use it I can't plug in headphones since it covers the headphone jack. =/"},{"rating":"2","title":"PS2 Keyboard to USB Adapter","review":"This product was very helpful in providing USB functionality while using older technology.

I edited my original review in 2010, but the date of the review was not updated.While they look like the same glove, they are not. This is what I dislike:- Goat skin is not as durable. Calf skin was much better. Why did they change the type of leather...local manufacturing sensitivity? Made in Pakistan)- Shorten finger lengths. The goat skin is bunching during lifting- Not true to size. My hand is 8\\" around. A large is extremely tight fittingWhat I do like:- Valeo still uses the memory foam- The look- The addition of the terry cloth on the thumbI will no longer purchase this weight lifting glove.

The image gives a false depiction of the true cheap nature of this gloves.The finger sections are made of cheap materials unworthy of a true tough hardworking weightlifting glove they used to be.Already the finger sections are wide and torn just from lifting and I only used them for an hour on two different occasions.

What a beautiful story! And very easy to read. I recommend this book, to introduce kids to the wonderful world of reading.The words are simple, it has a beautiful ending, with a very nice message.My son was very interested in the story through the entire narration.

The poor little guy is lost, alone, and frightened as he searches everywhere for his mother. Should be a horror story, not a bedtime story.

I remember thinking that the story was cruel and calloused, and i felt so sorry for the poor baby birdie.To this day (25 yrs later), my mother, sister and I, still joke about being traumatised by \\"are you my mother?\\", and refer to it as \\"that awful book\\".If your kids like it, that's fine, but i will never buy this book for my kids."},{"rating":"1","title":"Child abandonment is not an appropriate topic for kid's","review":"This story is really not appropriate for young children. The premise is very frightening. A little bird spends the entire book searching for his mother and comes face to face with a pretty scary \\"snort\\". He does end up reunited with his mom in the end, but the main storyline plants the seeds for plenty of nightmares and anxiety. There are many better children's books out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't Stand This Book--So Many Better Options","review":"If you are looking for a story to explain the mother-child bond and you live in an artificial society where all parents look like their children, then, perhaps this book is for you. However, if you are an adoptive parent, a step-parent, a foster-parent, or just a mom whose child doesn't mirror you, don't even bother with this book. I won't read it to my students (I am an elementary school teacher) or to my own children--who, incidentally, don't look like me. The book reinforces the notion that in order for a child and his mother to have a bond, they must look alike. Maybe I'm being a little overly sensitive or PC, but I simply loathe this book, which isn't even well written on top of everything else there is to dislike about it. If you're looking for a moving story, that truly shows what it's really like to be a mom, regardless of who you are or what you look like, A Mother For Choco by Keiko Kasza is a far superior choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull Dull Dull - Buy 'Is Your Mama a Llama?' instead.....","review":"This book is so awful it prompted me to write my first review. I almost wonder whether I read the same book as the folks who gave this book favorable reviews. This shamelessly dull book is poorly written and illustrated. It was a burden to own until I finally threw it out for the extra space on the bookshelf. This is not a Dr. Seuss book and doesn't contain any of the usual catchy Seusslike rhymes or illustrations.

He goes in search of his mother and ends up asking a kitten, cow, dog, car, boat, and a plane if they are his mother. Luckily for him he is returned to his nest by a friendly Snort (dump truck) before his mother gets back.The spirit of the little bird who goes looking for his mother is wonderfully expressed through the illustrations. They are simple, but expressive, cute, and colorful. The story flows well, and this makes for a cute, fun book.Loggie-log-log-log"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple eloquence","review":"There's nothing deep here, but \\"Are You My Mother?\\" has a simple eloquence in the story that seems to enchant small children. The drawings, too, are simple but appealing. This is classified as a \\"I can read it all by myself\\" book, but I've found it best as \\"read-aloud\\" book for my two kids at around age 2.

I recommend this book to anyone with children."},{"rating":"1","title":"I dread reading it.","review":"My son picks this book out a lot to read before bedtime. I always oblige and read it to him. But out of all of his books this one I enjoy the least. It's not because there is some moral objection to the book. It's not due to the fact that the bird is lost and afraid. Most other reviews say something about the book being upsetting for those kids that are adopted.For kids it is a good book. I would just rather read some other book as it's not as \\"fun\\" as other books I suppose. So I usually read this one first and then read something like, \\"Put me in the zoo.\\"Just my observation. I find the writing dull and predictable. It just seems like it would be simple for someone, anyone, to sit down and write a book of similar nature. Put me in the Zoo and Bear in Underwear are easy for me to read to my son every night. Whenever he hands me this book I have the thought, \\"ugh, not again.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"A very cute book!","review":"When I was a little child my mother use to read me the book, Are You My Mother.

GREAT BOOK!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy the Board Book Edition","review":"This 1 star review is for the board book edition -- certainly the harcover gets 5+ stars; it is a classic that should be in every child's library. But why does Random House insist on abridging its catalog to get them to fit into board book format? The board book strips down a story that's already quite simple, and takes all the flavor and joy out of it.Bottom line: if you want to enjoy \\"Are You My Mother?\\" go and buy the \\"complete\\" hardcover edition. If you need something sturdy that your child is going to teethe on, buy a Zwiekback biscuit."},{"rating":"2","title":"my baby loves this cloth book","review":"My six-month-old son loves this book.

Everytime I look at his eyes I fill with fear. But the idea of being seperated from your parents of the worst fear factor. AND in addition. NEVER EVER EVER BUY THE VIDEO THAT GOES WITH THIS BOOK!

NEVER BUY THIS BOOK!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Very Nice Message","review":"I know that my review will not please a lot of fans of this classic, but...I have to say, this book's message is pretty out-dated, and rather insensitive to many modern families. The baby bird goes up to various animals asking, \\"Are you my mother?\\" The answer is invariably, \\"No. You are a bird. I am not a bird.\\" What kind of message is that for a child? Many children today do not look like their mothers at all!A much better story is A Mother for Choco, about a little bird who wanders around, going up to every animal that bears some sort of resemblance to it. In the end, it decides to live with Mrs. Bear who is also raising an alligator, a hippopotamus and a pig. To me that is a much more beautiful message for children: that a family doesn't have to be people who look alike. A family is just people who love each other."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book in the world!!!!","review":"This book is very good, and I think that every mother and father should get this for there children.

There are some Gregorian monks chanting, Indian sound clips, good special effects and synth use, beautiful sounding female vocalists, poppy upbeat songs, and more introspective tracks as well.

Their ambient/electronic/new age genre defying sound has carried them through the last two decades of excellent music and near constant (if not drastic) reinvention. From SEMANTIC SPACES to POEM and now THE BEST OF DELERIUM, they have shown themselves to be among the best at what they do, walking alongside other greats like DEAD CAN DANCE or ENIGMA.Essentially a collection of previous songs, some remixes, and two new tracks, THE BEST OF DELERIUM is a more commercial offering that previous albums, but it is still a fresh, beautiful, and well constructed piece. Stand out tracks include \\"Paris,\\" \\"Underwater\\" and the fantastic \\"Truly - Wise Buddah Radio Edit.\\"A great place to start a relationship with Delerium, THE BEST OF DELERIUM is a representative look at their long history of creating great music.

The 3D is about the worst ever, it never really produces a 3D effect and the red/blue glasses dull and changes to colors making it almost a black and white film. None of the 3D effects really work. The best of them is the falling snow. Often the viewer sees the two images ruining the whole effect and making it impossible to concentrate on the story.A recommendation is to forget the 3D version and just play the 2D version. Both are on the disk.When 3D was first introduced, people complained that they got headaches from the 3D. This DVD definitely falls into that catagory. Perhaps in Imax with the gray poloroid glasses, the effects work. NOT on this disk."},{"rating":"2","title":"3D fun with a campy twist","review":"This movie seems to be even more fun for the adults than the kids at christmas time, packed with references from popular science fiction movies (SW) and action films. The snowman has a depth of character you wouldn't expect from his simple look and makes a great arch-nemesis for Santa. And it actually got the kids thinking because the snowman has an understandable motive for taking on Santa.The 3D effects were good through most of it, even better with a bigger screen TV."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 stars great movie, buy the Sensio or FQHS & see in IMAX 3D","review":"It really is an enjoyable film, Awsome in Imax 3D and at home if you have the Sensio, or field sequential version. The dvd that comes with the Red/Blue \\"3D\\" glasses inside doesn't work and is only good for 2D viewing. The 3D effects on the Sensio and field sequential versions work as they should! The field sequential version IS availible on Amazon so get it instead of the Red/Blue Analglyphic.-I originaly gave 4 stars on the Red/ Blue version only for the fact that I really enjoyed the film in IMAX the Sensio DVD that just came out should recieve 5, however you can't change that in a review edit."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big disappointment","review":"I took my three grandchildren ages 2 1/2 to 6 to the IMAX presentation of Santa Vs. the Snowman at our local Children's Science Museum. I was with my daughter-in-law and after no more than 10 minutes we removed the children from the theater. The elves are rude and crude. But what I was absolutely flabbergasted at was the conversation between two elves which in essence went like this: One elf asks the other if he's put a ring on his girlfriend's finger yet and the other elf replies, \\"Why buy the Ice House if you already get the ice for free!\\" I was offended by this movie and so disappointed that I had taken the children to something geared for kids and exposed them to something so inappropriate. I would have given this movie a 0 but that option not available."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just pure fun!","review":"We had an old video tape version of this that we recorded many years ago...but we missed the first 5 minutes of it.

We thought the special effects would be fascinating and they were. However, within minutes of the movie's beginning my daughter was in tears. I won't say why but she found the plot frightening. Several times during the movie I tried to talk her out of watching but she wanted to see what happened in the end. Fortunately the movie is relatively short. Overall, I found the story to be a cynical look at Christmas. As an adult, I think it might be humourous to watch after a hard day of Christmas shopping but I urge caution before showing it to young children. There was way too much animated violence to match the spirit of Christmas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some adult humor, not for kids...shame","review":"There were a couple of places in this film that I didn't appreciate. If they removed those I'd give it 5 stars. An elf talks of getting caught in his wifes clothing, I didn't find that funny at all. Sick if you ask me and doesn't belong in a childrens show. I really liked the plot and the characters except for the two elves in the control room.

This is so far away from that you would need the Hubble Space scope in order to see how close it came. The imaging is excellent and has been executed with great expertise. Regrettably the story makes Santa vs. the Martins look like an Oscar contender. Such a waste trying to make it more desirable by hoking it up with 3D gimmickry. You can't improve on failure.

Ms. Woody covers a wide range of pottery techniques, from centering clay, making bowls, plates, lids, cylinders, pulled handles, and more. This book is also filled with wonderful photographs of each step. Ms. Woody slices each clay project in half to show the correct position of the potter's hands while forming the pot. This is the book that I credit my success as a potter to, and I highly recommend it to anyone who is really serious about learning pottery on the wheel!

The ease of use, large range of options, scenario editing and choice of games/campaigns is fantastic. The recreation of the ups and downs of battles creates a feeling of being in the heat of battle. The AI works very well. The ability to play either side against the computer, both sides or with another player adds a sense of not just recreating history, but of possibly changing history. Having played many of the scenarios several times, not once did any of the scenarios end the same way. The final result is always different, which keeps the game fresh and challenging. If you want to experience the excitement, agony, nerves and sweat of commanding any size unit in battle, I highly recommend OAW: Wargame of the Year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh my.........","review":"Possibly one of the worst games I have ever played.

Deliciously sarcastic, witty, mysterious and entertaining the whole way through. Magic is handled in a way that was so refreshing and unique. It flows beautifully and isn't chopping like old-fashioned novels are wont to be. There's a slight eeriness woven throughout that makes it so compelling. I'm not going to lie, though. It took me a good 4 weeks to plow through the whole thing. It doesn't end on a cliff-hanger, but at the same time it doesn't wrap everything up for you - it leaves you to imagine what will happen next.

The prose is very good, the characters fully developed, and the situations range from entertaining to outright funny, but...First, it's too specific in genre. You really have to have read a lot of fairy tales to understand many of the references, but if you do understand them, the direction of the plot eventually gets obvious. I was hoping from a departure from the norm, but this isn't it.Second, it's just too long. All the tension is in the first two thirds of the book and the last third is a long winding down.Still, a great first effort. Buy it used, there are sure to be 100s of copies around soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it","review":"I haven't read a book in a long time that was as delightfully original as this one. Magic isn't just waving a wand and crying out some magic words. It is at times as fresh and beautiful like an English garden, such as a street in London transforming into a Faerie forest, and the little box \\"the color of Heartache,\\" and at times fascinatingly dark and macabre, like a bottomless Tower of Eternal Darkness following the magician, or the Faerie's nonchalant murders, like when he was extracting the essence of a kiss from women's lips.The author also added depth to the background of the story with all her footnotes which I found to be interesting.All in all a GREAT book, although it may take a bit to settle into it. For me I loved it from beginning to end. Witty and original all the way through. You might be bored because you don't enjoy the Jane Austen/Bronte Sisters style of 19th century English language, but never because the author's ideas were unoriginal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strange book","review":"There is no redeeming qualities in any of the characters, and there is not much of a story line.

The characters are very shallow in design, with quite a clinical approach to their descriptions. They are equally stand-offish which makes it hard to relate to the characters or feel for them.The book is written in giant paragraphs. It makes it hard to follow dialog when they are all smashed into the same paragraph. With the old British way of speaking, and the unusual names, it is hard to follow the conversations.I know people who have loved the book, and one of them actually recommended it to me since we have similar taste in books. This was not one of them. Give it a shot if you really feel the need, but if you don't like the first 30 pages, the rest of the book is the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clever and at times entertaining, but disappointing","review":"While I liked parts of this book very much, it needed editing. The sequence near the end in Venice was pure agony and I came ever so close to giving up. However, having read so many pages it seemed a shame not to finish the book.

She is obviously very educated (a ton of research went into this book)and has wonderful descriptive abilities. She can also be quite humorous.Unfortunately, the book did not move quickly enough to maintain my interest.

After nearly 800 pages, one would think that Clarke could reward her readers (who have by now forgiven her meanderings and heavyhandedness) with some resolution. No. There is no resolution and the ending is far too 'cinematic' (and I mean that in the worst way possible). The possibility of a regrettable sequel is left wide open (though I won't bother reading it)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Typos Galore","review":"I'm not sure why this book is so awfully transcribed.

Five stars? Susanna Clarke, is that you?This audiobook (or book if you read the print version) will break your heart. 32 hours of rambling tedium. Very little character development, not much internal consistency, and perhaps most damning of all, no action whatsover. Even the greatest \\"reveal\\" of the story is an offhand mention - no understanding of how it even happened.It was essentially a 100 page story spread out over 700 or so pages (over 30 hours). Go ahead and listen to it. I dare you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enchanting Read","review":"This novel is unique and enchanting and hilarious.

Sometimes the little asides in the footnotes were more interesting than the text itself.To sum up the text: in 782 pages there is a hint of a very interesting story that is never fully realized and is played out by very boring people.

Skip this one if you can."},{"rating":"1","title":"How much time do you have to waste?","review":"There are at least 250 extra pages. As a fan of Dickens and Austen, I bristle to see them cited in these reviews; they were much more economical writers. I didn't throw it at the wall, I stayed until the ending, but was disappointed.

I really had to force myself to get through it. It reads like Harry Potter for Adults, but without any of the fun or excitement.

Otherwise, pass on to something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thank God it was a loaner.","review":"The subject matter is potentially exciting and the writer is both technically competent and apparently familiar with the period.That gets the book one star.Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norell is not exciting, nor humorous, nor romantic. Even drama seems lacking. From a slow start, it drags on page by page, promising much, but never delivering. In a word, it is boring. I made it through about 90 pages then went off do some gardening. My intelligent, talented, accomplished, speed reading wife made it about 3/8s of the way through the book before arriving at the same conclusion and switching to another book. She LIKES \\"arty\\" books.Thank God this was a loaner."},{"rating":"1","title":"I believed the hype","review":"Hearing the book of the year and Harry Potter for adults tags, I grabbed this book with a lot of expectations. I've seen other glowing reviews here so I assume this is a case of YMMV (your mileage may vary).The old style of writing didn't put me off. But I think this could have been a good (but not great) 200-300 page story. The book set up an interesting premise and contained some interesting sequence. But inbetween is a lot of rambling.The footnotes remind of of Book of Leaves where the first 50 pages or so they come off as an interesting unique devise but by the 400-700 pages I began to find them very tiresome. If you have a two page footnote, maybe that story should be part of the main storyline.As someone else said, don't expect Harry Potter for adults. It is definitely not that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Like Susanna Clarke, many of the reviewers here take too many words to get to the point: \\"a book to savor, not devour,\\" \\"will reward the patient reader,\\" and the like.Here's the short course: boring.

Not that anything is wrong with you but it might be downright weird for some. It doesn't necessarily mean you are stupid or can't understand good books. It is just that there is a definite style, and style is in the eye of the beholder I guess.The setting and the characters are really entertaining, but might seem dry to some, with all their gentlemanly rules and such but that is what makes them entertaining to me.Overall, I highly recommend you at least try the first chapter!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring,boring book","review":"Ive read a lot of books in my life and I know the cream of the crop, Catch 22, The hitchhikers guide to the galaxy, Connie Willis's Passage.

The whites around him (revealing how ignorant they really are) assume him to be some African king in exile. Everyone around him dotes on his wondrousness. I hoped that he would be some minor character and soon disappear but as I scanned the next few hundred pages I saw his name popping up again and again and again to the point where I knew that no matter how much I liked the writing and the flow of the story so far I just could not continue such an anachronistic uber-PC work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and Tedious","review":"After plodding through 400 pages of this immense, plodding tomb, including the annoying and unentertaining footnotes, I am at the crossroads of deciding whether I should waste any more of my life by continuing onward to the end.

Looking back on the whole tedious experience I wonder how and why I stayed at it so long.

I'm not sure what motivated the author to do this but given the time she worked on it, it's a tribute to her determination.

I am quite surprised at all the positive feedback this book generated as I feel it easily could have been half as long.

He went to a great deal of trouble to track the book down and get it for me for Christmas. If he hadn't gone to all the trouble, I would have chunked this in the trash after 2 or 3 pages. More than 800 pages later, I felt like I'd been trapped in a Seinfeld episode (not much happening, but spending a lot of time talking about it) without the laughs.

I give the book only 1 star out of respect for an author that can string together that many words. The book would have been a halfway ok at half the number of pages. It's a frustrating read filled with half-baked characters and a story line that does not hold together. But, more importantly, it's such and uninteresting book to read. Unless you have a fetish for 19th century English culture. Otherwise, as a fantasy, it's a dud.

The story is written in a VERY dry, rambling style with ubiquitous footnotes - many of which are almost an entire page long and totally off subject! I waited patiently for the pace to pick up, but it never did. It was only in the last 100 pages of the book that my imagination was finally prodded out of coma-mode. This book is defnitely NOT worth the $30!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dickens on Valium","review":"I enjoy big fat books, Dickens, fantasy, a wide variety of books of all kinds. Somehow this book was beyond strange, it simply had no point, no tension, it was almost a documentary on 2 made-up magicians in a fantasy world. Worse, I kept expecting it to get better, to go SOMEWHERE with all of this other than just random imaginings with no real connecting theme. After all, so many critics raved about it. So I read about 600 pages before I dumped it in the garbage, a fate that very few of my books ever suffer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn...","review":"I won't try to write a clever review of this book discussing the range of the characters and so forth. I am going to be honest and straightforward. Simply put, this was a very long, boring book that went off on tangents with footnotes galore. The author might have thought this quaint, but it only added to the tedium. I only mildly enjoyed the last 100 pages of the book and forced myself to finish it.There are many more books out there worth the time and effort, but not this one. Too bad too...the storyline had potential."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"This book has some magic, some characters that are moderately interesting, and very vaguely--a plot. But in my many years of reading, it is plainly the most boring book I have ever read. That list of boring books includes many of the so-called classics we were forced to read in grade school. I kept trying. I got three-fourths of the way through when I gave up. The footnotes did not bother me too much, I have seen that happen in some very good textbooks and classics. It was just that nothing much happened. There would be something happened and some 100 pages of nothing much. Just a lot of \\"explanatory\\" text. I am sorry, because I wanted it to be good. Even the characters were boring. Mr. Strange was somewhat interesting, but that did not help much. As far as I am concerned, it could have been half as long, and been a much better book. If you enjoy long expositions of society and life and how magic is not around, then you will enjoy the book. Otherwise, skip it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Ponderous But Enjoyable Work","review":"I was rather intimidated by this audiobook, which comes on 26 CDs. It was slow to start, but it intrigued me, so I kept going. I'm glad I did, though I didn't feel like the ending finally wrapped up as much as it should: I had hoped it would explain more about how things came to be as they were at the beginning. Regardless, I enjoyed its rather rambling story with its engaging characters, moments of laugh-out-loud humor, fanciful footnotes of magical history, and magical descriptions of magic. And the narrator did an excellent job of bringing it all to life, with distinctive voices for each major character."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating but slowly-paced","review":"This book is best described as a fantasy history. Suppose there were magicians aiding the Duke of Wellington in his battles against Napoleon? There are also several subplots including one about a particularly malevolent fairy.The book is well worth reading, and will especially appeal to fans of fantasy. It has been well-described as \\"Harry Potter for adults.\\" I would suggest it for adults not because of cautions about language, sex or violence. There is no bad language, no sex and less violence than in the Harry Potter books.My concern for both children and adults is the book's pacing. The pace of the novel is frustratingly slow. It is not so much the footnotes (which are often delightful) as the author's style. The book is 800 pages and seemed longer. It would be a better book if it had been more tightly edited and been published at 600 pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engaging","review":"I was afraid that, at it's size, this book would be overly pedantic, but I was surprised to find that it was actually relatively engaging. This is a hard one to rate, really, because it doesn't fall into the star category very well. It IS engaging but the story sometimes seemed to take a while to get where it was going. I think I'd give it three and a half stars. The characters are well-developed and sympathetic, the story is interesting, honest, and believeable. I got a bit annoyed at the somtimes full-page footnotes, and the sometimes rambling plotline, but for the most part, I found the book entertaining and quite readable. Rarely does the story pick you up and carry you with it (I was usually not that upset if I got interrupted, and I didn't stay up til all hours reading as I have done with other books) but it is a good, well thought out, entertaining story."},{"rating":"1","title":"didn't much care for it","review":"A slow read for the casual reader.

Transports you back to a slower-paced, proper and polite bygone era. IF you're willing to spend MANY evenings patiently communing with these mild and temperate men, slowly unfolding their noble (yet flawed) character and depth, you will savor this story. The slow pace pulls you in, as though these are your friends of many years and you are settling in for a quiet and reflective evening with them in the drawing room.If, on the other hand, you prefer your fantasy fast-paced and action-packed, then this ISN'T the novel for you.I particularly appreciated the willingness of these characters to gently overlook faults in others, to readily forgive, to respect each other even in the face of disagreement--we could all learn a thing or two here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Going Nowhere","review":"Nicely written, but I'm 200 pages in and I don't know enough about these people to care to continue.

She is also enamored of the word \\"Oh!\\" - exclamation included - which starts almost every conversation and on some - many! - pages gets annoying.

The story is very slow moving and the footnotes are more interesting then the text of the book (although their length is quite annoying). I have read several other reviews and still cannot figure out what everyone else has seen in this novel. This book, like it's main character (Mr. Norell) is boring, tedious and given to long silences. Ms. Clark spends most of her time on character development of entirely boring characters -- some of whom are not important to the story. The entire story is told in the last 80 pages of the book although the reader is expected to plod through 720 pages of drivel to get there!

The only gripping episodes were those involving the gentleman with thistledown hair, Stephen, and Lady Pole. The lengthy footnotes could be entertaining but grew tiresome as the book progressed (and it is a long book, to put it mildly); Norrell is more a spoiled whiner than a threat to Strange; and the use of magic in the Napoleonic Wars never attains the suspense and drama of a real battle.

I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't finish it - But it's good!","review":"I hate to contradict myself in one sentence like that, but honestly is the best policy. A friend recommeded this book, and I picked it up at the library. The first 100 pages was fairly smooth, but as I went farther into this long book, I rapidly lost steam. It is not the easiest read in the world, there is something antiquated and almost romantic in the way it's written, which is great at first. But when you're reading page after page it was difficult to get lost in the story when I'm stumbling over the prose. I'm going to eventually try the audio book. It is a very interesting story, and if you like a slower read, this is your book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hey that was good fun","review":"So many reviews already detail this novel so I'll just say that i really liked this journey.

Evidently, most of those who gave this book 3-5 stars thought the potential was realised. I am afraid to say I did not. The main reason for this is the lack of a plot thread, a purpose to the main conflict, the lack of an interesting cast of characters, the lack of a true antagonist; I could go on.

But I had to write about this one. OK, it is a decent book. But I bought it because it was touted as an adult (grown-up) version of Harry Potter. This was one of the hardest books to get through. The whole story jumped all over the place and in the end you still did not know what the plot was.Buying this in paperback might be worth it. It is not the worst book I have ever read (actually it is the next to the worst book) but it certainly is a borrow from the library level of bad. You will not want this in your library."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's the Return of 19th Century English Magic","review":"I absolutely adored this book! She wove the tale of two magicians as masterfully as Charles Dickens! Her complex storyline took us through all sorts of labyrinthine subplots -- and I just wanted to linger in each one! This is a book I never wanted to end. I have not enjoyed a book this much in years! Raves for Sussana Clarke! Encore!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I didn't want this book to end...","review":"I recently purchased this book on a whim off the bargain table. I was immediately hooked! I left my copy in a B&B so I went out and bought another. This book is a charmer. It's funny, it's engaging, it's smart and it completely captures the feeling of the period. Frankly I don't know enough about the subject of English majic to know if Susanna Clark made up all the footnotes or if they have any basis in fact. DON'T SKIP THE FOOTNOTES! They are half the fun. I'd just finished Pride & Prejudice for the first time and this was a great follow up to that. This book isn't for everyone, but I'm glad I found it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good reading","review":"I didn't think I would like this book becuz it seemed for women, but I was wrong. It is very long book but so good a read. It is about a magician, but not at all like Harry Potter, so don't think it is. It is so much better than Harry Potter. I found myself thinking more of Jim Butcher's excellent DRESDEN FILES series, that I also think is great. There is no romance stuff in it, so don't worry about that.It takes place in the 1850s or so and follows the exploits of Jonathan Strange on his quest to explore the world that cannot be seen. He makes \\"jumps\\" into a vast unknown area to go to other places and follow a mysterious figure that eventually begins to wreck havoc on the world of humans.These characters come to life and is hard to put the book down, even though it is very very long. But you will be glad it was long when it is done and you will still want more. I am waiting for a sequel"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant Footnotes, etc.","review":"Whoever suggested skimming the footnotes is a bowdlerizer. Most of the footnotes are marvelous stories that stand on their own. This is not Tolkien or Rowling. This sometimes very funny and sometimes very sad book, the world Susanna Clarke creates, is utterly original, a gorgeous and thrilling mix of magic and history. Very highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Check it out from the library first","review":"This is an excellent book. Its sense of humor is dry, its language is incredible, its world feels complete, and its characters are both fascinating and believable. In short, it's all the best of recent fantasy, and it now has a place of honor among my most-loved and most-reread books.Unfortunately, it's also all the worst of old fantasy. Think only a few steps removed from the level of the Silmarillion, but with jokes. Especially towards the beginning, the novel is slow, and focuses on a character who is harder to sympathize with than most. The fact that it kept my attention in spite of this is nothing short of amazing. That said, it may not keep yours, so if you have any doubts, check the book out from the library first.Basically: I loved it. You might, too, but find out before you buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth it","review":"This book is not worth the 800 page investment of time. The plot is developed agonizingly slowly and there are myriad unnecessary details about period, dress, and interior design. The last 150 pages are superbly done, and almost able to stand on their own. Only if you have great patience, should you attempt to read the entire book...."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fantastic Delight","review":"The story pulled me in like a tractor beam and it was almost impossible for me to stop reading this wonderfully written magical fantasy. Susanna Clarke makes the impossible seem plausible and even believable with her matter-of-fact style and impeccable attention to detail. For the magickally and metaphysically minded reader, Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell should prove to be an exceptionally satisfying and delightful diversion into other mysterious worlds and fantasy. Some have called this Harry Potter for adults and I cannot entirely disagree, but this style of writing far exceeds the Potter series which was, after all, written with children in mind. For readers who enjoy faeries, good literature, magic and English historical literature I believe this will be a valued addition to their collections."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating and tedious","review":"I tried to like this book, I really did. I got 50% through it and still barely anything had happened. The story wasn't drawing me in and the characters were mainly unlikeable. The comparisons to Harry Potter are ludicrous except for the fact that it mentions magic. I got the subtle humor but it certainly never made me laugh or even smile.I appreciate that it's written in the style of the 19th century. I've read some of those books and in some cases you realize why people stopped writing books like that. It reminded me of another big thick book about 'Faerie' that I also gave up on. I think that was a classic novel but I can't remember the title and I wish that I could.Very disappointing"},{"rating":"1","title":"1 star for Kindle version of what should be a 4-star book","review":"This review is simply concerned with the kindle version, not the content. Some of the fun aspects of the book in print are the arcane and amusing faux footnotes. In the Kindle, the numbers should be a link to the footnote text, but they are not. One has to go to the table of contents, find the footnotes section, then search for that number. Come on, guys, this isn't rocket science."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth buying, good story!","review":"I have one thing to say........get the audio version. I would never have gotten through the print. But, narrated by Simon Prebble, this was entertaining. I thought the characters were animated, well defined and there were more than a few times where I thought the situations were just plain funny (see Drawlite meeting Norrell, pushing himself into his house, telling everyone he already knew him, etc). The humour is perhaps, English for lack of a better word (I'm somehow reminded of that old sitcom, 'Are you being served?'The plot did not lack complexity and was well done, characters were rounded, believable and the story was not lacking in suspense and wait. There were a few times where it dragged a bit (geez this is a long story), but I never kept listening and always found it interesting. Got kind of dark near the end. I'd definitely go see the movie (which is being filmed now) and will probably buy a copy of the CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yet another glowing review","review":"The promo copy describes 'Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell' as \\"Jane Austen meets J.R.R. Tolkein.\\" If you like either (or both) of them, it's likely you'll enjoy this epic fantasy set in 19th century England and Europe. I've read some people took a long time to finish or quit reading after a while, but I couldn't put down this 800+ page book, and it never stalled for me. Some say it's like Harry Potter for grown-ups, and Ms. Clarke has created quite the History of English Magic for her readers to explore. And the many interesting characters: Mr. Segundus, Mr. Norrell, Childermass, Drawlight, Lascelles, Sir Walter and Lady Pole, Stephen Black, Vinculus, Jonathan and Arabella Strange, the Gentleman with the Thistle-down Hair�? Don't miss the footnotes for some foreshadowing and the numerous back and side stories. I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"An instant classic","review":"Few books make it onto my \\"read every couple of years/give to my children\\" list. This one didn't take long to jump onto that list.Other reviewers can tell you about the plot... though it is slow to develop, it is there, consistently throughout the book. The characters are a delight, and the story is rich with detail both historical and magical (sometimes melding the two).What I loved about this novel was the resemblence it bore to some of Tolkien's lesser known stories like Smith of Wootton Major & Farmer Giles of Ham... short, fairy-laden tales of otherworldy magic.Buy this book, start reading and give it a chance. Totally worth every minute spent reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Long, But Worth It!","review":"I want to write SO MUCH about this book. It has history, magic, deep characters, style, involving plots, feuds - everything to keep most readers of any age extremely interested. Even the tiny-fonted and intimidating footnotes were entertaining!I would go into more detail and describe specific parts that I like about the book, but I don't want to spoil anything and it would be better for potential readers out there just to go ahead and read it! By page 800-something, I was wishing the book would go on for 800 more pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved, Loved, Loved It","review":"I'm amazed by some of the negative reviews I've read so far. How anyone can say that this book has no plot is staggering. It's definitely not a formula kind of thing (Thank God). It's full of small details that some people may have found daunting but I think that's the book's great strength.Anyway, it's a wonderful book, one of the best I've ever read. Yes, it's long but I found myself wishing it had been much longer. Honestly, Susanna Clarke's imagination is one of the best ever. The book is incredibly rich, very complex, a bit baroque, very funny, very sad, kinda scary and so on. Think of all the things that make a story great and I'm sure the Susanna Clark put them into Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell. It's a long book, after all.She deserves a place in the pantheon of great British Fantasists, if there is such a thing somewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was the point????","review":"I had great hopes for this book, as it dealt with magic and the supernatural, but as I read this I kept hoping there was a point to everything. The book just kept on and on. I have been more engrossed with other books of similar length, with the wish that they would not end. Not with this book, I couldn't wait for the book to end, but it just never did. Even when I got to the end, I kept asking, what was the point?, Why did it take sooooo long to get to the end???? I would not recommend this book to anyone. I am a great sci-fi magic fan, but there are many more interesting books out there than this. Huge disappointment!!!! Her short stories, 'The Ladies of Grace Adieu' is better. Not sooooo long winded. A big disappointment for a lover of fantasy and sci-fi."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow. Can't believe how many people liked this book.","review":"I read reviews on this book and couldn't wait for paperback so I bought the hardcover full price - mistake. I am AMAZED at how many people actually liked this book. It was full of promise, the premise was good and yes, it was creative. But it was so painful to get through from begining to end. The characters were flat and did not come alive for me at all. It lacked emotion and was detached and cold. I couldn't wait for it to end so that I could start something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"A work of surprising excellence.","review":"This is one of the finer fantasy novels to appear in recent decades. With a mature sense of humor and keen literary style, if avoids both the pomposity of contemporary high fantasy, and silliness of contemporary humourous fantasy. For the first time in many years, we have a truly beautiful fantasy novel to add to our bookshelves. Clarke adds comical and sometimes extensive footnotes that give a mock-scholarly feel as well as relieve tension (but you'll notice they appear less often near the climax). Her treatment of magic is subtle and tasteful, and her characters lifelike but interesting. Is it too long? No. If you think so, go buy yourself an attention span or a cheap Piers Anthony story and leave this serious, beautiful, and mysterious novel to the grown-ups."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding.","review":"I enjoy fantasy a great deal but so much of it is Tolkien redux, in fact I'd almost forgotten that it was possible to make a fantasy any other way... until I read two books that reminded me how narrow and uninspired fantasy has become. The first was \\"American Gods\\" by Neil Gaiman and the second was \\"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell\\". It's hard to think of two more different books yet both are \\"fantasy\\" (anything with magic is fantasy in my book but these labels are always loose). There isn't much I can add that hasn't been said, I just wanted to throw in a very enthusiastic thumbs up. I highly recommend this, it's amazing to think this is her first novel.So, don't despair! there is unique and inspired fantasy novels to be found and this book is one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrific book, lousy Kindle file","review":"This is a great book. Unfortunately the Kindle file does not live up to it.The Kindle file is full of missing letters (for instance, \\"a ery unfriendly letter,\\" instead of \\"very\\") and leftover hyphens from where words were broken across lines in the print edition. It suggests it was insufficiently proofed by the publisher, which is a shame.(Also, while the footnotes are hyperlinked _from_ the body of the text, they are not hyperlinked _back_ to the body of the text, which is an inconvenience if you are browsing.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Run, Run Away from This Book!","review":"Holy moley this was a boring book. I gave up about reading about one-fifth of the way thru the book. I could just tell the author was taking unnecessary tangents and providing additional detail for the sole purpose of reaching a certain page limit - she seems to think that bigger is better. \\"If the readers have to suffer to finish the book, they will like it more.\\"I've given up on very few books in my life - I was happy to give this one up. Given our short existence, spend your time with a better book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good grief is this book wearying","review":"For the first several chapters, I just loved this book.... Interesting characters, charmingly old-fashioned style of writing, so fitting with the historical atmosphere of the novel. Then, about a third of the way through (right about at the first LONG footnote, yes, you heard me right, there are footnotes, and then there are the LONG footnotes), it started to drag a bit, maybe annoy me just slightly. Then, several chapters later, it was gratingly unpleasant to read. But, I'll admit, I wanted to know how things would turn out, so I finished it. It was painful; I wish I could have those days of my life back."},{"rating":"1","title":"I fell for the hype","review":"Boy, is this book overhyped. I think it will be like \\"..And Ladies of the Club\\" -- many will buy but few will read.About page 400, I stopped reading because what little plot there was had disappeared. I couldn't work up the energy or interest to find out what happens when the magicians feud.I wish I hadn't wasted my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't like it","review":"I titled my review after the 2 star rating, because it seemed the most appropriate way to express my opinion. I don't like it. Is it a bad book? Maybe. Is it too long? Maybe. All I know is I don't like it.I slogged through 500 pages and just couldn't bring myself to read anymore. I wanted to read an interesting story, and I just could not remain INTERESTED. Maybe it wasn't meant to be read as a story. Maybe it was meant to be viewed as a work of art with it's Dickens-like prose. Maybe.Whatever interest I had upon picking up the book had disappeared after 100 pages or so. The other 400 pages was simply me saying, \\"Give it some time, it's a big book.\\" Well, I finally ran out of patience on page 500. It's on to the next book for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow, random, and fickle","review":"While I found Clarke's writing to be imaginative and charming in places, I found the book to be slow, very slow. New characters and plot devices are introduced with every chapter, creating confusion and muddle. I fell asleep reading it for nearly three straight months. Perhaps that's why I felt it to be slow and confusing, but for the very reasons that others enjoyed it, I found it a battle to read. I hoped for a brilliant ending, but it felt like Clarke got tired of it and just wrapped it up. Somehow."},{"rating":"2","title":"What Americans Don't Understand","review":"The title is enough to give me a fair share of 'review unhelpful' votes. But this is something that I've realized in alot of US reviews, even in the New York Post. They don't seem to get the point. They'll ramble on about how the prose is trite and too dry, all the while failing to realize that this isn't American literature. This is British.You could perhaps put some of the fault of misunderstanding on Bloomsbury, with the emphasis they've been placing on the US mass marketing, it gives the impression that this book is meant primarily for Americans. Which, of course, it isn't. (Ifm pretty sure I haven't read a more British book in the last decade.)We say 'lost in translation' and think it only refers to exotic languages and translations, but what we fail to realize is that it applies also to the gap between British English and American English."},{"rating":"1","title":"struggling....","review":"I am a voracious reader and this is my gendre...I find it a struggle to finish.

This is one tedious book- be warned. In poking fun at her prissy characters the writer talks down all the time to the readers. The supposed parody of regency brit class system and manners is without original humor, very broad and superficial, unforgivably it is also very boring..The tale is purportedly about a magician in the times of Napoleon, winning the war for the brits by creating illusions such as a blockade or some such humbug- all without inciting too much emotion in England, to show the phlegmatic nature I suppose..It's like Harry Potter extra lite ..ie without the JK Rawlins talent, so sinks rapidly.The author paints the magicians as dreary,buffoonish petty characters and now 2/3 of the way into the book it's a dreary uninteresting NOT WELL WRITTEN read. You are warned! I will soon be donating my copy, check one out before you click on buy!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh","review":"I have tried, twice, to get through this book. I really wanted to enjoy it. I know there are people who defend this book with a strange sort of vehemence, and usually I am the first to say that everyone has a right to an opinion. But Great Zombie Jesus this book is more a chore than a pleasure! Subjectiveness be damned, I cannot for the life of me understand how anyone got through this overwritten, overwrought, meandering mess of a...something...I hate to say \\"novel\\". Honestly, it reads more like a university student's lame attempt at great Victorian-style prose.Sigh.Normally, I wouldn't bother to review a book I hadn't finished, but thought that, for someone reading through these reviews before purchasing the book, I will gladly mail you my copy. Hell, I will even pay the postage if it means getting rid of it. I tried putting it out with my recyclables, but they said they don't take human waste material."},{"rating":"1","title":"I must be missing something...","review":"Rarely do you see a book with so many five star reviews. I normally would never review a book I did not finish, but I have to say something about how disappointed I was with this novel after hearing all the hype. I found it to be extremely dry and slow and gave up after a couple hundred pages. Many people obviously loved this book, and there are some very witty lines and clever descriptions, but there are too many great books out there for me to invest time slogging through page after arid page in search of a literary oasis. Don't be surprised if you find this book to be seriously overrated - you aren't alone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book I have ever finished","review":"I've read many thousands of books, and many more dense and detailed that this one. That people who like the novel seem to deride people who don't as being unintelligent or not having an attention span makes my blood boil.After 200 or so pages of this book, I just felt irritated beyond belief, and I could just imagine the author at her PC or typewriter with a smug look on her face thinking how great she is. I get that at times with Pratchett too. The footnotes that increased throughout the book added nothing and just took you out of what little story there was. How I finished it 'll never know, but I have to say it's the one book I really wish I'd not botehred with as it's just empty. Of everything. That's just my opinion.... If you feel otherwise that's fine.... I just don't happen to like prose for prose's sake. To me that's just self-indulgence.If I could have given this book minus stars I would have. I didn't just not enjoy it. I hated it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well written but.....","review":"This is a well written novel but somehow the characters lack charisma.

I Want That Part of My Life Back!","review":"This book was a real disappointment. Such plot as there was moved, if at all, with extraordinary sloth. I could not bring myself to care about any of the characters. It was a death march in which the author painted impossibly broad and self-indulgent tapestries of backstory and side details while ignoring any semblance of story momentum.I can't believe that I actually finished it. It was probbably the incredulity I felt at having wasted so much time up to the point at which I had by the read that kept me going. \\"There has to be some redeeming material up ahead!

All the reviewers were very exited and enthusiastic about this. One even went so far as to compare it to Tolkein.

The most magical thing that happened were potential story lines that would disappear or which took the reader on rides to nowhere special at all. I wanted to give this \\"story\\" more of a chance because of all the good reviews it has gotten, but I didn't care about a single one of the characters. This story reminded me of what it might be like to visit a retirement home to visit with seniors - except instead of hearing interesting stories of times past which revealed universal truths about the human experience, they just droned on and on about disjointed half-memories. Obviously this book was a labor of love, but it's also a labor to read. Honestly, this was such a painful experience that I could feel myself get a little older with every flip of the page."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sheer Tedium","review":"It took me forever to get thru this book. 781 pages of sheer tedium. But stubborn as I am I just kept plugging away hoping it would get better. I found it to be just as dull at the end as it was in the beginning.

This book was so arduous to read and I was happy when I finally got to the last page."},{"rating":"1","title":"Starts slow and lacks tension","review":"This is not a book that grabs your attention right away. The story starts with Mr. Norrell whom is neither an interesting character nor a likable one. Jonathan Strange is only moderately likable. Strange is introduced much later in the book.The plot is slow to develop and does not really begin till maybe the last 3/4 of the book.The strength of the book lies in Susana Clarke's development of this world. The many small side stories help creates an interesting world but at the same time it slows down the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was it written for reviewers instead of readers?","review":"As a three-books-a-week reader, I looked forward to Clarke's opus. Great disappointment! The novel seems to have been written for major book reviewers of the world instead of readers.The characters are one-dimensional -- even Jonathan doesn't come to life -- the insider jokes are tiring, and the plot's twists and turns are too obviously manipulated.All in all -- thumbs down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Potter and Prejudice","review":"It's easiest to describe this novel as \\"Harry Potter for adults\\" and that's an apt comparison but slightly misses the point. It's a much richer exploration of magic than Harry Potter, weaving in the English social dynamics of Jane Austen and the irony and atmosphere of Dickens. That being said, like Austen and Dickens it does require an enormous investment of TIME to read this nearly 900 page doorstop of a novel. Unlike another recent doorstopper novel of 19th century England, \\"The Crimson Petal and the White,\\" Ms. Clarke's novel does not let you down at the end. My only minor quibble is that the novel could have used a bit more slashing by a judicious editor's pen, but it's a very minor quibble indeed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and hard to read","review":"The first half of the book is devoted to Mr. Strange, who is a thoroughly unlikeable character.

From there, however, the book degenerates into a long, drawn-out description of war between England and France using magic to do battle. The story becomes tedious and boring.

It reminded me of The House of Mirth.Update - I thought that I would give this book a little more time to grow on me. I am now at Chapter 31, and it is still as boring as ever, if not more so! The Harry Potter of adults my eye.Another update - after investing so much time in this book I thought that I might as well finish it. It ends as it begins, meandering along a road of pretty prose with no real end in sight.Apparently we are being set up for a sequel.If you like Dickens, read Dickens, and if you like Melville, read Melville, but don't call this a classic just because of the lovely way it is written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Have to step in here...","review":"It's hard to fathom why so many of you love this book, to say nothing of the inference that A.S.

Having just finished a couple of really well written novels, I can also say that there was nothing special about the author's prose whatever...Who is reviewing this work-fans of Harry Potter? Finally, if you want to read an intelligent, throw-back kind of novel with real drama, well drawn characters and a truly epic feel, pick up Palliser's \\"The Quincunx\\". Light satire and pale imitations of Jane Austen do not a classic make."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the effort","review":"This book has a great premise and, perhaps, great promise. Unfortunately, it fails to develop the former and never delivers on the latter. There is action and there is character development, but the action is so slow and so wrapped in seemingly endless descriptive passages that the characters seem to be frozen figures from a video game with processor lag. I read the whole thing hoping for a change of pace (I was stuck on an airplane), but by the end of the third chapter I just did not care what happened to these muddle-headed muggles with their pseudo-Victorian sensibilities and their utter lack of any spark. I left the book on the plane."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow with little to no pizazz. Lots O' footnotes though.","review":"I bought this book based on some of the early reviews and I am having a hard time getting through it. It is slow, with not very much life to it. It is fantasy, but it is not very 'fantastic'. It might be a little too historically accurate for my, bogging down in the details instead of concentrating on plot-worthy events. The footnotes are fairly numerous and distracting. I am not sure if I will finish the book, similar to several other reviewers here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slow at first, picks up as it goes along, good character development","review":"The first two volumes can be rather slow in parts, but things really pick up and become quite engaging by the third, though perhaps almost too much of a rush to a conclusion as one nears the final chapters (but definitely not as obvious as one would see in the typical Hollywood blockbuster which crams endless car chases, explosions, and plot twists until the very end). The delta between \\"real\\" and alternative historical timelines is just the right amount, as is what's revealed (and not) about the Raven King. The degree to which one's feelings change about the various characters over the course of the interwoven stories is a good indication of how they're both multi-dimensional and believable. Definitely to be considered part of the fantasy genre canon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Long, Very Good","review":"The size of this book is overwhelming when you first look at it as a physical copy. Four page footnotes, a few black and white illustrations, small font, and an incredible number of pages. However, I gave this book five stars for a reason. If you're looking for a light read, it might not be what you need, but light-hearted is a better word. This is a fantasy novel of a different kind. It is not for children, but it is not too stale for any age as long as they can sit down to read it. The characters are amusing and likable (or easy to dislike, if that is what they are intended for), and the humor is subtle, ironic and witty. I don't bring myself to read on a non-stop basis, and I certainly don't read books of this volume, but I was intrigued in the first chapters, so I pressed on. It was worth it. The first few chapters are a bit slow, I suppose, but the writing style carries you through.Also, I suggest you read the footnotes. Everything is better if you read the footnotes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell","review":"I originally spotted this book while at a bookstore with my daughter. With almost 800 pages, a font size I found to be smaller then the norm, and subject matter that didn't seem as flashy as other books, I decided to take a shot and started reading it. I was very pleasantly surprised by the flow and interest this novel created. This book is not a \\"quick read\\" or a \\"sprint\\"... this is a \\"marathon.\\" I thoroughly enjoyed my time spent in England over the 10 years from 1806-7 to 1817 and I am now becoming a fan of historical thanks to Susanna Clarke. The end does indeed justify the means in this story and although there may be some slow convoluted it gradually makes sense as the pages progress. I highly recommend this to people who don't mind investing the time in a book and are already a fan or have interest in trying some historical fiction mixed with a bit of magic. Note - Don't expect Harry Potterish plot and action."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excessively Long and Pretentious","review":"I relish books with alternative history themes, settings in the 19th century, and touches of magic. This book contains all of those, yet I did not enjoy it at all. I found it ponderous and dull and the characters thoroughly unengaging. I was quite disappointed in it, and I don't believe I will read any of this author's work again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Marvelous adventure for nerds","review":"Wonderfully imaginative, expertly crafted, full of mind-boggling detail, I am thoroughly enjoying this book though my wrist is getting sore from holding it aloft. This tale of English Magic during the napoleonic wars is not for the feint of heart, by which I mean those without patience for gobs and gobs of glorious faux-historical detail. The footnotes are eye-killers, to be sure, but worth the strain. If you love immersing yourself in a well-crafted universe where anything is possible, you will probably love this."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book I've read - maybe ever","review":"I am not going to bore you with a description of the book. You can read that right above here. Let me say that this is the most original, refreshing, exciting book that I have come across in a long while. Though it is not an EASY read, you will enjoy reading every line, sometimes twice, and you will be surprised at the cleverness of it. I beg the author - write more! Magic does exist - at the hand of author Susanna Clark. What a gift she has given us!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindle Edition Problems","review":"[I only left a rating because I was forced to, it refers to the poor quality of the ebook, not the content of the story]I like the book so far as I have read it but I have to point out that the translation to the Kindle was not done well. There are many places where there are multiple words in a row without spaces between them. Less frequently are the first letters missing from words yet often enough that it deserves a mention.This is something I have not experienced in any of the other Kindle books I have read."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 Star because of the Kindle ebook","review":"I love this book, I own it in hard cover and paperback. It is a very big book though and hard to carry around for re-reading, so I purchased it on my Kindle. The translation to the ebook was horrible. Words and names were spaced in the middle of them, capitals when there shouldn't be and not where there should be. Words were missing, letters were missing. The first chapter was hard to read and confusing, even though I've read the book before. I did request a refund from Amazon. I hope they fix this, and if they do I would be more than happy to re-purchase it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Astounding!","review":"\\"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell\\" is, quite simply, one of the most breathtaking works of imagination I have ever had the pleasure to read. Not only does Susanna Clarke successfully create a sense of place in her novel, she creates a sense of place that is real and unreal, subject to wonder and enchantment, humor and terror. The characterizations in the book are fantastic; the wit is pervasive. The footnotes to events reinforce the depth of the story, weaving a mythology throughout the novel. The last third of the novel turns dark, very dark indeed, and I found that soon I was possessed by a sense of dread as events unfolded.For all of the length of \\"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell,\\" I felt that the novel ended too soon: such is the world that Susanna Clarke created. Magic, with its natural roots and stones and wind and water and flame and fire, seems so probable here. And so elemental. And so English!I cannot recommend this novel highly enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindle transfer is distractingly bad","review":"This is not a criticism of the story, which I enjoyed. This is an admonishment to Amazon on their pathetically poor effort at transferring this book to the Kindle format. Transfer errors are so common that hardly a page does not go by in which you as the reader are not yanked out of the flow of the story as you try to worry out what the original text was. It is as if someone was paid to cut the pages from the book, scan them into a computer, remove all of the white-space, and leave the computer to its best efforts to guess at the original words. Well fine if that is the only way to establish an electronic copy of the book, but I can think of no good reason why they did not employ a proofreader to correct the very numerous and obvious mistakes.Shame on you Amazon. This is NOT the quality of product that I was expecting when I purchased my Kindle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Floating into magic!","review":"It took me a few pages to get into the story, as the author takes you gingerly into the reality she has created for the readers, which is so close to mundane that you suspect that the story is just a mundane story about magic, until a few chapters later you find yourself burning the midnight oil. She describes the characters to sound, once again, quite normal, and a few words down the line you realize that the same characters are no more mundane than when a military general confides in you that the government is poisoning body fluids through tap water or some such quiet madness. She is witty, humorous, and makes imagination beautiful."},{"rating":"1","title":"fake victoriana - painfully slow","review":"The book is long but that isn't the problem; the problem is that it feels long. I have to confess i gave up after about 100 pages, but that shouldn't be an objection to a review - after all, does anybody blame you if you stop eating an unappetizing meal?The book: fake Victorian style - appealing at first ('finely wrought', a certain elegance of style) but then tiresome. PS - if I want Victorian style, I'll read one of the Victorians. After all, they lived it, and that shows.The plot - some kind of alternate history of England including magic. It took so long to get off the ground that it drove me slightly batty. I would've given up earlier if not for the desire to finish what I started.In short, I think the lavish praise for this book is just the punditocracy (the journalistic and literary establishment) reacting to the frills of style and the appearance of sophistication."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe it\`s me...............","review":"No one has mentioned! the major flaw! in the book so here goes! Every freekin character! speaks in breathless! rushes so that I can\`t concentrate on anything! other than the next exclaimation!

I think you should, Mr. Strange!\\"\\"Oh! said Lascelles.\\"\\"Oh! said Drawlight...\\"\\"Oh, that!\\" said Strange\\"Oh!\\" cried Drawlight.All this just on page 224 and 225.

Great reviews, I\`ll give you that, but just so you\`re warned Ms. Clarke\`s writing is dour and relentless!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Could've been better if you take out 200-300 pages","review":"It took me a very long time to read this book. I would've stopped reading it a while ago, but I wanted to see what all the hype was. Is it this chapter? No. Maybe it will be in the next one. Nope. The last 1/8 of the book held some dramatic tension I guess, but when Strange and Norrell meet again, they become friends. No magic fight. No human fight. No argument. 750 pages of building of the differences in views and opinions of these two magicians and at the end when you think there will be some kind of resolution to all of the long, long, long build up there is nothing. I felt drained after finishing this book, wishing I had never started it. So if you're looking for a very heavy paperweight, this book is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable, but just too long and rambling","review":"I did enjoy the half of Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell that I read, but I just got too darn tired to continue. I am happy to read big, bad, heavy books that will conk me in the head every time I try to read in bed. I quite enjoy English works that take a long time to build up to little or nothing if the journey is good. I freely admit I loved the historical style, complete with footnotes, in Jonathan Strange. It seemed like everything that I would want in a book, history, magic, written for grownups! But it was just too much reading with nothing going on to take. I have to agree with other reviewers, it is a personal style thing. Perhaps at another time in my life I will come back to it, but for now I'm okay with not knowing how it all ends up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Magical Snorefest","review":"After reading some of the reviews about this novel, I understand that there are people who love it for the writing style and supposed wit. I myself believe that a book on the best seller list should, at the very least, hold some entertainment value for almost everyone. After fighting my way through 300 pages of this cure for insomnia, I cannot for the life of me, understand what makes this book so wonderful. It is page after page after page of the most tedious, uninteresting drabble, occasionally interupted by a rare burst of actual excitement and innovative storyline.. The bursts are too few and far between. Maybe a degree in English lit would make this 10 lb. sedative more appealing, but I for one was greatly disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I made myself finish this book. It was tedious and horribly boring, all 800 pages. I would have much rather read a book about the footnotes because they were much more interesting. This book has about as much magic in it as a chopped onion does. Now I know why it took her ten years to write it; she kept getting bored and forgetting to write more. Why are all these pseudo authors recommending other books in almost all of these reviews? There is a special section for that and it's not in the review box. Yes this book is terrible but using the review area to plug for other books is disrespectful, and not helpful at all to people who are looking for a book review not an advertisement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interminable chore of a read","review":"I agree with the other reviewer - the writer is technically gifted so she deserves at least one star. After all it is her first attempt. But I forced myself to finish this book and lost all patience with her in doing so. The only character for whom I felt even the vaguest of stirrings of empathy was Stephen Black. The book lacked warmth. And she was allowed to be totally self-indulgent with the footnotes, which really grated on my nerves. This is a total shame. This same story could be told well. It simply isn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Magic should not be this dull","review":"What this book lacks in imagination and verve, it tries to make up for with footnotes and breathless, \\"Victorian\\" sounding prose.It doesn't work.Several of the characters spend a lot of time under some form of enchantment, but the enchantment itself is rather dull, and mainly consists of the characters being forced to dance when they really don't feel like dancing. This \\"enchantment,\\" and that term merits scare quotes, leaves the charaters listless in their daily lives. They are just sort of tired and bored, which is likely how you will feel when you are reading this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite books in the last 5 years.","review":"I was caught up in the world of this wonderful book, and enjoyed the sojourn immensely. Susanna Clarke has a gift for language, both description and dialog. It is a pleasure to read her work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Magic shouldn't be dull!","review":"I never finished this book. It was just too dull. Mr. Norrell is a thoroughly unpleasant character and it's a full 100 pages before the somewhat more interesting and likeable Jonathan Strange shows up. But by then the damage was done and I simply couldn't get into the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Much Like Assigned English Reading","review":"Many of the reviews of this book have noted how faithfully it recreates the literary ambiance of Regency or early Victorian novels. As far as I am concerned, that is the besetting flaw of this book--it is endlessly discursive. I freely admit that books of this nature were required reading for university English literature coourses, and being forced to read them may have poisoned my view of ALL novels in the genre, whether originals or, as here, deliberate copies. Nevertheless, I must say that \\"Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell\\" reminds me of nothing so much as a cross between \\"The Hobbit\\" and either \\"Silas Marner\\" or one of Anthony Trollope's more lugubrious novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bewildered but not bewitched","review":"As I was getting to the reviews here I noticed that the editorial review above used the expression \\"Sophisticated, witty...\\".Sophisticated and witty are two things that this book definitely isn't. It's predictable and obvious - you can practically hear the author's mind clunking uncomfortably. It is also not funny in the sense of \\"funny\\" generally used when talking about literature. In the sense of \\"funny\\" used when talking about daytime TV, maybe it is.Perhaps the book is an outstanding example of the Fantasy genre, I would't know. But as literature, or even a good read, it's an insult to your intelligence. Stay well away."},{"rating":"1","title":"so... very... long... and... boring...","review":"Susanna Clarke, Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell (Tor, 2004)After struggling with the first fifty pages of this book for almost three months, I finally gave up and hurled it out the window. I know it's a critical and fan favorite, but my god, people, the snail's pace? The thudding language that apes Dickens' worst paid-by-the-page excesses? (For an example of how to do this sort of thing correctly, I urge you towards Charles Palliser's The Quincunx.) A lack of characters who are in the least likable, or even empathetic in some negative, but compelling, way? No, thanks. Twenty thousand-odd books are published in America alone every year, and many thousands more around the world; far more than a body knows what to do with, and I'd much prefer spending my time reading the ones I'm actually going to enjoy.

Last week, after being snowed into my apartment with no access to the library, I gave it a shot. 200 pages in I tossed it across the room. Why, you ask? It's dull, it's depressing, it's slow, and it's just not entertaining. I could have watched reality TV that sparked more interest and pathos.At that point my friend calls, and says, \\"Oh, it picks up at the 300 page mark.\\"Right. I shouldn't have to trudge though 300 pages for a book to get entertaining. The editor of this novel should have been fired."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"I can't believe I bought this for a dollar! Great book, especially if you only paid a dollar. My copy is not for sale, sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"A meandering odyssey","review":"This fantasy novel had some good moments including some charming characters and witty prose. The first fifty pages had me enthralled and excited to snuggle down with an engaging read. The concept of reviving the magical arts in England could have been quite enchanting. However, it soon became a meandering odyssey without momentum making it an actual chore to read. It is unnecessarily long-winded and never really achieves anything. The numerous footnotes were annoying and further served to destroy the momentum. If it is important put it in the story. But I don't think this author really knew what was important to the story and just added everything they thought of. A great disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Moo.","review":"Clarke's novel is essentially pastiche. She has adopted (one can hardly say mastered) a certain voice then spends her many pages ruminating in it. But there is more --much more-- to good writing or storytelling than chewing the cud. One reads page after page longing for something to happen. It seldom does."},{"rating":"2","title":"classically stylistic and simple-yet-deeper profundity","review":"I'm inclined to admit, I seldom finish any fictional work, apart from \\"the classics,\\" aside from this one.You see, my bend is more toward the non-fiction. What interests me is natural medicine, metaphysics, quantum physics, aesthetics, psychology, etc.So I MUST say, this little piece was a serendipitous treasure, melding reason, knowing and beauty. A courtship between what I loved in fiction and lined-up with what I groped for in research. And it came without necessarily seeking it.Should you read it-- and if you are at all like me, you should-- pay attention to the two protagonists. One accumulates all and exercises little in action, a \\"heady\\" fellow; and the other practices all, groping for head knowledge. The dichotomy is brilliant, and each facet is part of a whole truth; not unlike our own."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of my favorite novels","review":"Absolutely, unequivocally, one of my favorite books of all time, if not THE favorite. The world the author weaves is believable, poignant, witty and magical. The book is so layered, and the characterization great. It really reads like a cross between Jane Austen, Tolstoy, Wilkie Collins and Harry Potter, if such a thing were possible. If you love one or two of these authors, you'll LOVE this! It's not at all dense and hard to read, as some reviewers have suggested. Sure, it's not Dan Brown, but neither is it War and Peace. A page-turner...classifiable as adventure or suspense. The ending was so gripping I was pretty much skimming things to find out what happened!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Argh!","review":"The first 100 or so pages were excellent. After that, it was tedious at best. Much time is devoted to major charachters like Mr. Segundus, who then tend to vanish entirely for several hundred pages.The book could have used a brutal editor to cut it down to a fraction of its current size, and it would have been far more readable. Its a pity, because the core of a really fantastic saga is clearly there. But it gets buried under piles of mush."},{"rating":"1","title":"No footnotes on Kindle Touch","review":"I was excited to get this book, since I have arthritis and reading the hard copy just doesn't work for me. But there are extensive footnotes, and those are not accessible on my Kindle Touch. (Yes, I did check with customer service about this, and other Kindles may be able to access them.) I have no idea how important those footnotes are to the story, since the hard copy is out for me. But at the very least it should be stated somewhere that Kindle Touch owners are buying an incomplete copy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long, longer, longest","review":"I was very anxious to read this book that I had heard was meant to be oddly fascinating and curious and intelligent...however, although the author is obviously quite keen on discourse and perhaps history and tries for an interesting yarn, this story lacks any real aspect of great storytelling. I found myself pushing and pushing myself through the book at all stages. It is very much a long-winded work and, once you're half way through, you know you're INVESTED so heavily that you are unable to drop it before reaching the glory of the story ending. But when the outcome is sadly lacking, you'll find yourself suffering great pangs of remorse for having wasted your precious time. I think what happened here is that the author had a great first draft on her hands but the thing was so bloody long she couldn't bear to take a crack at re-writing it to make it great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Piece of Work","review":"This is quite possibly one of the best books I have read. I was a little disappointed by the ending, but the many pages it took to get to that point were absolutely delightful and well worth it. Clarke weaves mystery, adventure, humour, romance, suspense, and magic together in a most superior way. I found myself rereading many passages in awe of her writing style. I highly recommend anyone read this book, as there is something in it for lovers of all genres. Once you start Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell, you will not be satisfied until you have reached the very end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strange but Good!","review":"I quite agree with other reviews : this book should not be picked up if you want fast-paced, non-stop action. Ditto if you are looking for the second coming of Harry Potter. This book is a whole different story. I loved the descriptions, the long character developments, the use of old English and the not-so-clear bad versus good war.It is a long book. I read it in a week and a half which, for me anyway, is a long time to read any novel. But I did enjoy every moment, actually slowing to reread some paragraphs. It's not a \\"on the edge of your seat\\" kind of book but you do want to know what is coming around the corner. I also enjoyed the other characters, other then Mr Norrell & Mr Strange. It's rare in books that you want to know what happens to other, lesser charcaters just as much, if not more so, as you do the main ones.As a first novel, this is hard to beat. As a novel, the research involved must have been incredible! Hats off to Ms Clarke!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Richly woven tapestry","review":"I don't think I can add much more to what has already been noted by other reviewers for this book (there are so many reviews), but I did want to add another 5-star rating to its credit.This isn't a \\"hold on to the seat of your pants\\" kind of book, but is instead a very intelligent and thoughtful novel that focuses on an imaginative, inventive, and magical alter-England. It does require patience to read because of the sheer enormity of the novel, but the rich descriptions and characters build up the story in well-developed layers, making it a sincere pleasure to read.I sincerely hope that Ms. Clarke continues to explore her writing potential--because with this as her first offering, I can't wait to see what else she has to offer in future!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bad...","review":"A great, imaginative story that could have been more effectively told in half the length.I ended up skipping whole pages b/c the extraneous descriptions and actions went on and on and on.I liked the story, but the book was torture to get through in some spots."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of Hype...","review":"I bought this book due to the fantastic articles written in the New York Times Book Review, Entertainment Weekly, etc. While this book has incredible detail and constructs an elaborate world, I had to force myself to stay with the plot and continue reading.As a former graduate student, I am used to books that are intricate, scholarly and somewhat dry. Around 500 pages in, however, I gave up on this one. Perhaps, I might return someday to find out what happens. But at the moment, I prefer to spend my time reading something more engaging."},{"rating":"2","title":"A few magical moments . . .","review":"Not only could this book give readers a concussion if it fell on them while they drifted off to sleep, (heavy, huge hardback edition), but at times it could quite possibly be the cause of the sleepiness. Still, big and unwieldy as it is, the book is worth a look.Susanna Clarke's book, heralded by some critics, is, in my humble opinion, a strange combination of wonderful prose and monotonous blandness, interspersed with a dribblingling of truly inspired and magical moments. The search for those moments is what kept me determined to finish this lengthy undertaking. But in the end, and though the writer indeed deserves praise for weaving a story of this verbal magnitude together, there just weren't enough of those magical moments to allow me to feel satisfied.In the end, what comes to mind is that reading this book was a bit like reading one of those textbooks that Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell spent so much of their time with. Just add the dust."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely Overrated","review":"I bought this book because it had such good reviews, but found myself wanting to put it down often. Well, it is completely overrated and much too long. Although fairly well-written, it is slow and not exciting at all. I can at least say that about the Harry Potter series. Thing LONG and hard about bothering with this slow moving sleeper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, boring, boring","review":"If you liked Harry Potter don't read this book. Over 200 pages into the book and they are still yakking and haven't done anything much to speak about. I did not even finish this book since is was soooo boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to read","review":"First, I have to say that I only got through 50 pages of the book. It was slow going from a plot point of view. Also, my 63 year old eyes had GREAT difficulty with the small print. I'm sure it was done to keep down the size of the book - it's over 1000 pages in paperback as it is - but it is very difficult to read. In addition to the small print, the pages are quite faint, making it even more difficult. Perhaps if the plot had been worth it, I might have persevered, but..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull and disorganized","review":"The premise of this book is quite good. However, the writing style is undeniably British. None of the main characters are particularly sympathetic, nor are motivations well explored. Some of the smaller characters are interesting and sympathetic, but my favorite of them just vanished in the middle of the book with no explanation whatsoever. Even the ones that don't per se vanish, like Lord Byron, appear to be randomly thrown in to provide a bit of color to the incredibly dull protagonists and don't seem to really advance the storyline. I read it all the way through because I couldn't believe that a book with the reviews that this one is getting wouldn't get better, but it didn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is boring.","review":"I was excited to read this book but could not get past the first hundred pages. It was just dull, and I found myself forcing myself to read it.It's well written, but there is too much information to take in, the end notes were annoying, and I didn't enjoy the form of the novel. It was just off-putting altogether."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry Who?","review":"I never \\"got\\" the Harry Potter thing. As a lifelong reader of Tolkein the appeal of a children's book about magic, however thick, eludes me. When I read the original reviews for this book in other media I was intrigued not by the comparisons to Harry Potter but by the substance of the book itself. I think that if the Harry Potter comparisons are marketing driven, they do a disservice to the author. This novel is much more mature, and more of an indulgence in language and character than any children's novel could hope to be. Perhaps some of the other 'adults' that are such fans of the children's fantasy genre ought to work their way up to grown up literature. Harry Potter is a good start, but the writen word is meant to inspire and entertain on its own. You dont need a thrill a minute. An English moor delivered by the pen of a competent author, and appreciated by a sophisticated reader are what literature is all about."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very slow read","review":"Based on it being a number one bestseller and highly rated fantasy novel, I eagerly started this book. After about 200 pages, I wondered when the plot would start moving forward. Written like a historical narrative from the 1800s, it teases the reader to keep turning the pages but many of the payoffs are muted and felt like you're reading a history book. The overall story is interesting, but it takes about 650 pages to pick up the pace. The fantasy element is minimal, but it gives a good impression of an English magician in the 1800s."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Didn't Know Magic Could Be So Boring!!","review":"I only read about half of this book which still came out to 400 pages. The story drags along worse than any other book I have read. I was confused by all the praise. Perhaps the readers who liked it are more history rather than fantasy readers. It dragged along and even when magic did occur it was described in such a mater of fact manner that it had no impact. The Characters really had no major redeeming characters and after one of the characters had a loved one die clearly by magic they did nothing about it.The part of the book that had so much to work with regarding the Napoleonic Wars could have been so exciting but was another event to be ticked off in the chapters.If you are used to more fast paced or even remotely exciting fiction DO NOT READ THIS BOOK. If you like stories that are well researched alternative histories where the characters are secondary to the setting you might like this book. Overall: Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Successfully creates a world where magic is possible","review":"Susanna Clarke's novel transgresses the boundaries of Victorian literary fiction, fantasy, and the historical novel. As a fan of some of the Victorians myself, I found Clarke's imitation of their writing style and novelistic structure to be quite precise. Her concerns with the human soul, with survival after death, and with the struggle of good and evil within a human being are both modern and typical of the 19th century.The reader slowly walks into a world that is partly familiar and partly quite bizarre. It's the English drawing-room, calling-card era, with the overlay of magic, an art that is allegedly long forgotten. Clarke's mock-scholarly footnotes are charming.However, the book takes just a bit too long to get started and to invite the reader in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very imaginative and well-written!","review":"In spite of the other reviewers that didn't like this book, I enjoyed it a lot. It COULD have been better with some editing, (I wonder how much was edited out!)but all in all, it was well-written, and a great plot. It's hard to find well-written books. I would recommend this book for patient readers who enjoy a well-crafted book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant contemporary fiction fashioned in the style that is wonderously vintage","review":"For those of you who prefer your books time-tested for quality, I believe this book to be worthy of reading again and again; it is my hope that our contemporary readers will, in time, elevate Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell to the level of a classic. Suzanna Clarke crafts a tale that is designed for those who have an attention span for literature of the 19th century, but rather with a cunning imagination that is tangibly surreal. I can only apologize for the quality of my own writing...I am a far superior painter who has read and listened to this book six times over the past 3 years and I have not exhausted my delight in her word choice, the development of her characters, and her bizarre use of pineapples. I only wish I knew more people that I could buy this book for...it's a challenge to make friends painting all night in one's studio."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me","review":"I had greatly looked forward to the publication of this book. The early reviews made it sound like just the sort of work I would like. And the rave from one of my favorite authors (Palliser, author of \\"The Quincunx) further whetted my appetite.I read and read and read before I finally gave up. I just don't see anything here worthy of merit. The characters are wooden and the plot all but non-existent.I would say that Ms. Clarke is a British Anne Rice--not a compliment in my book. Certainly she is no Rowling.Obviously many readers were greatly attracted to this book. I'm just not one of them. And whatever an amateur's opinion is worth, that's mine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super book, poor ink","review":"This book, Johathan Strange & Mr. Norrell: a Novel, delivers everything promised on the inside and back cover blurbs. Unfortunately, it is rather a physical trial to read in its standard paperback format. After all, it is 835 pages long, and the reader needs to constantly struggle to keep the pages both open and within the binding. The ink on my copy is very faint, and the print tiny. It's a challenge for both muscle coordination and eyes. I love a lengthy novel, the longer the better for me, but this book is set aside for the time being. I would rather have spent a bit more and gotten a larger bundle: large enough to contain all those pages comfortably and bright enough to read smoothly and easily, with a slightly larger font."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engaging","review":"It's been a while since I read this book, but I found it extremly engaging and very enjoyable.I enjoyed it so much that I gave my mom the audio book, which she enjoyed."},{"rating":"1","title":"needed a good editor","review":"Clever, well written, enjoyable book, but way too long.

Very light reading, and does not deserve the accolades according it status of good literature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"This book stinks. From the start it was a hard slow read. It never took off and the characters were boring. PLEASE do not ever compare this book to Harry Potter there is no way it ever comes close to JK's great books. I bought the hardback version because I read the \\"glowing\\" reviews. Now I'd be glad to sell mine for $10 bucks and take the loss gracefully.Star"},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't even describe how inflated the ego is.","review":"Here is my 5 theses regarding this horrid novelFirst, Clarke uses the plot mainly as a giant anticliche against all other fantasy booksSecond, She elaborates more on insignificant people by writing long footnotes that only stress your eyes with the sall printThird, She lacks good variety in character, and her style practicaly causes characters to contradict themselvesFourth, the story is MASSIVELY discursiveFifth, you say the writing is beautiful? Her style is very modern and, once again, discursive. She directly refers to and converses directly with the reader too infrequently, as well as writing rhetorical questions, prose of her own. Her style is a sad attempt to bring the book an antique feel to it, but I myself write like that, and I'm twelve...HER WRITING IS CHILDISH!Any good quality there may be is definitely overshadowed by the above."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did you all actually read it?","review":"First off, I am an avid reader and love a long challenging read, however, this novel is one of the worst I have ever read! It is long, boring and has absolutely no plot. I purchased it when it first came out without reading any reviews. Although from the looks of most of them here, I personally suspect that many of those who raved, never actually read the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somebody Help Me Read This Thick Book","review":"I bought this book used from Amazon for 99 cents - hard cover copy, too. Unfortunately, although it came highly recommended from a friend, I have yet to survive beyond the first chapter. The problem is this book is so enormous that it is impossible to bring on subways or planes. And at home I usually fall asleep before I can finish reading 10 pages (it is so heavy, it is even difficult to read in bed or on the couch!). The prose really takes a long time for one to get into. I've had it for months. I've since seen that the publisher has brought it out in 3 separate volumes. Better buy that one if you are the type who can't stand reading jumbo thick books. (Needless to say, I have never read \\"War and Peace\\")."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you love being bored to death...","review":"...then this book is for you. I can't believe I wasted hours of my life on a book where nothing happens. A friend gave me this book as a christmas present and I felt obligated to read it; mistake on my part.

Bottom line is this book is crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious text","review":"I fell for all the positive hype and purchased this book expecting greatness. I was sadly disappointed. The characters were not that interesting really and the plot tended to drag, very heavily at times. An adult Harry Potter this is not nor is it a \\"fantasy\\" novel as most would expect. I plodded through the whole thing, determined to find what everyone liked about this book. I guess I missed it."},{"rating":"1","title":"BOOOOOORRRRRING","review":"I kept thinking something would happen in this book but nothing every materialized. The best part of the book was the story at the end of the book, that had nothing to do with the main story, about the Raven King.

Don't waste your time there are better books available."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I could give it zero...","review":"I don't often bother with reviews, but this book is just so boring I feel compelled to type about it just to have gained some entertainment from it at all. I read a lot of books and this is only one of two books I've ever read in 25 years that I did not enjoy at all. I lost interest in it before I was half through it, but insisted on soldiering through it. It was so slow and dry it took me a full two weeks to finish it (though I can typically read a book this long in about three days).I let my sister borrow it with a warning that she wouldn't like it and she never finished it and is convinced I gave it to her to punish her for some insult she had paid me. It's a personal thing really, obviously plenty of people liked it. I honestly wanted to like it as well, but just couldn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money and time!!","review":"Reading other reviews giving this 5 stars has become too much for me. I truly do not understand how anyone finished this book. The footnotes taking up sometimes overhalf the page made me feel like I was reading a research paper and not a very interesting one either. The best two words to describe this book are TEDIOUS and BORING!!! I read fiction for pleasure. There was no pleasure in reading a single page of this book. I did not finish it. I could think of no reason to continue to waste my time. I was not enjoying it or learning anything. I bought this based on reviews and wish I had saved my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"This book was absolutely horrible. I am a hugh fan of Harry Potter. JK Rowing creates a world of magic you can believe in and a main character that seems genuine, like a boy you could know. This book does none of the above. With a ridiculous amount of footnotes and a painful slow pace this author truly wasted my time. Don't let it happen to you."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a bore!","review":"I agree with the last two posted reviews that this book was a huge disappointment. After reading some of the hype and reviews on Amazon, I thought I was in for a great fiction read that I would be hard pressed to put down. What a joke! I found it tedious, the footnotes irritating, and dull overall...I also did not get past page 150. Maybe I can sell on Ebay?"},{"rating":"1","title":"799 pages too much","review":"The lowest I can go is 1 star - this book is so boring, un-interesting, lacking any high- or low points, that it is app.799 pages too long. A cocking book for British Food might be more exciting and interesting. The Author moves along the story very slowy - the points are missing and the conclusion is just about the most awfull. The book could be written in one page - pupil fight teacher, teacher fight pupil - during that the consequences for the rest of the world is nearly horrible.Next to that, the plot is completely un-realistic and a kind of very sought for - The Author obviously hoped to be the next J.K. Rowling - but Harry Potter by many length beats Mr. Norrell and even though Harry Potter is a book for children - it's far better than this. Don't waste your money or time on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A labor... not necessarily of love","review":"If it hadn't been for my strong determination to finish everything I start, I would have put this book down weeks ago. The first four hundred pages were soooooooo slow. I used to avoid the book, try to hide it somewhere and forget it, but this determination told me that I had to finish and know if it was worth the time. Having finished it last night I can say that it's a \\"good book\\". That's all I'd give it. Ask me in a month and I won't remember the plot nevermind the intricacies-- not exactly the stamp of a great novel. The last two hundred pages gripped me, I couldn't wait to turn the page, but did I really have to wade through 600 pages to get there? This book should have been edited to half its size... less is sometimes more. I wish someone had told Susanna Clarke that."},{"rating":"1","title":"It is about magic but there is no magic in it","review":"Just a look at several different reviews and you get the idea - people either love that book or are bored to death. I honestly tried - and reached about half through before I decided that life was too short to spend it on this volume.There is no plot - really, there isn't. The so called \\"well developed characters\\" are indeed, well developed - at the very beginning, but after that they simply do not change that much. Nothing happens for pages and pages. I do admit that the language is beautiful and text-wise it is good work.But \\"Lord of the Rings\\" keeps you in its magic spell when you read it, or \\"Big Fish\\" or \\"Time Enough For Love\\" or LeGuin's EarthSea books. They all have magic. This one doesn't - even though it is written about it. I simply did not want to meet any of the characters again and for me that's enough reason not to finish the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loved the prologue but...","review":"This was recommended to me by a friend. He knows I love Dickens and said this book was like reading the same but with magic. When I read the prologue, I agreed and I began loving this book. But when I got to chapter 3, I realized the tone of the book had completely changed and I was not enjoying it. I did try because the writing is very good, but I couldn't make it beyond chapter 7 without giving up. I wish the book would have had the same comical flare that it did in the prologue. Not for me, but maybe for others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jonathan Strange and Mr Morrell","review":"A first indicator of what you're going to experience in this book is the fact that the introduction is by Neil Gaiman. If you know of and like his work, this is your book ... although it is quite, quite different from much of what Mr. Gaiman does.With over 700 other customer reviews, I don't want to go into a lot of details about my personal experience with this work. I just want to record for the ages that I think this book is utterly entrancing in a slightly creepy way. It's a bent and dark world of astonishing characters and relationships and plots. It's not for your average fantasy reader at all, though. Whoever you are, be ready for something that might be unlike anything you've read in years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadfully Boring, Only Daffy Chimps Would Like This","review":"This redefines the word 'piffle'.

It seemed a mass mailing to any who had purchased it and mentioned the numerous typos in the edition I had received and said a corrected one was now available. To get it, all I had to do was reply by email \\"yes.\\" Why this step? Downloading the new version would wipe out any notes etc. I might have put in the original edition, so they were avoiding do that without my permission. Nicely done, Amazon! I am now almost done reading the revised kindle edition and the typos are indeed gone.Original review: Fabulous book but the kindle edition introduces numerous typos (scanning errors?) not found in the print (HB) edition and not all the footnotes are hot linked.

Mary is able to capture that intrinsic beauty of his sea and his poetry in this wonderful book of art. And you could ask for no better translator than Alastair Reid. Neruda loved how he'd walk barefoot all around his house and the beach at Isla Negra barefoot. And he loved his translations, as do I. Neruda said that \\"to me, the ocean is an element like air.\\" This book of his poems about his sea, combined with the sublime blues of Mary Heebner's art, makes for such a great book for your coffee table, or as a gift, as I have given it now to six different people.--Mark Eisner, editor ofThe Essential Neruda: Selected Poems"},{"rating":"2","title":"Neruda Poems","review":"I think Neruda is the most passionate poet I have read. There are many poets that have love and passion and pain and joy to write about, but Neruda does it with such ease. Reading his poems is like drinking a fine wine, his words warm you and for that brief moment you are alone with them you feel free and inspired. Unlike the wine though, Neruda's words linger with you days, months, years after you consume them. What a true work of written art!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A story of friendship and courage","review":"\\"The Big Wave,\\" by Pearl S. Buck, is a short novel that takes place in Japan. The main characters are Kino, a farm boy who lives on a mountainside, and his good friend Jiya, who is the son of a fisherman. The two boys bond despite the cultural differences between the farming and fishing communities. But with the presence of a volcano and the threat of the great ocean wave of the book's title, life holds danger for these boys.This is a simple but beautifully told tale. Buck's themes include courage in the face of danger, the impact of geography upon the lives of the Japanese people, and the cycles of death and life. But most of all the book is about hope and friendship. For a good companion text, try one of Laura Ingalls Wilder's books."},{"rating":"2","title":"11 year old review","review":"The Big Wave is a book about two families that live in Japan and one BIG wave!Kino a Japanese boy lives in the \\"midst of danger\\" with the ocean in front of him and a volcano behind him.

I consider this book to be mindless and confusing. You don't know if the author is talking about something the boys are doing at the moment or if the boys are recalling the past. I say a big no-no.

Rather than some sort of \\"sell-out\\", Blue represents the musical maturation of the band. And it rocks very very hard, too.

Plus they tried something different with much more melodies in the chorus of some of the songs of this album and on the 5 song EP that came out shortly before. I think it's a bad idea for them. David Yow just can't sing this type of song, plus it doesn't have the scary sound of the Jesus Lizard, which make them so incredible.

I look back at what my mom used to tell me about how kids held her back from what she wanted to do, and I realize (with the help of this book) what she ment. Not that was being rude when she said this, just that it is a fact that our patriarchal society uses motherhood to put women in 'their place'. Please if their is one book you take time to read make it this one. Rich writes this analytical book in such a way as to make it sound personal and interesting...not dry and dull.

I have read dozens of books about pregnancy, birth, babies and motherhood, and this blows them all out of the water. Rich's prose is poetry, and her research and scholarship are vast and impeccable. The critical reviews that report that she \\"didn't like motherhood\\" missed the point by a long shot (and misquote her). Rich's love for her three sons is clear throughout the book, but she does not shy away from acknowledging and facing the struggles that she faced as a mother. With this book, she explores the profound historical and cultural context in which all Western women experience both the bliss and the difficulties of motherhood. Of Woman Born is a huge gift to all people-- mothers, daughters, and sons.

There is a profound integrity that never slips into a self-righteousness. HIs letter to Martin Dorp is an excellent example.

So glad to see Melissa Kaplan is still putting her brilliance to work in Mercury. Stand out tracks are: Solar/Lunar- which would fit happily on Space Mountain or the Serenity soundtrack, Six-step dragon- an absolutely beautiful synth-asian peice, and Dragonfly.A word of caution:As with the case of much of Splashdown's stuff, you may not like this music the first time you hear it. It's very dissonant, oddly unlike what western ears are trained to hear. KEEP LISTENING.

Malice and Pusha T do not have great voices, and somewhat wasted these excellent beats that they were given. They could've used more guest appearances to improve their marketing and performance.

The one complaint i have about this cd is the people that the clipse have on as guests. They could have been left out. Except for Fabolous, he has a tight verse n possibly one of the hottest lines on the cd. \\"Virginia\\" is definately one of the hottest tracks on the album... i kno people that dont live in VA ride to this track. I dont kno what people are thinking when they say that pusha n mal cant rhyme cuz they hold it down throughout the album.

To understand this book, you should have prior coursework experience in at least several upper division undergraduate courses in mathematical statistics and probability theory. The structure of this book is also that of a typical math book; full of proposition, corollary, lemma, etc, and very limited use of illustrations (e.g., there is no single figure up to chapter 6).I wanted a book with a mathematical sophistication simliar to Durbin's book, but this book is way more than that.

Still, I very much enjoyed it not only to see my friend who has since passed away, but also because it was shot in my hometown so there are a lot of familiar locations that give me a rush of satisfaction every time I see them. This film was made for practically nothing and I give the director a lot of credit. Instead of having very tacky horror effects that he couldn't afford anyway, he does a decent job of evoking the scares through power of suggestion. That alone makes this pretty unique for a film of this type. I understand it's selling well in England, doubt anyone here in the U.S. knows about it. You have to really love this genre to appreciate this film but I do feel it probably serves as a good example to film students as to what can be done with almost nothing."},{"rating":"2","title":"MUST HAVE!!","review":"I use this pump for both Shraeder and Presta valves.

It looks like on the photo, not like described. I bought mine yesterday at local R.E.I. store, and it worked great. It was simple to use and I was done with adjusting the pressure in few minutes. On my bike, I had to remove the wheel first due to the position of the valve on the shock (Cannondale's Headshock, with valve which is likely impossible to access with any pump without taking the wheel off). If I had \\"classic\\" type of suspension fork with more accessible valve location (i.e. not needing to remove the wheel first), it would take only few seconds.

In this way, the book prepares the ground for a complicated argument in which long-term/ sytemic factors intermingle with the short-term factors, like Gorbachov's comimg to power in the SU, and presents a very readable and interesting account for the students of this important question of modern European history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Refreshingly simple","review":"A very insightful book that helps you to understand your own personality and to accept other people as they are.

Honestly, I have never found it helpful to look deeper and deeper inside of my person or psyche because I find the same person everytime I look. A wretched sinner in need of a Savior.

Yet Florence has taken concepts that in reality are probably much more complex and reduced them to a usable format. This book will make you laugh - mark my words you will believe Florence spent weeks observing you. I'm not convinced that our personality traits are innate (rather than a product of our environment) as Florence argues, but regardless of this, the advice is no less powerful.

George and Lous still are great performers and the renditions of the songs are ok, but the video quality (a non-anamorphic, letterboxed image that lacks sharpness) sucks. And where is the Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround audio advertised in the package? I could only find a 2.0 analog track that comes mostly from the center channel and sounds mono for me. As bonus material there's a behind-the-scenes documentary that just made me wonder about what two of the finest black players/musicians from the 70's were doing there. Just embarassing.

Although the book doesn't explain every site on the walking tours, it does give an overall, helpful picture of the tours in general. It also tells about the hot clubs and places to go, with regular updates and good descriptions.However, if you're looking for excursions outsiode of Boston, or are, like me, a new resident of Boston, you may not want to get this book, becauise it focuses on the Boston area.

I thought the book was sick. It turns women into an object of function. It also talks about men being 100% head of the household and women being 100% submissive. The authors are a husband and wife but I can't hear a woman's voice anywhere in this book. The cover is pretty so she probably had something to do with that.

These chapters helped me tremendously in finding out what God intended for sex and pleasing my wife. All the tips he gives in these chapters are very long and tedious. If you think you have these problems prepare yourself for some fun but hard work. Lots of practice sessions with total vulnerability with your partner. And probably with some disappointments. It can be tedious reading but stick with it, it is helpful. Some of the commentary is very clinical and dry, but helpful when you apply it. I really saw the heart of the writers, which is to help and instruct people to have the most fulfilling sex life as possible.

It has been very helpful to both of us, we wanted a Christian based book on God's design for sex in marriage. We also wanted input on what to expect the wedding night to be like since we're virgins, it has a wonderful chapter that talks directly to engaged/newly weds about that first night. We would highly recommend this book to other couples who want a biblical view of sex in marriage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Christian Book on Sex in Marriage","review":"This book would be excellent as a gift for the intended before they get married.

Upon receipt I immediately turned to the section on pregnancy and birth control as I am an avid supporter of the protection of the unborn babies in our world. I was HORRIBLY dissapointed at the presentaiton of the material in this section. This is supposed to be a 'Christian' book yet they used terms like 'fertilized egg' instead of baby to explain the way that birth control pills can prevent the implantation of a baby into the womans womb. They even say that if that occured it wouldn't be an abortion of a baby. Any basic sex ed class teaches that fertilization occurs BEFORE the egg reaches the womb; actually occuring in the fallopian tubes. Needless to say I CANNOT recommend this book for any person seeking Biblical teaching on planning a family. \\"Children are a reward from the Lord\\" and \\"Blessed is the man whose quiver is full of them\\" Psalms"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so hot.","review":"I was given this book by my therapist to read. I found that a few points were interesting and informative, but overall, the book was a snooze. It seems to be made for the older crowd, not so much the young twenty-something-to-be-newlywed. Chapter 10 is ESPECIALLY a crock, titled, \\"The 'Perfect' Wife.\\" That was what really turned me off to the book and made me think this was totally not worth my time. There are much better books on this subject out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fantastic book for newly married couple","review":"After our marriage, we attended a Marriage growth camp, during the camp, the speaker spoke about this book and we decided to purchase it, it was a fantastic book for newly married couple. we began to enjoy reading and exploring each other."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too clinical, yet not enough information","review":"This was the first book I read for help on marital intimacy. It was a wedding gift from a friend that meant well. I read all of it, and found only the most basic info of it helpful in any meaningful way. My husband read the first few chapters, and was so turned OFF by what it said that he stopped there, and I can't blame him. Clinical, humorless, and not at all relatable, not to mention all the issues, techniques, etc that was not even addressed by the authors. I gave my copy away.I've since read many, many other books, and can highly recommend \\"Sheet Music\\" (for both genders) by Kevin Leman, \\"The Sexually Confident Wife\\" by Shannon Ethridge for women, and \\"Sex, Romance, and the Glory Of God\\" for men by C.J. Mahaney."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good book","review":"I got this book as part of premarriage counseling, and overall it was a good book. Good information for people of various sex knowledge levels. However, the book was comical at points and seemed a bit old fashioned/impractical. For example, a wife should have dinner on the table and look her best when her husband comes home from work. It also said that couples should not own a TV for the first year of their marriage. Already broke that rule."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not accept the item.","review":"I did not accept the item and I will not order any furniture on line any more.

The reader is transported into the world of the 1960's & 1970's, when little was known in the medical and educational communities about children with undiagnosable conditions. In a time where warehousing handicapped children was encouraged, Bill & Sarah Bryce bravely navigated the turbulent waters of ignorance, nonchalance & anger. Instead of giving up hope, they sought help in both conventional and unconventional arenas and were successful. This book is a lesson in tenacity, courage and love."},{"rating":"1","title":"Create too much signal degradation","review":"I do not recommend this product.

The story book approach was not particularly appealing to me, but the errors of fact, particularly early on in the story, tainted my opinion nearly from the outset. I would not recommend this book to anyone interested in actual details, but I would recommend it as a story book to be read to or by younger children who might enjoy a summary account of Boone's adventures."},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing Series","review":"This is but Part 1 of a 3 part series on the amazing VW Beetle.Rather well done,with excellent narration and emotional background music.I bought my copy of the series back in the mid 90s when Rocky Mountain Motorworks was the exclusive retailer.Very expensive videos,nonetheless worth every dime.Chapter 1 is very historical...lots of original videos and still shots.Later chapters covered the VW ads in America (and Doyle Dayne Burnbach's selling techniques),and an amazing look at what it takes to build a Beetle on the assembly line,accompanied by a very catchy \\"imported\\" soundtrack,and a running scroll on the bottom of the screen charting the Beetle changes from 1949-up to the (then) current.When they made this series,they did it right.Shame its not on DVD.....its the best Beetle videos yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"book retired for copying whole sections","review":"This book copied whole sections of flying by D'Exupery and was therefore retirted from print."},{"rating":"1","title":"ladies watch","review":"this watch arrived with no working battery; i have to buy a new battery; from now on, i'll buy my watches from a store where i can see first hand if they are any good"},{"rating":"2","title":"easy to read watch","review":"I like this watch for the easy to read dial, the minute demarcations on it and it's good for people with small wrists. The only thing is it may not have a good seal (of its glass). I took an airplane (I don't know if that's related) and when I arrived I noticed it had condensation under the glass which would sometimes almost disappear but never totally. So it looks like there's water under the glass which is not good. And they (lorus) don't carry these anymore & don't repair them. They can only replace it with a different watch. So hopefully it won't happen to yours."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cathartic end to an inspiring epic","review":"The Power that Preserves is the stunning conclusion to the finest fantasy series since The Lord of the Rings. Once again Thomas Covenant returns to the land, which has been ravaged in the wake of the Illearth War. He must finally come to terms with the rape of Lena, with his leprosy and with The Land. Ultimately, the book is about how even a leper can fight off despair -- or can he? If he can redeem his own sorry self, he can redeem The Land. After the high of the Illearth War, the best of the series, the Power that Preserves is more subdued and philosophical, but you will not be disappointed...After you savor the end of the series for about a year, give the second series a shot. It's not as good, but still far superior to the schlock pervading fantasy shelves nowadays."},{"rating":"2","title":"a good sendoff for the trilogy","review":"I found one narrative flaw in this book--the revelation thatthe Land is more likely to be real than merely the product ofCovenant's imagination as demonstrated by scenes of the Lords before Covenant's advent into the Land. Aside from this, the book continues faithfully the tale of the Unbeliever in the Land. The ending, despite superficial cliches, was very good. In fact, given the evidence in the rest of the series, there was no other way to end the story. However, I consider the strong qualities of the book to outweigh the narrtive weaknesses to such an extent I will grant it five stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Fantasy ever!","review":"This is the most breathtaking book I ever read. It is full of darkness and misery, but on every page there is a piece of hope, of believe in a man that doesn't know himself, that can't handle life itself. You have to read this, it's an unforgetable experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"What more could you ask for","review":"This is the most enthralling book of the First Chronicles. I get such a sense of awe when following Mhoram's thoughts, inner struggles, hope and eventual victory. Ne'er have I found such emotional writing, it's not deep like the Second Chronicels, but it inundates you with emotion."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Fantasy.","review":"The first time, I read these three books over a weekend--of course that is all I did. These first three books of Thomas Covenant, Lord Foul's Bane, The Illearth War and Power That Preserves remain for me the measure by which all other fantasy is measured (including the later books of Mr. Donaldson.) In 1979 when I asked the author how he had tied up all the characters and plots to produce an ending so worthwhile, he said he wrote the book backward from the ending to the beginning. Thomas Covenant is not an inviting character all the more amazing then is his transformation. The first 50 pages are difficult, but wonders await. After 30 years I am reading them the third time. Donaldson's imagination is staggering. His use of the English language wondrous. Please endure the beginning, the ending is well worth difficulty in the beginning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best in the series so far.","review":"I was purely shocked by this volium.The first one was pretty good,the second one was quite mediocre,but this one was the bomb!It was interesting,(like usual)quite fast moving,and had a wonderful ending.Unfortunately,I cannot tell you the ending except for the fact that its wonderful.I loved how Bannor and Foamfollower came back in,they were some of my favorite characters.I also enjoyed how dark and foreboding the style was.Any Donaldson fan is in for a treat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Series is not worth the time. . .","review":"You can also read my review of the series in my review of the 1st book. Basically, I just want to restate how un-impressed and how boring this un-inspiring series was. Donaldson focuses so heavily on his writing style and his portrayal of a one-dimensional self-pitying Covenant that he forgot to write a story which would captivate his audience. Instead he writes a very rudimentary, unimaginative, predictable plot with flat unbelievable characters. My suggestion is not to waste your time reading this series as I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"very dark","review":"Time in the Land has made Covenant out of place in any world. The fruits of his actions haunt him, and his search for peace drives him to the brink of death, a thing that would make too many people witout hearts rejoice. Yet, his heart has been cured of leprosy, even if his body is sicker than ever. So, when he has the chance to save a child, he takes the risk of condemning the Land to save her. Then, he is given the chance to rectify his error and is taken to the Land to find it changed. The Bloodguard and Giants are no more, the girl who loved him is old and insane. It's now or never for the Unbeliever to face Lord Foul, but with a heart so filled with lornness, how can he fight despair incarnate?This book is another winner, one that reminds us that hope always lives."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dreamy","review":"The outcast is back for a third time and this time he is pissed. Mhoram discovers the fruition of breaking with the oath of peace, but is it in time to overcome the army's of Lord Foul? And our anti-hero is on the other side of the land with heroes fighting their own battles. Elena missteps in the last book bring some surprising problems here, and good book and wonderful entertaining tale make all three books a rewarding read"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better and better","review":"The last in a three part series, \\"The Power that Preserves\\" serves as a fine testament to Donaldson's consistent improvement as a writer. I must admit, the first book, \\"Lord Foul's Bane\\", was a tough book to endure and nearly extinguished my interest in the series. However, with each book, the pace becomes more lively and the characters become highly layered. This is truly an ending worth reading over and over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Incredible Series","review":"For Thomas the Savior, The Land is idealized beauty in which Thomas believes he is (unwittingly) pure evil. For Thomas the Leper the real world is pure agony in which he is the innocent victim. In both worlds he believes he is without free will. The crux of the series is his self-exploration into the nature of his evil in The Land, his victimization in the Real World, and the true extent of his free will. All this in incredible sub-plots and settings and an engrossing narative. True, these are NOT trivial books - but if you are willing to explore these books in depth then they are truly fantastic."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Have for All Tiger Fans","review":"The new DVD No Turning Back includes all the big hits with the original videos from the 80's as well as two new videos for the new singles.

To me they sound like Scared of Chaka jacked up on crack singing mainly about girls not in the whining love sappy way but mostly the one night stand wanna get with a girl and then leave immediately way. Two of the songs are also bilingual so it makes for a unigue sound. All the while this noise sounds like its coming out of an A.M radio. The songs are very short and it all goes by in 24 minutes or so. This is somewhat of a good thing and a bad thing. There are a lot of good bands coming out of Tuscon such as Shark Pants, the Blacks, and of course Swing Ding Amigos. I recommend this record to anyone who is into fast energetic songs with a lil bit of an experimental sound.

Quick and easy to install and remove on our 2005 Sienna. Salesperson said that it should fit 4 bikes and should be able to carry heavier cruiser bikes. But I did not try mounting the cruiser or 4 bikes because after mounting 3 adult mountain bikes, it seemed a bit heavy and did not have much room left. It should fit 4 bikes if you really try though.

It took about 30 minutes each time of loading and unloading the bikes. Finally, the hatchback was nearly impossible to open with the rack in place.

My only complaint thus far is that while the advertising and photo on the box claims the rack if fine for van's and SUV's, the literature then claims \\"but\\" some SUV & van door's and bumpers aren't strong enough so use at your own risk. Miffed, I called and they said it's OK to use, but the literature was a direct contradiction and I thought I'd been had. The CS was fine.

So, it is comparable usage, and who would have guessed it? Anyhow, since it didn't need a battery to screw on, I decided to have this thing move later on, but does come with a holder for a lamp bulb and works with the environmental friendly type. Overall, there's a insert with a pin placed in so if I leave it off, it comes on at a scheduled beeping and doesn't do much good since there's no smoke, so I guess that really could be something to improved upon.

Overall I thinks it's a bit pricey for play food of this quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good item but too expensive!","review":"I'm not sure if the cost is worth what you receive. The products are good but it is very expensive for what you are getting."},{"rating":"2","title":"My kids love this!","review":"I was so excited to see the price drop on this item during the holiday. My kids love play food but most of the cheap stuff fell apart and split at the seams after heavy use by my kids. This set is great - the pieces are larger than most play food I've bought, it's sturdy and my kids have a lot of fun playing with it.**Updated** When I bought this in Dec 2007, I got it on sale for $36 thru Amazon. I wasn't necesarily in the market for play food, but the price was great and the reviews were too. A year later - all three of my kids (6 and under) still love to make \\"meals\\" with this food set and it's held up exceptionaly well. If you can find it for a price you are willing to pay - I would definitely buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"So disappointed!","review":"I ordered this based on the outstanding reviews. I even have friends who have this same set who love it. Perhaps my set was defective, but when I opened the tub - the chemical smell was overwhelming. The play food had a very strong plastic/paint/chemical smell. I thought it might 'air out' but the smell is still there a week later.The food is cute, although not as cute as pictured. Some of the pieces look more like dog toys than play food. I suppose I was expecting more because of the high price.I will be returning this product. I purchased the new Melissa and Doug plastic produce sets instead(there is a fruit set and veggie set) and I like them so much better. No smell at all - and adorable, high-quality food."},{"rating":"1","title":"CHEAP!! Not worth what it costs!!","review":"When I checked out play food by this very company a couple years ago (before my daughter was old enough for it) it was well made. Somehow, in those couple years they must have changed how the product is made. My kids LOVE to play with play food and I thought i would invest in better quality ones to replace the cheap and cracking ones we had. I purchased it for Christmas and almost didn't even open it to check it out but I did to show my husband. So glad I did because it was NOT the same quality I had seen them produce a few years ago. The painting on it was off and just plain not \\"on\\" on some pieces. So cheap! Not worth the almost $100 for play food so I returned it immediately. I wouldn't pay any more than $25 for this tub!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"You Don't Have To Be An Alcoholic ...","review":"This very readable book proves we don't have to be an alcoholic to benefit from the Twelve Steps. \\"The Twelve Steps\\" is not only a great introduction to Twelve-Step Recovery, but one of the best recovery books I've read.The authors offer an interesting take on all the steps. They've been there! Also, I like that the book is small and easy to carry wherever I go.Again and again I go back and reread the chapters of this book, even when I'm feeling fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Capresso perfection","review":"This is a wonderful coffee maker. I love how it grinds the whole beans in a compartment away from the water and filter compartments. This keeps the steam away from the grinder and the grounds do not get caked in. I fill the grinder with beans and add the water to the reservoir the night before, setting the timer for the morning. It makes wonderful coffee from the fresh beans. I definately recommend this coffee maker."},{"rating":"2","title":"great coffee","review":"We have three homes and three Capressos. They grind the coffee beans as you make it. For the price, I can't think of a better coffee maker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly designed, but cute","review":"The good features about this machine: it's cute the way it swings the filter and makes your coffee from freshly ground beans.The bad features are many:1. The keys get sticky rather quickly - can't really clean them well even with alcohol. LCD panel died later. Unfortunately, this machine is totally unusable without the control panel.2. It's bulky and tall - it's not going to fit every countertop3. It's inconvenient if you like to drink different coffee depending on circumstances. Stand-alone grinder is more convenient.4. The coffee that it made was never superior to the one made by (much) cheaper coffee makers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Breaks easily","review":"Worked okay for 1 year. Like others, not hot enough. Grinder broke then machine stopped working. Lot of money for only 1 year use."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor quality of display","review":"I have had this coffee maker for 14 months several months ago numbers on the display started going out now they are all out, the machine still works but I have to measure beans into hopper and push start twice to get them all to grind, after reading other reviews and talking to friends this is a common problem. Way to much money for a machine that is going to last a year. I emailed the company with problem they called the next day, sent me a return ups label, I shipped on a Wednesday and got my coffee maker back the next Wednesday. Hopefully the company can correct the problem with the display however I got great service even though it was 2 months out of waranty."},{"rating":"2","title":"EASY to use, great tasting coffee- recommended!","review":"So far so good, purchased 2 months ago. I really like the ease of use and the coffee has good flavor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good coffee, bad display","review":"We have had the coffee maker a little over 2 years and brew one pot a day. After using it for 12 months the display started to quit functioning and became blank in about 30 days. We have continued to use the coffee maker since we spent so much on it but have finally given up.Seeing the others here that have had the same problem it is clear this is a flaw.We are going to go with a different manufacturer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easy to use, but makes cool, weak coffee.","review":"We bought this grinder and coffee maker combo to replace our Cuisinart Grind and Brew (which was a mess to clean and quit working after 9 months). This Capresso machine is very easy to use and very easy to clean. Unfortunately, the coffee is not hot enough for our standards. Once poured into a cup, it cools VERY quickly. Also, because the grinder measures out the amount of coffee to be ground for each pot, it uses less coffee than we would choose for a 10 cup pot of coffee. The result is weak coffee. We are returning this machine and purchasing a Technivorm machine instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame, Lame, Lame","review":"Totally Dead, just 13 short months after purchase, and frankly I'm releived. If you like strong coffee, or have to make a pot for a group, then this machine isn't for you. The water dosn't get hot enough to truly bring the flavor of the beans out and the grinder doesn't produce enough grounds for a full pot of stong coffee. The manufacturers standard (and only) response is to use less water.The parts fit together poorly, especially the basket. While not a chore to re-asemble, I cant say the things just \\"drop right in\\".This machine eats coffee at an alarming rate. If you purchase this unit, like I did, you will need to settle for using somewhat of a excessive amount of coffe or inadequate amount of water to get your brew tolerable.My major complaint is about myself. I should have returned it the day I got it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Coffee-maker - terrible customer service","review":"Got this coffee maker as a wedding present. We've been happy with it for a while until a few months back when problems with the \\"elegant, illuminated white-on-black display\\" started to go on the fritz, with some numerals not activating. Through frustrating, we could live with this.This morning, I tapped on the display, hoping to get it to work again. Rather than working again, it fell back into the coffee maker. Figuring I could just open it up and pop it back in place, I turned the unit over to find proprietary screws holding it shut.I called Capresso for help with this and was told that I had to send it in to Pennsylvania for repairs at a cost of $45 (almost a quarter of the original cost of the machine, and more than enough to buy a new coffee maker and grinder of almost any other brand). Outside of that, they would not help me.As far as I'm concerned, this is a total, catastrophic screw-job.Thanks for nothing, Capresso."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love my coffee!","review":"This is the best coffeemaker I have ever used! It's really easy to set the timer and the freshly ground beans right before brewing assures the freshest coffee each and every pot. I'm sold and would buy it again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Two Bought, two broken","review":"We've had 2 of these machines, the 1st when the model was initially introduced and it was the only grind and brew on the market. We were delighted with the concept, as neither my husband nor I are good at measuring coffee to make the perfect cup of coffee. The machine made a really good cup of coffee with little fuss.Alas, the first machine ceased to function (the arm would no longer automatically move from the grind position to the brew position). It broke at a time they were introducing the new model, so it took a while to be able to find a new one. Once we did find and buy machine two, despite having light use, it is now broken as well--it no longer heats water and sends it to brew.These are expensive coffee makers to have such poor longevity. We will buy no more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak coffee","review":"We previously owned a different Capresso coffee maker that made fabulous coffee, so when it broke after many years, we bought this model. Unfortunately, it's nowhere as good. If we use the same amount of coffee we used with all other coffee makers, we get weak coffee. Also, as many reviewers mentioned, the temperature is not hot enough. Given how expensive this coffee maker is, it is definitely a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Problems with grinder","review":"This machine worked very well for a few months. Then the grinder stopped working. I diligently cleaned it following the directions in the manual, but it still does not work. It is way too expensive for a machine that will brew, but not grind coffee."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great coffee, poor quality and poor customer service","review":"I bought this as a gift for my wife and she loved it, at least until parts of the LCD display began to disappear -- now we have to guess how many cups it will make, etc. I contacted Cappresso, and they will repair it for only $75 -- which is more than 1/2 the cost of a new maker. Given how common this issue is in reviews, it's pretty clear this is a design problem with the coffee maker. Bottom line; makes great coffee, but a good chance that your LCD will go bad and then you are stuck. This is our last purchase of a Capresso machine."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent","review":"I've tried many other machines, but this one is fantastic.Beans are freshly brewed, set the number of cups and you're done.When I was pregnant I just could not wait to get back to this machine!Wonderful!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed & Stuck","review":"I had great coffee at a friend's home, and they had this identical coffee maker.I bought one, but I am so disappointed!!!! The timer does not work, the grinder does not coordinate with coffee maker, and the entire plastic component is physically \\"OFF\\".The lid does not sit properly on the top, the dripper basket sits to the side of the larger portion of machine, not quite centered, I have to press real hard to the left so the hole lines up and water can drip. Speaking of drip... it keeps dripping even when glass pot is removed, plus the coffee is never hot.Since I did not inspect the machine at my friends, I never noticed how poorly manufactured it is, the plastic seems very very cheap.(Fisher Price makes better quality toys)I can't find my receipt, or else I would have returned it.So I am stuck with this expensive, \\"too big for the counter\\", poorly functioning, cold coffee machine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall Very Good","review":"This is a nice machine. Burr grinder, fully automated, but I wish that I could adjust the amount of coffee ground. I like strong coffee and I have it on the 10 cup \\"strong\\" grind setting, and only use 5 cups of water and it is OK. The temp needs to be a little hotter too. Hence the four stars. If Capresso would make the grinder fully programmable it would be perfect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overpriced","review":"I have owned this coffee maker for approximately 2 years and today the display disappeared. When trying to turn the coffee maker on it automatically turned itself to the lost power setting. After a few minutes the machine started to grind all on it's own and started smoking. Had to rush to get it outside. A call to Capresso customer service got me the comment that the machine could be repaired for the cost of $75.00 plus shipping. Needless to say the only place this thing will get shipped to is the landfill. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work for me and had to return","review":"Bad luck most likely. Didn't like how the ground coffee had such a long path into the filter - the grinds could be from a day or two ago (not \\"todays grind\\"). Unit had to be returned due to non functioning cup level control."},{"rating":"2","title":"So good I have 2","review":"I liked the Capresso so much that I ordered a second one. I had both for a number of years and when the first one got too old I replaced it with another Capresso. I have tried other grind and brew machines and got rid of each of them because they just didn't do the job. The capresso makes great coffee whether you grind or just brew coffee."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Better Then Any Unit From Cuisinart.","review":"I have owned several units from Cuisinart, and this is superior. It gives you complete control over your brew size and strength, it is less noisy, and clean up is the same as a standard coffee maker. Cuisinart models are a pain to clean, and most of the ones I owned had problems with the grinding unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it--just a big hassle","review":"I've had this coffee maker for a few weeks now and I'm returning it tomorrow. I've tried everything but it makes luke-warm coffee. I even called Capresso and they told me that their coffee makers brew at 180 degrees. Well I put my candy thermometer in the pot this morning and guess what? 160! Way off from where it should be. It's a great design but they are missing the most important part...good coffee. Guess I'm going back to a Cuisinart which at least brews a great cup of coffee."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing gadgetry","review":"Well, what can I say. The thing worked. At a pre-set time in the morning, the grinder would commence and the coffee would brew. I didn't have any trouble figuring out how to work it. I'll have to admit, it was kinda nice to wake up to the smell of coffee without having to do any work.Couple of problems, as before mentioned: (a) the grinder didn't grind the coffee fine enough for my taste; and (b) the water wasn't heated high enough: I'd have to nuke my cup after adding milk -- ridiculous. So while the device worked consistently, it made consistently mediocre coffee.Like another reviewer, I buy my coffee beans green and roast them myself. After going through all that trouble, why would I drop the ball at the end of the process? I now happily use the vacuum brewing method.Ultimately, I didn't feel this machine was worth its price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent product!","review":"This is arguably the best coffee maker on the planet if grinding beans just before brewing is important to you. I've had at least 5 of these at the various houses I've had and they all work great (I kept giving them away to the kids when I moved). Unlike other brands, you don't have to pre-measure the beans every time you make a pot. And, unlike others, there is essentially no clean-up from the grinding process. The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is the coffee temperature is about 10 degrees cooler than what I would like. As I recall, it's about 170 degrees and I'd like it to be 180-190."},{"rating":"1","title":"timteach","review":"I have had this coffee maker for about 2 years. After about 1 year, the display slowly started to die but I could still discern # cups I wanted so I dealt with it.

The throw pattern in flashlight mode is not smooth at all.The design of the light is decent. The housing seems fairly sturdy, the switch seems a little flimsy and the handle is adequate, but not sturdy.It's not really practical as a flashlight, but I could see this light as being handy in a power outage as a light to light up a bathroom or make sure you don't trip over the couch. I think if you used it in lantern mode and sat 5 feet from it, you would not be able to read a book.

Geisler chooses a pretty good model but doesn't give fair representation to the other models.Geisler does the worse job of applying these models that I have ever seen.

The style is approachable and dynamic, and the ideas are still exciting ten years after the book was published. The authors cover a wide range of topics both historical and contemporary and come from different theoretical stand points. The articles not only focus on composition and performance but also on listenership and the gendered power relationships involved in that. As a first year postgraduate student involved in gay and lesbian studies of music I found this book inspirational and invigorating because of the high quality of scholarship involved. Queering the Pitch is a much more interesting read than several more recent collections of queer musicology because of the strength of the ideas involved but especially energetic and transparent writing styles which avoid the stogyness that musicology can often suffer from."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Maze\\" by Catherine Coulter","review":"I have to say that I found this book to be tiring and boring.

Sorry to be such a pessimest but you did ask me to review this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazingly Bad","review":"If I were giving awards for the worst book I have read in many years, The Maze would easily win. The plot is unbelievable, the characters shallow and mean, the dialog childish and the romance sappy. The one redeeming feature is the encouragement this book must give to aspiring writers. Surely, if Catherine Coulter can make a living writing this badly, anyone can. Judging from the number of four and five star ratings given this book, there is a good market for bad writing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Constantly Amazed","review":"Why did I ever finish this book? I have to agree with the reviewer from CA - the dialog was so adolescent, I was embarrassed I was reading it. The continual unrealistic character building of potential suspects was, frankly, unbelievable. Subplots were never resolved. I often felt I was reading the writings of a teenage author. For example, the cheering and high-fives by the police and FBI following the killing of 2 men, which had just brutalized 2 women, was juvenile. After the shooting of one man in the 'back of the neck', blood pouring out of his nose and mouth, the victim continued to carry on several paragraphs of perfectly coherent conversation, with better grammer and vocabulary than he displayed through-out the book. I have to say this was one of the most disappointing of Coulter's books I have read."},{"rating":"1","title":"An amatuerish book by a professional writer.","review":"Much of the story was too contrived, although interesting for light reading.

The story was amazing and the characters seemed very believable (but as I have yet to meet any FBI angents I simply don't know). Her way with words and the scenes which she paints bring the story alive and throughout the book you find yourself rooting for Sherlock and Savich (the heroine and hero) in all that they are doing.

Unfortunately, for her, it will probably be my last. The story line intrigued me because I like thrillers and mysteries. However, this book was so poorly written, I can't believe it was ever edited! The characters are childish and/or brutish, the dialogue is juvenile (do FBI agents really speak this way?), and I can't believe the FBI wouldn't know a candidate's sister was murdered by a serial killer!

The dialogue was not well written at all. The \\"plot\\" (if you can even find it) had huge holes in it. The intimacies would not be allowed. Lacey's maverick behavior would have been nipped in the bud right quick if this was anything close to real. None of the serial maniac stuff was even close to convincing. And a real cop out ending.

More like a fairy tale.","review":"I was introduced to this series by a friend, she said that I would like it. Well, I'd have to disagree with her. The story is basically crap filled with plot holes.The characters are two dimensional, and the dialog is miserable. I died a little inside at every turn of the page. The book is described to be a thriller, but I guessed correctly through the story... there's nothing surprising, or even interesting. I don't know what else to say about this book than it's crap.

Sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice attempt...no cigar","review":"I researched the reviews on The Maze and thought I'd give it a shot, particularly since it was contemporary fiction. I was extremely disappointed! The story was sluggish, the dialogue inconsistent and uninteresting and there was little character development. I never felt like I got to know the primary characters at all; there was simply no depth to the writing. Even the love relationship lacked passion and emotion. Halfway through the book, I lost interest, but continued to read, hoping that it would get better. It didn't. I know Catherine Coulter can write MUCH more interesting and intriguing stories.

In this book, however, there were too many to ignore. CC makes a big point about how ridiculous it is for a judge to take into account the fact that the bad guy in the story was viciously abused as a child. Yet in both these stories, the female victom is suffering from repressed memories from her youth which drives her behavior and we are led to sympathize with her.

I love this author!I will be perusing all other books by Catherine Coulter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sensational!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This book is my favorite out of the entire FBI series. It has to be the most imaginative one (but only by a little) Sherlock and Savich are a great couple and you have to wonder what kind of mind would come up with that plot and how to pull off everything so it was believeable for the most part. The Maze, as logic would have it is about a criminal who ingeniusly uses mazes as his calling card. Not only did this book keep me on the edge of my seat but it kept me turing pages faster and faster to see what would happen next. I also finished the book with such a happy and warm feeling. If you have to be up early the next morning DO NOT start this book just before bed. I can guarantee you will still be up reading when the sun comes up. I was!!! Catherine keep up the excellent work, I am looking forward to your next book, whatever it might be."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books I have EVER read!","review":"My mother got this book out of the library for me. I had only read Catherine Coulter's historical romances & thought that those were the only type of book she wrote. When I got the Maze, I was stunned. It is one of the best comtemporary thrillers I have EVER read - and I read all the time, I have read thousands of books & the Maze rates up there w/ the best of them! The suspense kept me on the edge of my seat, to use a hackneyed phrase. :) I adored Savich & Sherlock, they have become two of my favorite characters & I hope Coulter continues to develop them in future books. I was pleased to see them return in \\"The Target\\". Catherine, your thrillers are AMAZING, please keep them coming! So many women can write the historical romances but not many people can write a thriller as well as you can! I would highly reccomend this book to everyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sherlock and Savich meet - ah what a team","review":"This is the story where Dillon and Sherlock first meet.

It took me a few chapters to settle into the rhythm of the novel, but once you're tuned in its great stuff. When a rich lord is killed on the way home from a trip to the city of Exeter to visit his mistress, a flock of claimants step forward to claim his lands. Ralph Dechard and his colorful colleagues represent the King to adjudicate the claims. Sex, violence and greed are the order of the day. As the tale unfolds, the \\"clues\\" point to several different possible villains in turn, but finally come together to reveal the true killer. This is the first of the series that I have read, but I will undoubtedly circle back to read the rest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific!","review":"Marston's Domesday series is a winner!This is the eighth book in the series, and the story is just as good as the previous ones. Ralph and Gervaise, along with Hubert and Simon find themselves in Devon. They happen to arrive just after a very vicious murder has been done. One of the city's leading barons is found dead with this throat cut and slashes all over his face. Gervaise and Ralph realize that the victim is one of the main people in a land dispute that they will have to settle, and they know that the murder is connected to the land dispute. Both of them find themselves in danger before they can solve this particular case. I love the period detail in these books, and the likeable and real characters that Marstons has created. This is a great historical mystery series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great stuff...","review":"If the words 'new' and 'country' send shockwaves of horror down your spine, then Summerteeth is probably not for you, but it is a fine record, more akin to pop/rock than country, and full of cracking tunes and twisted melancholia.Best is the opening salvo of I Can't Stand It, She's A Jar and Shot In The Arm, although the exquisite and painful How To Fight Loneliness has to be the standout.So good to hear a quality album of this ilk, and so much better than Beck's truly average Mutations. Like it? Try The Jayhawks...please!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT ALBUM -- Wilco is already one of my favorite bands","review":"This is my first Wilco album. They opened up for R.E.M. when I saw them this summer and I persuaded myself to buy this record about a week ago. Wilco doesn't sound like any other band I listen to, but I took an immediate liking to 'Summerteeth.' It gets better with every listen. 'A Shot in the Arm' is the best track on the record, although not by far. Every song is very catchy and the lyrics are well written. 'ELT' sounds a bit like the Wallflowers but in a good way. I don't know what to compare this record to, but I'm a big fan of Radiohead, R.E.M., Portishead, and Pink Floyd, so if you like those bands give Wilco a listen. Highly recommended. This record might even broaden your musical tastes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent album from an excellent band.","review":"Rarely do you own an album where you like every track. Maybe those days are gone. But this album certainly fits that description for me. This is an amazing album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whoa!","review":"After listening a bit to Uncle Tupelo, my first Wilco album was Yankee Hotel Foxtrot. I thought, \\"Jeez...where the heck did THIS come from?\\" Then I heard their amazing album Being There. Besides finding myself completely blown away, I was amazed by the way the band's sound changed. But I think Summerteeth really surprised me most with its twisted pop that seems fluffy at first, but is dark and deep when you rip into it. A lot of reviewers talk about the Beatles when discussing Wilco; What's Beatle-esque about Wilco is the creative arc the band as experienced across their four albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's okay...mediocre...be dubious of all the Fan Frothy","review":"There are two above-average tunes (She's A Jar, Via Chicago), a bunch of re-hashed mediocrity (ELT, How to Fight Loneliness) and some rather syrupy and/or pointless clunkers(Shot In the Arm, Summerteeth YUK!, I'm Always in Love, In a Future Age). The sound is brittle and amateurishly over-produced. The band plays without any soul whatsoever and the arrangements are gimmicky and distractful (a common recording trick when you're dealing with a poorly written song in the first place). Some lyrics are intelligent and beautiful (\\"And freeze to spread skeleton wings/I passed through before I knew you\\"), while others are trite and dopey (\\"You followed me down/the neck to D\\"). In short, there are far too many run-of-the-mill songs on this CD for it to merit such unquestionable, \\"album-of-the-year\\" praise. Look before you leap and borrow a friend's copy before you buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Addictive","review":"I can't stop listening to this album.

What a disappointment, this album is very DULL and lifeless, the sound quality is very poor up against the latest offerings from other bands recently e.g Robert Cray and Tom Petty."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to the formerly great Wilco?","review":"I've been a big fan of Jeff Tweeedy since his Uncle Tupelo days, and I have to ask about Summerteeth, what happened? Gone from this album is any connection to Tweedy's alternative country roots. Gone too is the coherent songwriting and hummable melodies that define his style. Loyal listeners beware, there isn't a \\"Passenger Side,\\" or a \\"Kingpin\\" on this whole album. In fact, there is nary a song you'll remember five minutes after the CD is done playing. It pains me to say that this is one terrible album."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT A MESS.....","review":"WHAT WERE THEY THINKING??

They lost a good amount of fans by srtaying from the alt-country sound, but it just proves to me that they're one of the best bands in the world. After all, I love Son Volt, but they make the same record again and again. Diversity is the sign of a great songwriter. And Tweedy is really showing his diversity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good album by a great band","review":"Although this Wilco album isn't awesome compared to most other Wilco albums, It has a few mainstays that are in the bands live concert lineups. It's nice to have the studio versions of songs that you're guaranteed to hear live (Via Chicago, A Shot in the Arm). Wilco is one of the best bands i've seen in person, so even if this album doesn't have a ton of heavy hitters, being a big fan lends this album a decent replay value."},{"rating":"2","title":"my favorite Wilco album","review":"This is the album that took Wilco from alt-rock novelty to just straight alt. It's my favorite album, well written songs that meander around a bit but ultimately have a perfect balance. I love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Summer teeth: one of many, but still as great","review":"I have been a long time Wilco fan, without even knowing it. In the past few years i have been keeping up with newer albums (Yankee Hotel/A ghost is born) but only recently stumbled upon Summer teeth. Once i listened i knew it was another classic. Following suit with their newer albums summer teeth offers one or two up beat (semi-kitchy) tunes that at suface seem radio friendly, but with deeply meaningful lyrics that often catch me off guard. Though Wilco isn't for everyone, Summer teeth is deffinately for any Wilco fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"On the way to perfection","review":"Wilco's latest album Yankee Hotel Foxtrot is a prime example of what an obscure band can accomplish. But, please, don't forget about their other albums. Summerteeth, in my opinion, has all the same magic that YHF has. Listening to it multiple times really gives you a sense of the talent behind the music. The lyrics are brilliant, and are accompanied by a brilliant arrangement of instruments played expertly. Excellent album, 4 1/2 stars, but I'll give em 5 because this band really needs to get some recognition."},{"rating":"2","title":"this one'll grow on you","review":"Well, I must say that I am very pleased with the album as a whole. The rockers like \\"E.L.T\\" really sting you, with innovative arrangements and driving power. Though, I must say the best parts of the album are these. Songs 7, 8, and 9 are a mini-tragedy, hitting home with sweeping movements are gut-wrenching lyrics. They just sound like pure emotion. The other is the remix of \\"A shot in the arm\\" that concludes the album. Crisper and edgier than the first version, it really is the best shot that the band has at a hit. It'll be a shame if they don't release it. Anyway, I hope \\"Summer Teeth\\" sells so that these guys get the recognition that anybody reading this knows that they deserve."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointing","review":"it's very disheartening to watch an entire genre of music sell out. one after another, alt country bands signed to major labels all of a sudden think they are rock, or even worse, pop bands. guess that's where the money is. sure isn't where the quality is. thank god for son volt; at least one half (always was the better half) of uncle tupelo is still playing true roots americana music."},{"rating":"2","title":"New, real, deep.","review":"The new Wilco cd \\"SummerTeeth\\" is the freshest new sound that I heard since the early days of R.E.M. Influences are everywhere, Beatles, Doors, Petty, Nashville, maybe a little Seattle, and a lot of Texas."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best of '99","review":"Always been a big fan of Wilco and it was nice seeing them branch off in a different direction. Much of the album sounds like a long-lost, nearly forgotten, '70's style recording. They did keep some of the so-called alt-country touch on a few songs, though not enough according to some reviewers (who would prefer an 'A.M.' retread). If intelligence in pop would equal airplay, this CD would rule the airwaves. Unfortunately, this is the real world and you'll have to buy the CD, since it doesn't get airplay - at least not down here."},{"rating":"2","title":"expecting the same? nope, new cake!","review":"this will be brief because if you read the other 80 or so reviews you will be confused due to the ratings from 1 to 5 and many of the differences so very well defined.i like wilco. i like them because they never serve the same meal. their firt album AM: meat potatoes with the \\"no depression thang\\" still there as accents. their followup Being There: nouveau cuisine. jeff and the gang found new spices in the studio but still remembered the basic stock. now number 3 \\"Summerteeth: well it's sweet, tastes great but a lingering after-palette twinge of bitterness. it's cake.i never turn down cake, and if you love a pastry chef who experiments with classic ingredients but creates a new sensory work...then this Summerteeth is worth your bite."},{"rating":"2","title":"Album of the Year","review":"Pop can be the most transcendent genre, and Wilco have realized what I hope to be the first of many masterpieces. A musical force to contend with. Don't miss out on this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"A sign of things to come","review":"What do you get when one of pop musics greatest minds decides that he wants to show off his songwriting chops and brilliant pop sensilities? Summerteeth is like a Beatles album getting lost in time and emerging at the close of the century. True, no new ground is broken here, but any pop record this brilliant has to be commended. The contrast between the bright melodies and dark lyrics about abuse are what really sets this album apart. The production does exactly what it needs to, its extensive enough to be called pop but not overdone to the point that it takes away from the content. I know some people to miss the sound of Uncle Tupelo, AM and Being there, but after listening to this I'm starting to think that theyre all insane."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment !","review":"I listened to this record and the first thing I thought was, what a boring music is this.I think the album \\"Bein' There\\" didn't sell not enough records so they came up with a very commercial album.

This could be a great record but it is absolutely ruined by overproduction. It has constant left to right to left pans of various instruments -- like some kid was playing with the audio board. There are layered synthesizer effects which are absolutely annoying. If this record were stripped of these effects it would be quite good. As it is I'm going to re-sell this ASAP."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's Wilco?","review":"There were maybe 2 or 3 tracks on this CD that were even close to \\"good\\". The remainder was like Herman's Hermits meets the Beatles meets Moody Blues and ran the gambit from bubble-gum to downright sappy. A true multi-layered, overproduced effort with none of the small studio-jam feel of, say, \\"AM\\" or \\"Being There\\". Bring Back Wilco!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I got this album because of Mermaid Avenue, which I thought was an excellent cd. Jeff Tweedy wrote wonderful music to Woody's lyrics, and so I thought I would check out a Wilco album. Summer Teeth sounds like bad eighties music and outtakes from the Beatles White Album. The songs sound so cheesy and generic. Not at all what I was expecting. Tweedy may be a gifted lyricist and songwriter, but when the music sounds like this, who cares. The sound is too electronic and modern sounding, and a couple years from now will sound really silly and dumb."},{"rating":"2","title":"A comment from the UK...","review":"It appears that this CD divides opinion in the US somewhat. Most UK music lovers will have come to Wilco via the Mermaid Avenue album with Billy Bragg, so we don't carry the baggage of alt.country, Golden Smog etc. All I can say is - value this band, they're an American national treasure. Summerteeth stands alongside the best US music of the 90s - when are you coming back to the UK, Jeff? And can you come to Ipswich so I don't have to go all the way to London?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wrong hidden tracks listed","review":"The hidden tracks listed here are wrong! The correct tracks are 15. Blank (12 seconds of silence), 16. Candyfloss, and 17. Shot in the Arm (Alt. version). Great album, one of my favorites!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Possibly my favorite CD of the 90's","review":"Unlike Son Volt (the other offshoot band of the defunct alterna-punk-country Uncle Tupelo) whose records seem to have declined in quality with each release, each of Wilco's CDs has improved dramatically. Summer Teeth may disappoint some of their loyal country-oriented fans, but its lack of twang is more than made up for by a rich, highly produced sound. The songwriting on this CD is as strong or stronger than anything on their previous CDs. This CD makes it well into my list of the top 5 CDs of the 90s and may well be my favorite."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wilco's pop gem","review":"I've read every review on this site, and decided its time to add my own. Several reviews are comparing Wilco to the Beach Boys or the Beatles because of this CD. The only way to appreciate it is to compare Wilco with themselves. Do that, and you'll grow to love this record. The best songs on the cd (She's a Jar, A Shot in the Arm, ELT, I'm Always in Love) stand up well against their other classics (Box of Letters, California Stars, Outtasite (Outta Mind), What's the World Got in Store). On a recent busines trip I took along a \\"Wilco's Greatest Hits\\" tape I made. By the end of the week, the new songs sounded comfortable with the old. I think the negative reviews are coming from the same people who gave up on R.E.M. when \\"Fall on Me\\" started to get some airplay. They tell everyone about their favorite band (the \\"greatest band in the world\\"), then get upset when their friends actually listen. Anyway, buy this one, give it some time, its worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I can't stop listening","review":"This has really grown on me over the last couple of weeks . . . I can't quit listening to it. One of the absolute finest (pop) albums I've ever heard.

Is there anything like this being played on Top 40 radio or topping the Billboard charts? Maybe 30 years ago. And just because this is a pop album doesn't mean it isn't absolutely gorgeous music, either."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's not AM, but it may be better","review":"True, Wilco comes across with a distinctly new sound on Summerteeth. But it works! Some of the rawness of AM and Being there are gone, repaced with more elaborate backings and even a touch of the electronic sound from time to time. But it's unlike any other music I've heard. I don't know if it's as good as AM, but it beats Being There by alt-country miles. And that was a quality release. Four and one-half stars may be a more accurate rating, but what the heck. In a word: Impressive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some fantastic surprises!","review":"This isn't the \\"most listenable\\" album I've ever heard...there are some majorly dark moments, but if you stick it out and listen repeatedly and thoughtfully, you will be rewarded!

If you are a rock hound or a naturalist that is concerned with all of the Latin names of every plant species in the Lassen area, this review may not apply. However, if you plan on using this book to help plan a multi-day backpacking/hiking trip through Lassen you should look elsewhere.No doubt the author is very knowledgeable about the area, but the format is not for trip planning, but more for reference to read as you are walking the trails. The trails are not linked in loops, or connected for round-trip hikes in any discernable way which is a necessity for trip planning in my opinion. Overall, this book is great if you want to catalogue volcanic rock and plants, but if you are planning a backcountry trek look for another hiking guide."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Customer Service","review":"I cannot comment on the product itself but I was not happy with Avalon Body Product customer service.

The police detective Voort is horrible.However, the worst part of the book was the writing style. Black is all over the place with his writing. He wastes so much of the reader's time with irrelevant material, trying to be descriptive. The problem is his descriptions have nothing to do with anything involving the plot or characters. And when he does try to give us character descriptions he either describes clothing, or attempts to use mundane prose to let us in on the personality of the characters.I could go on and on about how bad this book is, but I will not.

I never realized that NYC was so filled with so many beautiful, lusty, commitment-shy people driven by the demons of their past. Conflict and tension are required for story-lines, but must all the characters be doomed to unhappiness and stupidity.

I found myself giggling at the ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay but. . .","review":"This book has a decent premise, and I love the detective character, but it needs some work.First of all, I agree with one previous reviewer -- the \\"secret\\" of the book is revealed literally half-way through the read (way too soon). This makes every move by the detective and other characters look so stupid it's not even funny. You really want to like the detective, but after reading him do some really dense things, you lose interest.I also have a fundamental problem with the book and it's secret. I think the author really needed to get himself a better editor, because there are many inconsistencies that need to be resolved.Speaking of editing, the book is chock full of poor grammar and missed/mis-used punctuation.I'd wait for the next book or if you want to read a thriller, get Mark of the Assassin by Silva or something like that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Recommended","review":"This is a book whose premise had potential to be a suspenseful, gripping novel. However, none of that potential is realized. Instead, it is badly written, filled with graphic sex and descriptions of the wealth Voort and his well-to-do partner. I found myself not caring about any of the characters. There's a twist in the middle that makes reading the rest of the book almost irrelevant. I'm always looking for new authors to add to my reading list. Based on this, Black isn't going to be one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Concept exceeds Author's grasp","review":"The characters are preposterous.

They are involved with a crime investigated by a millionaire NYPD detective who has has a tall, thin, beautiful, blonde girlfriend with white-blonde pubic hair. You buy that?P.S. This is not a debut novel. This is an author who had a mid-list crisis and has been repackaged. Good luck, Ethan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Obvious and unrealistic","review":"A quick and moderately entertaining read, but nothing more. One must suspend belief from the very beginning of this novel. The main character and his partner are millionaires who continue to work for the NYPD out of the goodness of their hearts. Their women friends are all 6 foot tall blonds with busy careers who find time for exercise and, of course, always sport thong underwear and have insatiable sexual appetites. And, as mentioned in other reviews, the real plot twist is revealed in the middle of the novel--making one wonder why they should bother finishing it at all.

It is completely and utterly ...... repulsive. The .... between Conrad Voort and his girlfriend that is. But entirely doing away with the juvenile giggling-hand-in-front-of-mouth childishness of the ..... would do very little to improve Mr. Black's efforts. For the style in which this parody of literature is written is, at best, confusing and, at worst, totally incomprehensible. So, do yourself one gigantic favor and skip this book, and if you've bought but haven't yet got around to reading it, drive to your local secondhand bookstore and toss this puppy into the bargain bin and pick yourself up a Sallie Bissell or Ridley Pearson. Leave this reprehensible trash for the garbage man."},{"rating":"2","title":"best thriller I've read in a long, long time","review":"First I missed my stop on the bus, reading this.

It is a story based on oral traditions of the founding of the Hungarian nation in the fifth century by the Huns (or, precursors or \\"cousins\\" of the Huns), brothers of the Magyars and the Cimmerians. The vision of a white stag leads Attila across the Carpathian mountains to a new land."},{"rating":"2","title":"The White Stag","review":"The White Stag is a great book for people who like strange fantasy. It was very different than any other books in the way Kate Seredy expressed what happened. I liked how she changed an old story of killing into an interesting plot. Before you read this book you think of the Huns as people set on killing, but when you read this book you feel the Huns actually had personalities and reasons for doing what they did. You get to find out about a hidden history and how different the Huns really were. It is a very interesting book."},{"rating":"2","title":"From a child's perspective (spoilers...)","review":"The beautiful story arc pits the Magor tribe against the followers of a man we come to know Atilla the Hun. This book had me on the edge of my seat as a child, and has a great ending!Late, late in this book, Seredy uses the word \\"Hun,\\" at which point (as a child of 9), I figured out that Hunor and Magor were the founders of *actual* tribes, including Atilla's Huns. Up 'til then, I'd assumed it was pure fiction created by Seredy. Her subtle approach has always impressed me about this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprising Bad","review":"By the other reviews here, you'd think this was a marvelous sports-war book fullof interesting, endearing characters performing in extraordinary times. In fact, the book reads like a story from a friendly uncle who carries on and on about people you don't know who he hasn't made you care about. There's little to bond you to the characters, and much of the book explains the not particularly interesting game-by-game season of a Wisconsin football team. In the preface the autor relates how his father's life inspired the book, and this feels like something someone would write for the benefit of the narrow group of people who experienced it, not the general public."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredibly vivid images painted by words...","review":"Mr. Frei has been able to so clearly paint the images of football, war, heroism, friendship, patriotism and love. I never wanted to put \\"Third Down\\" on the nightstand; the faces and stories were so real. This book will appeal to football fans and history buffs alike -- yet it is so much more than either of those. \\"Third Down\\" is a fanastic story but the fact that it is based on reality makes it so much more... I deeply care for the people Frei writes about -- he touches the reader by bringing us into the lives of real American heros. Thank you, Mr. Frei, for passionately sharing the story of the '42 Badgers with us!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Trashy retelling of a lot of British shenanigans","review":"This book gives a ten page write up on about twenty of the most famous cons in (mostly) British and European history.

To say that EC has returned to his roots here is far from right, but Reptile definitely has more to offer than Pilgrim. The change of feel is remarkable, and though there aren't too many searing solos, one has to admit that for sheer Slowhand goodness, this is great (albeit a slight deviation from regular Slowhand jamming). Superman is pure joy to listen to, and Broken Down is outstanding. And there are a good number of gems in this recording. It's not EC's best, but hey, it's not too far from it either."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful","review":"This is Eric Clapton. Going back to basics at this time in his career is the best move he could have made. I haven't heard Riding with the King yet, but after hearing this, I am convinced that it would be worth it. When I put this in my cd player, I was blown away. Clapton is by far the best guitarist I have heard.

I never thought I would say that, as I am a huge fan. I own everything Clapton has ever recorded (from The Yardbirds to \\"Riding With the King\\") including many compilations. The realization of what he is capable of makes it impossible for me to suffer through this sort of dribble any longer.Eric, if you are listening: don't be misled by Grammys or the thin veneer of adoration from gushing \\"fans\\".

There was almost nothing on this entire cd that caught my attention. It sounded like not too much effort went into this recording, which is uncharateristic since Eric is known for pouring his heart into his music. The background vocals reminded me of Elvis Presley's back up singers from the 50's and seemed out of place on most tracks. I also thought the blues, Clapton's strongest attribute, came across weak and hollow. I did like Superman Inside and Son & Sylvia, though. Tried and true Clapton fans will enjoy Reptile. Even if not so much for the music, at least because it is Slowhand himself. I'd rather hear something from his past. I would give this one star muscially, but because it's Eric Clapton, I gave it an extra star.

The man has made so much money that he seems to think that he can afford to sacrifice his artistic integrity and still maintain credibility with the fans who have admired his rock and blues efforts for 30 years. Who knows, maybe he can. He sure suckered me into buying this album. The meandering cocktail jazz of the opening track \\"Reptile,\\" the \\"lite rock\\" of the cover songs--this all adds up to little substance. Is this the same guy who played in Derek & the Dominos? He seems to be more in tune with Jackson Browne, Elton John, James Taylor, and Leo Sayer than Muddy Waters or Buddy Guy.This is appropriate material if you don't feel like being challenged as a listener. In fact, I hope this isn't an example of Eric challenging himself as a player. If so, he has lost it completely.

The guitar-work is ( as is to be expected from such a master) sublime to say the least. Mr. Clapton's vocals on this record are superb, especially his compelling blues voice on songs such as \\"Come Back Baby\\",indeed a reflection of his deep-rooted love for the blues. The songs are diversified and the arrangements well balanced. The tonal quality of this recording is impeccable. This album is a polished shining gem and bears the signature of a truely gifted professional. I am certain this recording will undoubtably attain the status of \\"Album of the Year\\". Congratulations Mr. Clapton!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it or hate it?","review":"Seems that most people either love this album or hate it, and I have to put myself firmly on the side of the lovers. Yes, this album is a mixture of styles that Clapton has come out with in the last ten years (and some faithful fans of the \\"old\\" Clapton won't like that) but if you loved From the Cradle, and still have Unplugged on your list of best albums, you are going to enjoy Reptile. Riding with the King was easily the best album of 2000, and this may not be up to those standards, but put this album in, turn it up, and get ready for a great time. I highly recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"ERIC NOT GREAT","review":"THIS CD IS FOR ALL THE MELLOW ERIC FANS,WHICH I DON\`T TEND TO BE.I LIKE ERIC BEST WHEN HE IS PLAYING HIS GUITAR HIS BLUESY BEST AND THIS CD DOES NOT GET IT.5 STARS FOR THIS.YOU HAVE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME.OH I KNOW THAT ALOT OF YOU PEOPLE THAT WRITE REVIEWS DO THE POPULAR THING AND ALWAYS SAY HOW GREAT A CD IS TO GET POINTS,BUT PEOPLE LETS BE HONEST,THIS IS NOT A GREAT CD.STAY WITH ERIC\`S OLDER STUFF,AS HE IS RUNNING OUT OF GOOD TUNES."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clapton spreads his wings!","review":"I have followed blues and jazz for many years. What I like about jazz is the way you can pick out styles of artists. Many play on each others songs and it is a great collaboration. Eric has done this on Reptile. The credits read like a \\"who's who\\" of music. The combinations of Billy Preston, Stevie Gadd, Nathan East, Joe Sample, Paulinho DaCosta, to name a few, makes you wonder what the overall sound will be. I found it incredible. From James Taylor's \\"Don't Let Me Be Lonely Tonight\\" to Stevie Wonder's \\"I Ain't Gonna Stand For It\\" and beyond, the sound is strong and blended excellently. My favorite....? \\"I Want A Little Girl\\". Just a fun little ditty that is nightclubish yet rock n roll bluesish! I recommend this album highly, there's something for everyone on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why even put this out","review":"I didn't give this one star because it's certailnly not his worst record, just his most forgettable. Reptile and Pilgrim would be destined for what used to be called \\"the cut-out bin\\". I understand that he's done it all and can afford to \\"explore\\", but lets get real. This music makes me think that \\"Behind The Sun\\" and \\"August\\" are really great records. Bring the Marshall back and turn it up."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"I hesitate to say anything critical of Eric Clapton, since I am such a tremendous fan and usually *love* everything he does. Maybe that is why I was so disappointed with this album. Maybe it is just me, but this album doesn't sound like Eric Clapton at all to me. The first instrumental reminds me of elevator music, some of the other tracks sound jazzy to me, and a Stevie Wonder song? The rest of the songs have too much piano and not enough guitar playing, which is why I love Eric Clapton so much. His talent is astounding! He should show it off! The two redeeming songs on this album are Superman Inside, which almost sounds like the E.C. I know and love, and Come Back Baby. On Come Back Baby, Eric puts his whole heart and soul into the singing and as a result, it is AWESOME! This is what E.C. does best: sing the blues! I just wish I loved the rest of the album as much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocrity","review":"The persons responsible for supplying music for elevators and hospital waiting rooms will love this album. Die-hard Clapton fans will buy it just to have it. Everyone else, listen to it before you decide to buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Riding with......Otis","review":"the only other place I've heard music as fine as this has been in an elevator."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pre-retirement","review":"The thrill must be gone. This CD is Long, oh so very long. Don't get me wrong he is still a great Guitar player, and there is some good music on here, but it seems as though pre-retirement has begun. I must say his vocals have goten very good. As far as the Cd as a hole goes the word Lethargic comes to mind. I have been a fan for years and I am 40 years old so when I say lethargic it must be. I have watched or I should heard his music go up and down over the years, this one is a down. It would be good background music but to sit down and listen to it is a challenge. Oh by the way you may notice that I never mention the name Eric Clapton, that is because this review can double for the latest Mark Knopfler CD, word for word."},{"rating":"2","title":"Guess What?","review":"I just go off the phone with Bodge and he said he was thinking about having a cotnest. To see who his biggest fan is, but you dont have to enter it because you KNOW who it is!!! The winner gets to have a day with Bodge and a SPECIAL concert and dinner with THE MAN himself!! My friend said that if I win I'd be eating a lot of tube steak. But tube steak isn't BRITISH. Probably I'd be eating a lot of steak and kidney pie (IT\\"S a real food, PEo-ple look it UP!!!)oh, and buy reptile on amazon!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's the Same Old Song ... Literally","review":"If you've liked any of Clapton's work in past 25 years, you'll like Reptile. Same thing, new package. There's no question that Clapton is talented guitarist (wildly overrated, but talented) and still fairly interesting for the 40+ set who still think he's \\"groovy\\" much in the way the previous generation thought Liberace was \\"one hep cat.\\" Aside from the well-executed Son & Sylvia, this is a fairly predictable, paint-by-numbers exercise.If you don't have a lot of exposure to Clapton, do yourself a favor and check him out in his prime (30 years ago folks!) with Derek and the Dominos during the \\"Layla\\" era or 461 Ocean Blvd. There's a lot of great Clapton out there. Virtually all of it is pre-1980."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eric's Gone Pop!","review":"I think the first track \\"reptile\\" sets the pace for the entire cd. Very slow moving, no continuity and sooooo pop! There are only about 4 good songs on this cd. I actually would skip past tracks after hearing the first few minutes .Pilgrim was bad and this one is more of the same. This really saddens me as I'm a die-hard Clapton fan from the '60's."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Strong Set From Clapton The Musician","review":"If your only interest in Eric Clapton is as a guitar god then this CD is probably not what you're looking for. But, if you're interested in Clapton the complete musician you'll be very happy with the results. Covering blues, rhythm & blues, rock, soul and even a little jazz, this is Clapton's most diverse collection yet. There is no shortage of guitar, just not a lot of show-off soloing.His voice is in great shape, the band is tight and the songs are strong."},{"rating":"1","title":"Been done before ...","review":"Almost everything on this album mirrors something he has put out since 1989's 'Jouneryman'. Light acoustic, some blues, r&b a little rock. Echos of his 70's output resound here. I suppose the addition of the Impressions can be considered new.I have been a fan of Clapton for nearly twenty years now. And one thing that he has consistantly said about when people want to hear him plug in a Les Paul and crank the amps ala the Cream days, his response is \\"I've done that already.\\" Well Mr Clapton, you've done the acoustic, r&b, easy listening rock before also, yet you still put it out (as evidenced by this album). If you consider yourself largely a blues guitarist, then lets stick with that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Music","review":"Great music from a very special friend. Keep up the great work sister. Love ya loads sis, Phyllis"},{"rating":"2","title":"I disagree","review":"I rank this at the top of Hocico's releases. It combines the harshness and rage of their earlier work, with more accessible and memorable melodies and song structures. Of course, the instrumental tracks have always been throw-aways. Spirits of Crime may be among their 2 or 3 best songs. This is top-quality harsh electro that sets the standard for the genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cold interpretation and staging","review":"Although an opera lover, I have never been a big Traviata fan. This production did not help. The decor is cold, and the acting only decent. I much prefer the Zeffirelli (film) version (cond. Levine)."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm trying","review":"I'm trying assist this famous video because this musical theme is lovely to me. Infortunetely I live in Brazil, to much distant of EUA..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fine looking cast and a complete performance","review":"First of all let me say that I can't think of anything that is bad about this DVD. The performance is of a high quality, the production is fairly traditional and enjoyable, the video and sound quality are top notch (although it's not widescreen). I gave it an extra fifth star for being as complete as it is. Even Alfredo's second act cabaletta is repeated, when many performances cut the whole thing. Gheorghiu is very attractive, which is important in this work, I think. Why would Alfredo fall for a dog? Lopardo is good and without as much of the tendency to sharp notes as I have heard from his other recordings and live performances. Nucci is up to his usual standard, and if you like his timbre (somewhat on the nasal side) you will enjoy his portrayal. Solti's conducting is solid. A thouroughly enjoyable set. I sold my CD set taken from these performances to get the DVD. Totally worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"very clear video. Gheorghiu is beautiful","review":"I enjoyed this video very much. This is a recording of a live presentation. Most impressive, apart from Gherghiu's amazing voice was the amazing clarity of the photography. My only critism is that I longed for some close up view's of Ms Gheorghiu's face."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gheorghiu and Lopardo Shine","review":"This is my favorite video recording of 'La Traviata'. Lopardo's introduction to the \\"Brindisi\\" in Act I, and his acting in the fanale, lend a humor and humanity to Alfredo that is rare on the opera stage. Gheorghiu especially shines an Act II; watch her hands. With her hands on stage, she could have phoned in the rest of the performance. This was Georg Solti's last video and his conducting showed a sensitivity that will be the finest testament to his own career. The sets and costumes are up to the usual high standards of the Royal Opera."},{"rating":"2","title":"A \\"Regular People\\" Review","review":"I'm new to the Opera, just getting into it over the last year. This is a great DVD and to make it even better you get the Highlights CD which sounds great. Any newcomer to the Opera will love the performance. But it would be good to also have the libretto handy for the viewing definitely worth it...and keep me updated!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bravo!!!","review":"I watched this on TV many years ago, and watched over and over again and I'm sure this was very sensational for opera fans and musicians. When Sir Georg Solti died I was so sad because I wanted to go to his opera. The difficult things about opera is that it should be great in both music and also drama (act).This is perfect in both. Gheorghiu was especially good. I cannot find better \\"La Traviata\\" than this. This is my favorite!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gheorghiu ain't no Anna Moffo","review":"After Anna Moffo, Angela Gheorghiu is one cold and regal Violetta. The contrast is jarring. This is a good production but visually too minimalist for me. Solti and the orchestra acquit themselves brilliantly. But Ms. Gheorghiu is so formal and regal, and so cold, that I almost wish I had not bought this DVD, even with the added attraction of the highlights CD. Alfredo is superb, with a resonant voice; Ms. Gheorghiu also has a strong and accurate instrument. The sound overall is very good. But I am spoiled by Anna Moffo. She is so feminine and spontaneous, unaffected and passionate. She could be Violetta - she simply does not seem to be acting. Ms. Gheorghiu, by contrast, is definitely playing a role in an opera. She lacks the emotional authenticity and vulnerability of Ms. Moffo. As she begins to sing \\"Sempre libera, it sounds like she spits out the words, as if she were angry. It's puzzling. But Ms. Moffo sings her heart out, and she has won mine."},{"rating":"2","title":"ritual beating system","review":"ok..ok..I the FINEST music I have heard of its kind.The soulful vocals of Carlinhos Brown are fabulous!!I have since collected his solo work,as well as some of his collaborators..i.e...Marisa Monte and Arnaldo Antunes......music that makes you swoon.Music that makes your body sway and flow..in the natural rythms of life...this music is tribal as well as melodic....floating jazz melodies over pounding synchopated beats..absolutely GREAT!A perfect synthesis of Brasilian and Western styles.BUY IT NOW!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Adequate -- but too expensive for what it offers","review":"This video is instantly dated by the fuzzy look, the late 80s/early 90s fashions, and the presenter's stilted, infomercial speaking style.The information given is very basic.

It was just a big setup for the next book with plodding asides, usless digressions, forgettable characters, this book has it all.The editing in the first 50 or 60 pages left a lot to be desired.

Whenever they threw in the made up names for the various places on the two \\"earths\\" the flow of the story came to a screaching halt with my mind struggling to put together the clues that pointed to where on our Earth the action was taking place.It was over 500 pages into the book before they described what the Arcanan military titles actually meant. Which is to say that the book was nearly done and they were still setting up the universe. You'd think that after 800 pages something would have been accomplished but it feels like it was only the prelude.The novel could easily have been edited down to half it's current length without hurting the story. I eventually just started skimming through the second half only stopping when interesting things were happening and I don't feel I missed much.I would not recomend this novel to Weber fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rough Book for Weber","review":"This is almost a first. A Weber book that I really didn't like too much (the other being Insurrection w/ Steve White). I don't know, it's an excellent premise (the Multiverse), but it's just not written well: It's a bit too slow and boring, and I felt that some of the characters were being led by the hand by Weber (meaning that they easily figured things out that should have been nearly impossible). Furthermore, there is way too much animosity between characters on one side of it (seems like it's the side that Linda Evans wrote, probably). Oh, well, hopefully he won't write too many more books that are as bad as John Ringo's stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"The aptly named Hells' Gate","review":"As a long time Weber fan I was disappointed by this plodding, predictable and ponderous attempt. As other reviewers noted, too many \\"J\\" names and way to many irrelevant details, all detailed in exquisite...you guessed it...detail. Part of the problem is with the original conceit which is parallel universes. The problem arises with both universes being complex which makes for twice as much exposition....some of which is not altogether bad, but overall it makes for slow going. There were some incongruous moments, like the trip back to Arcona during which the two lead female characters are relaxing in deck chairs--just two babes catching some rays on the cruise home and they talk about....genetics. I guess exposition is where you find it. If I had it to do over, I would wait for the paperback."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!","review":"I really like the Honor Harrington books! I bought the Hell's Gate books in hardbound because I like the Honorverse so much.Hell's Gate is a big disappointment. I finished the whole thing and I still don't have the characters straight. This is at least partially because all of them have difficult made-up names. Had I browsed it in a store, I wouldn't have bought it because of this. I bought Book 2 at the same time but I don't know if I'll ever read it! I wasn't involved enough in Book 1 to make it worthwhile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreadable","review":"I couldn't read this book... 100 pages in and I gave up. A poorly written romance novel with an extremely thin science-fiction facade. Incredibly wordy, pages and pages which don't advance the story or character development one bit. You can skip 20 pages and not miss anything. Heck, you can skip 1000 pages and not miss anything... that's what I ended up doing. Scary bad. Yanking nose hairs en masse will get you to the same place for free."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do NOT buy this book","review":"I read and enjoyed both this book and the book that followed in the Multiverse \\"series\\". However, what is the point of buying ANY book in a series that the AUTHOR HAS ABANDONED? The two existing books are not really good as \\"standalone\\" works so purchasing this book will be nothing but a frustrating waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I love Science Fiction and most of Webers work. But this took soooooo long to even start to develop, that I lost interest. I couldn't even make myself keep reading it. If you like military scifi, skip this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hell's Gate to confusion","review":"Wow I was really looking forward to this book, as I haved enjoyed Weber's other books. Then I tried to read it. I have been a science fiction fantasy fan going on 40 years now. After 30 pages I was so confused as to who,was who,as well as the technical, aspect of the story that I gave up. I mean multiverses were first encountered by me from H.Beam Piper, as well as other authors and I was able to keep track. Then you have the tech's from Sharona who don't have magic but are psychic and telepaths,give me a break. This book will soon be in the discount bin which is a shame as Weber is usually a good author."},{"rating":"2","title":"too complicated?","review":"I have been a fan of both authors and looked forward to this new series, but. While the book is tightly written and the characters are well plotted, there are faults. Or at least in my opinion.the book is long, extremely complicated, and because the setting is so different than the average readers background, hard to understand.Both magic and PSi powers need more explanation on why they developed rather than our industrial revolution type universe.No explanation of how these \\"gates-between-the-worlds\\" work is given; maybe both universes are too low tech to even try a explanation.On the whole, I can recomend the book for a light evenings read. I especially wait the next volume early in 07, maybe evething will be explained.Overall, despite the faults, a book well worth investing your time and money in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellant","review":"Great story, perhaps long winded setting scenes and characters, nevertheless i am eagerly looking foeward to the sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Requires some patience","review":"I've read a bunch of the other reviews and I know where they are coming from. There were a lot of characters introduced in very short order and I had to keep checking to see which side was being discussed. It made it confusing but after a while things started to click for me. I still really enjoyed it and it has much of the same feel I expect from Weber. When I re-read Honor Harrington books, I tend to skip all the politcal intrigue, discourse, and stupidity. I've read through all of that here in this book on this first pass through, but it was hard in this case because so much of the book was that sort of political maneuvering.Still, I am very much looking forward to the next one. Hopefully we won't be introduced to 27 new characters while still following the story of the dozen or so that we are currently interested in."},{"rating":"1","title":"EXTRAORDINARILY BORING AND SLOW , VIRTUALLY NOTHING HAPPENS","review":"This book is 800 pages long. I wonder if the writers were paid by the page and/or by the number of words. The only thing that actually \\"happens\\" in the book, covering at most, 50 pages, is two battles in the beginning between Arcana and Sharona. Arcana is a very advanced society based on magic. Sharona is technological, but for some unknown reason, is only at a steam powered level of technology. I don't understand why Sharona could not have had a 20th century level of technology. The balance of the book is basically 750 pages of conversations between the characters and some political manipulations. There is such a thing as having too much characterization. It was very difficult not to nod off during this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, Boring, Boring....","review":"I wanted to start reading a good series, so I purchased this book because of the past reviews on Webers other series of books. I am struggling though this book (it's HELL!), and am finding it a very tough read. In fact I put it down 4 days ago, and started reading another book by a completely different author. 0h! the relief I am feeling that I am enjoying a GOOD read again! But now I am feeling guilty about spending so much money on \\"Hell's Gate\\", and not finishing it. Don't spend the money on this book! It is not worth the pain and suffering."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Weber - Nope, Couldn't Be","review":"This has to be written by Linda Evans entirely - in my opinion: Not \\"David Weber & Linda Evans\\".The writing style has absolutely none of Weber's touch. Rather the writing style here is clearly based on the following philosophy and written word style:Never use one word when 1,000 words can be used; never use one sentence when 100 pages can be written; never have a clear and direct description when a meandering, redundant, over detailed background can be employed; and on and on and on and on and on.Unreadable. Not worth a yawn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sometimes...","review":"Sometimes when you buy a 1000+ page book, you get Shogun or The Stand. Sometimes you get... this. An interesting story, but waaay too wordy. Read a chapter, flip through a chapter of boring exposition, read another chapter, repeat... for twelve HUNDRED pages. These authors were not well served by their editor(s). The excision of about 400 pages of filler would have earned this book three stars (or even four) from me.Consider also that almost four years after release of book 1, Books 3 and 4 of the series don't have release dates yet. So unless you're vewy, vewy patient..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother with this series.","review":"I love reading David Weber books, but the writing for this series is atrocious. There are simply too many characters that do nothing, that you don't care about, and that take up chapters at a time. I slogged through the first book and found myself skipping... not skimming, skipping... entire chapters devoted to these characters. I finished the second book and they still do nothing.Simply put, I found it bad enough to write a review on Amazon about it instead of the normal apathy response."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very OK","review":"A lot of time wasted in this book, at one point a character spent, I think 6 pages, walking around a room and getting descriptions of what was on the walls, the maps, everything. This book could have been pared down to about 1/3 of the size and you still would have gotten everything you needed to know from it.Very little in the way of action, but when something did happen it held your interest. Mostly talk throughout the book. I'm going to read the next book in the series, I hope it's better, otherwise I might be done with this author.."},{"rating":"1","title":"ouch..painful","review":"As a long time webber fan to the point of buying his omnibuses (stars at war, empire from the ashes, in fury born) as well as singles, this has been the most painful of his books to read (worse than the excalibur alternative which was terrible). It reads like a prose heavy version of John Ringo's council wars. Good concept, magic versus technolgy but not really fleshed out and the introduction of too many (at this point) extraneous characters who do nothing but talk about their motivations makes this a tedious read. I ended up skipping chapters just to follow the characters I liked. Needs severe editorial help (not unlike the wheel of time books that rambled on...)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Plodding","review":"Normally, I'm a fan of Weber's work, but this book is too flawed to keep me interested in the series.The biggest problem: exposition. There's so much of it in this book that very little interesting actually happens. This book is effectively just the setup for the next book, but without enough story of its own to stand up as an interesting read. The resulting pacing is awful.Put another way, it is as if the series bible was spliced into the text of the book by mistake.Beyond that, there are too many annoying or uninteresting characters. Other reviewers's accusations of incompetent characters are on the mark.Bottom line: Overwritten, underedited. This has been a trend in Weber's recent work, but it is particularly bad on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this book","review":"There is, at most, about a hundred pages of story here. The rest is filler and padding designed solely to make you buy the next book. You get to the 52nd chapter and after all that it stops as the action is about to begin. Harrington regulars will recognize familiar hall marks from the latter half of that series. A strong female lead. (Two of them actually.) Smart animals. Equivalent but not equal technology. Corrupt officials back home. Two powerful empires, one of which is (conveniently) significantly more evil and stupid than the other - just so you easily know who the bad guys are. If you really love the authors books and must buy it - buy it cheap. If not go straight to the second in series which begins (as this novel should have) by dumping you straight into the action."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's the pont?","review":"The premise of this book that two totally different cultures would go to war because of a few mistakes is ludicrous. There's no need to fight each other; trade works much better. And there's no point in fighting over resources when the resources are unlimited! Just find another portal to a new world.I gave up on it just after the two cultures meet. A pointless story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring.","review":"Why has David Webers recent books all been terrible? I don't know but I wont be buying them anymore.

Oh well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Failed potential","review":"I'm on page 900 and seriously considering quitting the book. Really too bad, as there are characters that I like, but way too much lecturing from author...like taking a history class on some made-up society that you could care less about. There are many plot contrivances that are just annoyingly absurd, like idea that an advanced culture with advanced weapons just can't conceive of the idea of flight. Wish I woulda read reviews before buying this dud >.<"},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly boring","review":"This book is 1200 pages and would have greatly benefitted by being shortened to 300 pages or so. That would at least have created something resempling a pace. As it is, it crawls along, one irrelevant detail after another. To add insult to injury, it is not even SF. It is fantasy, with one side in the conflict using magic, and the other having telepaths and ''technology'' on the level where a revolver is considerd high-tech. I have to admit that I did not make it past page 250 before I threw it into the trash. Maybe it gets better after that, but I very much doubt it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the David Weber I'm used to","review":"I have been an avid reader of David Weber's military sci-fi, especially the Honor Harrington books. I have, however, also noticed that when a book by a well-known and rightfully popular author appears with a secondary author, the work is invariably sub-standard. This is the case, unfortunately, with this book. This is the first book purportedly by Weber that has failed the 20-page rule. The prose is best described as turgid. It is disappointing to see his name on this book, as it doesn't live up to the books I have come to love so much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"As a fan of Weber, I expected a good read from this book. High tech meets magic. Grim battles, political maneuverings, the works. Unfortunately, this book is a series of slow-moving descriptive text with a few short battles and a smidgen of political maneuvering wedged in. After the twentieth or so painfully detailed description of just how angry the citizens of one culture were at the other, etc, I think the readers got the point. I'm sorry, Mr. Weber, I read for a thousand pages but just could not finish this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring Gate","review":"Found most of the book incredibly boring. Lacked a good editor. By the end I was hoping for a nuclear winter to put everyone out of their misery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cliffhanger ending","review":"For the most part I enjoyed the book. I tend to like action, so I found the long descriptive passages somewhat tedious, but the overall story was good enough to more than offset that, and there was plenty of action. What really annoyed me was the cliffhanger ending. I generally like series. (I am really looking forward to the ninth book in C. J. Cherryh's Foreigner series, due out in February.) But each book in a series should be self contained. I think it is unconscionable for the authors to write an 800 page book (far too long anyway) with essentially no ending. The book actually ends with the statement \\"Watch for Hell Hath No Fury\\" (the next book in the series). I think it is fine for the authors to want to sell the next book in the series, but that does not remove their obligation to their readers to produce a finished product."},{"rating":"1","title":"The only book by David Weber I ever hated!!","review":"I bought this book because it was by David Weber -- big mistake.

I read this book to page 200 or so and never could get into to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I must disagree with the poor reviews!","review":"I actually think the multiverse books are Weber's best! The whole story idea is a little silly, I'll admit, but I was pleasantly surprised at how well Weber and Evans pulled it off. I found myself really caring about the characters and their relationships. This book is not full of any deep or profound ideas, but it does pose the challenging of making both sides of a conflict seem \\"right\\" and sympathetic, and Weber and Evans did a decent job.This is not great sci-fi by any means, but it's a really fun book to read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very much on the tedious side of things","review":"Normally I love David Weber books.

Page after page of people peering into one another's eyes. All of the female characters bursting into tears at the drop of a hat....again and again, and again. Heroic male characters who the average trooper wouldn't follow to the local waste water treatment plant, let alone into battle.

Disc 2 is rife with bent pitches and creepy minor chords that pang strongly of The Blair Witch Project and work by Vidna Obmana, just really eerie and dark. There album is void of melody and left me totally creeped out, and therefore, I cannot listen to it again. I understand that some people may not agree with me, and I am cool with that, but I am disappointed. The only redeeming quality of this album is that Substrata Disc 1 is included, which is much better than V.2, \\"Man with a Camera\\".Now if you want to talk about a really GOOD Biosphere album, then I highly recommend \\"Microgravity\\" which is a much better representation of the Mr. Jennsen's talent and full of upbeat, contemporary and futuristic melodies.

From the reviews I read, I thought it have more of the ambiant qualitys of Michael Shrieve. I would recomend any thing by Phillip Glass or Patrick Hearn.

This inspired the Academy to also award another western 2 years later (\\"Unforgiven\\"). After that there was a wave of new westerns. Some great (Wyatt Earp), some good (Tombstone) and some awful (American Outlaws & Texas Rangers).Fast forward to 2003 and here comes another Costner western. While this one should not win Best Picture it should definetly get a nomination and if you look on the horizon there are 2 more big budget westerns coming out this year (The Alamo & Cold Mountain).

Must see movie!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Movie Making!","review":"I remember an old John Wayne movie called \\"Cowboys\\". \\"Open Range\\" brought that same realistic approach to molding a movie around a Western format. The movie couldn't have been titled better. The incredible visual work in this movie alone make it a must see; not to mention the believable characters played by Duvall and Costner.The only mistake this movie makes is trying to add more emotional dimensions to the main characters than is necessary to make the film flow. This only happens towards the end of the film: Charley, suddenly concerned about Boss's real name, after riding with him for years. Boss, suddenly concerned about good tasting chocolate and a storekeepers lack of finance to enjoy his own chocolate.The action scenes are great, the acting is tight, and the storyline is well trimmed.

Another strength is the presence of Robert Duvall who portrays the boss of 3 other men whose herd of cattle do \\"free-range\\" grazing, much to the chagrin of the neighboring cattlemen. He and Kevin Costner have to stand up to the men who oppose them, which leads to the obligatory shoot-out at the end. Another subplot is the developing relationship between Costner's character and Annette Bening who plays the part of the sister of the local doctor who tends to Duvall's men who are wounded by the townspeople.

I thought the gun fight was very realistic with the sounds so clear and upclose. It put you right in the middle of it all. It drew gasps and yells from the fellow movie watchers. The scenic background really put you in the old west losing the hub-bub of our daily grind.

I'm a very tough movie critic and usually find the birght spots in any movie to be enough to carry it over. However, this movie left me completely empty. It's cliche, overdramatic, poorly written, and incredibally empty. The saving points of the movie, are a clever idea of free grazers and a great gunfight, aside from that its a long 2 hours and 19 minutes. The story itself is cheesy, and nearly unbelievable. Costner is horrible, his character is a stoic individualist with no social skills, and his interaction with Benning is laughable. Duvall is solid in this role, however he is also very cliche and needs a real star with him to shine which he does not have.If your a western fan, this will most certainly not rank in your top 10."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacking Color","review":"I found open range very disappointing. The universal missing link is color in every aspect of the movie. The characters, the scenery, the dialogue, the sincerity, the acting, the props, the make shift town all lacked quality and color. I guess for Mr. Costner it was about breaking even and making a few bucks. Hoping that his fans would flock to the shows to view a hope of greatness like Dances with Wolves. I felt so empty after viewing this picture. I read some personal reviews and could not believe my eyes. If you have seen the movie Mission you would remember the imagery and sound, that did not find itself in Open Range.

The magic of going to a forgotten time, living with it's citizens, etc. \\"Open Range\\" captures that magic.Kevin Costner's sure directorial hands guide the amazing stars (Including Costner, himself) through a script filled with old west flair. The technical crew capture the beauty of the Old West in all it's glory and craft an intense, bloody, and memorable gunfight.\\"Open Range,\\" despite it's minor flaws, is a modern Western classic.

An epic for scenery with no plot to hold it up.Cliched story, bad cattle man etc. Nothing new here. Some pretty scenery, but boy it gets boring fast.And such ringing of the audience's emotions.

Annette Benning and Michael Jeter. The story is pretty much standard western--good old guys are done dirt by bad guys (including Michael Gambon with an on-again-off-again Irish accent) and they seek revenge, naturally involving a gunfight. However, the quality of the cast lifts this above the ordinary, the scenery is beautiful, and the story is satisfying. I recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best modern western done","review":"Westerns went out of fashion for a while after Silverado, but with Open Range the western is back.

It has fantastic scenery (filmed in Western Canada), a classic gunfight scene, and a little romance thrown in. What more can you ask for? Robert Duvall and Kevin Kostner are perfectly cast as the \\"open range\\" cattle herders."},{"rating":"2","title":"Familiar actors acting great","review":"Good western to watch alone or in a group. I bought it to give away as a present, and it was well received."},{"rating":"2","title":"In harms way in Harmorville, Montana","review":"Harmorville, Montana, is the scene of this ultra violent shoot-out. Thetownspeople were mostly not gun-handy. After all, this movie depicts the 1880s, whenfrontier ways were already giving way to more civilized manners. The land had notbeen fenced in yet, though, and the growing animosity toward free-ranging cattleherds was not based on law.The menace lurking in Harmorville was aptly forshadowed by the recurring symbol ofthe buzzsaw blades carried about, mounted and displayed around town. The oddsagainst two open-range cowpokes surviving were fearfully thin. It was cool-headedcunning that gave the winning edge to Boss and Charlie in their quest forretribution against the wicked ways of the powerful landowner, the corruptmarshal he controlled, and their numerous armed hirelings. The buzzsaw did notmake the cut this time."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best western ever!","review":"This is a must own for any western collection.

I agree that it was good to be Robert Duvall in a role that was so much like Gus in Lonesome Dove, but that's about the only bright spot I could find in the movie. The story has just been done so many times. For such great acting talent, this one was a disappointment to me. My time would have been better spent watching The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, Rio Bravo or Lonesome Dove."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like watching grass grow- predictable & boring!","review":"I won't spend a lot of time here because the film is not worth the time. It's disjointed, rambling, boring, predictable and illogical, however my wife liked it and I reaped the fringe benefits of sitting through this 'chick flick'. ;-)The cinematography was good but the story line was grazing somewhere off with the herd. It would have made a better 1/2 hour tv show (because it would have been about 1 1/2 hours shorter!). If you must watch it wait 'til it comes on cable."},{"rating":"1","title":"1-star for the scenery only...","review":"This is one of the worst movies I have seen in recent memory. Stilted dialogue. Scenes that faded out and made you feel like a commercial was coming on, unrealistic scenarios...just implausible from start to finish. Yes, you can leave and go get a snack and miss nothing, so that's handy I guess. I am a huge Robert Duvall fan and I never thought I'd see the day I would dislike a movie he's in and it makes me wonder at his good sense to agree to do it. Plus, he was playing Gus without the excellent dialogue of Lonesome Dove coming out of his mouth. Horrible. Whatever you do, don't spend money on this turkey. But, the mountains and the rangeland are beautiful, so there's that. Just mute it and fast forward through the \\"action\\". You won't miss a thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"GOOD old fashioned Western!","review":"Let me say this right off the bat. The main reason to watch this movie is Robert (\\"The Great Santini\\") Duvall! His performance in this movie is worth three times the price of admission. He goes from being a gentle father figure in one scene to a fearsome arbiter of frontier justice in the next. The plot is simple: a few cowboys go into town not looking for trouble and run into a corrupt cattle baron that doesn't want them around. Well no one tells Boss Spearman (Duvall) where he can or can't go, \\"That just sticks in his craw!\\" Kevin Costner and the always beautiful Annette Benning give good solid performances in supporting roles. The cinematogrophy also deserves special mention as the shots of the country side are beautiful to behold."},{"rating":"2","title":"Open Range is all Duvall","review":"Robert Duvall is at his best in this movie. He steals whatever thunder Kevin Costner may have hoped for. It is a must see in the big theater for all the bigness of the great outdoors. It may have been filmed in Canada, but it looked like what the \\"old west\\" might have looked like in the era of the film.Duvall is John Wayne in this film. Costner did his best job of acting since Dance With Wolves. This is not a typical Costner film. It's better. I can hardly wait for it to come out in DVD. My screen isn't big enough at 36\\" to give this film its due.

Perhaps that's why my disappontment was even greater! I loved DANCES; I loved LONESOME DOVE. I did not like OPEN RANGE. \\"Slow\\" just doesn't come close to describing how slow this movie is. I started wishing they would get onto the gun battle, just so the action would pick up. The \\"extras\\" on the dvd are better than the movie. OPEN RANGE is great on scenery; but Boss and Charley spent way too much time giving each other meaningful looks instead of getting to the business at hand...defending the rights of \\"open rangers.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Western story!!","review":"This is a great movie.

Watch and enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Did cowboys talk this way?","review":"Don't know. Duvall & Costner seem to be too smart to be free range cowboys. They seemed to be very 21st century to me but no manner. Costner puts his money where his heart is & I repect the projects he's done. The production values are always there & not cheap. He can tell & I guess he figures his customers can also. Westerns have changed over the years but this one has things in common with the oldies, such as justice redemption, gunplay a little romance. Annette Benning is a delightful diversion from the all male cast. A very good western for our times. Sure, I recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"a real turkey","review":"a ghastly film that even the 'dances with wolves'- type sound track can't rescue. it might have made a story for 50 minutes but at 2 hrs 10 it drags on for eternity. so what is so bad about it? a truly dreadful screenplay, lousy direction (with every scene three times longer than it should be) plus a repetitive cliched story that leaves zilch to the imagination. you have the impression that you have seen every scene before. that is because you have. costner even manages to wreck the pekinpah-style shoot out at the end, turning it into an absurd parody.there were a few good things. alberta looks great. duvall does a reprise of his augustus mccrae character (lonesome dove), albeit a doddery one. michael gambon enjoys himself as the villain of the piece while annette still looks good heading into middle age. thin pickings though. best give this one a miss."},{"rating":"2","title":"DVD Open Range","review":"I received the product in a most reasonable time.

Okay, the one problem with Kevin Costner's movies is that he insists on acting in them. Robert Duvall pretty much reprises his role as Gus from Lonesome Dove, which is a good thing. However, Costner, though playing the strong, silent, Captain Call type character, is no Tommy Lee Jones.The story is pure Western genre with all the necessary cliches, including the love interest, and some saloon scenes, but, hey, if you went to see a mystery, you wouldn't expect them to leave out the dead body or the detective, right?Due to Costner's acting, I give this only four stars, but Duvall makes it still well worth seeing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Open Range","review":"I really like this movie.It is one of my favorites.Kevin Costner and Robert Duvall afe two of my favorite actors.The country side is incredible!

It could have been cut down to around 2 hours if they didn't show every little thing like a close shot of flicking a cigerate to him looking at the sun to watching them slowly trot across the plains.

Duvall is upset about the killing of his cowboy friend 'Mose\\". In his anger he refers to our Lord as a \\"Son of a b----\\". At 43:34 Kostner \\"agrees with\\" Duvall digging deeper this anti-Christian conversation.Into the trash bin with the whole lot of them I say. There are many ways to express your deep frustration.

He goes on and on and on... The first hour is a good set up for the next hour and a half or so...Duvall is great, almost as if he wrote his own dialogue. It is not that \\"Open Range\\" is not a good movie. It is just not that good. The pace is slow, which i think is deliberate to set the tone and it works, again for about the first hour. But even when the story gets going, it does not have enough power. The violence is subdued, as is all of the acting, almost as if Costner the director did not want Costner the actor to look too enthuiastic. Because all of the actors do not seem to be as interested as they want the viewer to be involved with their lives. There are moments that are endearing, but not nearly enough to make you want to sit through the length of the movie.

As the reviewer shallowly sugests, the movie lacks \\"Thematic Impact\\" That's reviewer speak for, the characters didn't have enough nuerosis to shock the audience. Instead, Costner shows his tremendous talent to highlight the reality of common life and common struggle. Much like he performed to critical acclaim in 'Dances With Wolves' Costner paints inspiring depth with image and sound throughout the film. The landscapes are breathtaking and his use of dynamic sound structure transport one right into the scene. The only thing that could top this movie is its release on Blu-ray."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hi-Yip! Here Comes Duvall & Costner!","review":"Robert Duvall is the man! God bless this man! Last evening while changing channels and reading, I ran across a jewel. Where have I been that I haven't seen this movie, Open Range?! Anyway, that's what I do at night, I change channels and read. Alas! Two of my favorites--Robert Duvall and Kevin Costner in a movie-- and a western at that.Could I stand it?This was too good to be true-- but true it was. I did not change the channel once, and I only read during commercials. Open Range is one of the best movies I've seen since I watched Duvall in Lonesome Dove, and Costner in Dances With Wolves. Duvall and Costner, they've got what it takes to be a real actor. They become the character, and still manage to leave a little of themselves in there. Only a mastermind can pull this off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classically constructed western","review":"Two veteran free-range cattlemen (Kevin Costner and the incomparable Robert Duvall) must enter hostile territory to get medical attention for the wounded boy who works for them (Diego Luna). The town is under the thumb of an unscrupulous cattle baron who despises free-rangers and has no compunctions about killing them (Michael Gambon). This is a classic Western in which the two protagonists are compelled by their moral code to face danger instead of retreating from it. Costner and Duvall have magnificent chemistry in this film--Duvall as the moral conscience of the pair, and Costner as the former killer who is haunted by his past and longs to be able to see himself as a good man. Although director Costner has had a somewhat checkered career, he demonstrates here that he is a man with true talent. The final gunfight is a real highlight and not to be missed./"},{"rating":"1","title":"why bother buying it?","review":"This is one badly written book.

There is a convenient divider that stores in the lid.

The lid is flexible and does lose its shape after washing, but it always fits perfectly. My theory on the cracking and warping is that these people used the heated-dry setting on their dishwashers...

My main problem has always been being able to consume all the greens I buy before it gets mushy or wet, which then leaves me feeling guilty/wasteful. Not to mention, leafy greens aren't exactly cheap. With this though, I would say it gives an extra week (at least) for whatever veggies you put in. The trick though, is not to cram everything in and leave a bit of air space (for circulation I guess).I've tried and it works beautifully with spinach, all sorts of lettuces (iceburg, boston, etc), and asparagus. There are other vegetables you can use too and they've plastered the list on the outside for you as a handy reference (and whether to allow venitilation or not). I only wish they made it bigger (but I guess I should just go out and buy another haha)."},{"rating":"1","title":"DOES NOT WORK ON LETTUCE!","review":"I eat leafy lettuce, not iceburg...leafy or romaine hearts only and for years I've used the iceburg crispers (those ones that are kinda round)... recently mine fell and broke and so I thought I'd try one of these guys out...As directed I added water to the bottom, opened the vents and within 2 days, had wilted lettuce. I tried closing the vents half way and same thing. When I closed the vents completely I got rotten lettuce... Not sure what the trick here is folks but lettuce would last for WEEKS in a crisper and all I had to do was rinse.... guess I'll be hunting for one of those today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great, I just wish it was much bigger","review":"This works so wonderfully, esp in combo with a salad spinner. However, it will only hold approx. one head of anything after cutting. We use one head of spinach, romain, and cabbage for our weekly salad and require three of these babies to replace the one huge tupperware container I used to use. This takes up alot more space in the fridge which stinks. I wish they would make a much larger version of this product. That being said, all the salads last the whole week and are as crisp as ever on the last day, usually 7-8 days later. I'm sure it would would keep at least a few days beyond that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well, but it's big","review":"Can't complain about how it keeps the lettuce fresher; it does do that well. The only drawback is that it's very large so it takes up a lot of room in the refrigerator. It can't really go in the crisper drawer, so it must sit on one of the shelves. All things considered, that's a very minor issue, however, so doesn't take away from the functionality of the keeper itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fresh lettuce and spinach for over a week!","review":"This is the best little purchase we've made this year. We have a ton of lettuce and spinach from the garden and with just two of us eating it, we needed a way to store it so that it keeps longer. This container does exactly what it says it will do. The greens come out of it fresh and crispy (even more so than when they were picked). Couldn't ask for a better veggie keeper.Only con is that the divider that comes with it is really flimsy. It doesn't want to snap into the little tabs very easily so we ended up just putting the lettuce and spinach all together in the container. Still works great.Last note - I definitely wouldn't put this in the dishwasher even though the directions say it is dishwasher safe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"It has worked better than I ever expected, keeping everything so fresh. I'll be buying these as gifts, great product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Word To The Wise... Not Dishwasher Safe!!!","review":"I can't vouch for the product because I never got to use it.

So now, I am passing on this knowledge of this product onto you. I hope this helps."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"I just ordered my 4th Keeper. These are fantastic.

The concept seemed like a good idea. After running it through the dishwasher, the bottom \\"lid\\" warped and it ended up leaking all over my refrigerator drawers. I was constantly cleaning up water. I ended up buying the tupperware ones and am very happy."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disapointed","review":"I was very excited to have this at first.

I don't see any need for it although it's nice looking and the top stayed on fine. I bought it like new at the thrift shop so I guess the first owner felt the same way, and I donated it back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, well.","review":"Returned this item. Didn't keep spinach fresh as long as I thought it should. A loft of commotion for what you get from the product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea but only lasts maybe 5 days in Fridge.","review":"Love the concept of keeping Spinach or lettuce fresh and crisp vs. soggy and wet. I bought this item with the sole purpose to eat more greens (spinach salad) for lunch or dinner along with grilled chicken, onions, cheese and dressing. However, my mother and sister buy only what they need at the Copps grocery store- self serve salad bar. According to them, it stays just as fresh in the plastic containers and is more cost efficient, and they get to choose how much they are taking so food does not go to waste. After using it for 1 week, I washed the container and has been sitting on my breakfast bar since. Recently, I bought spinach and thought I'd give it one more shot. I may possibly give it to my mom for her birthday instead of returning it. Hope this review helps you as I know it's hard to read all these reviews when it's just best to see for yourself!

Look elsewhere for a lettuce keeper or you too will fall victim of the \\"Mystery of the Lettuce Keeper Lid!\\"That's right! You store your lettuce, secure the lid and WHILE YOU SLEEP! Ahhh! The lid curls up in the and creeps it's way off the top of the keeper!Okay, so the lid is shallow, cheap, thin, flimsy and hard to put on securely. I was willing to work with that! BUT... One night in the Fridge AND..... It's a nightmare! Apparently, this product comes with little gremlins who pry open the lid while you have visions of sugar plums dancing in your head. Ee-hee-hee-hee!Head my warning! If you buy this product, don't sleep at night or gremlins will take over your fridge."},{"rating":"2","title":"So crisp!","review":"I bought this because I have a hard time keeping romaine crisp and fresh. This does the trick. I've also used it on a couple other veggies and it's worked wonderfully. I would recommend this to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Veggie/Lettuce keeper","review":"I'm really happy with this product, but just a warning that it will take up a lot of space in your refrigerator. I do love that it has a divider for keeping two types of fruit or vegetables. I also like that the crisper guide is printed on the front of the canister, so you know when to add water to the reservoir."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Great!","review":"I joined a CSA this year and this product works great in keeping fresh all the many different lettuce/greens I receive weekly. It's a great size: large enough to fit many different sizes of lettuce. I love that it is dishwasher safe as well. I fully recommend this product!I just had a bunch of spinach last for 2 full weeks in this lettuce keeper. I washed the greens and stored them after having them for about 5 days. 10 days later, I served it at a family dinner and everyone I told, commented how green the spinach still was and how fresh it tasted!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"I have been trying to find a salad crisper that actually works. I bought this one and tried it a couple of times without any satisfaction. It kept my romain lettuce dry but not crisp. I was originally using a large container that I purchased from the dollar store and will be going back to using that. It keeps it dry and crisp for a very long time and it only cost $1.oo. Save your money and don't waste your time buying this item."},{"rating":"1","title":"soggy, brown salad","review":"I bought this with high hopes. I had a lettuce keeper that kept my salad crisp and fresh for a week. I bought this product and have been terribly dissappointed. I will buy a bag of salad and store it. Within a day or two the lettuce is brown and wilted. Unhappily I need to purchase a different one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I bought this product. I hate it. My lettuce spoils faster then in the tupperware lettuce keeper I had to replace.I am not looking for something to replace this thing. I do not recommend it. Too bad I can't return it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I bought this because of all the positive reviews but after using it I must say my lettuce lasted no longer then it did when I stored it in a plastic bag. The directions say to pour a small amount of water in the bottom and open the vent for keeping lettuce fresh. This only seems to make the lettuce turn brown even faster. The only good thing about this container is I can place freshly washed lettuce in the container and it will drain well. (Acts as a colander) That's why I'm giving it 2 stars instead of 1."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great item that really works!","review":"I was a bit skeptical at first at whether this would work or not, but I needed something to keep the lettuce I get with the CSA subscription I recently signed up for fresh. To my amazement, the lettuce keeper works amazingly well. I had a head of lettuce in there that stayed fresh for two weeks, with no wilting whatsoever. The only downside is that it's a bit big so be sure you have room in your refrigerator. My mom liked it so much she ordered 8 for herself and to give as gifts to her friends. Shipping with Amazon Prime was super quick, as usual. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"People are not machines, surprise surprise!","review":"About time someone wrote about human nature and the fact that people are not machines. The myth of \\"total efficiency\\" still persists in the workplace.This book is in sharp contrast to practices that have plagued the workers for decades; women who sewed in sweatshop factories in the early 1900's were carefully monitored on how long they took to make bathroom breaks. Even now software is available that can count every keystroke a worker makes (to check on their efficiency.) The dream that careful monitoring and structuring of the workplace to get the maximum \\"juice\\" out of workers is disproved in this book.This isn't even totally new information; a very old study found that brightening the lights in a factory improved performance. Then another study found that DIMMING the lights also improved performance. In other words, people are not machines. They need downtime, change, meaningful work and mental breaks or they burn out. A very timely and helpful book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Efficiency and Effectiveness are not the same thing!","review":"Looking at the summary of this book, I initially thought that I understood the idea well enough not to read the book, but after finally being convinced to read it, I see I was wrong.This book is much more than a summary of the key idea. First, it has a host of examples which are useful in illustrating the concept to those who don't understand it. Second, it has several other related ideas which are almost as important. Third it indicates actions one can take to improve the situation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sound Advice","review":"What's in your workplace?Efficiency or flexibility?Tom does a fine job reminding us of the difference."},{"rating":"1","title":"One idea, well covered in 58 pgs","review":"Tom DeMarco looks at this one idea of \\"slack\\", basically how hard management makes an employee work, and its effect on productivity. He does so reasonably well but exhausts all his ideas by the 58th page. The remainder of this book is pure fluff, much like what you'd expect from a college student who has only 1,500 words for a 5,000 word essay.

While we, of the Church of the Subgenius, slack off in order to become LESS productive, the author of \\"Slack\\" is attempting to redefine the term to become one which would make people MORE productive. I find this to be every bit as disturbing and insulting as a Christian would find using a crucifix as a piece of drug paraphernalia to be!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Some good points, but boring","review":"Before I get harsh, I will say that there are definately some good points and ideas that you will go away with from this book. However, the author could have said it in fewer words, and clearer. If you're reading this, I'm sure you've read all the cliche mangerial types of books. This, to Tom's credit, is different than your average manager book, with a different perspective on the surviving the coporate world... but its also a stretch. Much of the points in the book are not only subjective, and not backed with real-life anecdotes and testimonials (there are few, but they are far between), but the analogies are weak, and the diagrams and graphs are subjective and border-line bogus (not constructed with real points of correlated data; they are more like guess-sketches). If you looking for a fresh, quick, to the point book that will keep your attention and that you can't put down, then this is not that book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bedtime essential reading for anyone who works in a delivery focused company.","review":"Look around, do you notice how certain people get work done (and done well), hit deadlines and still have time to chat at the water cooler.

I agree that \\"Peopleware\\" is one of the central books every technology professional should read and apply. However, Slack does not deliver the same level of effectivness and impact.The first part of the book is ok as it discusses the need for \\"slack\\" and the negative effects of having all resources fully optimized on productivity and sustainability. However the second part of the book looses steam rapidly and seems to be just criticism of current conditions rather than helping people make the justification and incorporate slack into their business practices.DeMarco is a giant in the software industry that many of the new technology professionals should get to know and recognize. I would strongly recommend that they meet DeMarco through his other works -- Peopleware in particular rather than this work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written psychobabble","review":"This book was recommended to me by a colleague and I was excited going into it but within the first twenty minutes I found the book to be difficult to read for two reason.The first is that I don't feel like this is well written. The author seems to bounce around from page to page. It has a very jarring flow. Perhaps there was too much slack for him and his editor.The second is it's hard to digest and accept a book that just makes sweeping generalities. More so when there's very little proof or info to back it up.Overall, this feels like management psychobabble trying to promote \\"the total paradigm shift to think outside the box\\" as a quick fix. I think he brings up real problems that exist but he seems to present little information of how this fixes it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Students liked it","review":"I bought this video for my students at school.

But the \\"disappointed\\" guy reviewing from Texas is a gremmie taking potshots. Some so-called Beach Boys fans have a chip on their shoulders. If anybody checks, you see the Wilson birthdates given in this book are right. Checking my copy on pg. 339, it doesn't say Dennis Wilson is the \\"youngest\\" Beach Boy, but the \\"California Calling\\" chapter says send suggestions for future editions, and that small bit was probably fixed. But why say Dennis Wilson isn't in this book, when Chapter 7, called \\"Gettin' Hungry\\" is all about him growing up and finding out about surfing? Brian sings, love and mercy is what we need. Amen."},{"rating":"2","title":"The standard in music journalism","review":"Only a handful of rock biographies have made the effort to place a band in its social, familial and historical context. The Beach Boys were America's greatest band in the sixties and this brilliantly researched exegesis tells the story of Brian Wilson's genius as well as such a mysterious phenomenon can ever be explained. In the process, it also tells the story of Southern California: both the escapist myth that came alive in the music of the Beach Boys, and the bizarre reality of a subculture that could nurture and destroy such creativity. Timothy White is the standard in music journalism."},{"rating":"1","title":"No \\"good vibrations\\" here","review":"Tying the Beach Boys into their Southern California milieu is an exciting idea; this book, however, fails to deliver. The writing is convoluted, the conclusions superficial and cliched, and the interviews with poor Brian Wilson much less than enlightening; and the narrative sags under the weight of Beach Boys trivia that crowds out what should be a truly compelling narrative."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inconsistant Book, Not Quite Fun Fun Fun","review":"Vacillates between a geneology book and a book about Brian Wilson and the Beach Boys. Does not capture the story of the Beach Boys as well as other publications. Dwells overlong into family histories or upon elements of the Southern California lifestyle. In fact, seems to gloss over the Beach Boys' story making it seem mundane."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ambitious but uneven","review":"If you're interested in the early 20th-century westward migration, and in the early 60's surf and car culture, the first half of this book will be useful to you. As a history of the band, however, it's spotty at best, especially post-1970: an enthusiastic track-by-track review of 1970's \\"Sunflower\\" album is followed, not by discussion of the \\"Carl & The Passions\\" and \\"Holland\\" albums (which it doesn't even mention) but a capsule history of the discovery of polyurethane skateboard wheels and the revival of that sport. If you really want to know what was on every page of a newspaper from Hutchison, Kansas, circa 1910, then you'll probably like this book.White does seem to love the band, at least.

One feature that stands out is her interaction with so many other influential characters of her day.

The sentences are convoluted, the dialogue -- which is quite sparse to begin with -- is confusing, and many archaic words are used.

It takes you down to the actual Titanic site at the bottom of the ocean. It was done by James Cameron, who directed the Titanic movie, but this is pure exploration. They take you to the rooms and places and show you glimpses of the people who were there. The 3D is really what makes it. You feel like you are there.

I absolutely love it and the extended version gives us fans an extra 30 minutes of film not seen in the theater! I love the way they superimposed the computer generated scenes with scenes from the wreck. It really gives you insight into how it actually looked before the tragic sinking. I love Bill Paxton as the narrator -- I wish he would do a lot more of this type of work. For me, the only part that gets a bit on my nerves is James Cameron -- although, he really does know his stuff. I certainly wish that this could have been so much longer but then I don't think that even a good 3 hours would make me completely satisfied. I am a self-proclaimed miss 'know-it-all' of the Titanic and can never seem to get enough, especially with awesome films such as this one!!

They also had digital recreations on the wreck of the original structure superimposed...The bridge (among several areas) came to life when they used this digital recreation.They also brought 2 remotely piloted robotic cameras named Jake and Elwood (Blues Brothers fans I would assume!) that took you into the interior of the ship.There was some sadness even today when you saw a woman's still laced shoe and realizing that the body was long gone...This is one DvD that doesn't stay in the shelf long - I have watched it repeatedly.And I saw the tie in to Cameron's 1997 movie when I realized that this Russian deep sea exploration ship was the same one they used in the 1997 movie..."},{"rating":"2","title":"For fans of the event","review":"This DVD will appeal to fans of the sinking and others will find it only interesting. The strengths of this DVD are the fantastic photography and the overlays of actual pictures of the ship and recreations of events (the ghosts) acting out some of what happened. [For historical accuracy, many of the actual photographs are probably of the Titanic sister ship as the actual ship was not fully recorded photographically.] One really gets a good understanding of where the photographs were taken within the ship and those photographs are remarkable. This is a much better dive record than the previously released National Geographic 'Secrets of the Titanic'. I found the second DVD in this set unnecesary but fans will find it useful. Those who have an interest in the fate of the Titanic will want to add this to their collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ghosts Of The Abyss 3D or Not 3D","review":"I am a very serious Titanic Buff. I saw the Imax 3D Version of This in 2 theatres. Las Vegas and Rochester, NY (My Hometown).Here's the real scoop... Disney/Imax chose not to release this in 3D because of synch problems in Imax Theatres. I too experienced bad synch in both Theatres 2000 miles apart. This must have been a common problem. For my Money producing the DVD NOT in 3D was probably a wise choice for Disney to avoid any home problems which are usually compounded with the lack of proper home equipment. The DVD is sensational. The Underwater shots and inside the Titanic Video is simply incredible and breathtaking. Highest Recommend!******* There is a French 3D version available which is also excellent but I only recommend this for serious 3D buffs who have Shutter Glasses and their 3D home system in order.

The second portion provides texts to read in Sauraseni, Maharastri, Jain Maharastri, Ardha-Magadhi, Magadhi, Avanti, Bhasa, Pali, etc. There is an adequate but not great index supplied.

The music is rich in strong and funky rhythms, mostly simple grooves, with interesting, intriguingly varied guitar interspersed throughout. But what makes it remarkable is the accompaniment by a veritable who's who of World Music's best - Ziggy Modeliste, Jaki Liebzeit, Jah Wobble, Bill Laswell, Zakir Hussain, Guilherme Franco, Aiyb Dieng, Foday Musa Suso, Bachir Attar, Simon Shaheen, and Amina Claudine Myers.

The Algebra Survival Guide wastes a lot of space that could be used better for instruction. It also provides problems on each page, but also includes the answers on the same page which makes it difficult to use as an exercise book. Further, it emphasizes number properties such as reflexive property, symmetric property, and transitive property, which are rarely taught but ignores more common number properties such as inverse properties.

At least 75% of the anticipation for this book was to see how this rocky,funny and deep hearted relationship would end. Sam was honorable, rough and somewhat of a jerk, but he had a mind of his own. The end of his relationship with Aylssa was a cop-out, so 1950's and very much out of character. He and Aylssa deserved much better. It was not an enjoyable read.

The story was wonderful (although as an aside - I'm afraid, that a story like this just reinforces the idea that men and women shouldn't be in combat together). Like everyone else, I'm dying to read about Sam and Alyssa. And, like several other reviewers - I didn't care for the WWII storyline. There was plenty to keep this book interesting and, after about half the book, I skimmed or skipped the WWII part. I'll have to go out and read the book that starts Sam and Alyssa's romance.

I don't normally write reviews, and never any bad ones, but I was so annoyed with the ending of this book I decided to vent a little of that here. I'm sorry I invested time & money in this book & I will definitely NOT be buying another of her books.I know a lot of people are fans of her's & I'm sorry if this review offends them. I just personnaly don't like to read books that drag you down emotionally.

It has everything you could want; intrigue, drama, action, and heartstopping sensuality. A few readers may find some of the dialog offensive (lots of F**K's flying around) but it's Navy SEALs that are talking. Anything else would have been totally unrealistic. I would also caution squeamish readers, there is a measure of extreme violence in this book that is also not found in a typical romance novel. I, for one, applaud Ms. Brockmann for not taking the easy way out and making each subplot have a \\"happily ever after\\" ending.The storyline that began with THE UNSUNG HERO and continued with THE DEFIANT HERO just keeps getting better and better. According to Ms. Brockmann, she has already written the fourth installment in this series (OUT OF CONTROL, due out early 2002)and at least two more will be coming soon.

So now i find myself at midnight having to go through my book collection to find a nice gooey romanctic comedy to try and obliterate the nasties out of my head because i won't be able to sleep until it's gone. Thanks alot SB for turning what should have been a happy ending into a case of the nasties."},{"rating":"1","title":"High School Dialog","review":"I normally can't wait for a Suzanne Brockman book but the dialogin this book is so high school (maybe Jr Hi) I just could notread it... so sorry but this one is a bomb!!!...I couldn't evenfinish it it was so boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you need to know Is-136, this is it","review":"If you need to know Is-136, this is the book.

ALLISON(1957)---Robert Mitchum, Deborah KerrA \\"two character\\" movie that I like a lot. Mitchum is a U.S. Marine who is stranded at sea and washes up on what appears to be a deserted island in the south Pacific during World War II. He soon runs into Kerr who is a nun that has been left alone on the island after the death of an ailing priest she had stayed on the island with to care for. A Japanese force comes to the island to establish an observation station and the bulk of the movie is taken up with the soldier and the nun trying to avoid detection and stay alive until the Americans can take the island from the Japanese. Along the way, each is forced to re-examine their lives. The film was directed by John Huston. While not a \\"great\\" or \\"classic\\" film, I enjoyed this movie a lot---I am a fan of both stars and I found the \\"character study\\" of the two individuals engaging."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic","review":"Robert Mitchum does a great job on this old WWII movie.

Good movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"2 legendary stars...and a Japanese Army!","review":"This John Huston classic is one of my favorite war movies. The beautiful island scenery is breathtaking, and Robert Mitchum and Deborah Kerr are flawless. The chemistry between these two, despite Kerr playing the role of a nun, is awesome. Mitchum, playing a tough-as-nails Marine sergeant, is perfectly cast, and gives one of his finest performances. Kerr is also perfectly cast and was nominated for best actress (she didn't win). This movie doesn't have epic battle scenes like other war films, but it perfectly captures the spirit of the U.S. soldiers in WW2. One of the film's best scenes is when Mitchum gets drunk and almost forgets Kerr is a nun! The dvd version has a great picture quality and the special features include a newsreel from WW2 showing battle scenes in the Pacific, and there are a few trailers. If you want to see a different kind of war movie, I highly recommend this classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"OMG I LOVE THIS","review":"I LOVE THIS ANIME omg i happen to be a tough guy but this this anime was so emotional to me it really went to my heart i highly recomend this anime it is my favorite tied with only one other anime"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Organizer","review":"I got this for my kitchen.

So I will have to pay someone money on top of the $32 the vest cost and the $12 shipping. After all is said and done this vest will end up costing me at least $60!

I remember how much it helped me deal with the emotional and identity adjustments a new mother has to make. It was priceless in terms of getting me past my own ego. I found that reading this book for a few minutes each night, especially in that first year of being a mom, really helped me stay focused in terms of the kind of parent I wanted to be for my daughter. Not the kind of child I wanted my daughter to be. I think this is some of what other reviewers might also be referring to when they say it changed their ideas of parenting. This is not a book with a list of things you must buy-- on the contrary, the author makes an enlightened case for how little you actually have to buy when you have a baby. The only problem is that the beliefs in this book are not popular ones in our mainstream society. This isn't a book about controlling your child or making him or her smarter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another dud from Makoto","review":"1. As per my other Makoto Ozone reviews, I kind of know what I'm talking about because I have almost every album this guy has produced. Obviously this is a opinion of mine, but his earlier work clearly surpasses all of his more recent output (ie everything since... Nature Boys). Without a doubt, all of his work with this trio has been just so average. Obviously the music isn't horrid; all of these guys are pros. But the music is just so canned and stereotypical; so unlike what Makoto Ozone is capable of and what he has produced in the past. It's just sad to see how such a talented musician can output such bland material.2. Suggestion: check out Makoto's first 3-4 albums as well as Nature Boys; truly inspired material."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome lesbian anthology","review":"I remember being really pleased when I found this book a few years back.

The book obviously intentionally uses adjectives like \\"Hypnotic\\" and \\"evil\\" over and over again to make innocent situations seem evil. It's just horrible tabloid-esque writing.It's too bad because the book has some useful information wedged in piles of crap.The writer obviously had no clue about the case other than the silly \\"Helter Skelter\\" fairytale.

Although not awful, the songs are going-through-the-motions rockers with little imagination or innovations and an alarming vacuity of ideas. A Uriah Heep album of any era almost always has one or two great songs on it, songs that grab your attention and make you go \\"wow!\\" and go on to become classics. No such songs are really on Different World. In fact, many of the songs are indistinguishable from each other, which just doesn't happen on most other Uriah Heep albums. The production, too, is a big comedown from the previous album Raging Silence (although it is somewhat improved in the remaster). If you're looking for modern Heep and aren't a completist, get one of the other albums by the current line-up instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Our favorite of all the Signing Time DVDs","review":"We have all the volumes of the Signing Time DVDs (Series One), and love them. But this one -- with the GREAT special features -- is by far the best of the bunch. They cover so many additional signs that are not in the 1/2 hour program itself, taking their own version of the ABC song (completely different song than what you think) and breaking it down sign by sign. I wish they'd have such informative special features on all of their DVDs. The early ones have barely any additional content; but the later ones do have a bit more.All the Series One DVDs are the best tools available for teaching sign to children (and adults!). They have a second series that most people don't know about, but we have not ventured there yet. We might.

The later printings of the 3d edition, by Arfken alone, were quite free of mistakes and of typos.

Most of these typos are in equations that were correct in the 3d edition.My students have had a hard time learning from this book.Also, the binding of this $99 book is cheap cardboard -- the hardcover edition does not really have a hard cover. All in all,this is a typical Elsevier product: inferior and expensive."},{"rating":"1","title":"I couldn't stand this book","review":"There are two main things that made me dislike this very popular book. First, the topics are frequently spread along several chapters, making a selective reading at least unpleasant. Second, the examples frequently involve topics of physics not yet covered (like mesons, nuclear physics, etc). I must admit that people I respect like it. I see it more like a collection of formulas with too little connective tissue, and badly organized too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not if you want to learn math, use only as reference","review":"I used this book as a textbook for a Math class. Okay, I'm not a mathematician so it was suppoused to be a side course. Since I'm not precisely fluent in most of these topics I expected to learn at least the basic stuff. But, as I tried to use the book as a basis for my studies, I found only concepts and demostrations, and no clear examples about anything! I think the authors must think that putting examples in a book like this may be considered offensive by some of their most lectured readers!I recommend this book only if you are fluent in mathematics, if you already know about the topics and just want a reference book, or if you want to put your \\"genious\\" to the test trying to find out what's going on without any kind of aid."},{"rating":"1","title":"All but useless","review":"I had to use this book for a graduate level engineering math class.

Arfken is then best used to jar the memory with examples that are often abridged examples from the aforementioned undergraduate texts. As for an undergraduate taking a course where Arfken is the primary text, I'm confused. Obviously you should know everything in Arfken but he doesn't get to the meat of any given subject. You might as well get cliff notes for physics.

Unfortunately, this work is becoming the classic text for such courses. The text is too concise to be useful for most students at this level. However, it may serve as a good reference book for those who have already learned the material. Good luck to those trying to learn it for the first time! The book is loaded with oversimplified examples of tough concepts and then leaves the difficult problems AS AN EXERCISE FOR THE READER. You will definitely need a supplemental text or two! Try Mathematical Physics by Eugene Butkov for a more thorough treatment of the concepts."},{"rating":"1","title":"A decent reference, mostly for its large glossy text","review":"This book is pretty encyclopedic, and is quite easy to look at, but please to not attempt to actually LEARN from this book. Some of the sections are good, but many are shamefully terrible, such as the treatment of complex variables or Green's functions. Overall, the book just seems sloppily thrown together. The quick-reference equations in the front and back, for instance, are conspicuously mis-indented and mis-aligned. Really a shame, because his book has a lot of potential. As an alternative, I would recommend the cheap paperback by Dennery, which, though slightly less comprehensive, is much more consistent."},{"rating":"1","title":"A book for the twentieth century","review":"This text is hopelessly out of date if one is serious about modern physics. The tired old approach to vector calculus should be relegated to the dustbin of history. Students need, indeed must, learn the exterior calculus of differential forms, not as graduate students but undergraduates, if they can ever hope to get to the frontier. There is so much a student of physics needs to master in advanced mathematics. In this regard it would be very useful if the classical areas such as electromagnetic theory were recast in the language of differential forms."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my cup of tea","review":"As an undergraduate student this book was difficult to follow. Explanations were incomplete and it seemed evident to me that the text was made for graduate students, but I had to use it in an undergraduate course.

As a reference book for graduate students it's probably pretty good, but I didn't enjoy learning from it one bit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Our Battlecry: \\"Arfken!\\"","review":"Throughout the past year, our common battlecry in my classical mechanics and mathematical physics courses was \\"Arfken!\\"... usually followed by \\"Maple!\\" (a powerful math program).

However, I know that someday I will be and I know that Arfken was one o the best guides that I had on the trip. 'Nuff said."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent reference, poor TEXT","review":"Unfortunately, this text holds ominous title of a classic I suppose. This is not a very lucid text, and I would not reccomend it to be used as such. However, if it is a fairly braod reference you are looking for, it might be good. The TOPICS covered are at least at the level of advanced undergrad/beggining grad. But if it's intermediate graduate level + you are interested in, there are others that are definitely better."},{"rating":"1","title":"A poorly organized collection of formulas.","review":"I found this book quite superficial despite its length. Little more than a compendium of formulas. Poorly organized and typeset. Reasonable price per page, which pushes my rating from 0 to 2. The oldie but goodie (and inexpensive) Abramowitz and Stegun is better for reference and quick lookup. Morse-Feshbach, Courant-Hilbert and even Whittaker-Watson make more sense for in depth study although they are outdated on several topics. Poor in numerical methods and modeling. Unsuitable as textbook."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely perfume...","review":"This is a very good product. It is a little bit more like an oil than I expected but I have never used a roll-on before.

I have received many compliments for this product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Read - Informative, even scholarly.","review":"If you've tried a couple hentai anime films and liked what you saw, this book is a MUST-HAVE! Gives a great overview of the history of anime, all the different subgenres, and delves into the culture, industry, and marketplace that creates them.The chapter on the Overfiend series is terrific and provides great insights into the themes behind the series (including plot points that got mangled by western editing)."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Humdrum Guide to XXX Anime","review":"While this book provides detailed coverage of much of the dark side of anime, it is marred by very lackluster writing and a dearth of illustration. The writers shift back and forth from a dry academic philosophizing which sometimes borders on apologising for Japanese tastes to an equally dry reporting of film contents. This should be a fascinating subject. The Japanese have focused considerable writing, illustrative and musical talent on sexually oriented anime, and this strange little book seems to want to downplay all of that. Hopefully someone else will be inspired to create the book this should have been."},{"rating":"2","title":"The History of Anime","review":"This is an extremely in-depth look at the history of anime and the role of eroticism in shaping it. It also covers the views that have shaped how anime is perceived. It has a guide to individual movies which takes up about a third of the book, but only half of those are erotic films. A must for increasing your understanding of anime, but it is not really a film guide."},{"rating":"1","title":"Levitating globe-- hard to get it to do so","review":"Globe is somewhat small in size. The main problem is I have a hard time getting it to levitate. Once its levitating, it tends to not stay that way for long. Lately, I've been able to make it stay levitating but adding a round magnet weight I had and stuck it underneath the globe. Obviously not well designed. Seems cheaply made as well (except the globe, which is made in Germany--- but again still should be much bigger)."},{"rating":"2","title":"WoW","review":"This book was amazing. Some find it quite boring. I really liked it. It was funny, adventurous, sad, and I will always remember it as a wonderful novel. At the beginning, two sets of sisters were stuck in the same cottage. They were put in a new environment. This really tested their personalities. At first, they greatly disliked each other. They grew closer together after a series of adventurous events. They discovered that they could get along. Martha, the main character, teaches Kit to stand up for herself. Kit becomes a new person. The setting, a cottage, is quite appropriate. It is away from \\"civilization\\" and is quite isolated.The girls experience a summer, of laughter, tears, and happiness, they will never forget."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is an interesting book...","review":"There's 4 girls that are in a cottage without their parents. First, they felt awkward but then, they started to become friends.

It's a soft, air brushed account of the tribe and frankly not very engaging. Eisler is a poor writer. While he is clearly literate, he does not write in a compelling way nor does the story necessary hang together. It seems without focus and depth and that he just cut various facts and excerpts from other publications and glued them together to form this book. His writing lacks passion, intellectual rigor, and compelling narrative. This book is adequate, but I am giving it one star rating for paying $10 for what is essentially puffery. This book is probably worth pennies from a dime store. I would not recommend this book for an indepth understanding of the Pequots. Frankly, I want my money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Superficial Effort","review":"This book relies entirely too much on clips from previously published sources. In addition, the authors did not interview many tribal members or people who aided this tribe get on the map. It feels like a book the author was simply rushing to finish.

However, it appears Logitech has stopped providing downloadable TV listings to the remote. This makes the remote much too expensive and defeats a big benefit. It also call into question Logitech's commitment to newer remotes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Harmony has discontinued the program guide","review":"It's true - Harmony discontinued the program guide feature. Their reasoning - it was too expensive for them. There are a lot of universal remotes out there, but the tv listings were what sold me on the Harmony. Zapping through the listings on my remote was way easier than using my cable box's on-screen guide, and for my tv's where I use CableCard I don't even have an on-screen guide.Aside from that, there are serious quality control problems. My first remote was DOA. For the replacement, the battery cover broke off (a common problem according to internet forums). Now a key on the keypad has fallen off, and Harmony made me pay for a new keypad since the one year warranty has expired.I understand that Harmony was once a great company, but it seems to have gone downhill since it became part of Logitech."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmmm, I thought this would have been it....","review":"Pros: The setup was pretty easyCons: The setup did not work!I have had this device for about 3 weeks.

Not just a little bit, but all the way.I have tried to redo the setup, but that did not make a difference.It is now basically useless. One other thing I had major trouble with is that I cannot close the battery door after the batteries are installed.I have a pretty good understanding of remotes, but this one beats me.

It is the best sleeping mask I have ever purchased. I can breathe comfortably and the mask stays in place when I sleep. I am so glad I purchased more than one. I highly recommend. After 6 months of use the fabric seperated from the bottom by your cheeks. This hasn't diminished the comfort or quality of the sleep mask."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beware! This mask may cause you to hit the snooze button one too many times","review":"I bought this mask about two months ago and I was completely delighted with it! First of all, it has a thin inner padding that makes it very comfortable. The open space allows you to blink, so your eyes won't get dry, and the back has a big adjustable velcro. Some reviewers have mentioned the thick velcro band can be uncomfortable if you sleep on your back, but I did not find that to be a problem with me.I'd say it blocks about 99% of the light, a little bit of light can sometimes leak near the nose, but you will only notice it if you try to look down. Otherwise, it does its job!Sadly a couple of days ago I noticed the inner black cloth is coming undone right in the middle nose area. I guess the glue wears off because of sweating and human heat. It would had been perfect had they used stitches. I will continue to wear it until it can't take it anymore, then I'll probably order another one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly uncomfortable","review":"Maybe it is because I am a petite woman with a smaller head, but I found this mask to be unbelievably uncomfortable. First off, the velcro in the back is thick and stiff and it went across the entire back of my head making it really difficult to sleep on my back. The eye part is over sized and kept pushing down over my nose. I've had prior sleep masks that had Velcro but didn't use such a stiff, thick, long strip of it. To make it small enough to fit, I'm probably going to have to cut the Velcro bits off and sew it together. As it is this mask won't stay on and with the Velcro makes sleeping impossible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fell apart","review":"The liner on the inside is only sewn at two points.

If the velcro touches your hair it will stick to it and God forbid your hair get tangled up in it during the night. I wore this one night and one night only. Terrible design, terrible purchase. What were they thinking? The person who designed this either has no hair or sleeps standing up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this eye mask","review":"I had purchased the Bucky forty blinks mask for myself 6 months ago and loved it so much I bought this one for my husband. The mask is so light and comfortable. The mask does move a bit when sleeping because I have a small head and the mask does not really adjust small enough to fit secure (hence the 4 stars). Also if the room is bright (or you are in a car) there is a very very small amount of light that comes in from the bottom of the mask, but this is not a significant amount that prevents me from sleeping. Although it makes me look like a bug, I still wear the mask in long car trips when traveling because it works so well and is easy to stash."},{"rating":"2","title":"YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I love these things!

This sweet mask and a neck pillow made for a pleasant journey."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless! A T-shirt is better.","review":"This mask has some serious strap flaws.1) The strap is too thick. One strap over laps and attaches to the other strap and creates a THICK piece of fabric which digs into the back of your head. Not very relaxing.2) The strap slides around, usually down toward my ears. Again, not very relaxing.3) The Velcro is the wrong method for this type of adjustable strap. With Velcro there is the soft piece with the loops and the scratchy piece with tiny hooks that attach to the loops on the other piece with loops. With this mask, the scratchy side faces down toward the pillow and keeps pulling threads our of my pillow case. Great. Thanks for ruining my silk pillow cases.If you reverse the strap, then the scratchy side digs into your scalp. Wonderful.My advice: forget the mask. And use a T-shirt to cover your eyes. It works better and is much more comfortable."},{"rating":"1","title":"ALMOST TOTAL DISAPPOINTMENT","review":"Bucky Sleep Mask.I was disappointed.The layers became appart and it last just 4 months.

I purchased it since my husband has to have the fan running at night (on super high) and it drys out my eyes. I have used many masks before but I feel that because they were flat on my eyelids, it didn't give my eyelids a chance to do what they need to do to keep my eyes moist during the night. This one works well because I use it when the lights are already off and it allows my eyelids to breath while keeping the air flow from coming in direct contact with them.If you are purchasing this and do not want ANY light in then be careful. Note: my face is shaped a little funny (swim goggles never work for me...my nose is to pointy at the bridge i think) which may lead this mask to not be as tight as it was designed but on me it does leave space where the light will come in at my nose."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good stuff!","review":"After using the soft padded sleep masks from Earth Therapeutics for many years and being somewhat dissatisfied with them, I decided to give these foam masks a try. The one thing thing I disliked about the soft ones is that while they were comfortable, they pressed against my eyes too much. When I got up in the morning, my formerly long eyelashes were curled back inwards. I hated that. With these foam masks, it's made so that the mask blocks out light, but doesn't put any pressure on my eyes. The reason that I've given this mask 4 instead of 5 stars is that it can be hot sometimes b/c of the material it's made from. Overall, it's an excellent purchase for troubled sleepers like me."},{"rating":"2","title":"bucky 40 blinks ultralight eye mask","review":"overall this is a great mask. the fabric is very good quality; it's quite comforable. it does a good job of keeping the light out. i have a big nose and i feel that the nose indentation could be a bit more accommodating to make it a completely perfect fit. that said, no one mask fits all types of faces perfectly and this one comes close."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good sleep mask, but could use a couple improvements","review":"This sleep mask is very comfortable and would be perfect for travel, when you're sleeping in an upright position. However, there are a couple things that make this less than perfect:1. The velcro attached to the straps is thick. This creates a bump (1/8\\" or so) on the back of your head that makes sleeping on your back unlikely. There really isn't a good position in which to place the strap to make this more comfortable. However, sleeping on your side is perfectly comfortable.2. On my face, light leaks in on either side of the nostrils. If only there was an extra bit of fabric to gently close off that gap without putting pressure on the nostrils, this mask would be greatly improved.Both of the above cons are minimized if you are using these on a train or plane, which is probably the intended use of this mask anyway. I just wanted to point them out in case you intend to use them in bed."},{"rating":"2","title":"the bee's knees","review":"In Dusseldorf once I bought a German-made eye-mask that was the last word in eye-mask technology. It was darned expensive, but after having used it for years I wish I hadn't bought three or four more.This one, the Bucky \\"40 Blinks Mask\\" is probably the best I've seen for sale domestically. There are no plastic buckles in the back: it fastens to itself using velcro. The straps are proper thick straps, not strings. There is a puffy hollow in front of your eyes, so your eyelashes don't feel crushed: the face mask material is made out of washable foam, not leather or satin.The best thing about this eyemask is that is hugs the bridge of your nose quite a ways down. This will take a few nights of getting used to since it creates a slight pinching feeling, but the big advantage is that very little light will be able to get in through the little crack in the nose opening, a common problem with masks that merely lie flat on your face."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed.","review":"This mask would have been great if the inner lining didn't peel off and tickled your eyelids while you slept. I would recommend looking for another mask that is not cheaply made."},{"rating":"2","title":"good mask with one problem","review":"I like this mask. It's comfortable and does a good job of keeping the light out. The only thing I don't like it is Velcro strap. There is a little bump where the two pieces connect, so it can be a problem is you're sleeping on your back. And like all Velcro, it picks up little things and can be tough to keep clean. Not anything dangerous, but just little pieces of dirt or a loose thread off the bed.Overall, a great product though. Helpful for getting into a deep sleep."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't stay on","review":"When I can get them to stay on, they do a good job of keeping the light out. However,I have yet to have them stay on all night."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really want to give this a higher rating","review":"The mask is comfortable and does a great job of keeping light out, but there are 2 significant problems with the design/construction:1. The strap that goes around your head is fairly bulky and takes some getting used to. In addition when you roll over, depending on how tight you have the mask, the strap may \\"stick\\" to your pillow rather than your head, thus causing the mask to shift off of your eyes.2. The bigger problem is simply the construction. As others have mentioned, the inner lining is not attached well at all to the mask. I've had my mask for a few months and the lining is now coming off beneath both eyes."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Bra For Your Eyes","review":"This product is excellent. It quite literally feels like a bra for your eyes. I ordered it because I need to sleep during the day and can't put blackout curtains up in my apartment. This does a great job of blocking out the light. I am a side sleeper so when I put my head on the pillow the mask moves a little and light gets through where it meets my nose, but with a little pulling and repositioning of the mask it completely covers my eyes. The part that covers your eyes does not touch your eyelids so no rubbing or uncomfortableness there. The mask is secured to your head by Velcro which is stretchy and doesn't cut off the circulation. Great product, would definitely purchase again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product and great customer service","review":"Blocks light well, weighs almost nothing, and there is no pressure due to the molded shape.

The Bucky mask is indeed ultralight, and I liked how the eye cups were molded so the mask wasn't laying completely against my face, since that tends to make me sweat sometimes.Unfortunately though, after only 2-3 months, the black fabric lining the inside started to peel completely away from the edges. I kept using it for a while, but now it's barely hanging on around the nose. I had to stop using it, and now I'll be looking to try a different brand.

While the mask is comfortable and blocks out all but a wee bit of light from the nose area, it is falling apart after only a few weeks of use. The inner liner (part that touches the face/eye area) is already separating from the mask. I would return it if I could, but I believe it's considered \\"used\\" (unreturnable) at this point.

I move alot in my sleep and roll side to side, in the week I have had this mask it has not come off once. There is a tiny amount of light seepage around the nose, but adjusts fairly easy for complete blockage and the tiny bit does not disturb me. The eye \\"pockets\\" are great because I can blink without my eyes touching the mask and it does not feel confining to me. I hope the mask continues to be this great for a long time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothing better out there!","review":"Used this sleep mask on a long trip to Europe and it helped me fall asleep in even a fully-lit room. It is truly lightweight, and doesn't have an uncomfortable roll across the lower half like some masks do. If you roll over, it doesn't dig into your face. One of those items that does what it claims to."},{"rating":"2","title":"I will never buy a different sleep mask!","review":"I have a hard time sleeping with even the tiniest bit of light and this mask is the best I have tried (and I've tested dozens over the years). It's made out of lightweight foam so it hardly feels like there is anything on your face. The extra space for your eyes to blink and move is a revelation after being used to masks where the material is pulled tight over your eyelids. I've noticed in other comments that people are having an issue with light leaking in around the edges. For me, this was easily remedied by tightening the mask using the velcro strap - and it was still very comfortable to wear.The only potential drawback is that after about 3-4 months of nightly use the fabric will start to separate from the foam. This is tolerable until so much of it comes off that it wrinkles up on your face. At this point I usually trade out for a new mask. This isn't really an issue for me as I feel you get your money's worth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does Mostly What it says, but 2 have come apart on me in 3 Months!","review":"I purchased the first one through an outside vendor. I really loved that it was light-weight & contoured to my eyes.But after 2 months the inside lining separated from the mask itself.I phoned Bucky inquiring as to the issue. They were extremely helpful and said there was a small batch that did this.I purchased a second one through them directly.The problem is, they only have a 30 money back. Now, the 2nd pair has separated after only 3 months! So sad, to be on the market for yet another one that actually works and is built to last!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Was good for about two weeks, then...","review":"Top comments you see here are all correct - they let light in around the nose for sure, and the velcro strap is super uncomfortable behind your head. Also, if you leave some of the velcro strap exposed at either end it sticks to your pillow so you basically have to wear it at one length and completely loose the usefulness of the strap.Last bad thing: SEE THE SECOND PICTURE AT THE TOP WHERE THE BACK LINING CAME OFF. THAT HAPPENED TO MINE TOO, AFTER ONLY A FEW WEEKS. So dissapointing.Those bad things being said they are very light and nice otherwise. I never think they are that bad while I wear them as I fall asleep but my body hates them so much that I literally wake up every morning and I have tossed them on the ground next to the bed in my sleep."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmm, this product WAS great.","review":"Okay, I'm giving this product two stars instead of one because it was the best eye mask ever unntil it started falling apart. The lining eventually peels apart from the foam. I still wear mine even with the flopping lining, but I am in need of a new mask now. Bummer because the product is EXCELLENT until the lining starts peeling. :("},{"rating":"1","title":"falls apart in about a month","review":"I've gone through 2 of these. They're comfortable, and are nice in that they don't press on my eyes, but the glue that holds the cloth layers on is weak enough that the external layers of cloth begin peeling away and render the mask unwearable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not comfortable for me, lets in too much light","review":"Wow, am I ever disappointed in this mask. It gaps all around my nose, particularly if I lay on my side. If I am on my side, it also slides around uncomfortably if I move my head even slightly - gapping even more. If I lay on my back, it gaps less, but there is a lump formed by the velcro that makes this position uncomfortable too. I don't know what is harder -- falling asleep without the mask with way too much light in the room, or falling asleep with this darn thing on and bright slivers of light still getting in. Seems like this mask works for a lot of people, but not for me. I have a narrow nose bridge -- maybe that is the problem for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ouch from a Side Sleeper","review":"Nice design for a back sleeper, but won't stay in place or hurts a side sleeper. Oh, and velcro and hair don't mix, so really it's not adjustable, because if you don't completely match up the velcro halves, you may wind up with your hair locked onto the exposed part (unless you don't have hair:-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"not made to last","review":"I use to love this product, however this version of the Bucky 40 blinks eye mask is not made to last. With in a month the lining that rest on the face peels away. I thought I may have gotten a defective mask yet me second mask also peeled away with in a month. The eye mask it's self is to narrow and lets light in. The elastic strap is very uncomfortable and leaves tender spots on my head. Very disappointing. Wish they would go back to the older version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Falls to pieces ... other then that fantastic","review":"If this eye mask actually stayed together I would have given it high marks. But alas.... not so much. The contoured eye pockets are a great design and the fabric patterns really fashionable.

I got myself some Eclipse curtains from Khols on sale."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best eye mask of all the brands I've purchased.","review":"It's exactly as the manufacturer describes - ultra light, comfortable, doesn't put pressure on the eyelids and is adjustable with a long enough strap to fit around most heads!!

However, the inner lining seems to be coming apart and it annoys or tickles my face. But other than that they are very comfortable and I would reccomend them over any other sleep mask."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product, Falls Apart Fast","review":"I bought this same eye mask for my boyfriend over a year ago and he wore it to shreds. He loves that this does not push up against his eyes like most eye masks but completely keeps light out. He is a very light sleeper and has found that this is so easy to sleep in that he wears it even when there isn't much to be concerned of in the way of lights. Unfortunately the two materials that make up the eye portion is held together with a light glue so the first one he owned fell apart and the new one I bought him started to do the same after just a couple months. This is the only eye mask that I have seen with this design and it works so well I doubt we'll ever buy a different brand. We will either continue buying this after the new one falls apart or we will just have to start gluing them back together!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mask traps heat","review":"This mask not only leaks light under the eyes but the material traps heat. I think the material just doesn't breathe very well and I can't stand it. Also, the velcro on the back strap is thick and makes the strap more uncomfortable."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would not recomend","review":"This mask did not work for me. It felt comfortable when I went to bed but i would wake up throughout the night. I am a side sleeper so the straps would rub against my ears an irritate them. It was not comfortable. I tried it for two night and just gave up on the mask."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would give 5 stars if it lasted more than a couple months...","review":"The first month of near nightly use I was loving this eye mask. Blocked all the light allowing me to fall asleep more easily. I would give this eye mask 4 stars if it didn't fall apart so quickly. Like others have said, the inner fabric started to peel off around the nose at first, then continued to un-glue up toward the temple area... then off to both sides. Pretty disappointed =(. Also the velcro on the back is a bit thick and may cause some frustration. For me it bothered me some nights, but not others. I'm going to try and sew the lining in and see if the stitching doesn't bother me..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fell Apart Within 2 weeks, disappointed!!","review":"Let me first say that I really like this product, it is extremely comfortable and does an excellent job blocking out light, however what good is it if it falls apart in two weeks? I have purchased these masks in the past and got a very reasonable amount of use out of them(8-12 months used every night) before they fell apart. But, this time, the inner liner came off both masks within two-weeks of use. So, what to give it for stars, hmm, well 5-stars for comfort and functionality minus three stars because I couldn't enjoy the functionality for very long."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for sleeping","review":"I have worn a blindfold while sleeping for years, because I don't like being woken by the sun in the morning. I needed to replace my old blindfold, and I found this one online. I've used it for a few nights (I wear it all night), and it works great. It is comfortable, adjustable, and lets virtually no light in. My only complaint is that it's not machine-washable."},{"rating":"2","title":"QUALITY PRODUCT !","review":"QUALITY VALUE .

It is not completely unreadable, and I continue to enjoy Mike Deodanto's art since he came back onto the scene, but compared to the the the great Spidey tales out there, this one is very missable. If you're new to Spider-Man check out Essential Marvel Team Up to see some great Spidey, or the first few trades of the current run with JMS and Romita Jr. they're a lot better than this one focusing on some minor character from Parker's past (who I don't beleive we, the reader, have ever met before). It starts out interesting exploring what could've happened if Peter wasn't so responsible, but quickly turns into cliched hero vs. villain fare."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bleck. Stay away from this one.","review":"While not nearly as bad as the previous arc, SINS PAST, the story in SKIN DEEP is still very poor. It focuses on some obscure character who hasn't existed in prior to this arc. Yet, this new character who has never been mentioned all of a sudden shows up and goes on a personal vendetta, and the target is Peter Parker. The villain in this arc seems like a bad rip-off of Molten Man, an older villain who dates back to the Ditko issues of Amazing Spider-Man. Overall, the story is dull, unimaginative, and predictable. The only reason you might want to pick this up is so you know why Peter, MJ, and May move into a new residence right after this story..."},{"rating":"2","title":"good book","review":"I was hoping to get more of an idea what shape-shifting was - ala Perkins.

The most preposterous being the \\"study\\" about the \\"randomized\\" trial to test the effectiveness of long-distance prayer, presumably the Harris et al study done in 1999. These and other studies such as the Columbia Miracle study in which it was reported that women prayed for from thousands of miles away by strangers were more likely to become pregnant than those who weren't are studies that have turned out to be a fraud.Although the book is interesting when Bruce talks about her family and her reasons for studying shamanism, her details and descriptions of the visions are just too freaky.I also don't buy what she says about a person being able to genuinely change from without before changing from within. I think this claim is only used to justify her career."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just awful","review":"I was interested to hear Vince Russo's side of the stories that abound in wrestling. He was at the centre of a lot of the big events for the last 15 years and hoped to get his version of events.What I got was a watered down version of his pre-WCW days with him giving space to his thoughts today, now that he has found God.I have no problem with his religion except that his new belief meant that tha book was weak and feeble. Barely could read it as it came across as too preachy for my taste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great for the arcade, a breeze for the SNES","review":"You first selects as one of three pit fighters to compete against a slew of amazing brutal pit fighters (a whole 7). This is your normal fighting game, no blood, no fatalities, the only difference is that there is more of a playing field, you can move around the total pit, rather than just moving left and right on a platform like other fighting games. There are pretty simple moves, punches, kicks, sweeps, yada yada, which make the game get old really quick. The only good thing about the game is its huge challenge and special rounds, such as when you must fight tigers! Rent it, don't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too slow, it's almost too simple","review":"Pit Fighter for it's time was a good game. But even with games of it's time, it wasn't as great (this game came out in 1991). you could only be 3 characters, all of which were fairly decent and more or less the same with the addition of a few moves and subtraction of a few moves.The only thing that really held this game up was it's challenge, it's bonus rounds and it's easy play. It was almost too easy at times. Plus you could use the entire screen to fight a match instead of scrolling left and right. It might not be worth buying because it gets real old real quick so maybe rent this one first."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is very different than the shooters of the time","review":"Ghost in The Shell is the first game based off of the Ghost in The Shell Manga and Cyberpunk movie series.Plot: You are a rookie at Public Security Section 9.

I purchased the book just for Judith McNaught's 'Double Exposure' story. But,the other stories are additional benefits and gifts for the readers. Heartwarming stories from these five leading ladies. Judith McNaught's and Kimberly Cates' stories make me cried with its own twist of heartwrenching emotions. Andrea Kane and Jude Deveraux excelled in delivering quick,witty romance stories that surely make readers laughed along as the plot progressed. And the story from Judith O'Brien will surely make readers sighed and wished for long lost love that screams eternity. After reading the book, it is a sure bet that these authors will excel more in writing short stories in the near future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly dull McNaught","review":"I didn't particularly enjoy Judith McNaught's contribution to this collection, it just couldn't get off the ground for me.

It is a part of the soundtrack. It's just read not sung.This is a beautiful CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Cuban","review":"At first listen I was somewhat dissapointed, hoping to find more of the original soundtrack music on it but...there are some real gems here in the Cuban repetoire and this has become one of my favorites. Check out Ay Mariposa by Pedro Ferrer and Por Que Me La Dejaste Querer? by Bola de Nieve, Carter Burwell's original soundtrack piece 'Baloon Escape' and Kamata Mariyam by Fairuz. I would only question the voice over at the end of the record... I don't know why producers never seem to understand that when we buy soundtracks we want to hear music not dialog excerpts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was missing the song I wanted.","review":"I purchased this sound track because because of a particular song which I didn't know the name to. I thought it would be in the soundtrack but no it wasn't. I did even hear samples of the songs but was confused by the Balloon Escape song, I thought that was the song I was looking for. I now know it's Lou Reed's song called \\"Rouge\\" on his Ecstasy album. The other cuban sounding songs are pretty cool actually but I don't really listen to it. You should get this if you are mainly interested in the cuban music (that's what I\\"m calling it) that is played in the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cathartic","review":"My experience with this music was cathartic. Sure, the film helped to inform the sound and give it context. Any further critique would be without heart, and this was music from the heart and soul. The only track that I had questions about is #14 Kamata Mariyam. A Lebonese singer? But it works. I highly recommend both film and soundtrack."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing lots of music from the film","review":"Julian Schnabel ultilized much more music than this osundtrack provides. Two essential missing pieces:(1) the police raid of the fiesta (the one which Javier's tour guide friend takes him to) contains a three minute montage to the adaigetto of Mahler's 5th symphony (which is by the way, a very banal and naive use of music).(2) The music depicting the sea and Javier's disasterious flight from Cuba on the makeshift raft is lifted from Popol Vuh's original soundtrack to Werner Herzog's \\"Aguire the Wrath of God\\". In fact, Schnabel shamelessly copies Herzog's use of the music- to depict the enorminty of nature compared to miniscue man.Final word, this film is too sappy- Schnabel is not humble enough, because his craft remains weak."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed","review":"Although I don't usually write negative reviews, I think this item is more than deserving. To begin, this is the only soundtrack you can buy; while most movies have an original score and a various artist album (when applicable), both are truncated into this single volume. Much of the various artist music is available, but only two original pieces are presented, one with Javier Bardem speaking as Reinaldo Areanas in Spanish (the scene in the movie in the cab in New York), a memorable monolouge indeed, but it doesn't fit on the soundtrack.The only real problem is that this one volume edition listed as an original soundtrack is not comprehensive and mostly unoriginal."},{"rating":"1","title":"If a picture is worth 10,000 words, a song is..?","review":"The soundtrack really doesn't hold up without the visual. It's not a convincing representation of what was being listened to in Cuba at the time.

The introduction took longer to get through than the book did! I thought it was amazing how the introduction discussed that many people really dismissed Keckley's account of what happened during the Lincoln years. I found her insights very interesting and personal, but I have to wonder about Keckley herself. If she was that close to Mary Lincoln (Keckley reports that she was the ONLY person Mary would see following the assassination of the president), why have I not heard of her before? She offers a fascinating insight into the sale of Mary Lincoln's personal wardrobe (which is so commonplace today that it barely registers), and how vilified she was in the press for even attempting such a thing. If you're interested in the Lincolns at all, or on the slave experience (albiet a really unusual slave experience), I would recommend Keckley's book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Behind the Scenes: Thirty years a slave and four in the White House by Elizabeth Keckley","review":"This Babblebooks MP3 Audio CD, read by Anais 9000, (purchased from Amazon) is a total disappointment.

I'm hoping Amazon will let me return it. Then I'll buy the paperback version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intimate recollections of the Lincoln White House","review":"Although this volume comes from the memories of someone familiar with the Lincoln White House and who became a close friend of Mary Todd Lincoln, it must be read cautiously. For example, despite the book's basic authenticity I find its account of Stephen Douglas's love for young Mary Todd and her jilting of Lincoln implausible despite Keckley's claim that she got the story directly from Mary Todd Lincoln and Anson Henry (a close friend of Abraham and Mary, who was a matchmaker encouraging their romance). Possibly some errors might be attributed to one or more literary assistants who helped compile the book. If a reader needs to be certain a about a particular statement, comparison with other sources is wise. Still, the volume will be valuable to anyone interested in firsthand impressions of the Lincoln White House."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointed","review":"This book has some historical interest but falls short of expectations. I found the description of the legal process for the emancipation of a slave and life in the whitehouse interesting. The sophistication of the writing style and the lack of any reference to Keckly's education leads me to suspect that it was put together by a ghost writer. That's OK but the historical coverage, while occasionally interesting, was very limited. The account after Lincoln's assasination was limited to the pecuniary embarrasment of Mrs. Lincoln and a fanciful description of trips back home."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read","review":"Interesting book with historical insights.

Although I can say nothing regarding the musicianship (hell, they ought to teach a class based on the playing on this album), one thing is certain: the songs themselves lack feeling, hooks or anything remarkable. The playing, particularly the guitar, is unparalleled and I often whip this CD out when a guitarist is visiting so I can watch his jaw drop. Bootsy also brings us some cool 'space bass' in spots. This is hybrid music, a little metal, a little urban, a little experiemental. It's actually a shot in the dark musically, as the songs themselves seriously lack charachter and emotion, yet a blistering performance exhibited within. Most likely will only be truly appreciated by musicians, esp. sweep-picking-hammer-on guitarists or any fans of the Collins/Worrell combo. 5-star performance, 1-star songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funk?

Before I read the book, I didn't particularly like the idea of relating cosmic evolution to biological evolution, but Lee Smolin makes some excellent points. Life may indeed be modeled after non-life. Compelling evidence is also presented regarding his black hole ideas, which is a great alternative to other theories in the field.The one downside to this book is the small print & verbose vocabulary of the author. At times, you almost need a dictionary by your side, & the average word must be eight letter long. However, if you make it through this revolutionary work, you'll never look at the universe or life the same way again. Overall this book is literally a beast to read, but in the end, it is well spent money & well spent time. Far too many scientists are scared to think on their own & hence there are too many books that sound exactly the same. This simply isn't one of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonders of the universe(s)","review":"Smolin presents some pretty interesting ideas in this book and in a way that isnt overly technical.

Work, however, it is. I had to read over several passages simply because I was unfamiliar with many of the concepts in quantum mechanics. The moderately determined mind will not be daunted by this and the reward is a vision of unfolding, evolving universes captured like chick embyos within the shell of black holes, hatched into a parallel reality. Dr. Smolin does us a service by giving us a beautiful thesis that connects our existence to that of our universe as never before"},{"rating":"2","title":"Question the way you view life by delving inside black holes","review":"The first chapter was enough to make me momentarily consider selling all my belongings, moving to Pennsylvania, and becoming a Physics major at Penn State.

This is a major disappointment though, nothing at all like the superb Trio Fascination Vol. 1. The problem lies in the conception - the various ensembles deny the CD any focus whatsoever, the number of tracks with each group means that there is no room [time] for a good exploration of the best parts, and the personnel choices are not ideal. One would expect Lovano and Dave Douglas to combust, but they play past each other, Billy Drewes is as thin-sounding and meaningless as usual, and Joe himself plays drums on several tracks, in order to provide the proper instrumentation within the guidelines of a trio, and Joe is simply not good at it.

That turns out to have been a big mistake, because the \\"Living Bible\\" translation is horrendous! It's really not a translation at all, but a paraphrase, and an absurd one at that. Look at what they did to the first chapter of John: \\"Before anything else existed, there was Christ, with God. He has always been alive and is himself God.

Get your N2O from Austria or at least some part of the E.U. Look for tripple filtered or Ultra-pure. In the long run, if you're into purity you'll be much better off and happier and healthier.

Granted, I've never been to Morocco & heard the music 1st hand, but based on the other Gnawa albums I've heard, this seems quite authentic, not to mention superbly done. The songs are wonderfully performed, and the sound quality is excellent, way above par: the instruments and vocals sound clear and distinct, but not phoney or stiff -- there's no artificial reverb or compressed-sounding stuff going on.

I could not put it down after finding it in my grandmother's collection of old books. It inspired me to become a better person and to strive for perfection and integrity in everything that I do. This book talks about the Lincoln that we were not taught about in history classes. I was impressed with the fact that Lincoln totally despised slavery. Especially after witnessing the treatment of a mulatto slave girl on the auction block by prospective buyers. His triumphs and failures make him seem much more human. Not only was he a great President, but a great human being as well. It illustrates the fact that the only true measure of real success is the ability to endure pain.

He specializes in the electronic scene, but he cannot be called a \\"DJ\\" he is a true MUSICIAN, an artist. This album is an experimental hour worth of ambient fused with loops of, what I believe are samples of Claude Debussy's classical works (afterall, this album is based on his works)This is quite a relaxing and soothing piece of an album. The soundscapes are very dark and gloomy. While I love the whole work, the standouts for me are \\"Ancient Campfire\\" and \\"Path Leading To The High Grass\\" the latter of which is absolutely amazing I think.sample it, and see if this is what you want to buy - it certainly is for the seekers of something original."},{"rating":"2","title":"beautiful but need to up the volume","review":"because it seems to be mixed/recorded very low.

Irksome trait, but it's still a really interesting work of minimalism.Postscript- I had to add an extra star after repeated headphone listening. This is a really great album and well worth your money. It has a hypnotic quality, especially on a couple of tracks that use loops very effectively. It's so nice to hear loops framed in ways other than 'glitch' or other audio collage/hip-hop/electronica.

I felt embarrassed for her just listening to her voice fail to hit the right notes on so many songs, not to mention she sounds very raspy throughout. The last four or five songs are the best (she had over an hour to warm up, I guess). After hearing all the hype, I really wanted to buy the gold edition when it came out some months ago. The $40 or so seemed too steep for me, until I recently received a gift certificate to Tower Records. : ) I wish I had spent the money on something else -- even a better recording (or two at this price!) of Garland taped in studio.

Shouldn't mess with great memories, I guess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Held my breath, waiting for this recording and still waiting","review":"I'm sorry but this stuff is boring. The orchestration, songs, tempo and pacing is so fifties it's madding. It's 1961 but Judy's voice had allot of vibrato and had lowered in range and register by then.As she was at the 40 year old mark it's understandable (passing at 47). It didn't help adding in the drugs and physical problems.Much better recordings are the \`The Capital Recordings' 1955-1965, her pipes were working well and she was sounding sensational in this time and environment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely the best","review":"Judy At Carnegie Hall is without a doubt the finest live recording by a female artist in the 20th century, period. Other singers have had their \\"live\\" recordings, too, but they cannot compete with Miss Garland on this night. (I swear, every \\"live\\" recording by other [female] artists, try to duplicate the success of this evening). She starts off strong and stays that way, taking the lucky audience - and us lucky listeners - with her as she wraps her talent around 26 songs. Today's stars, and I use that word lightly, could take a tip from Miss Garland. Today's singers seem to need all kinds of technical and lighting props, etc. Miss Garland had herself and an orchestra. Who could ask for anything more? She is playful and winning and heartbroken and wistful and even sensual (\\"Do It Again\\"). It's all here. And it's all brilliant. A must for any CD library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Miss Judy's Finest Hour!!!!","review":"Hard to believe, but forty-eight (48) years ago tonight, the greatest live concert EVER was held at New York's Carnegie Hall. It was two-plushours of pure dynamite and Ms. Garland was at the very top of her game!! If you've only heard about this concert and wondered why all the fuss about Judy, then buy this marvelous two-CD set. Judy was the STAR that night, but so was Mort Lindsey's magnificent orchestra!! His contribution cannot be overlooked. All in all, an absolutely superb performance by singer and supporting cast. BRAVO!! KUDOS!! TWENTY-FIVE STARS!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the Judy we love!","review":"I first got this album in 1962 when I was a boy of 12. Even at that tender age, i knew great talent when I heard it. I listened to the album for days and days on end. I wore it out. Now, listening to this 4oth anniversary reissue, I am astounded at how fabulous Judy still sounds to me. The engineers have finally done Judy justice. Her voice and her charisma and her incomparable performing genius are all here in all their glory. Thank God for such a talent in my lifetime.

She refused and said she could not believe that someone would have the gall to offer so little. She loaned me the 2 record set and I simply fell in love with the divine Miss Garland. It was without a doubt the night that the art of entertainment worked to the MAX. Judy makes you smile and makes you cry tears and if you think of her tragic life maybe a few more tears. Through it all, you must remember that you are listening to one of the World's Premiere Entertainers. Yea, even better than over-hyped Streisand. When I purchased the re-mastered CDs from ...

This unique talent is caught at its adult best. The performance is a comeback and also a last hurrah. The performance is wonderfully exhausting to listen to. Her range was limitless, both emotionally and vocally.Garland was very special and here she's simply magical.

The only difference with this game is that all of the fighters are pre-historic! Two apes, a big dinosaur, a fire breathing legendary dinosaur, a raptor and much more. The gameplay is much like Street Fighter 2, and the gameplay is very slow, because you are fighting as dinosaurs!

Yes, there were some errors, which I picked up on easily. In combination with studying the PMBOK guide, I could easily spot the errors and correct them myself.

I found lots of errors in the book, which really hindered my ability to study, as you kept going back to double check things.

It did not work originally, and you have to go online to download a fix which will provide links so that diagrams referenced in the question can actually appear. But get this - even then, the WRONG diagram would appear. Nice! Real Nice.I then purchased an EXAM CRAM 2 book which was a good choice. I can't say if it's the best choice or not, but it did the job for me as I did pass the ceritification exam.I'm not happy about giving a bad review.

I also found an error on the highly-touted 'wall chart' from the author's web site, where in the Schedule Development process, there are two extra process inputs listed.

In some cases, the explanation of the correct answer is inconsistent with the actual answer (e.g. the Correct answer is C - 50%; but in the explanation, they say \\"D\\" as the answer, but still say it's 50%). Additionally, there are tons of spelling errors in the CD practice exam.

I found the text in this guide very irritating and distracting for a number of reasons, not the least of which was because it didn't really corelate with the PMBOK.After giving up on the text, I hoped that I could at least use the practice tests on the CDROM that comes with it in order to get some simulated computer testing experience.

Just keep reading you will come to a point in the book that will make the reading seem to match up where the series left off. I would suggest having book 8 and the Prairie Legacy series on hand because once you start reading you will not want to put the books down.

He's really one the best singer of all the times. He's my own legendary figure !!!. Billy was \\"THE\\" rockstar of EIGHTIES. His success was a beautiful shine in the darkness, he began to collect hits since DON'T STOP (1981) and he stopped the parade with CYBERPUNK. This last album was a failure in America, yes, but it also was a RESOUNDING SMASH HIT in Europe and everyone knows \\"Shock to the system\\" too. By my side, CYBERPUNK is a masterpiece in a way of discovery. The nineties was a decade of celebration. Thanks to SPEED, THE WEDDING SINGER, the MP3 scandal, Tommy Iommi & HEAVY METAL 2 Billy Idol returned to the credit he deserved. Now, the man is popular again. This GREATEST HITS is not the end. This is the beginning. Do you remember when GENX died ? It was the beginning. Same story. I'm ready to see it...i'm only 24 years old.

During the late '80's, early '90's, I wore out my cassette copy of Vital Idol, and always wanted a more comprehensive collection of his hits.Well, this is it. Apart from three songs that I invariably skip (\\"Catch My Fall,\\" the live \\"Rebel Yell,\\" and the woefully lacking \\"(Don't You) Forget About Me\\"), this is a terrific representation of a career.The songs are presented mostly chronologically, so as to present a picture of the development of his artistry, and I wouldn't ask for it any other way (although he seems to have reached his peak somewhere around the \\"Whiplash Smile\\" album).I would highly recommend this for the '80's fan or Idol worshipper, or just anyone who likes their pop with an edge."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Compilation","review":"I remember when he first showed up on the scene.

It's hard to pick favorites though, these really are ALL classic songs from the blonde, punk Elvis. Included are the covers \\"Don't you forget about me\\", and The Doors \\"LA Woman\\" from the \\"Charmed Life\\" album. I actually would have liked another track from that one.

So I picked up the disc - such a good disc, I don't even know where to begin. My all-time favorite Billy Idol tune is Sweet Sixteen, followed by To Be a Lover and Rebel Yell.

From his Gen X days to the ill fated Cyberpunk album this is a fairly definitive collection of Idol's material.\\"Eyes Without A Face\\" and \\"Catch My Fall\\" are easily some of Billy's most creative and beautiful songs.\\"Cradle Of Love\\" over time, has not lost it's luster or charm.I especially liked the live acoustic version of \\"Rebel Yell\\" and even moreso Keith Forsey's: \\"Don't You Forget About Me\\" (as I understand it Keith Forsey actually wrote this song for Billy to perform back in the 80's before it was offered up to Simple Minds).I felt the Idol/Stevens team rocked Forsey's song out in great style and form.

I use them primarily for casual jazz listening and hip hop music production/turntablism. I am not, repeat, not an audiophile. However, I do know when I have a good pair of head phones. I can wear these babies for a couple hours without discomfort, and when they do start to hurt, I simply move them back a little farther on my head. Sound canceling/leakage is excellent. The pads cut out most external sound and keep it from leaking out. The cord is a nice length, and the ability to replace just the cord and not the whole headphone will probably come in handy in the near future.The bass on these bad boys is amazing, perfect for listening to hip hop, funk, soul, or anything with a driving bass line. I have already noticed several complex bass lines i missed using other headphones. I don't know how well these work for audiophiles, but for a semi-casual user, they are perfect."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'll keep my PRO4-AAs, thanks!","review":"Very disappointed in these phones, but then, Panasonic isn't really known for speakers and headphones, I suppose.

I just tried these technics that my brother has and I was pretty disappointed. They don't compare to either Grados or Dr. Dre Beats. They don't even compare to the Sony Extra Bass MDR XB700 headphones. I'm actually wanting to trade my Grados for these Sonys because they are incredibly comfortable, sound amazing, and have some bass. These Technics are too tight and DO NOT feel comfortable. Comfort and Sound Quality is crucial. Take my word for it. DO NOT GET THESE, PLEASE. Go with the Sonys if you have a cheaper budget. Grados and Dre Beats are obviously the best choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"tired of sony 700's","review":"If you are tired of the flimsy, plastic, sony headphones, well you have other choices. For dj's who use their headphones often, the Technic/Panasonic RP-DH1200 is the answer. The sound quality is very comparable to the sony vj 700's, and arguably better (particularly in its bass response). But what makes these headphones a great deal is that the cord is replaceable and so are the chushion pads on the headphones. I will warn you though that the headphones are slightly more heavy on the head than the sony ones, but for me it hasn't been that noticeable to me. Anyways, good luck in your search."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I'm into quality, and that's what you will get from these Technics headphones. I'm not a DJ, but I know these headphones work great for home listening. The volume can be turned up without any distortion at all. You may even want to record your mp3s at higher bitrates because you will be able to hear the difference between 128 and 256. The headphones are very well designed and comfortable. I find it hard to stop listening to them because I like them so much. The coiled cord stays out of the way. These headphones may be a little too bulky to wear walking down the street, but they are well worth their price. They also block out many ouside noises and other people in the room cannot hear the music you play at normal levels. This product will truly provide a new listening experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Joints & Headbands Break!","review":"I've owned two pairs of these.

But given that the sound won't change much with usage I have to say the following compared to the Sony 700's: the bass isn't as deep, the midrange is the best point about these headphones, the highs trail off too fast probably from the upper midrange on (probably around 3500hz)and the Sony 700's have better imaging.I have more headphones on order as I type. I probably won't use these very much or at all. They say you get what you pay for. Well sometimes, given the relatively high price of these headphones, you get less than a good value.EDIT: Although not the same quality of sound or in the same price range even the Marathon 1100's by Audiovox marketed as DJ headphones are a better value.

The babies were all male, all healthy, under 3 months old, and apparently all neglected or unwanted. The local police have given up. Inspector Napoleon Bonaparte is called in after a fifth baby goes missing, and this time, the mother is killed. Of all the cases he's worked, this one has him entering a foreign world of infants. He calls in an assistant on this one, Police Constable Alice McGorr for a little female insight.I really enjoyed this book. It was a treat to see Bony working with a partner. But the domestic side is never allowed to overshadow the mystery. It's not at all warm and fuzzy, just a pleasant change and setting for this book. Highly recommended and worth searching for.CMB"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a toy","review":"This is an amazing device. It's quite incredible--once you get it to work. My elven-year-old son had a delightful time putting it together, but there is a serious learning curve when it comes to making the device actually work.

Still, it makes for an effective demonstration of several scientific concepts--once you figure out how to make it work . . ."},{"rating":"2","title":"levitron top","review":"The Levitron takes a while to calibrate, but works well.

I'm giving it 2 stars due to my error and lack of research. The top will \\"levitate\\" but only when spinning and after much human intervention and trial and error. One must weight the top correctly, place on a plastic \\"launcher\\" of sorts, spin, then remove the launcher in hopes your spin was perfect enough to allow for about 5 seconds of \\"levitation\\". Once the top slows down, the wobble in the axis pulls it out of balance and its over. All of this takes practice and is time consuming and frustrating. Its more about the weight in the end to counter act the magnetic force.

I didn't have problems with paint chips however the pop-up doesn't really pop, it gets stuck all of the time. The other problem I see is the seat, my child's legs were rubbed raw after only sitting in it for about 15min. The other problem is he has hit his head on some of the plastic parts and has cut himself on the plastic book edges. I think this is a good toy for an older child but not for a 4 month old."},{"rating":"2","title":"love this item","review":"My baby loves this thing, she never sits still. The popping globe with beads doesnt work right though.

Once my baby got big enough for his feet to touch the ground I took the bottom off so he could use it as a rocker. It immediately struck me that the wheels are spaced in such a way that if my son threw his weight around a little too much he'd be able to tip it over. But since I only put him in it 15 minutes a day or less and I'm always near him I figured he'd be fine. Sure enough it happened. He tipped the walker over and landed face first, upside down on the ground. I saw it happening and just missed catching him. He's fine, thank goodness, but it was scary. I looked up the toy expecting to see it had been recalled but I was surprised to see it has not been recalled and is being sold here and from other retailers. This product should definitely be recalled until they make some improvements."},{"rating":"2","title":"---------","review":"This was a good product, but my son just didn't play much with all the toys. Just not enought activity for him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product, My son loves it!","review":"I researched a lot of products and finally decided on this one because of its 2 in 1 conversion from a play center to a walker later on. My 6 month old son absolutely loves sitting in it and playing with all of the gadgets, seeing all the lights, and hearing all the sounds he can make. Now that he can touch the bottom, he can turn himself so he can play with all the toys in the 360 degree circle. We recently took it apart so he could try out the walker and it was really simple to undo and then put back together again. I would defintely recommend this product to all parents out there. We love it and my son spends at least 30 mintues a day in it. A+++++"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love This!!!!","review":"I bought the Sit N Step 2 in 1 when my son was 7 months old. From the time that I put it together, my son absolutely LOVED it. When I first saw this online, I first liked the fact that it converted into a walker. Then I liked the variety of toys that it offered. I have not experienced the chipping paint or the ball pop sticking. My son has chewed on the music/activity bar quite a lot, and it still looks brand new. The only reason I am giving this item 4 stars is that the front wheels, while secured in place, sit quite a bit higher than the back, causing the front of the activity center to lean. But since it is still secured, I just left it alone. My son actually seems to like the fact that he can bend over to reach certain toys, or reach up to reach others. Overall, He and I both love it. I can't wait to see how this does as the walker."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice watch, watch out for the battery","review":"I bought the watch as a gift and it is a nice atch. Problem was it died in 2.5 months. When I sent it in to the manufacturer I was told that the batter ws dead and that it shoud have a 2 year life at least, and it was likley \\"old\\" stock so the battery was old. I was then charged $15 for a new battery and $10.50 to ship it back! That is not including the initial cost for me to ship it to the manufacturer. Amazon did offer to send me a new watc, but I turned that down. My fear was that I get another watch about to die from older stock and then in 3 months I am forced to spend money again to replace it. If that happens then I am out over $60 in 6 months for nothing! No.They did (Amazon) decide to issue a $30 credit to my account, which makes up for the cost to me. I do thank them for that. :)It is a good watch, just make sure you know about the possible battery issue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what the customer ordered","review":"The description said used, and that statement is correct.

However it is more of a primer discussing some of the issues that surround the topic of shared services than how-to. The really tough decisions involving shared services are how to evaluate the potential programs to take on, how to integrate and manage the portfolio across the functional silos (i.e., finance, HR, real estate, supply chain, and IT), how to govern the shared services organization, and how to balance customer satisfaction with cost efficiencies. Unfortunately this book is not helpful in dealing with these issues.So if you are a newbie trying to find out what shared services is all about you may find this book helpful. But if you are a manager who has been charged with implimenting a shared services function, there isn't much help here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally","review":"This is a copied version but i am so happy to have it in a playable format.

I was hoping to surprise her with a new copy, but I don't think that will be happening this Christmas since I'm returning this DVD.I'll keep looking for a VHS or DVD of this online, but I would implore others to heed my warning: Don't buy from Scary DVDs...unless you want to support bootlegs and don't mind horrible quality products."},{"rating":"1","title":"Purchase not rec'd","review":"I order a video on October 18,2002 and have yet to receive it.

Secondly, despite the anti-glare filter, the light is very harsh. Third, although it has three levels of intensity, all are too bright. Fourth, it does not \\"telescope\\" as advertised, but merely rotates on the hub. Fifth, it is not as well-constructed as I had hoped. The lamp rotates at the central hub and at the base of the light, and both screw-like connectors tend to slip and look like they will wear out.

As this is a subject exhaustively covered, researched and analyzed for over sixty years it is unrealistic to expect many new facts here. New insights may arise even generations later, however and this slim volume has enough to make the reader stop frequently to ponder and say \\"Now, why didn't I think of that?\\" or take issue. Prof. Lukacs' fresh look at the term \\"isolationism\\" is by itself worth the priceAs to taking issue, Prof. Lukacs is not shy about criticizing the work of other historians or biographers--even quite eminent ones and even in a cranky tone. He is a one-man school of historiography, neither right-wing nor left, European oriented or wholly American, ideological nor determinist.This book is valuable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The book is peppered throughout with irrelevancies, digressions, and no-explanation snap judgments of disputed facts and the value of other historians' work.

His treatment of the Stalin-speech to the Politburo on August 19, 1939 is also wrong. Lukacs claims that the speech is a forgery, but in fact it's contents have been confirmed by the diary-entry of Comintern-Leader G. Dimitroff (see his long entry on Sept. 7, 1939) and the instructions to the Communist Parties about how to jusitfy the Pact with Hitler.The book suffers from Lukacs' inability to read Russian books and his shallow overview of available material in English and/or German laguage.Not recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as good as Dude Ranch and Enema, but still good!","review":"!Heather's Teenage Son!Ah yes...this album was one of the most hilarious Blink-182 albums I've ever listened to.

If you listen to Cheshire Cat, then Dude Ranch, then T.O.Y.P.A.J, then the new one, you'd think they were all different bands! Anyway, back to Cheshire Cat: it rocks.

On some of blink's later songs, the lyrics became kind of meaningless and stupid(all the small things..true care truth brings... what the hell is that supposed to mean?!) but every single song on this cd is creatively wrote. On the song, 'Wasting Time,' I swear, I spent about 5 minutes pondering the lyris:'Sometimes I sit at home and wonder if she's sitting at home thinking of me and wondering if I'm sitting at home thinking about her, or am I just wasting my time.' the lyrics are a definite plus on this cd. even the lyrics on incredibly juvenile songs such as ben wah balls, or depends.

Originally, this cd is not a blink 182 cd, the band was named Blink and had another drumer, scott. Their name was changed when a techno band sued them because they had the same name, so, they changed their name to blink 182. Scott was an excellent drumer and his departure ended up with the hiring for Travis from Aqua Bats. This change led to a decay in Blink 182's music.Cheshire Cat is definetly Blink's best cd. Fast beats, excellent guitar, bass and vocals make this cd deserve a 5/5. If you enjoyed blink 182's funny lyrics in either dude ranch, the mark tom and travis show or in take of your pants and jacket, then this cd has what your looking for.

Blink 182 are a bunch of immature, unfunny, untalented losers, who said themselves that they are only in it for the money and the girls. Not the kids, just the materialistic stuff. All the bathroom humor is getting really old. It's no longer funny. Don't even get me started on their live shows. The guys can't sing at all and whatever glimmer of talent they do have is studio produced. This sounds worse then you sunday school band playing hymns. Seriously. Oh and the voice, the whiney and annoying voice that is like experiencing fingernails scraped across a chalk board. YES it's that bad.

Punk is raw, pissed off, anti-government music that truely rocks. This entire CD is a rip off of the Casualties, a real street punk band. It was so obvious that Blink actually had to TRY to sound punk, when it would be natural for real punk bands to sound punk. And being a sellout doesn't mean you have more success(Nirvana's 2nd album was very successful, and then they went back to the old sound), being a sellout means you lost your ways, your values. Blink, much like Green Day seem to have the same misguided ideology that \\"punk isn't violent, it's about peace\\", hippies were for peace, not punks!

I was originally disappointed because it sounded nothing Like Dude Ranch and Enema which were my 2 favourite CDs at the time. However, when I listened to it again I realized that it was decent music. So don't buy this cd expecting it to sound anything like their later stuff. My favourite track is definitely: \\"Does my Breath Smell\\".

With drummer Scott Raynor laying the drum tracks with true punk enthusiasm I encourage any Blink fan who wants to here \\"real\\" punk music to buy this cd. Scott Raynor was the driving force behind the punk Blink 182. When this was recorded the band was younger, more energetic, and running on pure guts and determination, MCA's hand was not in their back pocket. If you wanna hear real punk rock, true to life lyrics, and see the band before they were a tattooed money maker, check this CD out. They were simply three clean cut, funny young guys from Southern California, out to play some music. We'll miss you forever early Blink 182, and we'll miss Scott Raynor, the driving force behind this punk innovator."},{"rating":"2","title":"best blink cd ever!","review":"i own all the blink 182 cds and this is by far the best. in cheshire cat every song is great and even though the recording quality is not as good the songs rock! it sounds different from the blink we know today and it is a good difference. i strongly suggest buying this cd. i bought the cds back wards (toypaj, eots, etc.) but this cd is my favorite and the one i lsiten to most. so i think that any true blink fan should go out and buy this cd right now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"still good....","review":"First off, just because this wasn't recorded on MCA doesn't make it \\"true punk\\". It's really more pop-punk(or watered down pop-punk [stuff] as some people who don't know what punk sounds like prefer to call it. To those, check out The Sex Pistols) than anything else. Their new stuff isn't really even pop-punk, it's more like pop or alternative(all the fans of bink are gonna give me an unhelpful vote, aren't they? well, it's true and it was worth it). This cd isn't so bad, it's actually pretty good. It's not as overproduced as their new stuff.

Their muscianship again, isn't up there. But there lyrics are very deep. \\"Touchdown Boy\\", \\"Romeo and Rebecca\\" and \\"Ben Wah Balls\\" are the best songs on this CD.

Plus the rawness of tom's voice is one of the high points on the album. This album has Carousel one of blink 182's best song's yet. plus don't 4get m+m's, wasting my time and does my breath smell? if u doubt blink's musicianship or just plain adore them you should definatly have this CD!!

Some of the pieces were cut haphazardly and the black King tilts like the Leaning Tower of Pisa.

I thought the exchanges between Marlowe and the kid (who killed the guy who killed his boyfriend) were great also, but immediately after that scene, I folded. It's probably my issue with private eye novels anyway, but aside from the wonderful dialogue, I had a hard time swallowing and ultimately couldn't/didn't finish The Big Sleep ... i became too anxious to read what was waiting in the bin (The Leopard).

It lasted a month. The plot isn't all that exciting, and frankly hard to follow. There is little to no character development. I certainly felt the cigarette filled rooms smelling of booze and rumpled detectives, but the storyline was uneventful. I will rent the DVD to see what Hollywood made of the book. Certainly, there must be other intriguing works of detective fiction, perhaps even by Chandler, that would be better than \\"The Big Sleep.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Not to good","review":"I thought the first parts of the book and until about 60 pages were left it was kind of confusing and boring.

However, I was very dissappointed. I tried to like the book, but I was completely bored and could not even finish it. There was so suspense, the characters were flat and undeveloped, and I couldn't get past the misogyny/racism/etc. The book was entirely devoid of any emotion at all. It provides an interesting historical look into that society, but other than that, I could not have enjoyed it less.

Even literature back then was even at least somewhat interesting. I know that this book is a classic mystery novel, but there was really no riveting mystery involved. At least there was a little mystery involved, though. To give it some credit, Chandler's uses of similes were great in some areas, but he used them way to often. This book was very boring in my opinion. There is nothing exciting about it. It really was a 'Big Sleep.'"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Novel","review":"For a book read for class, this is by far one of the best I've had to read. It is very similar to LA Confidential.

Did I like it? Yes, why not - it had a certain sense of style, a certain attraction, present in every comment by every character. As it comes to dialogue, this book has it all. That's easy to admit.That much for the good sides, there were weak points too. Most of all Chandler's descriptions seemed to me somewhat showy and heavy. Also, the plot could've been more mesmerizing. Compared to other detective novels I have read in the past, this one might not do so well. Incredibly sophisticated plots always make me feel confused. Too much glamour in the plot seems like a desperate need to gain attention. But I'm pretty satisfied; it is very rare that 'a classic' turns out to this good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Style AND substance","review":"The Big Sleep by Raymond Chandler is a 20th century American classic. Chandler's gritty look into his 1940's private-eye world of Los Angeles feels as real as the cold, hard October rain coming down on Philip Marlowe's face.The novel's voice and tone are spot-on and you'll be completely immersed. I found myself seeing my own life through the eyes of Marlowe while reading. The narrative is even and believable though I thought it somewhat complicated on the first reading.I listened to the audiobook version, read by Elliot Gould, which I felt was the perfect choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a snoozer","review":"I listened to this version which was narrated by Elliot Gould. I could not ask for a better narrator. His reading of the book gave the perfect voice for Philip Marlowe. The story centers around the Sternwood family - an aging and ailing father and his two adult daughters, one is being blackmailed. The body count mounts as Marlowe follows the clues. Sometimes the murder happens in Marlowe's presence. As rough as Marlowe seems to be, he does have integrity to the very end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tough going","review":"Why is it that books that are labeled as \\"classics\\" often seem to disappoint? That's a question that has a longer answer than I'd care to write about here, but that thought did occur to me several times while reading The Big Sleep by Raymond Chandler. I'm sure high expectations have something to do with it, and the story did seem to be a winner. Philip Marlowe, a private dick from L.A. is on a black mailing case involving a millionaire and his two insane daughters.Here we find excellent prose, but a plot that is so hard to follow, I gave up about three quarters of the way through. I would have been able to keep up if I kept a notebook of all the characters (of which there are too many), and a history of what had happened thus far (too much too soon). Someone reading this for a college class may have a highlighter or two handy, and get more out of this book. However, the casual reader will find this novel tough going."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brutal and compelling","review":"I've read a slew of contemporary hardboiled tales (or what passes for them these days) and found nothing comparable to Chandler's \\"The Big Sleep.\\" This is a novel on par with Hammett's own Maltese Falcon. Chandler sucks you into the tale on the first page, and you'll be hard-pressed to put the book down until you know the ugly, sick truth.This is the ultimate crime novel. Friends, classics are deemed \\"classic\\" for a reason. Read this novel. You will not be disappointed. If anything, it will make you disappointed with every contemporary crime novel you read hereafter. If you have even a smidgen of interest in crime, hardboiled fiction, or straight-up compelling mysteries, you'll want to check this out."},{"rating":"2","title":"good an interior plot","review":"chandlers ideas of the way peoples minds work onlong with the inocence of the 50's make a good book. the description to the thoughts in which people think . the character of the young daughter will hypnotise you with her lying and cheating to hurt her fathe"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wealth- Porn-Murder- Missing Persons- Mental Illness","review":"This was my first Raymond Chandler read and I liked it. The plot was based in southern california during the late 1930's. The same time the book was written. A dying, wealthy old general is being blackmailed. He engages the services of private investigator Philip Marlowe to get to the bottom of things. It's a quick moving read of 231 pages. The story stands up well to the test of time having been originally published about seventy years ago. I think most would agree that this is an excellent introduction to the author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous Noir - even if you say you don't like the genre","review":"This is a fabulous book! It's Raymond Chandler's first novel & our first glimpse of one of the great characters in Fiction (argueably Pop Culture), Philip Marlowe. Marlowe combs through the seamy underbelly of 1930's L.A. on a case involving a paralyzed millionaire & his two psycho daughters. There's blackmail, there's murder, there are twists & turns to throw you off base. It's noir at it's best, quite frankly & I'd recommend it to anyone -- even if they swear they don't like mystery books. Hell, I'm not a big fan of the dectective genre, unless it's done right and Chandler seems to be the writer that all others copy, badly."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book defines an era of tough guy detective novels","review":"For best of breed, Raymond Chandler's novels top the list.His character, Marlowe, seems to stumble and crash his waythrough the plot.

Women falling hard for him left andright complete the male criteria for excellence. I had tobuy all of Chandler's books and papers after this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slightly over-rated classic full of wit","review":"The Big Sleep is not as quick of a read as most modern mysteries, probably because of the 1930s slang. I found the action entertaining, yet difficult to tie together. Only at the very end do we get the benefit of Marlowe's revelation. Even so, one of the deaths was never addressed. Between bodies falling, this book features more shady characters than even Los Angeles could have supported. Most of them die, of course. With the exception of the General, only Marlowe seems to have a clear conscience in this saga into the gutter of morality. I did enjoy Chandler's use of language in characterizing so much of the story with subtlety. It is hard to believe Marlowe would risk so much because of his duty to his client."},{"rating":"2","title":"My first reading of hardboiled fiction","review":"I figured I might as well start with the master, and boy, was this a fun ride! There are some issues with the prose on occasion (wordiness, lack of clarity) but as a whole it's a tightly-paced thriller with believable plot elements and an interesting cast of characters. It was especially interesting to read as a 21st century girl, with so many things that would be politically incorrect or offensive today. I will definitely continue to read Chandler in the future. I've heard his style grew as he wrote, so I'm curious to read his later books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyed it","review":"It was a fun read. Raymond Chandler definitely had a way with words.

The story will confuse and befuddle, but it is ultimately rewarding. The great thing about it is not only do you enjoy reading a great story, but you get a glimpse into a Los Angles of the past and a different cultural era. The darkside of the glamour city.

One other thing, if you do buy this watch and are reading the instructions, please note that to my knowledge, it does NOT have an alarm check (as the instructions indicate) nor do you press the B + C buttons to enable/disable the hourly chime. It's the A+B buttons."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Mustang Story","review":"This account of the P-51 does not compare favorably with the dozen or so other books on the subject. The writing (other than quotes) is uninspiring and borders on boring. There are errors that should have been caught, such as the statement that the P-51D increased it's armarment to eight guns rather than six. The quality of the paper is only fair and the vast majority of the photographs have been seen before. If you are looking for a comprehensive history of the P-51 Mustang, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Audio","review":"I'll give two stars because the audio was so bad that I had to crank up the volume on my TV to the highest point and I still could not make heads or tails what the people were saying! What a rip off! Although I liked the idea of the movie in dealing with good and evil. I understand that how things were back then with no big budget for making the movie. The blacks had to use what was given them and they made history! I will still invest in these hard to find films."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only if you want to look bad..","review":"What a badly designed jacket. I was given one as part of a management gift at work and I was shocked. The jacket is all outof proportion, with the arms being extremely large and puffy. also it seems the arms are way to long in comparison to the body of the jacket. The tapered back of the jacket (there are 2 pleats) gives the wearer the appearance of a hunch back as well as giving the wearer shoulders that are wider than the rest of the body. The only good thing about this jacket is that your dog would love it as a bed since it is overly bulky. Mind you the jacket is stiffer than Andie MacDowells acting...

I only gave it 1 star because they don't have zero star ratings.And I do believe this is a bootleg release. I highly doubt Perry and Co. are getting their percentages out of the sale of this thing.The audio quality is POOR. Not just poor, but the WORST. The vocals are unintelligible. The guitar solos are only audible when Dave hits a high note and it cuts through the garbled noise.The songs are not rare either. The \\"soundcheck\\" half of the disc is basically the band playing Had A Dad, but it's Had A Dad with very bad track markers.I think the individuals responsible for selling this #1 do not know the songs, #2 do not know Jane's Addiction, and #3 don't care who gets ripped off from buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ouch","review":"The only reason anyone should buy this CD is if you're that much of a die-hard Jane's Addiction fan, and the historical archive makes it worth purchasing in some extreme form of completism. This CD sounds awful, bottomline. I really hate to see great bands get their legacies trampled over. Jane's knew how to go out with a bang, rather than fizzle out and make sub par records, they went out in a blaze of glory with Ritual an amazing swan song. Followed by the first Lollapalooza, originally conceived of as an elaborate farewell tour. It's ridiculous reunions, new albums (without Eric Avery?, ever notice that every Jane's song is written around a bass line), and poor quality re-issues such as this that damage the legacy of a great band."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some random information for your convenience.","review":"This CD is a live recording of Jane's Addictions first show. The sound quality is just dreadful and makes the disc practically unbearable to listen to. It is an interesting peek into the bands infancy, but this is not a CD you will play frequently.When this disc came out, many thought it was a bootleg because it was a live recording not put out by either Warner Brothers or Triple-X records. However, this is a legitimate release by Eye Scream records. This was apparently released with the blessing of Perry Farrell himself. I am assuming it was either recorded too early for Warner Brothers to have the right to it, or the quality was so low that Warner Brothers didn't have any interest in it.Unfortunately, the disc just doesn't live up to the price it is commonly sold for. The sound for Had A Dad cuts out in a number of places and is spread across several tracks; it is really hard to tell if it is coming or going."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware - when this product fails it can't be repaired","review":"I was given mine as a gift.

It sat on my shelf for about 2 years before I finally picked it up to read and I was disappointed that I hadn't done so earlier.The book basically covers the entire war in one volume: starting off covering in brief, what took place between 1939-1944 and is crammed full of amazing information. Wilmot then turns to the main focus of the book, the fighting between 1944 and 1945. During the main portion of the book he covers both the Western and Eastern Fronts providing an excellent general narrative of the fighting backed up by dozens of maps to illustrate the text. Furthermore, the author actually took part in Operation Overlord and provides his own first-hand account of his landing into Normandy alongside the 6th Airborne Division."},{"rating":"2","title":"the struggle for Europe","review":"Excellent read.

The main character/narrator tells his story while adressing you as the reader on such subjects as his writing skills (or lack there of) and his idea of how a good story should be told. The just of the story is that of how the \\"author\\" comes to the conclusion that he is going to commit suicide and tells you of the many events leading to that conclusion only then to have his mind changed by an extraordinary event one day.

That was the first thing printed in the installation instructions. I called the company and they said the bouncing of the trailer will crack the rack mount.

With the Hollywood Rack we are able to easy load them on to either vehicle. We now have confidence that nothing will happen while in transport. The rack works equally well with our road bikes.

I haven't noticed much side-to-side sway though there is some up-and-down sway that could probably be eliminated by drilling a hole for a second hitch bolt.Do be aware that this is not a very compact rack. The tire platforms fold up but the rail that mates with the hitch is rigid and sticks out a couple feet from the rear of the vehicle. I find that I cannot close my garage door with the rack attached to my truck. Contrast this with the \\"hanging\\" style of hitch-mounted rack where you can fold the rack down when not in use.Shame Hollywood Racks didn't design the clamps to have a built-in locking mechanism (perhaps using the same key as the hitch pin lock).

When you realize that and then watch it changes the way you view it. I say this may not be for all ...but I let all my friends watch and and even my 75 year old mother (she asked to even after I told her what it was about) They all were shocked but most of all they all LOVED seeing Alex..even if his hair was blonde.

What a disappointment! After spending quite a bit of money on the mixer and attachments, I was excited about my new purchase until I saw what they sent as a cover.

The pocket is so flimsy and thin that if I put my accessories in it, I doubt it will carry its weight because the pocket will just rip off eventually. The \\"heavyweight quilted cotton\\" as advertised is not so heavyweight, it's more like a quilted linen cotton with very thin padding.

Apparently I had to put the bowl on it to add more girth, which took care of the extra inches, but now it is unsymmetrical- it bulges out in the front and sags in at the back, which bothers me more than it should.You get what you pay for, and I wish I had paid the extra five bucks for the brand name one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Small","review":"This item would have been nice for an appropriate size mixer.

This cover measures 17\\" High, 10\\" Deep, and if laid flat measures 13-1/2\\" across the top & 22\\" across the bottom.

They did, but the post office would not take it, as it was dated for the week before, even though I tried to return ASAP. So I Paid to ship it back. I called the company again. They said they would credit account and refund my postage. Well, it ended up It cost me to ship it back as they did not refund that amount. Not happy with this company and Amazon. I tried to complain to Amazon, but got no where with that. The add is false advertising, as it does not fit.

Frankie's voice is gone, clearly augmented by the back up group known as the \\"Seasons\\". The mixing clearly lowers Frankie's microphone so as not to make his voice the main voice.That it is only 76 minutes in length is a bigger dissapointment. How can 30 years (At the time) of material be whittled down to only 76 minutes. Too many great songs left off the set, which could have been added had they dropped the lame 50's doo-wop stuff.I'd rather see a documentary on the history of the group, including t.v. performances and other concert film from their prime. The Seasons have gone through more line-up changes than Yes.

I'm not a really big fan of action movies, and this definately had a lot of action, but it was really the dialog that I felt sold the movie. It's witty, fast-paced and more importantly contained a pertinent message. The cast for the most part were great, especially Adrian Paul. He really made the movie. The special effects were good, the robots were believable. The only thing I didn't care for was the jumpy filming at the very beginning of the movie. It was intentional but I didn't think it was necessary. Either way, it didn't last long and so didn't distract from what was a very good movie.

But it works well on pine and hardwoods. One problem is the inclusion of two bits (for the mini template) with 1/4 inch shafts. My router is set for 1/2 inch bits, so I would have to buy and install a 1/4 inch collet or buy two additional 1/2 inch bits.

I would not agree that this is a good law school text book. The text - for a legal scholarly work - is largely devoid of citations. Thus the book as a secondary source recounts history almost as hearsay without an ability to get to the primary history. In addition, the subject matter is superficial and insufficiently developed. The Kingsbury Commitment, a huge moment in telecommunications history, is given one paragraph. There is little new here that is not in other books. There is content that is missing. The author discusses Computer I and Computer II, but not Computer III even though that proceeding took place well before the publication of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tediously written and presented; lacks cohesion","review":"Unfortunately what seemed to be a promising resource in a highly dynamic and important field such as telecommunications turned out to be a huge disappointment.

It's a good read if one leaves science at the door and flips the pages for an adventure story. He creates a cult following of those who enjoy Star Trek, Star Wars, etc. and don't have the ability to distinguish science and science fiction.The book deserves one star for Science but I'll add another star for enthusiasm. 'The Chariots of the Gods' reader will enjoy the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too self-congratulatory","review":"Zubrin is a bit too self-congratulatory. The time he takes in each chapter to pat himself on the back drags down an otherwise interesting, if unrealistic, study of human space travel to Mars. All his assumptions leave little to no margin of error. Recent events have shown that accidents do happen to either expensive and/or tragic results. We're not yet to the point emotionally, economically or politically where we can be as cavalier as Zubrin's plan requires.On writing style, Zubrin manages to take an interesting subject and turn it into something dry and tedious to read. The pieces where he actually sticks to the science of Mars and of space travel, it's a quick and interesting read with informative graphics but these bits are hidden amongst long passages of minutiae relevant only to Zubrin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dated","review":"This book is really dated and somewhat overly technical.

Dr. Zubrin spends far too much time faulting NASA and trying to say why we should not do anything but go to Mars. He does make good points with his theme of \\"living off the land\\".

He knows what he's talking about. \\"The Case for Mars\\" sets out the technological, economic, and -- most intriguingly -- political reasons for expanding human civilization off this planet. Zubrin's plans for terraforming Mars into a near-earthlike climate are the part of the book that has gotten the most attention. But his political rationale for Mars settlement -- that ultimately, freedom requires a frontier and the values that a frontier cultivates -- are the most inspirational part of the book from my perspective. An absolute must-read for space, or freedom, enthusiasts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compelling","review":"In his excellent \\"The Case for Mars\\", Robert Zubrin makes a thorough, thoughtful argument about the need for the exploration of Mars. In a very well rounded, easy to read work, he lays out both the scientific and humanistic reasons for a trip to the Red Planet. While his science is excellent (he is a former Lockheed engineer), what is most compelling about this book is what Zubrin sees as the primary reason for Mars exploration: it is there. He correctly asserts that humans are at their most creative and productive when they pit themselves against a major challenge. He sees the exploration and colonization of Mars as a means of injecting the human race with fresh vitality and drive. After reading this excellent book, I'm inclined to agree."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware: Kindle version is not the new second edition","review":"The kindle edition is not the new 2011 updated second edition - it is the older 1997 first edition.Buy the paperback instead !"},{"rating":"2","title":"A new technological and philisophical vision for the future","review":"This book offers a coherent and sensible approach to the manned exploration and eventual colonization of Mars using current technologies and workable budgets. But more than that it offers a poignant phlisophical reason that this project must be undertaken now, for the good of all mankind. I found his epilogue to be one of the most profound articulations for the case for Mars that I have ever heard. As far as his science, it is technical enough for the engineer but simplistic enough for the dreamy eyed teenager. Great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm sold","review":"I'm saddened to say that in the 12 years since this book was published we are no further along to the vision set out here in these pages.We have turned our government into one which would rather micromanage our lives than set forth a vision for all of humanity.While the book is slightly technical in nature any amateur interested in space exploration can pick this book up and understand the implications...it would even be easy to skip some of the tech stuff and read the meat of the book.The authors lay out not only the benefit to society but the cost...in a detailed (nearly line-by-line) description of what a manned mission to Mars would cost if the government ran it and what it could cost on a shoestring budget.Simply a WOW factor. I'm sold."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is an absolutely incredible book.","review":"If you have any interest in Mars exploration this is the book to read. It is very readible and covers all aspects and how the exploration could be done cheaper and quicker than the NASA plans at the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book on space exploration in almost fifty years.","review":"After having read an enormous amount of astronomy/space literature for over fifty years I can safely state that Dr. Zubrin's book Mars Direct is the best popular work published since Arthur C. Clarke's monumental The Exploration of Space appeared in the early fifties. In an exceptionally convincing and lucid style Dr. Zubrin elaborates on how Mars can be explored and settled by humans using cheap contemporary off the shelf technology. Presently, humanity desperately needs a new and challenging frontier in order to escape from scientific stagnation due to ever increasing governmental bureucracy and regulations. It is my firm belief that man is destined to conquer the vastness of space and explore first our Galaxy and later most of the observable Universe. Now Dr. Zubrin has shown us how an important early step in this process can be accomplished within the next decade. - - Reynir Eyjolfsson Ph.D., Iceland."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant in its simplicity, magnificent in its scope","review":"Zubrin's Mars Direct plan offers the most realistic option for sending a manned mission to Mars. But he's not a short-term thinker; much of the book deals with his ideas of Mars colonization and the eventual terraformation of the planet. Although much of it may be overly optimistic, there are no proposals which seem impossible; everything Zubrin discusses in this could, in theory, be done. Some of the best writing within the book deals not with the technical aspects of sending a mission to Mars, but Zubrin's heartfelt reasons for WHY such a mission should be sent in the first place. I recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindle buyers beware!","review":"The cover image says it is the updated edition, but don't be fooled.The kindle version, uploaded when the new edition came out and with the same cover as the updated edition is actually the 1996 version of the book. For the subjects in this book, a lot has happened in our understanding of science and Mars in that time. This is a greatly needed (should I say overdue) update on this topic and to upload a Kindle version, this month, and charge more than the book sells for.... Bad publisher! No cookie for you.Not only that, but the audio option on Kindle has been turned off by the publisher.Very disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Case closed, we must go!","review":"An excellant account for those who feel mankind must do more to survive.

Zubrins presents a plan to go,using technology which already exists"},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't get past the language...","review":"Once again, a potential great book is full of trash. This book is about a horrid time in US History, written in different perspectives, but has an author who thinks that filth will sell a book.

Bill Bennett tackles the issues with vigor and focus and offers a fresh perspective on what Bill Clinton is about.

It is a must read for all concerned Americans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read this to set your head on straight about Clinton","review":"Once again, Mr. Bennett has astounded the masses by delivering another well written truth about morality and the culture of America, this time about Bill Clinton.

Mr. Bennett communicates his views in a professional, rational and thoughtful manner. He is a person worthy of respect and admiration. If justice prevails, we will all benefit. If justice does not, we will all suffer as we have been over this past year. An important fallacy of the Clinton crew that Mr. Bennett pointed out in this book is this - You can say you are for women in general and then treat women in particular poorly. The truth in this book is inspiring. I strongly recommend this book - especially to parents. You will feel glad to know there is someone as passionate and gifted working for our current and future collective moral health. We must assist in this endeavor.

Better men than you were mocked for feeling the pain of others.Maybe after this, you'll understand that forgiveness, tolerance, and understanding are virtues, and hypocrisy is not.Seems to me that there is more reason to burn Bennett books than smash Dixie Chicks CD's.

It is a waste of your money.","review":"In this era of narrowmindedness and conservative and reactionary clap-trap, this serves as a sterling example that if you fill a book with enough vitriol, someone will buy it. I long for a day when the two nations of the United States (The \\"right\\" wing and everybody else) will be healed. Perhaps this is just a resurfacing of an even older wound, namely the Civil War. The Republicans of the South (and elsewhere) continually defending the Confederate battle flag (note: it was only a battle flag, not the CSA national flag) and by proxy segregation and slavery. It is with bitter irony that a Republican freed the slaves, since now they are the party of the elite.This book is like all the other Clinton bashing books, high on venom, low on truth.

Bennett's shock- shock! at Clinton was revealed to be pure partisanship this weekend as he praised Bush's drunk driving and lying about it. If Bennett is going to pose as a voice of virtue, he should see the log in the eye of Republicans as well as that in the eye of Democrats. I don't know how he sleeps at night.This book is a slapdash, tediously written, utter intellectual sham, written purely with profit and politcs in mind. I can't imagine anyone enjoying it, apart from bone-deep Clinton haters and Democrats who love getting angry as Bennett lies, distorts, and prostletyzes to the choir."},{"rating":"1","title":"A better idea.","review":"Wouldn't it be a better idea to issue a hollowed out version of Bennett & Heston's book so as to afford a place to hide my Smith & Wesson 38."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simple minds are easily bemused.","review":"Methinks the self-proclaimed pillar of virtue named Bennett doth protest too much. He does casuistic cartwheels and Puritan pirouettes in order to project continuing Republican shame over Watergate onto the Clintons: a stomped-to-death tactic that does not, has not, and shall not yield another bitter grape, let alone the wine of salvation. Bennett's collage of Utopian morality, tired, glittering denials of human nature, and one self-replicating argumentum ad hominem after another speaks volumes about the hypocrisy, cynicism, and self-serving affronts to critical reason that will come to be seen as the true Reagan legacy. But why expect more of a failed \\"Drug Czar\\", who never quite succeeded in recovering from his addiction to tobacco? That anyone could take Bennett's death-knell of statesmanship and partisan harmony seriously suggests that outrage indeed is dead: The title says it all, if not quite as its author intended."},{"rating":"1","title":"A single-minded, one-sided, out-dated vendetta.","review":"Mr. Bennett cannot get over or get used to the idea that his former and probably only employer, Mr. George Walker Bush, lost the election in 1992 depriving Bennett of a job.

Our outrage lasts shorter than Bill's afterglow. And yet, for this book, some rage I'll conjecture; it ain't Mr. Bennett should give us this lecture. Both donkeys and pachyderms share in good measure, not finding the will to resist easy pleasure. Subverting the Union: now, there's some real fun! Shout it out from the rooftops, that Nixon's The One! Oh, there's lots of past history, already told, by other reviewers, both the young and the old. So let me, as well, belly up to the bar.

Hugely ironic considering he is the first author to profit from Clinton's scandal. Pure, forgettable trash."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bill Bennett says what the cable pundits ignore.","review":"I'm not a religious person so I had reservations about buying a Bill Bennett book. However after reading it I'm already ordering some of his other titles. Mr. Bennett uses the media's own quotes and headlines to explain exactly what the Clinton scandals have done to our society. Bible thumping is not included (okay but very very limited) which pleased me. My only complaint is that the book was written in the early summer of '98. If Mr. Bennett would have waited a few more months it would be interesting to note any changes. Even though it is well worth the read, for Democrats and Republicans alike."},{"rating":"1","title":"Appropriately Titled But Wrong Target","review":"The assault on American Ideals comes from the Republican Right. For years the Right has been trying to turn accusation into fact rather than the other way around - in essence making the law of the land Guilty until Proven Innocent. Next will come the public stockades. They have turned the media into a national joke; journalism into pulp fiction. As Christopher Dodd said, \\"If you get a witness who can't recall something then they must be being disingenuous. If you have a witness with conflicting testimony then someone is lying. If you get two witnesses that have consistent statements then it must be a conspiracy\\".

Given what we now know about Thomas Jefferson -- that he kept a black slave as a concubine for 30 years and lied about it -- it would appear that outrage was dead long before Bill Bennett stumbled across its bloated corpse. Bennett, of course, sheathed his outrage when his benefactor Ronald Reagan let Oliver North run wild in the White House (contravening the law of the land and the will of Congress), and when George Bush lied about his role in the Iran-Contra affair. It would be wise to remind Bennett that Dante set aside the harshest of all hellfire for the hypocrite. Have fun, Bill."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable, Reasonable restatement of Social Conservativism","review":"William Bennett provides a consise statement of the issues that are pertinent to a social conservative appraisal of the Clinton Whitehouse. The book lacks inspiration, however, and fails to ellicit the outrage it proports to deliver. The issues presented are certainly outrageous, as we all know, but we as readers hope to have our natural perceptions amplified by the sage observations of a cultural guru. This expectation is left unfulfilled. Clarification occurs, but passion is lacking."},{"rating":"1","title":"I love Bill Bennett, but this is way over the top","review":"Even though we went to the same Jesuit high school, and I would vote for him for President, this is just a little too 'holier than thou'. Come on Bill, Fr. McHale would never be so judgemental, or preachy. We've just entered a 'French phase' politically, and the latest election results show the people are way ahead of the political leadership in your party. This whole affair wouldn't get the time of day in any other country, and I can tell you from my contacts abroad that the U.S. is ridiculed not for Clinton's behavior, but for our media obsession with what my friends overseas correctly see as a personal, family problem, seperate and distinct from the governance of the Free World. Would I invite Mr. Clinton to dinner at my house? No. Would I want him to leave office over this? Also no. It's time to realize that the Puritan Morality is dead and buried. Welcome to the NEW WORLD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Many of us are repulsed by those loudly claiming to be repul","review":"What Mr. Bennett and many of the Republicans fail to realize is that many of their fellow Americans are nauseated by the many Puritan hangups concerning human sexuality from which periodic eruptions occur. The Pharisaically judgmental are more repulsive to many of us, more \\"ugly\\" than those fellow sinners who \\"fall.\\" Their self-righteous posturing is tiresome and repulsive. Preoccupation with blow jobs in the White House is unbelievable when one considers the global issues that confront us at home and \\"globally.\\" Claiming that the real issue is perjury does not dignify the discussion. What I fear is the unreality that characterizes so many of the conservatives on these issues. Thankfully, the right tends to self-destruct--I hope."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bennett's outrage is pretty hollow","review":"Bennett's \\"Death of Outrage\\" has a thesis and it is excellently presented. However, there's this little point about the author having worked proudly in the Reagan Administration, probably the most dangerous time in the Republic's history for lies and shadow governments, and refusing to recognize or at least acknowledge that the death of outrage began, not with Clinton, but his ex-boss President Reagan whose web of lies and usurping of congressional authority and laws made Richard Nixon's former activities seem trite."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought provoking analysis of Clinton's crisis.","review":"Bennett in his typical style thoughtfully summarizes and carefully probes the arguments in this heated controversy. He reminds us that there are inevitable consequences for breaking moral precepts. At times he pushes the argument too far, revealing his anger with Clinton the man. This is unneccesary, he does best when allowing the Presidents words and deeds to prove his argument. I appreciate his candor in finding the independent counsel statute flawed and find it ironic that Clinton renewed the law in 1994."},{"rating":"2","title":"Democrats will hate this book","review":"Traditional morals make liberals squirm like worms and this book will have them squawking and squirming. Some may even drop their phony liberal \\"tolerance\\" posture like reviewer Cheng Lee and reveal their bigotry against people of faith. Some of these reviews are good examples of why this book will become a bestseller. They also support my contention that those who still support a lying, perverted president are hypocritical, equivocating liberals or just plain fools. READ the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"White Trash in the White House","review":"William Bennett does a fine job explaining why Billy Clinton is the weak link in the democratic chain. Billy continues to make a mockery of the American justice system while thumbing his nose at the American public. Billy Clinton makes Nixon look like little league when it comes to White House scandal. The Republicans don't have a chance against the Democrats with Billy on their side. With the recent and ongoing sex scandal of Billy Clinton not to be confused with Billy Carter maybe he should be forced to pay the cost of the Ken Starr investigation as Newt Gingrich had to pay for the investigation against him. Of course he shouldn't be allowed to have Steven Speilberg or Barbara Streisand pay for it just as Newt had to pay from his own savings. Anyway this is a good book any good American should read from whatever side of the political fence you reside."},{"rating":"1","title":"How can Republicans be this predictable?","review":"This is yet another part of the continuing Republican propaganda assault on Clinton.

As seemingly the last person capable of 'outrage' he aims at his target Bill Clinton with Puritanical vigor. Of course one can imagine Bennett holding vast reservoirs of outrage having expended absolutely none during his years as a Reagan insider and Republican heavy. Grenada? Panama? Iraq? 'Deregulation'? Contras? Arms for hostages? What about his years as 'Drug Czar' and his connections with the nefarious DEA? Pretty selective sense of outrage if you ask me. Hypocritical? You bet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Holy Dice Rolling","review":"The only thing Im outraged about is the sheer hypocrisy of Bennett. He has written a library full of books preaching to the rest of us about the virtuous life and morality and making millions in the process. Then we find all the while he has been blowing 8 million on the roulette wheels, slots, and dice, while drinking and chasing women. It galls me even more that today he has the guts to host a daily program on some Christian radio network, along with regular appearances on the Fox News Channel.

The album was made in 1992, yet that song only started to get the attention it deserved in recent times! The rest of the album is a mix of solo tracks and duets with the funkmaster Chuck Brown. While not her greatest album, it boasts beautiful renditions of \\"You've Changed\\" and \\"Fever\\".

I have never heard of Chuck Brown either but he fits her like a glove. His vocals and piano playing remind me of Charles Brown at his more soulful. Like Blues Alley, this is a cover CD. Eva and Chuck sing some great songs from blues to jazz with a standard thrown in for good cause. Some of the songs feature horns, however it is the stripped down ballads that are the standouts. \\"You Don't Know Me\\", \\"Fever\\", and Ray Charles\\" \\"Drown in My Own Tears\\" are great. However, the price of admission is Eva's rendition of Dan Penn's \\"Dark End of the Street\\".

However, it is just as wonderful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magic","review":"Only some eighteen months ago did I hear about Eva from a young lady serving in a record store but already she is my favourite female artist. Her range is fantastic and to borrow the words from another reviewer (as I am not good at this) she has a \\"mix of aching clarity and rich warmth\\". In this particular album which is one of my very favourites she and Chuck Brown collaborate in an amazing way. They are just so amazingly excellent together and I thoroughly recommend all of the songs. Eva pounds it out but there are moments when her sensitivity and warmth also shine through. Chuck has a deep rich voice and I hope he does more of this type of work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gives you chills ~!","review":"Eva's voice is so pure and pristine .

In the additional song \\"Over the Rainbow\\", her voice soars gracefully upward into the sky with a beauty that is both dreamlike and real. Unafraid to explore different musical styles, she created a real beauty that can only come from real talent, heartbreak and hope.

If you absolutely must see this doc, rent it on Netflix."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beatle in Benton - NOT REALLY","review":"WOW...I have never been so dissapointed about a DVD purchase in my life. This film is about a big Beatles fan going around and talking to people who saw George on the street before he got big.

Do not purchase...is my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ladder Fountain is All Wet!","review":"Just remember the old adage: you get what you pay for!

Where the Aitch, Eee, double hockey sticks do I start? I've never heard of Craig Sheffer, and I count that as a good thing.

I can understand Bassinger needing to exorcize some demons, after her time with Alec Bald One, but, JEEEE-ZUSSS, did she have to take it out on us? Supposedly, she was also involved as producer, in some way.

Unfortunately, most of what happened while the She in the title of the film was out is neither. At least not for my tastes.A friend of mine that loves these sorts of films would probably beg to differ. He (husband of a former co-worker) always raves about how some slasher/thriller film is the most excellent thing he's ever seen, and I just sort of turn a deaf ear to such talk. I'd much prefer a good solid drama or laugh my rear-end off comedy instead. Even a bad comedy is normally much better than this sort of film.

(Ah LA Confidential!). Now I know why.Here name on the package is almost as big as the title.I think I expected \\"suspense\\" not \\"horror\\" and it's quite a violent film. I certainly spent no time with the Director's commentary. (That would not convince me to like this film any better.) BTW, check out the \\"rave\\" quotes on the package. Folks like LA Weekly and NY Observer, not exactly the NY Times.I sure hope Basinger goes back to making quality dramas.Steve Ramm\\"Anything Phonographic\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"better than I expected","review":"Kim Basinger has portrayed some of the most diverse roles of any actress over the last couple of decades in movies ranging from \\"My Stepmother is an Alien\\" to \\"9 1/2 Weeks\\" to \\"L.A. Confidential\\" (for which she won an Oscar). This film let's her stretch her legs (literally this time, as she has to perform quite a few action sequences herself) yet again. While she gives her usual solid performance, this isn't the best movie she's ever done. The \\"gang\\" she comes up against is really more of a group of young punks than a real gang, which explains their ineptitude when they to try to kill her for witnessing an accidental shooting they were involved in. I actually enjoyed most of this film. The only part I thought ended up being very predictable was the last few seconds of the film, when she was back at home with her husband. Overall, a good, but not great effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Kim","review":"Della is an abused wife and she's about as beaten down as a person can be. One night, she is accosted by four young hoodlums who chase her into the woods. As the brutal thugs close in on her, she finds herself fighting for her life.Kim Basinger used to be a big star and a good actress, but not this time. This is a cheaply-made, amateurish movie that uses violence and gore in place of character and dialogue, and she has no chance to shine. There aren't any surprises and it actually gets tedious waiting for the baddies to catch Della who is armed with only her trusty tool box, and manages to overcome years of abuse and emerge a strong woman in short order. Lukas Haas plays the gang leader and he's good at playing ruthless types, but his dialogue gets sillier and sillier and his last scene is nothing if not bizarre.A quickie indie movie that features repulsive characters tormenting a fragile woman; it gets old fast."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amusing Slasher Fun","review":"OK,right off the bat I gotta tell ya that Kim is still looking mighty good as she plays this untalented homemaker in an awful marriage and her fight with local punks as she struggles to return to her awful rugrats.There's lots of humor injected into the plot which is rather familiar to me after watching the past 30+ yrs of these types of movies but I did find it pretty fun and the 86 minutes went by at a decent pace while waiting for the next death.I was totally won over by the surprise ending and the great choice of ending song by Roxy Music,which I won't reveal the song choice here but it's funny.I went into this not expecting much but I found it much better than many of the movies I see and I will want to see it again somewhere down the line. (Now that I own the DVD!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"This was bad","review":"Some actors must have contracts with the studio to just act in films and fill roles no matter what the story, plot, etc. This was obviously one of those films. Kim Basinger is a great actress but even her decent acting could not save this way below par film. The story was redundant and the plot was predictable. I'll be tossing this one for sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fumbling around for a Decent Plot","review":"Kim Basinger stars and produces in \\"While She Was Out\\". She plays a suburban housewife married to an abusive jerk who needs to go out on Christmas Eve for a few last minute items. When she arrives, the mall is extremely crowded but somewhow after buying a few things and glimpsing a nighty, the mall is a ghost town when she leaves(no comment). She is harrassed by 4 moronic thugs who then murder a security guard who comes to her rescue. From there, the second half of the movie takes to the woods where the thugs chase her and shoot at her and utter some really stupid dialogue and curse a lot.Basinger's performance is fine and there is a little bit of suspense in the woods but there's not much else going for it. The other characters are silly and asinine. It reminds me a little of \\"Blair Witch Project\\" with a lot of the time spent in the woods in the dark fumbling around for a plot. 2 stars is as high as I could give this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"hmmm. . .maybe not","review":"Unfortunately, this turned out to be less than what i had hoped. I *loved* Kim Basinger in LA Confidential, so thought I'd give this a whirl. Unfortunately, for the most part, this movie is your typical woman witnesses crime and baddies hunt her down and try to get her. I like more psychological thrillers that are more cat-and-mouse, one opponent cleverly outsmarting the other type movies. This movie wasn't that. And aside from Ms. Basinger, who was good, and one scene by Lukas Haas, the acting(or perhaps it was the script?) was not very good. All those problems aside, the movie does have one excellent scene between Basinger and Haas, and a better ending than I would have expected."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never Leave Nasty Notes","review":"Kim Basinger was a great Hollywood beauty and talented actress. In this film she plays an abused wife who becomes a victim of young thugs--inciting them by leaving a nasty note beneath their car's window wipers. They intend to gang rape her and then kill her and the movie is about how she handles this situation.As others have noted, the plot was predictable and it is indeed sad to watch such a talented actress (and still attractive woman) reduced to such roles. One can only wonder if the personal abuse she suffered in her well-publicized bitter marriage motivated her to accept this role and act out abused victim-turned-revenged."},{"rating":"1","title":"Must be seen","review":"55 yr old kim basinger being chased by \\"bad ass\\" lukas haas and his cronies thru the woods. she ambushes them all rambo-style plunging tire irons thru their eyeballs, a giant knitting needle thru the eardrum, etc. then she has sex with haas at the end after the others are dead, only to pull out a flare and try to shove it in his mouth. it is absolutely hysterical. boy Alec mustve really destroyed her self esteem for her to be in this crap.Some of the things you will learn from watching this movie...1. even lukas haas seems imposing when hes flanked by 2 puerto ricans and a black.2. if youre a hot chick and the killer is about to shoot you.....diffuse the whole situation by having sex with him.3. even 55 yr old kim basinger can outrun 4 young thugs while carrying a toolbox"},{"rating":"1","title":"NO SUBTITLES","review":"THIS BLUE RAY DISC HAS NO SUBTITLES, THE FIRST ONE THAT I HAVE ENCOUNTERED THAT DID NOT.

Why?","review":"Kim Basinger is an Academy-Award winning actress! I can't believe she was in this movie. OK, it wasn't as terrible as you may think and her character isn't horrible - but the plot is just dumb. Basically, this abused housewife goes to get wrapping paper at a mall during Christmas time - takes a parking place and is then followed and tortured for an hour by a group of thugs. I don't know if it was a metaphor for how she felt in her life (being abused by her husband and getting to fight back finally...) I couldn't understand why Basinger chose to do this! It didn't even seem like a really good \\"acting\\" piece. Maybe she just wanted to do a thriller, who knows. I wouldn't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the weakest \\"revenge\\" thrillers of all time","review":"Do the people who made \\"While She was Out\\" even watch movies? If they did, they'd know that revenge films require two things: villains who commit reprehensible acts, and a lead character who violently turns the tables. Anyone excited by the prospect of seeing a good actor like Kim Basinger in a modern-day exploitation flick along the lines of \\"Ms .45\\" can keep looking, because \\"While She Was Out\\" is neither thrilling nor satisfying. At no point did I find the gang terrorizing her to be at all frightening or intimidating, and the film left me waiting anxiously for Kim to open up that red toolbox and start taking these guys apart. Credits rolled, and nothing. The DVD art is incredible, throwing out a \\"Hard Candy\\" type of vibe that the film never comes close to delivering."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same old, same old...","review":"\\"While She Was Out\\" is a predictable spin on the vigilante thriller. Della (Kim Basinger) lives in a gated community and is a devoted mom married to an abusive, former jock (Craig Sheffer). She has the appearance of a delicate -- even fragile -- creature, incapable of inflicting harm on others. But that changes after she is accosted by a gang of thugs while doing some last-minute Christmas shopping. Their leader, Chuckie (Lukas Haas), is clearly a sociopath itching to cause some serious pain. The lone Della must defend herself for her very survival as she improvises defenses with garage tools and ingenuity. Basinger is good and elicits a degree of sympathy, but when things start looking awfully familiar, that sympathy dissipates. The film is rated R.Bonus extras include audio commentary with writer/director Susan Montford, a making-of featurette, and theatrical trailer."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't even waste your time","review":"I like Kim Basinger, but this movie? I'm sorry. The story doesn't really make sense, the message are totally wrong and dark. The acting is so so.... the thriller is even lamer than you could imagine. It's so predictable and what's the point of this movie again? thriller? moral message? I can't find anything interesting in this movie (which I kept hoping that it will come soon ).

Sharrock's first employer Pharoah Sanders and Coltrane drummer Elvin Jones place this album firmly in the tradition of the later Coltrane sound. Sharrock's compositions are accessible, yet sufficiently open for deep improvisation. Bill Laswell's production effectively captures Sharrock's (and Jones') HUGE sound, which could make most jazz producers faint. And unlike other Laswell-produced Sharrock albums, this one is pure jazz, without the heavy metal bombast or avante-garde remoteness of his other work.Few modern jazz albums succeed so well in that combination of depth and accessibility that make for the finest jazz.

Trane died in 1966, and since then some of his best extrapolators have been guitarists, not saxophonists. But here in one dramatic session we have Sonny Sharrock, who plays guitar like Coltrane played the sax in his late years; Pharoah Sanders, who really played in Coltrane's last bands, and always plays like he's falling off a mountain; and Elvin Jones, whose drum work anchored the classic Coltrane quartets of '60-'65. Sharrock wrote the tunes, which are surprisingly catchy like rock anthems (I kept thinking of Santana) but then the improv goes berserk in the best possible way. Jones and young bassist Charnette Moffett supply the driving rhythm behind this hyper-energy, magical event."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grating and harsh, beautiful harmony, chaos and calmness","review":"This is a great jazz album...not for everyone though. First off, the fact that Pharoah Sanders plays on this one should clue you in that there will be violent, chaotic bursts of sound...not for everyone's musical taste. Sharrock also plays a whirlwind of notes, sometimes in a violently pointless manner.

Listen closely during his solo, he growls along with his kit. All 4 meet back at the theme while Sanders thrashes and groans. Bass and drums signal the fade-out.

It's new one, maybe opened once or twice but you will never notice it! Great product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Complete Chi-Lites","review":"I did not know the Chi-Lites made so many songs! This 2 CD set is just what it says \\"Complete Chi-Lites on Brunswick Records\\". They were also on the Mercury record label. The Brunswick collection is Vol 1 with 24 songs on disc one and 17 songs on disc two. It has every hit that I know of from back in the day. The hits are scattered throughout the collection so you can't play them all in a row on disc two but disc one has four hits in row at the end. To sum it up you get the hits and more. This is a good collectors CD. What will they do for Vol 2 ?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love It!","review":"I love my Vitalizer Plus! I love to drink the fresh and oxygen water.

I watched the movie first and as a result I wanted to be sympathetic to Mr Panzram. After reading the book, i did change my opinion about the man. Although the book tries to blame the justice system for his actions, his own words give you insight into a mind that is self absorbed and feels that the rules of society only apply to others but not to him. I didn't give the book 5 stars only because the authors don't blame Panzram for his own actions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay away from this book","review":"Stay away from this book.

Panzram is frightening and fascinating. Despite the horrors inflicted by him, the reader cannot help but feel some sympathy for the monster and anger at the society that produced him."},{"rating":"2","title":"A big surprise","review":"I really had no expectation when I opened this book, but was very surprised by what I read. Panzram, while being a remorseless killer, was obviously very in tune with himself and the world around him and by the end I was almost rooting for the Feds to not execute him.Really well written book and if you want something that will give you an insight into a killers mind this is a great one to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Delivery","review":"This product is from Shakers & Thangs.The product was great; more than what I had hoped for.However, the delivery time was extremely long.

It will take a long,long,long time to get your merchandise. I will never order from Shakers & Thangs again. Terrible service!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pierre Cardin Women's Diamond Collection Diamond Accented Watch","review":"I decided to buy this watch after I read the reviews and the overall rating.When I received the watch I was very disappointed to see that the words Pierre Cardin on the top and Diamond on the bottom were not written in straight line (as they appear in the photo, i.e., parallel to the upper and lower sides of the rectangular frame) but instead they were going upwards (kind of diagonally).The diamonds are really tiny as it was mentioned in other reviews and the watch does look substantial in terms of weight. Another drawback is its clasp. It is really very hard to open and close.However, the diagonally written \\"Pierre Cardin\\" and \\"Diamond\\" words, makes the watch not wearable since it is very visible, plus it raises questions on its authenticity."},{"rating":"2","title":"a classic evaluation of the paranormal in trustworthy style","review":"Charles Tart, with a strong academic background (electrial engineering, psychology) has been diving into the depths of the paranormal many years.

It is for those who want to carefully look at all possible explanations in their search for the truth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Performance","review":"This unit performs well in the \\"Copy VHS to DVD\\" function, VCR and DVD playback and the DVD recording function. The picture (from both sources) looks sharp and clear on my Samsung 56\\" 1080p DLP set.The VCR FF/RW functions are quick if not a little noisey. It really is a \\"Feature Packed\\" unit but the owners manual is a bit convoluted and takes a little study in order to properly understand the flow of information, i.e. the unit does a good job at editing DVD's once you find the procedure in the book.All in all, this unit far surpasses the performances of any other unit in it's price range that we have researched."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dead in 6 months","review":"DVD drive stopped working after 6 months. Numerous reset attempts did not fix the problem. Drive makes a clunking noise, fails to read any discs, and still gives me \\"NoREAD\\" errors even when the tray is empty. This is the second Panasonic product I've recently had stop working so unless their customer service people are willing to bend over backwards, I'll be spending my money elsewhere forever."},{"rating":"1","title":"believe the other reviews","review":"I read cautionary tales about this product and ignored them. Not only was it difficult (cumbersome) to use, but it is already busted after a couple of months. It was hyper sensitive. I am very disappointed b/c my whole goal was to take family vhs tapes and turn them into digital discs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would not Recommend this product","review":"I would not recommend this product to anyone. It does not create DVDs that are compatible with any other machine unless finalized. And it has an extremely high error rate which most likely will prevent you from finalizing your disks, making them good only for playback on the existing machine (half the time). The other half of the time, the error erases everything on the disk. So if you are taping your favorite weekly shows on the same DVD, by the time you get to the last recording, it can give you a U88 which will either wipe out everything you recorded on the disk up to that point or make it so it cannot be finalized and cannot be played back on any other machine.I am sure there are better DVD units out there and I hope I get one the second time around. This one was not worth the money I paid for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointing!!! :-(","review":"We brought this item because we wanted a dvd recorder/vcr combo to record from the vcr to dvd. And it is the worst. it freezes up all the time. wheather your trying to watch something you've recorder or a regular rental movie. Or it will take the movie and when you are finish it won't open to get the movie out. when you record something sometimes it plays on other dvd players and sometimes it doesn't. You never know what will play on other DVD player. it's so poorly made. it's not even worth it. it's better to pay a few extra bulks and get something that's actually works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldnt make it go for long","review":"Hookup was a breeze.. I used a Cable splitter so I could bypass the unit when watching TV - My Sony TV has a better tuner.The unit played well with a fantastic picture with both VHS and a phenominal DVD image.. near HD on my regual set.It recorded well with only a slight loss in quality to bot DVD and VHS.The manual was a little confusing since there is So Much gadgetry this thing can do..I sat down to read it until I understood what it said FIRST, before getting frustrated.Once I had that down it's a very sweet unit for the price.HOWEVER, and thats a big HOWEVER - First try at transferring vhs to DVD TOASTED the laser and I had to return it for exchange.It was very nice of Panasonic to put in a error message that said\\" U61(power interupted) Self check failed, refer to service\\"Thats the best thing when a unit quits..a message that states don't even bother to fiddle with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"ATE MY VHS TAPE","review":"The first time I went to use this I put in a VHS tape to dub to dvd.Discovered the entire left side of the machine did not work and remote had no eject button. I called panasonic but everything they suggested involved hitting buttons on the nonfunctioning left side. They finally said I should take it to their repair shop 30 miles from my house. FORTUNATELY I had put in a tape with stuff I didn't care alot about- I'm just gonna return the dmr.My advise: any time you buy a new dvd player, recorder, or vhs put in a disc, or tape you don't care about when you are first trying it.By the way, I have no idea if any other parts worked/ or didn't work: I repacked it up immediately."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor longevity","review":"I've had this recorder for several years. It has performed well during that time, however, it has suddenly stopped responding to the remote. I replaced the batteries on the remote several times with no results. I bought a universal remote and managed to get every piece of electronics I own to respond to it except this one. This thing cannot perform the majority of its functions without the remote. I can't even select the second chapter of a DVD without the remote, so even playback options are severely compromised. I'm being told that I have to ship the item to Texas to be repaired as it is outside its warranty period. How convenient for me. If I liked Panasonic before, I like them a lot less now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rubbish","review":"This machine will not accept ANY form of DVD disc. The VCR image is divided. Consequently no evaluation of the its' claimed capabilities has been possible. I have tried to get some sort of history from the vendor,to assist in a necessary repair, but he is singularly unhelpful, pointing out that if I want the advantage of the replacement service, I most move to the USA."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of crap","review":"Was formatting a disk yesterday to record the UH vs Boise game, the machine completely freezes up.

Chandranandan, is the most beautiful of all three tracks, which begins slowly and delicately, gently working its way towards an amazing culmination where melody and rhythm flow together seamlessly into an astounding and frenetic conclusion - an ending reminiscent of the startling beauty of a full moon night, to which the title owes its name. If there is one CD in the world you'll ever own, it should be this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very serious Hindustani classical music.","review":"Definitely four or five star.

Another CD that I would recommend is Ragas Ravi Shankar, Ali Akbar Khan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"Just another Anti-Confederate liberal college professor who has as grudge against anything Confederate. His verbal wars with the Sons of Confederate Veterans in Arkansas evidently predicated this book. As the author of a regimental history of a Federal Regiment and a Federal Reenactor, he has collected some essays from other liberal or pro black, pro Federal \\"authors and/or historians\\" to advance his agenda of Racist Confederate Troops massacring Black Federal Soldiers and Civilian.When you look at 19th Century History through 21st Century eyes and attempt to judge just to advance your own political agenda you are doing a disservice to your readers. His description of anyone Pro-Confederate or Pro-Southern as \\"Neo-Confederate\\" is proof enough for me. I guess this is a new term now used to identify someone who is proud of their Southern and Confederate Herigtate and makes no excuses for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Easy To Read Book on Basics of Meal Management","review":"Simplicity of the style has impressed me the most about this book. Although a thirteen years old book is considered to be a relic in today's electronic age but I am finding it hard to replace this book as a text in my Introductory Meal Management course.

The koalas scream or cry for their mothers. Anyway I had the first one, and it is completely boring compared to this, you can not even compare them. Night and Day!

Some of the animals you can chose from are giraffes, rhinos, wolves, wild dogs, pandas, komodo dragons, crocodiles, horses, gazelles, zebras and wild cats like lions. In the game you can put soda, burger and other food stands. You can also have gift shops and playground equipment like slides and jungle gyms. There are also jeep vehicle stations that your guest and you can ride in! Your guest can get upset if it smells or an animal is upset so you need to keep your guest happy. Your zoo can get up to five stars. There are three modes. In one mode you have to use money and you have to earn the animals in your zoo by getting stars and earthquakes can hit your zoo. In the other mode you have all the animals and don't need to use money or have earthquakes. The other mode has tutorials and scenarios. I love the Zoo Tycoon 2 series and have Marine Mania and Extinct Animals expansion packs."},{"rating":"2","title":"He LOVES it!","review":"My husband and I bought this game for my 8-yr-old stepson for Christmas. He is an animal lover and wants to be a zookeeper when he grows up. He has spent hours on this game, building his zoo, taking care of the animals, learning lots of interesting facts. It's just challenging enough that it keeps him very involved, not too hard that he gets frustrated. I'd highly recommend this game for your little animal lover!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Biased Hack \\"Journalist\\"","review":"This guy is absolutely outrageous. He seems to just write things to create controversy, thereby increasing publicity on himself. His articles are pretty much merit less given the fact that he knows the subjects/players that he writes about as well as he knows a salad.

If you like WASTING YOUR MONEY, or just throwing it out the window cause you like feeling deprived, angry and fooled, please go ahead and BUY THIS BOOK! If you believe in quality journalism, writers who put in effort and research into and actually believe in their work, don't walk but RUN FROM this book, you'll thank me when you spend the 25 bucks on something more useful like toilet paper . . . actually, I wonder if you rip out the pages of this book and use them as TP, will they increase in value? Because I know they surely can't depreciate anymore.This is sensationalism journalism at its worst (best?). If the only way you can pull in viewers is by degrading a hard working athlete, or talking trash about a team, then you really need to re-evaluate your life goals and especially career because you just can't cut it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whitlock's writing is painfully horrible...","review":"The author knows nothing about what he writes about and he is part of today's \\"shock\\" journalism - making bad reporting even worse, and mis-leading the public. He doesn't do research, he expounds on points that are questionable without offering a counterpoint to rationalize his arguments.In my opinion, and obviously others, Whitlock is the best example of why I wish we DIDN'T have free speech in America. Maybe it should be free speech for everyone that's not a babbling idiot - lucky for us, Whitlock wouldn't make the cut."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've seen more intelligent writing on a bathroom wall.","review":"For some reason, the musings of Jason Whitlock always remind me that I need to take a dump. I don't think Whitlock could take the pressure of writing a major book. Jason thinks that writing a column for ESPN is pressure. Does he not remember what happened to Larry Brown after he got all of those interceptions in the super bowl? No that does not make any sense, but neither does he."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who \\"Loves Him\\"!?!?!","review":"I'm getting 2 copies -- one to crap on and the other to cover it up with.This book shows how little Jason Whitlock knows about sports, or anything, for that matter. Whitlock is incapable of providing a shred of sports analysis or even a mildly objective opinion. His writing is vapid, his style is obnoxious and every week he tries to hitch his wagon to some rising star or else do a hachet job two weeks after the rest of the press has finished.Whitlock's infamous minute-to-minute flip-flops on pro athletes indicate that, somehow, he has even less loyalty than he does sense. Whitlock's lunacy is masked by scatter-brained prose that not only makes your eyes hurt, it mercifully forces the reader put down the book before any of the stupidity sinks in.Jason Whitlock couldn't be trusted to write his own nametag, much less a book, and this disaster proves it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe his mom","review":"...loves him, but his \\"journalism\\" is sheer drivel.

Don't waste your money on this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ball State's journalism department is shamed by this alumnus.","review":"Jason Whitlock epitomizes all that is wrong with journalism today. Bereft of research and any contact with reality, Whitlock's work consists of fantasy fiction calculated to shock. Jason never goes to the trouble of actually interviewing sports figures before baselessly and erroneously attacking them. His work lacks the quaility to even be included in tabloids (which does make it perfect for espn.com, I suppose).This book is a repulsive compendium of the author's arrogant egoism and compulsive prevarications. It is unworthy of having been published in hard back.Do not waste your money on this trash."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Music, could be more fully developed.","review":"The music on this CD is clearly first-rate. I particularly enjoy the tabla play of the late Pandit Mahapurush Misra. He's a top rate virtuoso with an impeccable sense of rythmn and melody. In fact, his play adds wonders to the overall melody of the music. My one complaint with Signature Series in general is that each rag has a running time of about 30 min. Perphaps this allows more CDs to be sold by not \\"overwhelming\\" the listener with too much at one time, but i think this doesnt allow for a full treatment of the ragas. For this reason, I can't say this is among the very best of classical indian music, but certainly it is worth getting nevertheless. It probably would also serve as an excellent intro to classical indian music, as a more extended presentation could very well \\"overwhelm\\" many new listeners."},{"rating":"2","title":"A work of genius!","review":"Let me begin by saying that I am a new-comer to the genre, and that most of the music I usually listen to is classic rock and blues. Nevertheless, this CD has completely captivated me. It is soaring, sublime, beautiful music. Even in my ignorance it is clear that the performance is genius. It has opened-up a whole new world of music for me. The CD is a precious jewel."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Powerful Tribute to Disciple and Guru","review":"Towards the end of his life Pandit Nikhil Banerjee had decided that he wished to spend the rest of his life following and learning from his beloved teacher, Ustad Ali Akbar Khan -- hailed by Yehudi Menuin as the greatest living musician on earth. Revealed by the beauty and spontenaeity of this CD's ragas -- where quite clearly Khansahib's sarode leads Banerjee's sitar without impinging on any of the student's own creative genius -- is the true depth of Banerjee's and Khansahib's spiritual and musical connection. The emotion evident in both exquisite tracks is even more poignant given Banerjee's untimely death in 1986 at the age of 55. His loss has left a void in Hindustani classical music that has yet to be filled. Khansahib, thankfully, continues to this day to create the same magic he did on that blessed day in the 1960s when this recording was made."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I Expected","review":"Just like previous posters, I usually use water based lubricants because they are safe to use with the flesh light. I purchased KY Intrigue thinking that all of KY's products were water based and unfortunately I was wrong. It takes more lubricant to achieve the same effect as the water based blends that KY uses. After several applications I still experienced friction as if I did not use any lube at all. I recommend to stick to water based lubricants."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money!","review":"Save your money and pass on this lubricant. It doesn't work with or without a condom. It's expensive and pretty much useless -- free saliva work better. It's sticky and doesn't glide well. I'm sure it would be worthless with toys as well, but I didn't try. It is hard to wash off afterwards as well. Pass on this and try something else, there are plenty of better lubes for less money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good silicon based lube","review":"I got this from Amazon on the subscribe service and save a bundle this way over retail drug stores. This is a smooth, but not overly slick lube. It can be difficult to wash off, but using shampoo can do it or just leaves your skin a little softened if you leave it on. Overall, it does the trick and holds up plenty long enough. Just be careful because with all silicon based lubricants, it will permanently stain sheets making it look like a permanent wet spot. Go with a darker color sheet or consider using a towel to protect the sheet. The water-based lubes are more slick and don't last as long requiring a reapplication, just depending on your endurance!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Slippery when wet ; )","review":"Great product.

Not everyone talks this way, so why do writers have to give the same voice to every character. I picked up this book a week ago because it's about my area and have yet to finish it. It seems the only books on the market these days are about preverts, mass murderers, physcos and whatnot. Everyone has a gun, everyone is hip, everyone is a lawyer driving expensive cars, and into golf. I am so upset. Where are the Dickens and Twain's of this age?

Call me disapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you're a die-hard Lucas Davenport fan, Anna Batory pales!","review":"The main problem I had with Anna Batory is that I did not especially like her. The concept of Sandford's heroine being in charge of a \\"night crew\\" which is a group of freelancers roaming the city in search of a story to sell, at any cost, with absolutely no moral sense of right or wrong in relationship to those personally impacted, does not suggest role model main character material to me. I want a hero I can, in my fantasy, hope to emulate. Anna does not make the grade. Therefore, it is truly fitting that she does not get her man in the end who represents everything she is not!

When I say \\"different\\", I mostly mean \\"worse.\\" Not only is it an arduous read, but character development (which Sandford excels at with Lucas \\"Prey Series\\" Davenport) is weak and inconsistent.

Teamed up with one of the best homicide cops, she is searching for the truth in a web tangled with lies. The story is choppy in some parts, but the suspense is definitely there. I recommend this book to anyone looking for the suspense ride of their life. I am looking forward to reading other John Sandford books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuk- Rate Zero","review":"This story was so terrible it made me mad. I don't know why I didn't return it for an old book I really wanted \\"From Here to Eternity\\". I've turned in less bad books. The charcters were wooden and Creek was someone I'd never want to really meet. I guess he was slated to be some hunk lover dude but he's more like a dud. And then this Glass character who started out to be a tough chick cop ends up by Creek's bed side knitting (cucumber covers?) of all things. And Anna, the main character who gets beat up and is still able to hobble around has gotta be tougher than Zina or whatever that woman is that comes on Saturday nights. Near the end I just sped read to get through the crap. I bet the writer did this to make a fast buck, and I will NEVER read any of his other books. He must've had silver screen in his mind as we wrote this trash. Don't waste your time reading this junk, Huck Finn will make you so much happier!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Did John Sandford Really Write This?","review":"After reading this , I'm convinced some guy who has it in for the real John Sandford somehow got this book published under his name. It seems almost impossible that the same author who turns out the great \\"Prey\\" series could also be responsible for this. Weak , unexplored characters, a uninvolving plot and a \\"who cares?\\" resolution makes this the worst book I've read in awhile. I can understand how an author can get sick of writing the same characters over and over and want to try something new, but this entry was just a wasted effort. I don't mean to sound so brutal, but I can't fathom how someone can write such consistently excellent books like the \\"Prey \\" novels and then turn around and write something so terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth the time","review":"An interesting start, but fades quickly. Plot is very disjointed and several characters are never developed or developed very poorly. I read the entire \\"Prey\\" series before this book, and highly recommend those stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok, but not great","review":"The book was pretty good (not as good as the prey novels, or even the Kidd novels) up till the end, it has no closure for the characters, unless he plans to make another, i know there was a big gap between the Kidd novels. It wasnt written as well as the prey novels, and the characters werent as strong."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't wait to put it down...","review":"...literally. This is one of three books in my entire life that I have just given up on. I got about halfway through and still found no likable characters or anything holding my interest, so I quit reading. I've always enjoyed the Prey series, and was actually looking forward to reading this because I wanted to see how John Sandford would do without Lucas Davenport to fall back on. Now I know. I could not have been more disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Out of control woman chases false leads to bizarre ending.","review":"I found Night Crew to be far below the level of all the Prey books by Sandford. What plot there was went in so many directions, I, as an accomplished reader, needed a road map. It's not very often I have to go back and re-read pages to stick with a story. Having characters with similar names: Jake, Jacob, Jason led to confusion as to whom was alive, dead, or waiting to be heard from. Speaking of characters: Please find me any person that could possibly take the physical assaults Anna received and continue on to \\"solve\\" this chaotic \\"thriller\\". Even V.I. or Kinsey would have been hardpressed to handle all this violence. Developing a more in-depth study of Anna's relationships with other characters would have helped to give better insight into Anna as a person. A film crew at night chasing news stories has a lot of potential. Kooky characters and violent events can still be used. Just keep it believable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good author. realistic","review":"You always look forward to turning the page. I never want to stop and mark the spot for later reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"A real letdown","review":"John Sandford really misses the boat on his latest novel. Although he continues his masterful writing and development of his characters, the plot of The Night Crew leaves a lot to be desired. I can remember rushing to get each of his books in the Prey series as they came out. But I really struggled to finish this one. I guess I am spoiled by the sheer genius of his previous works"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Many Loose Ends....","review":"This is totally a mediocre stuff from John Sandford...the story begins with a suicide jump and the video crew picturising it,this is followed by some more killings,some more false leads and what not.If John sandford thinks that he has kept the readers on the edge of their seats through out the book then he is totally wrong.When you come to the ending and find out who the killer is then you realise that almost three-fourths of the book does not lead you anywhere.There are so many loose ends and i could not find any connection between the suicide jump and the killer.Did the killer murder him or did he commit suicide..well who cares.I think John sandford should stick to Lucas Davenport character and his prey series ....avoid this book at any cost."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment","review":"After reading several of the \\"Prey\\" series, I expected the same quality when I began this book. I was very disappointed. While some of the writing was good and parts of the plot were interesting, I thought the book as a whole was disjointed and at times it seemed as though Sandford didn't know where he wanted to go with it so he just filled in with a bunch of fluff until he got around to the plot again. I found the character of Jake especially unbelievable. Imagine losing your only son to a drug induced suicide and then two days later making jokes and romancing someone you hardly know. The ending was especially pointless and disappointing. I would recommend any of the \\"Prey\\" series, but definitely not this turkey."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!","review":"I am usually a big fan of John Sandford, but I was very disappointed with Night Shift. I found the story full of loose ends and very unrealistic. When Jake's son dies by jumping off a building, all he can think about is trying to romance Anna. The plot constantly changed course making the book even less interesting. Usually, I can't put John Sandford's books down, but this time I could not wait to be done with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This night crew went nowhere","review":"This is a very pretentious and unrealistic book; not only on plot but even the printing is very artificial. I found that the jumbo letterings were very bothering for my reading. And this book should be condensed at least 1/3 on pages consumption. Another trick of the publisher's to push higher price for a thicker book. The whole story is such a bore and disappointment. You just could not watch some tabloid TV programs to get a novel done, Mr. Sanford, you should have some realistic night-crewing street exeperience. You got same problem as your PREY hero, a detective driving a Porche? Give me a break, it could only have happened in Eddie Murchy's \\"Beverly Hill Cop\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"BIG Disappointment....","review":"I loved The Night Crew until I got 3/4 of the way through it. Sure some parts were kinda unbelievable (Jake barely grieving for his son; Pam just camping out at Creek's beside) but I put those things aside because I was thinking, \\"Boy, this is building to an AWESOME climax! Is the killer Jake or Creek or someone else?\\" I couldn't wait to find out. When I actually did find out, I was so angry that I could barely finish the book. I found out and didn't even care! It was just, for lack of a better literary term--stupid. Don't bother with this book. It took 4 hours out of my life that I'll never get back. Don't let the same happen to you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the John Sandford to start with","review":"Fortunately, this was not the first John Sandford novel I've read. Had it been, I probably would never have discovered the delights of Sandford's \\"Prey\\" series, which is far more accomplished and enthralling.\\"Night Crew\\" is about Anna Bantory who runs a free-lance TV crew that roams Los Angeles at night, gathering footage they hope to sell to television stations. One night, they tape a raid by animal activists. Coincidentally a call comes in that someone is on a hotel window ledge and may jump. Anna's crew records the jump.Hours later, someone murders a member of Anna's crew and off we go into the pursuit of a crazed killer who is obsessed with Anna.Ho-hum. The characters are thin, the plot contrived and the novel interminable. It's not a total waste of time, but there are many other cop-novels out there that are far more enjoyable, including Sandford's own \\"Prey\\" series, which I highly recommend.Jerry"},{"rating":"1","title":"TALK ABOUT A STRANGE ENDING....","review":"John Sandford is obviously a prolific and talented writer, as evidenced by the success of his Lucas Davenport \\"Prey\\" series. However, with \\"The Night Crew,\\" I have to wonder why all the hoopla? Granted, this book has a very interesting and unusual premise---following a bunch of \\"reporters\\" who film unusual or bizarre accidents/murders/arsons, as they occur. The main character, Anna, is sympathetic and you can relate to her, in some ways. The book's best character, Jake, the ex-cop, is also quite different and interesting.Alas, however; the plot gets so confusing and the identity of the murder is so \\"convenient,\\" yet unexplained. The ending, both in regards to what occurs with Anna and Jake's relationship, and Creek's strange visit to Anna's ex-boyfriend, is just frustrating. No closure!Now, if Sandford intends a series, this ending might work, but if he doesn't, he's robbed the reader of the all-important resolution of vital closure. A real disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievable! ... and I mean that literally","review":"I too am a fan of \\"The Prey Series\\" and can't believe this book is by the same author. There were so many things that were unbelievable and stupid in this book that you will just start shaking your head. I would have to say at the top of my list is that the main character lets a man she has met once move in with her to protect her... come on. I'll let you guess what happens next. The climax was anticlimactic as a three year old child could see through the so called \\"trap\\" the villian fell into. If you want true enjoyment in a novel BAINE KERR'S HARMFUL INTENT is the best courtroom thriller I've ever read, buy that not this garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing and disappointing","review":"I read \\"The Night Crew\\" while waiting for the latest Prey novel to come out in paperback. If this is any indication of his non-Lucas material, I won't be in a hurry to check out his Kidd series.Normally, I think Sandford is a great storyteller who writes with clarity. This book is just sloppy. I had a very hard time figuring out what was happening and why.Also, none of the characters or their relationships really ring true, except for Anna's platonic relationship with her second-in-command of sorts, Creek.It's a quick read, and it's not totally horrid, but I would recommend it only as a last resort if you're the type that absolutely has to have something to read and this is all you can find."},{"rating":"1","title":"WAY Too Obvious!","review":"I LOVE mysteries and I am a fan of Sanford's \\"Prey\\" books but this was a pile of junk! I'm the type of person who doesn't try to guess \\"whodunnit\\" throughout the book - I just get swept away. Well, I didn't have to guess - the answer was so obvious the suspense was non-existent. I never have any idea who the killer is and I knew this one on about page 60! I'm just mad I finished the entire book to find out I was right all along..."},{"rating":"1","title":"loser","review":"There may have been sillier books written, but not by John Sanford.Go for the Prey series, yes they are by the same author but you willnever know or suspect it, prey tell."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anna Batory deseerves a sequel","review":"I have not read anything else by this author but definately will. This book was very enjoyable and kept my interest through the entire reading. Anna Batory deserves a sequel. She is a great heroine. Reading this book, I was wondering who would play her in a movie version of this story. The only thing I would change about this book...It could have ended about 2 pages sooner."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Night Screw","review":"Sandford's \\"Prey\\" series are all good to great thrillers. \\"The Night Crew\\" is garbage. He's written this totally politically correct novel(i.e. a super strong woman, weak guy as a love interest) hoping to interest a Hollywood leading lady into pushing the book into a script and a movie.(My opinion, of course). The book is implausable to the max. Enjoy the others in the \\"Prey\\" series, but skip this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT - BUT STILL A LET-DOWN","review":"The first Celtic Thunder DVD is my favorite live performance video, so I knew it would be hard for them to match it. The new show - Take Me Home -has 29 songs, but unfortunately only 10 are new. I think the song Take Me Home is awesome, and Ryan really excells on Every Breath You Take, and George's I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles) is fantastic. Their renditions of Danny Boy & You Raise Me Up are excellent, but I much prefer the way Celtic Woman does them. Of the 19 repeats, Steal Away is different but still beautiful. Damian is older now and his voice has deepened, but he is still amazing. The whole show seemed to be lacking the excitement of the first show, and I missed Phil Coulter & the orchestra. This seemed like an attempt to cash-in on their popularity without offering much that's new. But even so, I am glad I bought this DVD because the 10 new songs are worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome","review":"i love Irish music And these guys have it all well worth buying and watching over and over againfantastic"},{"rating":"2","title":"CELTIC THUNDER - A MUST HAVE!!","review":"GREAT MUSIC!

This DVD is terrible. Although slightly entertaining, it did not look or sound as though it were professionally done. The audio was monotone - no volume change in singing emotions. This made the entire show boring to watch. Keith has a southern drawl in his sound and really is not as \\"hot\\" as he thinks he is. Teeny bopper songs were OK for Damian a couple of years ago but he's a little too big for the \\"Cutesy\\" songs all the time, not to mention that his voice is getting too deep for it all. The follow-up DVD, \\"It's Entertainment\\", is a little better. It is more of a variety show setting, but the audio is still pretty much the same volume throughout. Losing the emotional feeling of the songs in the audio makes this DVD a total waste."},{"rating":"2","title":"Celtic Thunder - Irish singers","review":"If you have not yet discovered the men of Celtic Thunder then here is your chance to see them and hear them.

I have accepted Keith, Damian and Ryan as my personal favourites but I really do enjoy each and every one of them.Do yourself a favour and buy this album for many hours of pleasurable viewing.I hope they produce more DVDs so I may add them to my collection.

The guys are terrific singers and entertainers and the look of this DVD was so awful, I could barely stand to watch it. Nothing new really except 2 songs by Damian and the band was also great, as usual. Whoever threw this one together made a lemon this time. The guys and their whole production crew (orchestra, musicians) as well as their fans deserve better! I wish I had purchased the CD this time.

I would reccommend the first dvd NOT this this one.

However, I wouldn't classify this novel as stirctly gay fiction. There are heterosexual main characters and they are involved in a couple of subplots. The novel is interesting for two reasons: First of all, it explores the very close relationship between a gay man and his straight female best friend. The closeness of their relationship creates problems both for Sam's current partner and his female friend's husband. The book is also interesting because in spite of the early publishing date (1959), the protagonist is presented in a positive light. He loves his career, is intelligent and has a good sense of moral values and he wants a lasting relationship with another man rather than an empty promiscuous life. It is refreshing to see this in a book published in 1959. As far as the writing goes, it's not great literature, but still is an entertaining read."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is Junk","review":"While Howard's \\"Secrets of\\" videos are probably the best DVD learning tools available today, this 2 DVD set is worthless.

These episodes are some of the best in Dragon Ball Z. The battle between Gohan and Cell appears to be nearing its end as Gohan has finally awakened his hidden power, but the power may be going to Gohan's head. This arrogance will cause a sacrifice to be made by the man who has saved the earth many times before. When Cell finally appears to be dead, he comes back even more powerful than ever. In a flash the tables turn and Gohan can barely put up a fight. All hope seems lost, but some last minute advice from the Other World may just be the final spark Gohan needs to finish Cell once and for all. Who shall win the Cell Games?4 excellent episodes of Dragon Ball Z. These episodes are heavy on the fighting and one is really emotional as well. The violence is very graphic so as the DVD says I suggest this to fans 13 and up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good item","review":"I am very happy with this item it plays perfect and my husband is happy to have received this item"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lower your prices, sellers!","review":"Man, I really want to buy this, but seriously, start dropping your price for this!

It's hard to get anything out of it except noise. The left hand reeds are so far off of the advertised C and G tuning, and so mismatched to the right hand reeds as to be irritating. Most frustrating is the inconsistent difficulty getting any sound out of some of the reeds unless you push or pull so hard that you use up all the air on one short note.This might be fun for a 3 year old who just wants to make some noise on a colorful box, but if you are hoping to introduce a youngster to the joy of playing a simple tune, you and your budding musician will be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Think this is just for kids?

To keep it from further splitting and to even SEE where the strips were was near impossible. And after all that, it doesn't even stick very well.

Before everything, FREEDOMLAND is a movie about loss : loss of a child for Julianne Moore and Karen Collucci, loss of a child and loss of his people's trust for Samuel L. Jackson. The smart screenplay generates enough flesh around this theme to withhold the audience's attention during 100 minutes.

Then of course the police go off the deep end and shut down entire Black communities searching for the perpetrators.I am not surprised by the racist hostility spewed towards this movie, but hope that many open minded people watch it.

There were so many things going on that I lost track of what the purpose of the whole movie was to begin with.

I don't know about everyone else, but I'm tired of this \\"black versus white\\" bullcrap in movies. We've seen it all before. And in my opinion, movies such as this do nothing for civil rights, but rather make both white and black races look like monsters. As far as acting, both Julianne Moore and Samuel L.

Julianne Moore's acting was great and Samuel L. Jackson was pretty good also so for me the problem wasn't the acting but just the story. I enjoy Jackson's acting but I feel like he too often takes every role presented to him and I think there would have been better movies for him to do than this one.

A sick story is a sick story real or created. Maybe we are getting to use to all the violence and hatred that America has become and so this movie almost turns into a comedy. Besides, when i go to the movies i just want to escape all the horrible things that are going on in the world and be entertained. Not to give the person sitting next to me an idea. We're living in bad-enough times already without having to see more of it on the big screen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste time or money","review":"This movie has more plot lines than an elm tree has branches. Movie goers are left wondering if the movie was suppose to be about race-relations, racial profiling, missing children, good cop/bad cop, or a mystery about an abandon orphanage. Samual L Jackson and Julianna Moore are great actors but are unable to pull it off in this picture that can only be labelled \\"a mess.\\" It was long, drawn out and confusing. Go see ANYTHING else instead. I wouldn't even rent it when it come out on DVD, which as bad as this movie was, should be next week."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stinkeroo","review":"\\"Freedomland\\" is a mess. The basic premise: a woman, Brenda (a glammed down, scenery chewing{think about that horrifying and effective scene of Moore in \\"Magnolia\\" in which she goes off on the pharmacist...now times it times 50} from the usually effective Julianne Moore) has her car snatched, walks to the hospital with her hands bloodied and after about 15 minutes declares to a \\"counselor-defender,\\" Lorenzo Council (an intense Samuel L. Jackson who tries his level headed best to make sense of his part and this movie) that her son was in the back seat. This sets off a change of events that strains credulity at best and at worst has you scratching your head and wondering why you've spent your hard earned money on this crock.Nothing much works here and all the disparate elements: police brutality, racial profiling, child and spousal abuse instead of adding up to something important add up instead to an overheated hodge podge of a well made but silly melodrama."},{"rating":"1","title":"Samuel...i know you can do better than this!!!","review":"I knew this was going to be a great movie, mainly because Samuel L. was in it...FOR~GET~IT! This was by far the worst movie i have seen in quite some time...i didnt think it could ever get this bad. Julianne M. was HORRIBLE...i couldnt belive the acting in this movie, honestly Samuel wasnt that great either. The lines just didnt seem to flow, although the two of them were conversing. It was like he would ask her a question about the whereabouts of her son and she would respond with something like \\"do you want eggs with that\\"...HAHAHAHA...this movie was sheer torture to sit through. Plese do not waste your money...and especially your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"What in the world???????","review":"This was an awful waste of my time movie. I actually didn't enjoy the acting or the story line in this movie. I only regret that I purchase this movie instead of renting it. If only I had read the reviews first, instead of just watching a preview on another video. That preview was very misleading. The story line is all over the place and very hard to understand. Some of the acting is just unbelieveable, and weak."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste of Talent","review":"Julianne Moore and Samuel L. Jackson deserve to be in a much better movie than Freedomland, a ridiculous film about what happens when Brenda, a poor white woman, says her car has been hijacked. After giving testimony to several cops, she adds that, oh, by the way, her four-year-old son is in the car. Even though it's obvious to the detective, the viewer, and anybody with an IQ higher than George W. Bush that Brenda is lying, the cops decide to completely shut down the black project where they think the child, and his kidnapper, are. Accusations of racism and riots ensue, not a moment of which is believable. Edie Falco gives a very moving performance as a mother who's lost a child herself, despite the fact that most of the lines she has to deliver are absurd. Why all these talented people decided to make this ridiculous movie is a mystery to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of time","review":"I have seen badly made movies, and this one is at the top of the list.

Despite some stellar performances, the movie is one-sided, manipulative and sloppily directed. Samuel L. Jackson gives a fine performance as Lorenzo Counsel, a veteran cop investigating the alleged carjacking of a terrified woman, Brenda Martin. Martin is played by Julianne Moore and she acts like she wanted another Oscar nomination as she goes from frightened mother to neurotic mother. She's quite good in several scenes. William Forsythe and Ron Eldard are very good in supporting roles as Jackson's partner and Moore's brother, but the performances don't salvage the movie from being another ethnic mess."},{"rating":"1","title":"So bad it's hilarious!","review":"A puerile, manipulative plot in the manner of Spike Lee on a bad day, a director with a sub-median IQ who doesn't have a clue regarding how real people behave, scenery-chewing actors who rival the worst of William Shatner, not a single role to inspire sympathy or empathy. What does it all mean? A couple hours of my life down the drain. But add a tank of nitrous oxide, and you just might have a great time. This one tops my previous pick for worst movie on cable, which was \\"Cellular.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Moore HORRIBLY Miscast!!","review":"Julianne Moore, as the desperate mother whose car was carjacked with her son in the back seat, was totally, completely unbelievable in the role. Not a scene or inch of dialogue rang true, and her acting was incredibly sub-par and annoying to the point of ruining the movie. Jackson does his usual great work, but her performance, the unrealistic scenarios of police 'procedure,' and the choppy direction did the movie in. Pretty darn bad...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Torturous","review":"This movie was absolutely torturous to watch. I struggled to watch it in its entirety. I was so disappointed. It made no sense at all. The plots and scenes were not connected. The acting wasn't all that great either.

He's now almost 2 and it's so wonderful to be able to understand what he is saying. Everyday when we get home he asks to watch Signing Time (\\"Si Ti\\"), both verbally and in sign language.

She knows more than 20 signs already using Baby Einstein's \\"First Signs\\" DVD, and \\"Talking Hands\\" DVD. She is now learning her colors, and names of food so this DVD of \\"Favorite Things\\" met my needs.The Pros:Nice mix of songs, live action, cartoon frog, and different age children signing and talking including Rachel's daughter, Leah, who is deaf. Rachel's use of color coding her fingers, and simple explanations of each sign is very helpful.Cons:While the 30 minutes run time on the DVD is perfect for showing during meal times, and snack times, I feel the cost is a little high compared to other educational DVDs. The number of signs covered on each DVD is not that many unless you include the ones used during songs etc. However, as long as my granddaughter continues to show an interest in learning sign language I will continue to purchase new DVDs."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful","review":"I bought it for my 6 month old but my 3 year old simply loves it, too!

I picked up this video the other day at the library and I'm blown away by how well done it is. I couldn't believe that my 22 month old twins were so glued to the show. They aren't to the other baby signs video by another company. My 5 year old remembered 20 of the signs a few hours later after only watching it once.

And then there is the story about Runaway. I'm told by Frank Boyer who heard it from Stu Carpenter, that the reason he lost the trailer was that he had a 2 and 1/8 inch connection on a 2 inch mount.

The book is comprehensive in that it provides not only wonderful recipes for entres, but complements as well, such as sauces, rubs, seasoning and brining techniques that when combined, yield exceptional results. Recipes included go beyond those limited to smoking or grilling methods. It contains some wonderful twists for soups, salads, and desserts as well. This book is written with humorous antecdotes throughout and virtually all recipes can be prepared with readily accessible ingredients. It is my \\"go to\\" book whenever I'm interested in preparing food that makes the soul feel good and it's the only cookbook that I have purchased over and over again as a gift for nearly any occasion. I can't overstate the benifits of having this one in your kitchen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thumbs Up","review":"Many reviewers of the book have been to the restaurant(s) and have sampled its menus \\"live\\" - I have not. My comments are purely on the book. It is a very good bar-b-que book. The recipes in it are mouthwatering, and I don't mean just a few either. The \\"hook\\" in many of these recipes is that they utilize an all-purpose red rub recipe and/or a basic sauce recipe (the Mutha Sauce) provided in the book. I have made both recipes in order to try many of the interesting recipes. My only complaints are that the Mutha Sauce produces a very vinegary sauce and the one quarter cup of pepper sauce in it may, for some tastes, be a little over the top. If it suits your taste, fine. If your taste is more to the sweet, either amend the recipe or use another red sauce that you prefer."},{"rating":"2","title":"prompt service","review":"This book contains numerous menu items that are very tasteful.

So I rented it and started to play the game. First, I noticed the amazing graphics through out the game. Then there is the story line which I thought was pretty good too. The only thing this game really lacks is the time it takes to beat it. On my third try playing it, it only took me around five hours to beat the darn thing.

It is truly a great game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ico vs. Shadow of the Colossss","review":"I decided to buy after I realized it was a sequel to the newer game \\"Shadow of the Colossus\\". But they are two very different games. Ico's graphics and design are gorgeous, the storyline is interesting. I like the creation of a game language that isn't totally annoying (it's a mix of latin/japanese). But some of the puzzles are difficult, there are times they seem unsolvable. And other times, like when you don't know where to go and fall from a height and die, you are backtracked to your LAST save point. That is a bit frustrating. Still I can't wait to finish this game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great RPG","review":"I played a demo of this game and I think it is great.This was the first RPG that I enjoyed the action.Ico is the only of it's kind.You play as a boy who was born with horns,he is buried but escapes.He then finds princess Yorda and they work together to get out of a castle haunted by moving shadows.If Yorda dies,you lose.With great puzzles and great action it is the best RPG ever!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Instant Classic!","review":"As an old game vet from the age of Atari 2600, I think I have seen just about everything in video games.

Maybe it's because I'm 16, but I need something more exciting. You pretty much just run back and forth opening doors, dragging boxes and fighting evil spirits occasionally.

How this game recieved such high marks is a mystery to me, yet I feel it is my duty to warn others about it. Ico brings new definition to the word pointless, since through most of the game you are left wondering why the heck you want to go on, playing a game with a hollow plot, poor character development, and an annoying kid that makes you want to run him off a cliff, just to see him die! The only ray of light that shines through this dull title is the amazing visual effects brought out by the programmers... Unfortunately, graphics do not make the game, and Ico proves this.

You don't even have HP, I mean what kind of Adventure game doesn't have Hp?Take my extremely useful advice and don't waste your money on this useless and incredibly boring game.

Ico's bloodless game play and minimalist aesthetic was just what I needed.The best thing about this game is the art direction. The backgrounds are so beautiful and so well rendered that it's easy to just want to roam around and look at things. The lighting effects are gorgeous the whole game is infused with a sort of dark/light ambience that can be at times both soothing and foreboding.I found my hart in my throat whenever Ico jumped and shimmied around the castle at breathtaking heights. I liked the whole idea of having to lead Princess Yorda around; her frailty is endearing too (given that she's a demon princess!). The shadow creatures that come for her are equally spooky.Ico is a game I could play with my children (if I had any), and is the antidote to all the splaaterfest games that are out there right now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Romantic adventure with a difference...","review":"ICO cannot be categorised in any of the common game genres, as this \\"game\\" plays more like a romantic novel, engaging the player in an emotional and spiritual feeling that far transcends the boundaries of common \\"game experiences\\". Sure, you will need to climb ladders, activate levers, defend against evil shadows, etc. but all these actions will absorb your mind and soul in a truly beautiful way.The scenery is sublime in its melancholy, the struggle to free Yorda is agonisingly poignant, and the conclusion is a complete surrender to the higher emotions of love and mystery."},{"rating":"2","title":"2 CD's -- A lifetime of music to be moved by","review":"North Indian classical music, and music in general, at its best.

He unfolds the ragas slowly, just a couple of notes at time, letting himself and you absorb everything the music has to offer--the whole point of the alap. It is pure joy to be able to hear him play such long alaps. It is rare to hear it on a recording. The ragas on this CD convey very deep emotions. Shri Rag will keep you shaking your head in amazement. You will treasure all three alaps. They are easily worth their weight in gold.

I give it an A."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not his best","review":"It seems to me that the works of Kosinski set in Eastern Europe have far greater strength and authenticity than the work set in America. This particular little piece of ' Look at the anarchic dismal impersonal civilization we live in' school has a touch of the randonmness and violence which Kosinki's world is pervaded by.The story of the gardener whose guardian dies and who has to encounter the ' real world' for the first time gives no sense of any redeeming moment or beauty in life. One might say that Becket doesn't either and that is his genius. But I have the sense that the emptiness which Kosinki finds at the heart of 'Television Civilization's is an emptiness in the heart of Kosinski himself.Unfairly perhaps I think of Tolstoy and that kind of fiction which makes the person love life more, not wonder why one is reading something which makes one wonder if life really is so worthless and so small."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that funny","review":"I was expecting a laugh-out-loud book, but this book is not that funny or witty. The plot is obviously far-fetched -- a garderner becomes a media hero -- but it doesn't matter because implausibility can be great tool for humor. However I thought the author Kosinski didn't really go after this plot, the possibilities were great but there's not enough biting sarcasm . I think the problem is this book was written in the 70's, long before the current Ironic Age, so the whole thing comes off as pretty tame now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I think this book is that type of book whick makes a person sick .

Chance or chauncy as everyone would call his has the mind of a child. But his blunt honesty is refreshing in a way. I was pleased how the author wrote a charater that we should all try to assimilate some of his views. For example his honesty he doesent feel he needs to candy coat anything for anyone because he doesent see the point but on the flip side he doesent see much in anything. The book in my opinion was a refection of our society to a degree...but thats it, most of the charaters I thought were dull and almost like a bunch of zombies trying to find meaning in nothing, but over analyzing everything and sady enough making themselfs sound dumber and dumber with every sentece they speak. I reall like the way chance was honest a quality that is not found much now a days but i think that chance would have been a better charater if he had a stonger mind and not one of a child."},{"rating":"1","title":"surprisingly dull","review":"This is another of those novels that is less good than the film that was made from it. After I saw the film, I read the book and it utterly lacked the wit and irony of the performance by Sellers in the film. The novel moves slowly, is not very funny, and the writing style utterly lacks flavor. In contrast, the film was the perfect parody of the beginning of the Reagan era, in which appearences and the assumptions of the observers mix in the most surprising ways. Oh well. It appears to me that Kosinsky did his thing and had nothing much to say after The Painted Bird.Not recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilariously Written Commentary","review":"Chance, an idiot savant finds himself in situations where, by association with an extraordinarily rich and socially connected couple, his simple words are treated as metaphors for society's problems.

Most newer homes have metal studs in the wall and this system isn't compatible with metal studs. The cover just sort of hangs on the system and you literally pick it up so it's not really great for families with kids either.Great in theory but not the worth the money at all.

I personally found the book so appealing because it left me laughing, then crying, then angry, then sad. It pulled and tugged at all of my emotions and made me see that I have given up too easily on some things I have wanted changed in my own life.

This colorful and delightful memoir will warm your heart and open your eyes to a system that has not delivered on its promises. Those promises being, the right to an education funded by taxes and delivered in the appropriate manner by someone who can get the job done.Ever upbeat we find the protagonist working his way into the lives of the children on this all but forgotten island. We watch them attempt to bloom like so many different flowers, and enjoy their trials and tribulations as well as their ability to conquer their ignorance when given half a chance. Different than his novels, PRINCE OF TIDES and BEACH MUSIC, but none the less just as good, this is an endearing and sweet taste of a champion among the children.

You will learn many things from this book like what it is not to have a house, electric, and even a good education. I think that all teachers should read this to understand how much some people love their job and this book can help you improve the way you teach.

I first encountered Pat Conroy's book when I was in junior high, and have returned to it again and again. Finding that it's been re-released, hopefully to gather a new audience, is encouraging to me. The book, written when the world, especially the South, was grappling with changes spurred by the Civil Rights movement. A white teacher, graduate of one of the premiere Southern military colleges, The Citadel, takes a position as a teacher on an island isolated from the most of the cultural changes in the United States.

I really thought it was just a werid and an actually pretty boring movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed","review":"The writing is fairly decent, however the author's reading of the material is hard to tolerate. The thick New York accent detracts from the material being read. I would not recommend the audio book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never buy this light!!!","review":"I originally installed a double circular flourescent unit and a single tube unit... I have now replaced both units at three times each... Unfortunately, I did not recognize the brand name when I ordered the last set ..Until I took the cover off... Previously, I had also replaced the circular tubes only to find that although the tubes were blackened and obviously burned out, that after replacement, the ballasts were also gone... In essence, In the last 3 years, I have replaced the units three times and also paid for a full set of replacement tubes ..... What a waste of money...."},{"rating":"1","title":"cheap diffuser","review":"I bought three of these lights from Home Depot for a finished basement. During installation one of the clips that holds the diffuser in place punched a hole in it. Now it doesn't hang properly. The acrylic diffuser is really cheap and very easy to damage. Home Depot does not carry replacement diffusers and I have not found a source for a replacement on the web. A real disappointment coming from Litonia. Guess you can't trust that name anymore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent resource for smart approaches to skin care.","review":"I was especially impressed with all the time Paula Begoun spends on adult acne-proned skin. I am forty years old with acne-proned skin, and I have tried every skin-care line out there, and spent hundreds of dollars, and nothing worked. Paula's book intellingently explains what causes acne, and the best products to use to treat it. It turns out the best products DON'T cost a small fortune, they're just simple (sometimes surprising!) products you can buy at any drugstore, NOT expensive department stores. The result has been a dramatic improvement in my skin. My acne has cleared up, and the overall texture of my skin is beautiful. The only drawback to the book is it can get a bit complicated & disjointed. I found I had to go back and read a few sections over a few times, and even took notes as I went along. But I found it to be worth the effort. Paula's done her homework, and has been good enough to pass her knowledge on to the public."},{"rating":"2","title":"saved me lots of money","review":"Friends told me to a buy a book called the beauty bible,they actually meant the one by sarah stacey and I bought the one by paula by mistake.However it turned out to be one of the best mistakes I've ever made.It certainly has made my skin look better (and my pocket too). the only disappointing factor was that the subject of hair care was completely ignored.One expects a beauty BIBLE to cover all the aspects of beauty."},{"rating":"1","title":"A matter of opinion","review":"I have read this book that is far from being a \\"bible\\". All this book does is critize products and product lines. Than the author appears to contradict herself saying not to use a product in one chapter and than in another chapter says to use it. I very much disagree that all extracts are skin irritants and that they are unnecessary because this is how it all began, franksense and myrh, right. I am an esthetican and I do know that in this field people are going to have many different opinions but lets also remember that no ones skin is exactly alike. This book is very negative and misleading, definitely not a beauty bible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just like all her others","review":"While I learned a few things from Paula's other books, this one seems like a reorganization of her previous material into new chapters under new titles. For someone who is out to save us money, why is she selling yet another book with all the same information?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Technical, repetitive, lots of information","review":"I have to agree with one of the other reviews--this is basically her other books but without as much editing--the book is VERY repetitive, to the point where it's hard to read more than a couple pages at a time. I do believe the book could be summed up in a few sentences and the remaining hundreds of pages are just reiterations and examples. I didn't find anything new (and therefore useful) in the book at all. It's rather boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!","review":"I was disappointed in this book! The writer simply failed to interest me with her tales. The stories, which were only about a page or two each, seemed to be written more for a child rather than an adult; they were too short and lacking in detail. I read a few of the stories and then tossed the book aside. My greatest regret was that I'd paid nearly 10 bucks for this book. There are many other much better true ghost story books out there. If you're looking for some truly chilling tales, start with Haunted Heartland, Historic Haunted America, or USA Weekend's, I Never Believed in Ghosts Until..."},{"rating":"2","title":"into a world of redemption","review":"Ever since Dr. Gardner's doctoral dissertation on the Gospel of Matthew many years ago, he has been living out the Matthean text. This book is my primary resource for preaching, for devotions and for study. A particular feature of this series is that not only is a section dealing with how the text intereacted with the original hearers, but how the text has been dealt with in the life of the Church. This gives life to the text, and reflects the words as the Living Word. Dr. Roop engages the text with enthuiasm and brings life to often obscure portions."},{"rating":"2","title":"PEE IN YOUR PANTS FUNNY!","review":"Have all the \\"Carl\\" books and HAD to buy \\"Bad Dog Andy\\" to round out the collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"finally a tool that really works","review":"this is the best tool for your feet if you need something like this, and it's safe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool Sound","review":"This album makes me think of 80s music in many ways.

These guys are really good and their songs are really good...kind of emoish, in a way, not as sad... but they are about that kind of stuff... very good to just listen to....my favorites have got to be my paper heart and the last song, and your star... i definetly recommend it, it's a good buy...."},{"rating":"2","title":"The All American Rejects. No music rejects here.","review":"If you're expecting a 'GoodPlan41' (Good Charlotte, Simple Plan, Sum 41) kind of album, you're setting yourself up for disappointment.The mainstream popular song \\"Swing, Swing\\" is a great song. Catchy song and even a more catchy video. The opening track, \\"My Paper Heart\\", one of my favorite songs on the album, reminds me of something I would just like to sing along with at a show and stand still. \\"One More Sad Song\\" is something you would catch The Ataris leading man, Kris Roe singing to. With incredible writing skills, and awesome sounds, the only thing this band has in common with other popular MTV bands is the fact that they're all guys. Lyrically and musically, The All-American Rejects beat the other bands hands down."},{"rating":"1","title":"JUNK!","review":"The lead singer is one of the worst singers evar! He sounds good on the CD but if you've heard him live you'd know is voice is entirely digital and sounds nothing like it does on their LP. Stick with GOOD emo not this wannabe junk! I suggest you check out Early November, Further Seems Forever, Dashboard Confessional or the Postal Service for some REAL emo not this corporate processed MTV garbage! There's so much better emo out thar I don't know why anyone would listen to the All American Rejects!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good thing the price was so low.","review":"The All American Reject's debut album was a big disappointment. I had heard \\"Swing Swing\\" on the radio a couple of times, and it was catchy as hell. HMV was selling the CD for only $10, so I thought I'd give it a go. I found the entire album annoying and dull, except for \\"Swing Swing\\". I'm not one to need immediate gratification out of my music, but even after a third lesson I was bored out of my mind. The lyrics were the same old thing from almost all other emo bands, and the melodies just didn't work. It's albums like this that make an argument for downloading music. I should have spent the $10 toward a DSL subscription."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good!","review":"i have this CD & must say that it is Very good. i usually dont like sappy love songs, but these are AWESOME!!!the lead singer Tyson, has a great voice...i LOVE this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrid Crap","review":"This band along with GC, Simple Plan, etc. make me sick.

THis pop- punk is just getting out of hand. This stuff is pathetic. The leader singer can't sing and the rest of the guys just stand there and pretend like they are doing something. When I heard the song \\"Swing,Swing\\" on the radio, I promised myself that I would never listen to the radio again. It is horrible and the worst part about it was the lryics!

This CD is great to pump in your car with all of your friends. As someone from AAR's hometown of Stillwater, OK I know firsthand how talented Nick (Wheeler)can be. Check out Happy Endings (10) on Kazaa if you aren't sure about the CD. I am sure you'll be hooked."},{"rating":"2","title":"REJECTS","review":"This cd is one of the best of the new year.

Check out this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweep Of The Nation","review":"If you haven't heard of the Oklahoma rejects, then where have you been? This band's self-titled album is dope. Tyson belts out his lyrics with some killer guitar riffs. The Rejects are untoppable. I saw these guys on All Things Rock on MTV and went out and bought the CD the next day. They aren't your ordinary emo band. I suggest you go out and buy this CD if you know what is best for you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Never would have thought...","review":"If anyone would have told me that I would end up buying The All-American Rejects' album, I probably would have laughed in their face. I mean, I loved \\"Swing, Swing\\" and all, but owning the whole album? Not likely. Who are these guys anyway?Well, something happened and I decided I was in need of some new music, so I decided to buy it. Turns out, I was happily surprised to find out that I just adore every song on the album (pretty much equally). The lead singer's voice is just very captivating, melodic, and powerful. Each song is very catchy and gut-wrenching at the same time...a GREAT driving record, in my opinion. It's definitely not an album that will be making history any time soon, but if you are looking for something to just listen to all the way through and enjoy, buy this. It's really worth a try...at least."},{"rating":"2","title":"All American Rejects","review":"After hearing \\"Swing Swing\\" on the radio, I was an instant fan.

The CD has an incredible mix of rock and pop, and the band blends together awsome guitar riffs and classical string solos to create amazing songs. The punk edged vocals are incredible, and the drum beats and fills will blow you away. You can sing along to the funky lyrics of \\"Swing,Swing\\" and jump around to the fast paced song, entitled \\"The Last Song.\\" Overall, the CD is a must-have and is an excellant addition to your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"The All-American Rejects ROCK!!!","review":"When I first got into the All-American Rejects I was blown away. Their awesome rock melodies with discriptive lyrics really make you feel in-depth with the songs. You know that they're going to be big by their first big break with their latest single \\"Swing Swing\\", a catchy tune that is just bound to be stuck in your head. If you like such bands as Taking Back Sunday, or Dashboard, you'll love these guys. They're not emo. They're not pop/punk. They are just four guys rocking out the way they know how to. They're Oklahoma Rock!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD is really good!","review":"I bought this off interpunk.com and it is a really good CD!

I was very disapointed when I finnaly got around to buying their CD.Swing Swing was the only blockbuster hit on the CD There were some okay songs in there, but nothing amazing.If you or a friend have a CD burner, burn yourself Swing Swing. A star and a half of this review were for Swing Swing, and a half star for those okay songs.If you like any part of this album, I reccamond litening to O.K.

I love every track on it, especially Swing,swing and My Paper Heart. I paid 21.00 for it, and it was DEFINITELY worth it.

BUY IT!-DONT BURN IT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hometown Boys","review":"Maybe I'm a little bias towards these guys, seeing as how their hometown is only half an hour away from mine, but no matter. This is a good album. All American Rejects have always been good. To all those out there that think their talent lies in \\"Swing Swing\\" alone, you need to check them out live. They've been rockin' the stages in Oklahoma brilliantly for a couple of years now. And the album reflects that.

It rocks!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Punk meets pop","review":"This is one of the best CD's I have ever heard. It has its own distinct sound. I love punk, but this strays from the generic pop punk bands. They have a unique instrumentalism to them, not just the bar chord punk (not dissing it, I love it, I'm just saying) The lyrics are great, they are like exactly the kind of [stuff] that happens to normal people in real life in relationships. I encourage everyone to buy this CD, regardless of your tastes. \\"Too Far Gone\\" is one of the best songs I have ever heard. It has amazing lyrics, and a touch that saddens the heart and reminds you of old loves, yet the beautiful guitar work and vocals make you want to listen to it over and over again. Being a musician myself (guitarist), I realize the complexity of the guitar work, and also as a song writer I realize how well the songs are worked out to be very catchy and just great overall. You must buy this CD, it's amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this cd!","review":"When I first heards this cd, I loved it. My favorite song is \\"My Paper Heart\\".

It will make you want to pick an instrument and start rockin out to any of the songs on it. It has helped me especially in dealing with moving on from a bad breakup I had recently.

The All-American Rejects are typical corporate rock, catchy and generic licks, a whiny 12-year old lead singer, all-american boy looks, songs about love and pseudo-angst, and the worst drum beats I've ever heard. Check out the drum part on \\"Paper Heart\\"- it sounds like it should be on the Flashdance soundtrack. Bland, wholesome, corporate rock fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hot damn this CD is good","review":"I saw All American Rejects at a show and they were absolutely amazing.

That's about all the praise I feel I can honestly give to this CD. I know that this is technically emo, but does every single song have to be about the same thing? I can only listen to the same broken-hearted sentiment so many times before I get bored. I will admit that occaisonally they come up with an ok hook - \\"The Last Song\\" did impress me, but it might have just been the optimistic title. This is pure emo-pop banality that has been done many times with far more success, but of course the radio and MTV ate this up, and teenyboppers all over the country are raving about it. My advice to them would be to listen to The Movielife, an emo band with actual talent and creativity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD!!","review":"i bought this cd because i heard 'time stands still' and 'swing swing' i thought they were kick ass songs so i bought the cd and loved it. my favorite songs are time stands still, swing swing, and the last song. if you like GC OR SP you will like this cd"},{"rating":"2","title":"whats with all the hating?","review":"looking back on half the reviews, i totally dont agree with them being a typical rock band. they incorporate many other instruments in their songs that help to differentiate them from other bands. ill agree that a lot of the songs are sappy, but they have really good beats. they dont tend to use the same beats like other bands *cough*blink-182*cough* and you can relate to them. i dont get these people who are like their not true rock and just posers. shut up, you're probably poseurs yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome punk-pop sound","review":"I bought the CD about two weeks ago and I can't get it out of the player.

Not only are the boys in the band cuties but they can seriously play some tight tunes! With their hit \\"Swing, Swing\\", Tyson lays down the vocals really well with his amazing voice that sounds like no other. From the rockin'sound of \\"One Last Song\\" to the softer sound of \\"Time Stands Still\\", one listen to this album and you'll instantly fall in the love with them and their sound.

It's just not a good one. All of the songs sound the same, and it's not because the band has a unique sound. They are very much a pop rock band, and don't really bring anything new or interesting to the genre. This CD is best suited for background noise while you're doing something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Punk or Pop?","review":"Look, we all know that the rejects managed to catch a radio hit with \\"swing, swing\\". And because of that song, i ended up wasting $$$ on this ... cd!Literaly, the only good songs are \\"Swing,Swing\\" \\"One More Sad Song\\" \\"The Last Song\\". EVERY other song on this ... !Everything about \\"Drive Away\\" makes my skin crawl.The lyrics are questionable(to say the least) and punk doesnt work for the rejects. Mind you if \\"my paper heart\\" is anything to go by, niether does pop!All in all, do NOT buy this album. If you absolutely must have it then download it!But do NOT under any circumstances pay more than nothing for this worthless pice of plastic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it! Love it! Love it!","review":"This is an incredibly awesome album! I discovered it even before \\"Swing, Swing\\" was on the radio...and I fell in love as soon as I popped it into my CD player. This emo-punk-pop group has created songs bound to please the ears of listeners with varied musical tastes. The tracks sound pretty different, but they are all put together well with a combination of great vocals and guitars, not to mention the drums and an organ.... They're extremely catchy and will be stuck in your head for hours after you're done listening! My favorites are \\"Time Stands Still\\"- the best song I've heard in a while, and \\"Drive Away\\"- a very fun, upbeat tune.

It's outrageous that a producer would allow such a travesty. I in no way am dissing the band, but seriously I doubt I've heard them yet. This album DOES go from bad to gooder, by the end of the CD you forget how terrible it started.

Given that some of the songs may be catchy at first, they are ultimately bland and uninspiring. The best comparison I can think for their music is Disney's \\"It's a Small World\\" song: catchy at first, but it drives you crazy from listening to it. Their music is mostly the same recycled stuff MTV shoves down peoples throats all of the time. There is no originality to it whatsoever. There are plenty of bands that I don't particularly like their music, but I can respect what they are doing for their originality and style. This is not true for the All American Rejects who have no talent at all and need to be avoided at all costs. On a side note, I have seen them in concert and they were jerks to the crowd and put on a lousy show.

Do they even have a drummer? It seems that most of the drums are from the keyboard. Next to Garth Brooks, They are one of the worst things out of Oklahoma. It is such a shame that they got discovered when there are way better bands out of Oklahoma such as the Chainsaw Kittens, and the Starlight Mints who hardly get any credit.

I saw them in concert (Orlando, FL: House of Blues), and they are insanely talent young guys. The lead vocalist, Tyson Ritter voice is amazing. Him and bandmate Nick Wheeler are a dyamnic duo. My fave tracks are \\"Don't Leave Me\\", \\"Why Worry\\" , and \\"Paper Heart\\". The whole CD is worth more than the price- trust me.

They're flat out wrong. Tyson Ritter's vocals and lyrics separate him and the band from punk rockers.

In all the musical stylings of Tyson Ritter and Nick Wheeler are sure to succeed in a second Album thus opening a new hole in the EMO music industry.

Their mix of guitars, drums, synths, keyboards, bells, and everything else just make the song flow so well. The rang of the vocals are amazing for some guys, and the melodies stay with you day and night. I go around singing them constantly! Everyone should listen and love them. They mix all styles of music into one and do it effortlessly. \\"My Paper Heart\\", \\"One More Sad Song\\" and \\"The Last Song\\" are my favorites, but the reason I bought it was their catchy single \\"Swing, Swing\\". It's definetly not my favorite song but all of them are great. These guys are my new favorites. You should all go out and by this when it gets released, well the re-release, but anyways.

Their vocalist sounds like Mark Hoppus ala Blink 182, their guitarist plays in the style of Sum 41, they have a bassist who uses vaguely Green Day style techniques, while still managing to fit in synthesizers(Ben Folds)...And the surprising thing is that it sounds very good when it is put together. An extraordinary effort by these young men."},{"rating":"2","title":"The All-American Rejects [totally] ROCK, dude!!","review":"I bought this CD about a week ago, and I've listened to it probably about 20+ times!!

After I saw the video for a second time on ATR, I found myself humming the song day in and day out. So, I checked out the audio clips on this site, and I wasn't so sure about them. But I just got over it and bought the album...I'm so glad! I won't go through each and every song, because that's just my opinion...It really wouldn't help you out at all...The only thing that would help is to check it out for yourself...I can tell you that it is SO worth checking out, though.

This is far worse than any \\"pop-punk\\" label you can put on this music, in fact, who even says this is \\"pop-punk\\". If you like pop-punk, then surely you can realize NFG, GC, Starting Line, or for that matter, ANY POP-PUNK GROUP, at least can rock on a few songs. If you don't even like the style of those groups (TAAR is much cheesier), then don't even bother downloading a few tracks from this to test this CD out.

Right away it was obvious that the band had a sound all their own. The hits \\"Swing, Swing\\", \\"Time Stands Still\\", and \\"The Last Song\\" proved that the band was creating interesting music. The All-American Rejects mixed pop, rock, and synthesized sounds with just a hint of a grunge feel and the product was very unique. Their fusion even landed the band a spot in the soundtrack to the pilot episode to the television series The OC with the song \\"Swing, Swing\\".

These swords are called wallhangers because they are only designed to by hung on a wall, not swung. The reason is that underneath the handle is a very small piece of metal that connects to the blade itself. (Called the Tang) In a real martial arts sword, the tang is normally a thick piece of metal that is almost the thickness of the sword itself. If you swing this the wallhanger too often or too hard it can break at the tang, and fly off and hurt someone.If you want to learn more about how dangerous these wallhangers are do a google search on the words: anatomy of a wallhangerAny sword designed for real martial arts practice- like Iaido, starts at $250 not $15.So be smart, either hang this sword back on the wall, or throw it out before your baby brother/sister hurts someone."},{"rating":"2","title":"SAIYUKI ROCKS!!!!!!","review":"The road west is marred by the potholes from their past.

They didn't realize that it shouldn't have gone outside for any reason.

Some of the anecdotes are real hooters. But it's skinny on the \\"how to\\" parts. There's a lot of discussion about setting up your seat and pedals for a comfortable and efficient driving position, but not much about the specifics of choosing a line for this corner, in this car, in this weather, today. Not much about footwork or other aspects of driving technique, not much about car set-up, and nearly nothing about the physics underlying it all. A few glancing blows at topics like contact patches, but disappointingly little.Skip Barber's \\"Going Faster\\" is a better textbook, especially for someone like me, an engineer with an analytical mindset.If you want a driving textbook, get Barber's.

I guess the author figures by defining some martial art terms and by quoting from a famous book that paintball could be tied to martial arts. It is an interesting twist but this book falls very short. The book does cover some paintball tactics but they are elementary and probably only useful for \\"white belt\\" paintballers.

Yes this is printed on the manual. But the print on the manual doesn't make a defective design any better -- why didn't they design a more steady handle, or remove the handle entirely? After all, how many users will remember that the handle can't be used to hold the water tank each time they refill the water tank, when it's designed in such way that it looks exactly like what it is for?!They told me I can get a replacement water tank for $18.

I had not had any leaking issues.Every night I start the humidifier and shockingly, it can go on for over 12 hours (depending on how long we sleep). I always empty and let it dry out during the day. I have the item elevated as it states to do on a flat surface.My children know this item is not a toy, so they do not bother it. I think that it helps that it is red (like a warning color).

The little penguin chugs plenty of vapor, and I'm satisfied with it.There is a quiet hum when the penguin's puffing, which is probably the small fan in the base of the humidifier. I barely notice it, but then I live in a house with forced air and the ex-humidifier was a growler (backwards, in Latin), so it's nothing to me.

The second unit, unfortunately, had a problem where the filters would not thread properly to the bottom of the frog's head (where you fill it with water). After the 4th filter I decided to email and call the company. After no response, I called back a few more times and finally spoke with customer service who promptly sent a warranty form only after mentioning a few times that the filters \\"are not required\\" for operation.

The only plus was it was pretty quiet when it did work, so I was happy about that as I was using in a bedroom."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad motor = bad product","review":"Length:: 0:41 MinsHere you will see the Crane Hello Kitty Cool Mist Humidifier acting up. Bought this in August 2011, haven't used that often, and the issue started well within a year of purchase. Something is definitely wrong with the motor they use in this particular humidifier. Seems like they do use a different/better(?) one in other characters (i.e. frog, penguin, etc) since reviews are better with those. I'm just ever more so concerned since reading a reviewer that said his humidifier caught on fire!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Over-rated and Over-heated","review":"We purchased the Hello Kitty version for our 5 year daughter in June 2012. I was very pleased with this product for the first couple of months. It was quiet and worked great, but in November 2012 I noticed that the motor was on, but no mist was coming out of the top. I couldn't figure out the cause of the problem, but after further inspection I realized that not only did it stop working but the water in the water chamber was boiling hot and I burned myself. So I stopped using it immediately. I'm hoping to get a refund from the manufacturer because obviously this is not a safe product and I do not feel comfortable with my daughter sleeping with it in her room. I'm glad it was me that got burned instead of her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Problems after 2 years","review":"This has been a great humidifier -- cute, quiet, does its job. However, after two years of occasional use, it has started making a very loud noise when turned on, to the point we can no longer use it. At first, the noise was infrequent. Now it is constant. Disappointing given the price.
