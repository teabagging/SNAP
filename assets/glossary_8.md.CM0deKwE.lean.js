It is very much a woman's book -- a lot of emphasis on intra-family relationships, cooking, holiday times, seasonal changes, aging -- rather than a bam/bang mystery story. (I get the distinct imporession that all the other reviewers to date are women). Not my usual cup of tea, but I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The author's prose style is clear and flows so smoothly...I have also enjoyed her earlier work. Buy this book whether you are a man or a woman if you appreciate excellent writing. Stronger on characterization and description than on plot, but so what? Only 4 stars because the ending sort of trails off rather than resolving much of anything, but up to then it is a very nice read."},{"rating":"1","title":"A real time waster","review":"I kept waiting for something to happen and it never did!

I don't like to work that hard at reading! Sorry!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"I enjoy almost every book Oprah recommends but this was awful awful awful. I would suggest saving your money for next month's pick."},{"rating":"2","title":"Many true-to-life scenarios","review":"I was very entertained by this book--by the genuine feelings and actions of the main character--Joey Becker. Jo's rationalization of her actions and her criticism of those rationalizations was something many female readers can relate to. However, I did find Daniel's character a little too saintly and the daughters a bit too nasty. I was enthralled however with the youngest daughter's explanation for the nastiness in the twins. This book was filled with many experiences that are true to life!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Eli? and Daniel? Boring characters","review":"It seems Miller decided to stick with the saintly spouse vs. the slick creep who impassions the devoted wife formula. How boring and cliched for such an accomplished writer. It would have also helped if she had used as much character development on her would-be lover as she did on her fascinating daughter (Cass) I understand that Cass represents all the glory and confusion of the writers youth. However, this is not enough to make it plausible that she would sacrafice her marriage to recapture these fleeting feelings. I only remember exchanges between her and Eli a few times. He seemed like a jerk, especially when he was patronizing Daniel in their conversation about religion....And then BAM he's a murderer. It's just way to easy and does not ring true that he'd confess over drinks in the Ritz bar. I do love her writing;it is lyrical. I'm just disappointed in the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are we supposed to feel sympathetic to Jo?","review":"The main character marries, then has a desire to lead a seedy life, leaves her husband, lives in a commune and then gets a second chance and blows it all for what? I did not feel drawn to see her side of things because she was very selfish. She was just darn lucky Daniel decided to forgive her....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not So Enthralled","review":"This was my second Sue Miller book. I loved The Good Mother so I was eager to read this book.I was disappointed. I didn't like Jo at all. She seemed flighty and immature. She wants constant angst, and I cannot relate to that. She is yearning for something she will not find outside of herself. I was more concerned about her husband.The pace at the beginning of the book was good, as many other reviewers have said. When I reached the middle of the book I had to put it down several times for several days because of the frustration with Jo and the slowness. I was tempted to skip parts, but stuck with it.I don't think I'll ever read another Sue Miller book again. I'll stick with Jodi Picoult."},{"rating":"1","title":"In one word, DULL","review":"I forced myself through this whole book, hoping at some point it would get better, but it never did. The characters (especially the men) had no dimension. The only character well developed was Jo's murdered friend. The story of Jo's daughters added nothing to the story, and seemed to do nothing but make the book longer. The ending was very anticlimactic. There are much better books out there right now. Pass on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disjointed and melodramatic","review":"This book had all of the elements of a great story. Unfortunately, the author didn't deliver a great story. The writing was clumsy and disjointed, the dialogue was melodramatic and unbelievable, the characters were not very likable, and the ending was disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excessive enlightenment","review":"The tale was worth telling, I suppose, though focusing on the plot line appeared to be challenging for the author. I found myself wishing for a tighter prose. So much enlightenment, so many distractions, soo0000000 many details!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this Book!","review":"I have read this novel at different stages in my life 22, 27, 30 and love the descriptive pros used to describe a marriage. She describes women desires about wanting to feel young and free, yet feeling constrain from society to be conformed to a marriage even if it is a good marriage overall. It resonated and left an impression. Especially because she didn't \\"sugar coat\\" how flawed humans are, and hard topics all families deal with. Very poignant and intelligent!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, difficult to read, unlikeable characters","review":"My title pretty much sums this review up: I did not enjoy this book. I really did not like the main character (Jo). I did not see much character development throughout the book, even though there was so much potential! Being a Christian woman, I was appalled at the lack of understanding of a pastor's beliefs and life choices. It would be really odd for a Christian pastor to marry a woman who had absolutely no religious beliefs. Not exactly equally yoked! I know that it was intentional on the part of the author; however, I was offended and frustrated by this career choice (and lack of understanding). This was a boring read that I would not recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beyond dull - contains spoiler","review":"Started well enough with the characters sharing the house. Once the 'action' moved onto the later years and her marriage it became tedious with large amounts of the book describing her husband/kids/job/mother.

Tedious, very ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"While I Was Gone","review":"If you have a lot in common with the narrator (professional class woman/vaguely dissatisfied with everything), AND you don't like to think while you read, you may enjoy this book.Normally, I would give a book 2 stars just for being able to reach people (which this does), but I can't because it was full of pretentious language and meandering descriptions/anecdotes which didn't really contribute to the plot or the characters. Also, it was poorly researched.If you like reading about somewhat depressing family life and relationships, I recommend reading something by Ann Tyler instead (I actually don't like her either, but she's good at what she does.)The Amateur Marriage (Tyler, Anne (Large Print))"},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't understand the hype","review":"I absolutely hated this book. Jo is just a selfish pig. She runs away from her husband and family and doesn't even extend them the common courtesy you would give a stranger. Then all is forgotten and forgiven because she married a minister and became a vet?? Yeah, sure, until she reverts to type and is again ready to deceive her family. What a waste of time -- I only finished the book because I wanted to know where this sorry tale was heading."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a load of codswallop!!","review":"This book drove me mad. It's chock full of descriptions of bringing the groceries into the house and looking across at the husband and all the daily tripe that IS NOT INTERESTING! The minutiae is hideous. The only reason I read it to the end - and I had to skip hugely to do that - was to see what, if anything this total waste of time was about! If I ripped out all the bits that amount to nothing more than filler, this book would be about twenty pages long. Is this an Oprah book by the way? Yeah...it figures. WHAT A WASTE OF TIME."},{"rating":"1","title":"She should have stayed gone!","review":"This story has more holes than a daytime soap. A woman meets a man from the past and wants to have an affair with him. Then she finds out he killed her friend. That being the basic storyline, there were too many unanswered questions. Why did Jo care about Eli? Why did she want to cheat on Daniel? Why did she decide to lie about her name when she moved in with Dana and the rest? And last but not the least, why did Eli tell her the truth about Dana? The book was a fast read and was over before I got too bored with the defective storyline. I suggest if this book must be read, it must be checked out of the library, bought at a used bookstore, or borrowed from someone like me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"This book is not one of my \\"typical\\" reads. I bought it for my mother as a gift, and after reading a little about it - I got hooked. This is another book based on family, like her other book, The Good Mother. It takes her back to a life she left behind in Cambridge, Ma. She was happy with her family and her Vetrinary clinic... until the past comes back to haunt her..."},{"rating":"1","title":"whiney midlife drivel","review":"I am reviewer 1,800. Too bad, because I will have little chance to warn others: this is indulgent, whiney drivel. We get to know the passive thoughts of the protagonist, with thumbnails of the rest. I didn't care about the main character, or anyone else, not even the dogs! The reason I finished it was to give an opinion to the friend who lent it to me.Her friend is murdered. Wow! I considered warding off readers by blowing the skimpy mystery, but please heed my warning: you will, or at least ought to, be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Girls book\\" grown up","review":"I hesitate to call this a book for women as I tend to believe women have come a long way from the customs of the 1960s; however, for some reason, this book reminded me of the \\"books for girls\\" on the library shelves of the 1960s. They were books I, as a girl growing up in that era, tried to avoid because I found them dull, boring, and uninteresting when compared to \\"books for boys.\\" This book seems to fall in the same category -- a lot of psychological and motivational review with no action. For those that enjoyed reading \\"books for girls,\\" this book will be a good read; for those of us women with more \\"liberated\\" taste, this book is simply a grown up version of \\"books for girls.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I am reading \\"While I Was Gone\\" for a book club and am having a difficult time trying to read to the end of the book. Frankly, the book is boring, the female character is a self-absorbed, one dimensional, selfish person that gets along better with animals than people. I was disappointed with the story line, actually I was disappointed with all aspects of this book, except of course that I didn't pay much for it, because I bought it on Amazon.com."},{"rating":"1","title":"what was the point?","review":"The way I judge if a book was worth the time and effort I put into reading it, is how the book made me feel at the end, and what it taught me. This book did not teach me much. THe characters were there, but they weren't really there. I didn't get the personal relationship feeling that makes me care about the characters. When I finally finished the book, I had to ask, what was the point of that? This was the first book I read by Sue Miller, and it will probably be the last. I didn't understand why Eli would have suddenly decided to confess what he did. He went 30 years without anyone suspecting him, without anyone asked him about it. And he suddenly has the urge to get it off his chest...yeah right. Then there are Jo's daughters. They are all very different from each other, but very socialy stereotyped characters. And almost to offset Jo's behavior, the husband is a pastor. The characters barely fit together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"I was very disappointed that Oprah picked this to be one of her book club selections. It was terrible!!!!!! This book just dragged and dragged."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"Terribly boring! I kept waiting for the story to begin. About 3/4 of the way through it picked up a notch- but only for a second. If you have a hard time getting into books~ don't read this one!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"tedium","review":"This was a pathetic read. It read like pages out of someone's boring diary. There were at least seven separate themes, none of which were developed through to maturity. These themes possibly included the brutal loss of a close friend, \\"finding one's self\\" in the sixties, being \\"trapped\\" in life, father-mother-offspring triangle, mother daughter conflict, husband wife conflict, amd more conflict apon the discovery of the brutal killer of said friend decades later. Possibly the book intended to illustrate life as a series of unending, unresolved conflict. None of the characters were developed, merely decsribed. The only relevant idea alluded to an innate need of unconditional love. This idea never matured either. The book gives nothing to take away except, perhaps, be aware of bad boyfriends. This book was a relief to finish."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent read .......................","review":"Jo Becker has a loving husband, three adult daughters and a couple of dogs - an enviable lifestyle - if perhaps not idyllic. The appearance of an acquaintance, Eli Mayhew, reawakens memories from her past with startling revelations. This is a tension-filled, easily readable book that races towards an anti-climatic conclusion.I would have preferred a suitable explanation to Dana's murder. It just happened and then - voila - 30 years down the line, the murderer confesses. I did enjoy reading this well-written book, especially the beautiful sermon by Daniel which was so inspiring. However, I found the ending rather unsatisfactory, particularly the outcome of the murder of Dana.Some minor flaws were evident which did not deter from my enjoyment of the book. All in all - a very good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jo Was Gone, Alright!","review":"This was a really good book - except it was one of the few books I've read where I didn't like the main character. Jo has everything - a great husband, good sex, nice kids, beautiful home, great job. But she is selfish. When she was much younger, she ran away from her first husband and her mother and didn't tell them where she was - just that she was okay. Then, in her usual selfish way, she decides to have an affair with a man from her past who has really given her very little encouragement. I wanted to throttle her. But, yet the book really drew me - probably because I could completely relate to her \\"hippie\\" experiences. A book that stays with you long after you're done reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn !","review":"I have to agree with reviewer Steven Becker. This was a painfully slow & laborious book. I too was drawn in by the riveting reviews, but quickly realized I had been duped. Apologies to all Sue Miller fans...she is a good writer, but this was a very slow & tedious plot line.....a big yawn for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"While I was gone","review":"I was really disappointed with this book. I kept hoping that the story line would pick up. It got just a little hopeful with her conversation about the murder with Eli but dropped off again. This is an excellent book to put you to sleep. The idea for the book was a good one but it drug on with no surprises."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read \\"The Good Mother\\" instead","review":"I loved \\"The Good Mother\\".I didn't care about any of the characters and my response is a big SO WHAT. Not engaging for me at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic yet real","review":"I absolutely loved this novel. The fact that Jo was such a strong woman, who had accomplished so much, was key. But the best part for me was some of Sue's writing, in which she/Jo expressed feelings I've had but have not been able to put into words. They were REAL feelings/fears/revelations, even in the context of this fictional work. It really blew me away. I've tried other Sue Miller books and not been as connected; this one really hit home for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than I expected....","review":"I must admit-- I'm trying not to read Oprah books. It's not that I have issues with her selections...I just wonder what the true motives are. Anyway. I picked up While I Was Gone because I wanted some light summer reading. I was pleasantly surprised. I found myself finding every excuse to just relax and read. I wanted to find out what would happen to Jo, and if she would discover the truth behind Dana's murder. I must admit, I was a little disappointed with the ending, but all in all, it was an enjoyable read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Oprah selection","review":"I have recently decided to read as many Oprah books as I can. This was my 3rd book. It is not a quick read, but it was an enjoyable book. It took me about 2 months to read, but it was well worth it!!! If you are skitish about the death of pets, I would steer clear of this book, though. There was a scene in the book that just left me in tears for days!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Me","review":"I picked up this book and it took me a very long time to finish, the story line just didn't catch my attention enough to want to keep reading it. It was really hard to relate to the main character and it was also hard to understand her reasoning for the things she did. It would have been a much better story if it only was about her past life."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of my least favorite Oprah reads...","review":"I have been reading the Oprah choices, and this one was not up to par. The character development was completely lacking in all aspects. Near the end of the novel, I didn't care what happened to Jo...she became very selfish, critical and had no inner strength or spark. I felt the entire novel was intended to make the reader feel \\"sorry\\" for Jo, poor Jo. Not a favorite."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I had gone....","review":"I read it- the whole thing- but I don't think I liked it. The story that was meant to draw you in with one woman's conflicting feelings about her past (and maybe her present), rang hollow. I can't tell you what was missing but something was. Trite? Same old plot new characters? I'm not sure. But it was a book that made no sense to me. The main character seemed to have the perfect man in her life. Thoughts about an affair? Why? And then to get righteous about something that possibly happened in the past,go to the police, and jeopardize that great life? Well- guess you'll just have to decide for yourself. There just wasn't enough MOTIVE for any of the actions the main character took. I read this before Oprah made it one of her books. When I saw that she endorsed it, I wondered why. I usually like her choices. Not this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing.","review":"I was really disappointed in this book and reminded not to assume a book is good because it has a lot of blurbs. This seemed more like a first novel to me. While it contained some scenes and snippets that were well-written, they seemed forced together. I never believed what the narrator was feeling towards her old housemate and it didn't help that he sounded like a jerk the whole time anyway. Instead of the story flowing, I felt that the author just wrote her way out of each situation. Really not good, and I was disappointed that I used up a couple hours of my life reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ever wonder?","review":"Ever wonder what your life might be like if you'd made a different choice, in career, mate, etc? Ever feel as if you've missed out on something? This is what Jo Becker, the main character had to be thinking in WHILE I WAS GONE. Then one day, something does happen. An old friend from years ago walks into the place where she works and things get turned upsidedown. I was really struck by the excellent writing in this novel--the beauty of it reminded me at times of McCrae's \\"Bark of the Dogwood\\" thought the subject matter was completely different. If you're looking for a well crafted book, this is one to try."},{"rating":"2","title":"To the anonymous reviewer from Washington","review":"Thank you so much for naming the murderer. I really appreciate reading a review - note it's not a book club discussion, but rather a review -- that gives away one of the primary elements of suspense in the book. THANK YOU SO MUCH. Next time, please just state generalities instead of telling people who have not read the book what is going to happen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read this and wish you were reading it, While You were Gone","review":"I have enjoyed Sue Miller in the past, but this book just didn't do it for me. While the premise got my interest, the plot is so thinly constructed and the characters so unexceptional, I plowed my way through the book thinking, \\"I wish I, too, were gone.\\"Finally, the resolution is disappointing and one closes the book thinking, \\"What a dissatisfying ending to a dissatisfying book.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"A real snoozer","review":"I kept waiting for this book to get more interesting, for something to happen. I was disapointed that nothing ever did. I felt it was a weak story that the author attempted to disguise with her overuse of descriptive language. There are much better Oprah books out there to read. This is the only one out of ten which I didn't like."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully Crafted ...","review":"As soon as I hit the second page, I knew this book was going to be a wonderful read. Jo leads a life that is flawed, intense, conflicted. She has feelings she can't explain, like people do. She hits a point in her life where her past is incorporated to her present, though they were different eras indeed. As Jo experiences emotions, I felt the words on the page were perfectly crafted, and ones that captured beautifully what was happening. I felt the emotions myself at heart level as I read.This is my first Sue Miller book, but it won't be the last."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sue simply did not show any central idea behind this.","review":"The theme of this book seemed to be slightly conveyed as being about the feminine-manifesto, but she simply does not show exactly what she means by giving very general descriptions that can be interpreted as meaning almost anything and she makes it the reader's job to interpret it into a positive light as she suggests so delicately. I do not appreciate such matters of writing, and did not enjoy the way in which this book seems to have been put together."},{"rating":"1","title":"not what i was hoping for","review":"While reading this book, the only reason I continued was the feeling that it was just about to get interesting. I was truly disappointed because it never did. I felt like I flew 10 hours in an airplane, 50 feet off the ground and when I landed, realized I hadn't gone anywhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"Jo is such a great character. I could relate to her desperate wanderings from this life to her past life. Wondering which life was the best life. Always wanting something different from what she has. I thought that she was a very believable character, and very sympathetic. I also felt that Daniel was very credible. I saw a lot of men I know rolled up into his character."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hoped for more","review":"I had just completed my last final exam of an 11 year \\"return to college\\". Imagine my delight as I sat down & turned the TV to Oprah to see her introduce her latest book club selection! Finally a chance to read something without having to hold a highlighter in my right hand. But what a disappointment I was in for! I couldn't understand any of the characters. How could Jo & her husband be together when they seemed to value different things? I couldn't imagine a group of young people living together in the 1960's being more uptight than this group was. Dana sounded like an annoying, people pleaser, who never heard the word \\"boundary\\" before. Eli was pompous, shallow & weak. The ending of the story was frustrating & made me glad when the story was over. As someone who has missed reading for pleasure for many years, I hope this choice isn't indicative of Oprah's other Book Club selections."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVED this Book!","review":"This was one of those rare books that I couldn't put down! Sue Miller is a very descriptive writer, so you can actually \\"see\\" what she is writing about which makes the story seem so much more realistic. I really grew to like the main character Jo. She seems to be someone you find yourself relating to in various ways - although you are glad you are not in her shoes in some instances. A very well written book with an amazing twisting and turning story."},{"rating":"2","title":"A thought provoking read","review":"I hesitated to buy this book- I bought it and did not read it for awhile. Finally in desperation for something to read, I picked it up again. I identified with Jo, her thoughts and her feelings and it made me want to turn the pages to see what happens. I am not married, nor do I have children, but there was something about the way she processed her life that at times made me want to kick her for being so stupid, but at others could say- yep, know how you are feeling. It was thought provoking and a departure from my usual Patricia Cornwall books. I enjoyed this book and I am glad I read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"fractured","review":"I thought this book had too much information that didn\`t mean much and not enough explanation at one time to explain enough. It was too long for the storyit told. I didn\`t really like any of the characters but if I had to pick one it would be Cass because she was believable. Jo seemed to lack substace and even at the end of the book I still didn\`t know her husband.My favorite parts of the book are her get right to the heart of it descriptions of people and situations such as, Know this about me and yet LOVE ME----PLEASE or on page 154 where her grown children realize their mom had a past life that didn\`t include them. Your children never think of you in any other way than mom or dad and especially mom. Other than those few really great descriptions I just thought this book lacked depth and so did it\`s character."},{"rating":"2","title":"Audiobook review","review":"I enjoy listening to audiobooks while I drive and oftentimes (unless read by the author), I find the reader's voice irritating. This reader (Blair Brown) was very good and easy to listen to. Moreover, the story was wonderful.Beyond this, While You Were Gone is also a morality tale about telling and secrets and forgiveness. Miller subtly draws in the ethical conflicts with Jo's husband Daniel, a minister, as the foil.While You Were Gone gave me a rich new outlook on long-time relationships and family shaping them. This is my first Sue Miller and I will definitely read more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sue Miller Never Disappoints","review":"I got this book only because Sue Miller is the author. I had absolutely no idea what it was about, didn't even read the book flaps. I just plunged in expecting Miller's talent would shine through. I was NOT disppointed. She has such a way with being able to create an unusual but entirely believable situation and present it entirely from a woman's point of view. And not a sappy woman either. But strong and individualistic. Miller never breaks away to give the husband's or the daughter's viewpoint. It stays focused right on the main character, as painful as that may be. I could SEE this woman, and her home and her life and I could FEEL and identify with her every breath and emotion. An unsettling but fascinating read."},{"rating":"1","title":"I suppose I should have skipped this one","review":"This book is heavy with angst, I suppose. I suppose, I did not care for any of the characters. It was actually depressing, I suppose. All the characters sounded alike to me. How many times can one say, \\"I suppose,\\" in a novel. Well, I wished I had started counting from the beginning, because there must be over 100 \\"I supposes.\\" It was so distracting!!! After a while it was about how many \\"I supposes,\\" I could find in one page. And all the characters spoke the same. And Daniel, please for being a minister he sure knows how to meet out punishment, for a crime that never even happened. Oh my God. If you have limited time, skip this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"while i was gone","review":"Well written, but uninteresting.Sue Miller can write, she'sgood at developing characters, and also at writing dialogue. But I found this particular story is quite ordinary, even though it deals w/a particular horrific event. It's surprising that there couldn't have been more of a payoff after going through this journey.By the middle I was so bored, but was determined to finish this book, hoping that it would have some kind of exciting finish. Very disappointing.I doubt I'll pick up her future books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good summer read","review":"Oprah's May pick surprised and pleased me.

I found the plot line predictable and the characters were poorly developed. Why did this lady become a vet? At no point in her Cambridge days does she express a desire to help anyone or anything but herself. Why does she marry a minister? At no point does she explore her own faith. I found her very self-centered and unlikeable--someone who is watching life from the outside, always living in a dreamworld and never truly talking the risks that would allow her to grow. Pass this one up."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm surprised Oprah liked it!","review":"The author writes in excruciating (but not interesting) detail. She writes about the main character's every move throughout the day... maybe it's part of the moral of the story, but I found it boring. It was also hard to sympathize with the main character. I could see where the writer was going in terms of the message she wanted to communicate, but I think the story was poorly told."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time","review":"This is a shallow, meaningless, empty book that leaves a bad taste in your mouth. I got sucked in during the first chapters with her description of a 50ish woman living in Martha Stewart dreamland (successful career, loving husband, 3 beautiful daughters, gorgeous house, etc.).

You get to take care of and understand animals as a veterinarian. But your life still seems to miss some spark and so a murder mystery is thrown into the mix. All of your friends are affiliated with Harvard, Berkeley, or some other high prestige place--no Illinois State or blue color workers for you. This was a truly awful book written for dreamy status-seekers with no empathy or understanding of the real world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read; bad ending","review":"I thought this was a nice book. Miller's prose is vivid and she gradually builds suspense throughout the novel. I had a hard time sympathizing with Jo, the main character, although she was definitely believable, and of course flaws help make characters realistic. I was disappointed that the ending did not further resolve the murder of Jo's friend, Dana. We know who did it, but still no resolution."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rambling story about unlikeable characters","review":"Just because it's an Oprah read doesn't mean it's a worthy read.I found this book rambled on, back and forth in time, in an annoying manner. The characters are all unlikeable, I found myself not caring at all about the main character and very annoyed at her whole demeanor. I'm surprised I made it to the end of the book. I guess I had hoped it would get better. It didn't. I breathed a sigh of relief when I was done with the whole ordeal."},{"rating":"1","title":"My last Oprah book","review":"I've read this author before, For Love, and found the writing weak. Same thing for this book. The murder was the only exciting event in the story, but nothing happened with it. The characters are weak and unlikeable, even the animals were mediocre. Maybe if I was in the same boat as the leading character, married and unhappy (but she doesn't know it yet) I would understand the book. Most of Oprah's books have turned out to be all hype and no substance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enthralling","review":"I couldn't put this book down - I read it from cover to cover without stopping.

Whether it's because my selections have been so well chosen (ha!) or some other factor I don't know; \\"While I Was Gone,\\" however, has been the one exception.I got to the middle and then read a little bit further before I couldn't take it anymore. I was waiting patiently, to no avail, for the story to pick up the pace.There are two main reasons why I found this novel so boring:1. The plot---the \\"twist.\\" Everything that unravels I saw coming. If you read a lot and pay attention to detail, you'll figure the book out pretty quick. This makes for a pretty uninteresting reading experience.2. The characters. Miller doesn't give me a reason to care about them or what happens to them. She provides emotional moments that do little more than make me think \\"oh, how sad or oh, how unfortunate.\\" Sort of the same trite response one comes up with when reading through the myriad of unfortunate but mundane tragedies in the newspaper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Miller's best work","review":"Try Sue Miller's other books, or readRabid: A Novelby T.K. Kenyon or Bee Season: A Novel by Myla Goldberg.I'm too young and too foreign to bring much to this book, but you shouldn't have to bring a similar history to enjoy and understand a book. I don't think I ever will understand why Americans in the 60's and 70's were so obsessed with very misrepresented Indian culture. The details seemed disjointed, and the culture of \\"free love\\" and bohemian living is so different from the type of world that I grew up in.Beyond the setting and premise, the main character Jo Becker seems like a whiner who is always longing for something better than she's got. The ending was unsatisfying and unsettling, but not in a good way. My book club fantasized about more satisfying endings instead of discussing the book itself.Sorry.Minna"},{"rating":"2","title":"Betrayal","review":"In While I was Gone, Sue Miller takes us deeply inside a marriage. We always are surprised when people get divorced because marriages look different from the outside than the inside. Sometimes pretty on the outside, ugly inside. With this one between a vet and a minister we go inside the very fabric. We enter the bedroom. We enter the bed, the life of the mind, the life of the body, the life of the soul, the life of the parents, and when the fraying begins, we feel it acutely, a grind against our own gears. We feel the unravelling acutely. We are never the same.

I found it to be extremely boring and tedious. Seriously, three pages on the morning routine of feeding the dogs? And this is not beautiful Proust-like detail, or points that move the plot along - it's just listing of steps. I didn't find the emotion and realness that other reviewers found - I mainly found an unlikeable narrator and an overall premise so conservative (really? you go live in a communal house in the 60s but you don't have any sex or do any drugs?) that I don't see the point of investing time reading it. This book takes no risks. It might have been great as a novella."},{"rating":"2","title":"While I Was Gone","review":"This was my first Sue Miller book, but it will not be my last!I read \\"While I Was Gone\\" in a few days...Sue Miller has a gift as a writer to bring the reader inside the pages,the world, and situations she is writing about. I liked the main charactor, Jo....her honesty towards her husband, and I found out things about myself that I hadn't reflected on before. Ofcourse, Jo's husband was too good to be true, an angel really, to put up with her infacuations. One of my favorite parts is when Jo tells her husband about her \\"so called almost affair\\" and she knows he sees her walking out to her car, but he stands hidden in the garage. I think everyone should read this book, dive into the pages and swim directly into the lives of these characters ......You may just find something out about yourselves!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to get into the story","review":"I too am ambivalent about this book. At times it was interesting but the author added way too many extraneous details which end up making the story a patchwork quilt. I think that the author could have and SHOULD have spent more time developing the characters with whom Jo (the main character) comes in contact with. I'm a Gen X-er so maybe I can't understand middle aged angst, but this adult woman appears to be more self-centered than a teenager. I will say that Miller does a good job at creating a character that one can neither hate nor love -- but the character is also not one who can consistently hold the reader's interest.

I don't usually like \\"flashback\\" type books, but this is well handled, and, besides, I was there in her former life (or one VERY much like it) and I know how it haunts one even to this day.

She brings certain psychological nuances to consciousness. The character of Dana was very strong, and the symbolism in actions by her family members was an artistic treat. However, I felt like the author was simply celebrating mediocraty. For her to write a book about the fantasies and unsettling of a person bent for some excitement and then coupling it with the unlikely \\"passionate murder\\" was just too fantastic for me. Murder is overdone, and I thought that part was a big yawn.

Actually, scanning through the table of contents, I don't remember anything about most of them. I can say that I was not bored reading this book, it was just interminably long.

Some of their worst efforts in their careers and they don't really rock that well. Even Megadeth's song sounds so self-deprecating in some cases. Sir Mix-A-Lot's redo of his song comes off as lame. And the Beavis and Butt-head number with Cher sounds silly and out of place. Come To Butt-head sounds corny. Only the Run-DMC song Bounce, and Aerosmith's rocking Deuces are Wild stand out of this mess. The others sound like they were left on the cutting room floors in studios and that's not good.

It takes courage to write about the experiences she's had emotionally. Especially when it involves being heartfelt and honest about the giant step of having a baby.Anyone who is pregnant or plans to become pregnant should read this book regardless of whether or not you have a history with depression or other mental illnesses. Many of the feelings and emotions Ms. Slater expresses about having a baby are ones that many women have, but are not honest enough to express. Reading about her experiences and emotions authenticates just how serious a choice having a baby is, not just for someone with mental illness, but for every responsible couple.This is a good, informative and honest piece of writing. I would recommend it highly to anyone who wants an emotional look at what it's like to be pregnant.

In fact I was somewhat mortified at how much more I enjoyed her book than my own (The Zygote Chronicles) - and my jacket quote reflects my awe for her talent as well as this marvelous, spare, brilliant journey into motherhood.

After giving a thorough explanation of how the human memory works, the author then launches into several chapters on mnemonics. Perhaps the most helpful chapter of the whole book was the one on remembering names and faces.Reading the reviews caused me to expect much more than what the author delivered.

Several months and 20-30 brads more and again it smokes. On disassembly, I discovered two brads jammed in the thing. This stopped the solenoid from completing it's cycle. Unless it completes and a lever hits a microswitch, the circuit continues to power the solenoid coil.A resistor, R1, on the circuit board is used as a current limiter and a fuse. This resistor over heats and burns itself and the moisture-proof board coating. The solenoid and the rest of the board is fine.There is a place for a fuse on the board, but a circuit board trace makes it inoperative, if it was there.It is repairable, but with the jamming being fairly common, it's just not worth the bother. I will find an air driven brad nailer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Questionable Quality Control","review":"I bought mine through a national hardware chain store. It worked well for about three weeks of light to moderate use, then just stopped. A smell of burning electrical insulation and emitted smoke convinced me that the solenoid had burned out. I received a brand new product in exchange for the defective one, but the new one shot just two nails, then stopped -- with the same problem as the first. I returned to the store and they obligingly let me try the next one before I left the store with it. I tried three additional nailers, all of which failed after a few (between 3 and 7) operations. Too bad; I liked how the nailer worked, and it was easy to clear occasional jams. My suspicion is that the solenoid is underpowered for the surge current that generates the nailing force.

On their way to \\"Hendersonville,\\" a series of grisily, but rather cute, murders are committed by Justin. This is a pretty good movie, but I don't think it would be all that great if it didn't have Mark Hamill in it. He plays a good nut (no offence). The movie storyline leaves something to be desired.

The bullet would have to be the size of his torso to do that kind of damage TO A SHEET OF PAPER!Well, I think I saw that in MIDNIGHT RIDE at the very end. Look closely as the hero dispatches the villian with a single gunshot to the forehead.

Every aspect of their glorious and dynamic lives they share! And they don't attempt to paint a rosy picture of the U.S. Navy.

Then, I let the kids start playing with it, and while they were enjoying the chalk board I notice that the white board side looked like there was a gritty film on it, so I made a small squiggle to see how well it would erase, and it barely erased at all!

He is superb in his role, but was gutted when he is only in the long opening sequence. The film itself does have messages in it, mainly about forgiveness and healing. Quite violent, and with average performances from Peterson and Rossi. The great Paul Winfield is great, but again, only in one scene. The film has a great cast, but some what wasted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Written because of and due to a Pompous Audience","review":"If someone really understands even a fraction of what's being written in this book, then no doubt whoever does so goes looking at other books.

Except for period buildings, and staging the scenes with WWII figures and paraphernalia, some very basic diorama ideas on detailing etc can be gleaned from this offering. The quality of the figures is very poor. I note the very incisive comments by the Hong Kong reviewer on the quality of the car model. Why only two dioramas are presented is another matter, but the whole book feels incomplete and shoddy to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book for pros","review":"I have made several of the dioramas Scutts explains.

The boy on the box can't be older than two because the vest looks huge on him and in fact, it is very short. I ordered it for my four-year-old son and it stops just below his waist, which looks a little silly with his t-shirt coming down to his hips. Also, on the box the blue near the collar appears to be the aqua color that Diego wears but in reality it is a light/medium blue. The vest seems to be made of a very thin micro nylon fabric that is so flimsy it doesn't even close in the front and just hangs open. There are two velcro straps on each side of the vest that hold the front and back of the vest together. Our box arrived with a big dent in the side and the binoculars were smashed. This being said, I know Amazon will replace the binoculars and we'll begrudgingly keep it, as my son really wants to be Diego for Halloween."},{"rating":"1","title":"Barely fits my 22 month old son","review":"My son loves Diego. He was Diego for Halloween. When we received it through Amazon, I was suprised at how poor the vest was constructed and the cheap materials used.

The toys that came with it were fun for my son and he plays with those but not so much the vest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let down","review":"First off, yes, the vest runs small. Second, because it is the thinnest, cheapest nylon, with velcro on the sides (adjustable that way, I guess), it easily gets twisted and all the velcro is caught up with itself, and my son (4) needs help straightening it out. It is VERY difficult for a child to clip the tools on to the little loops, as well, so the vest has been tossed aside. The \\"canteen\\"? A TOTAL waste- it is a round piece of plastic. It doesn't open, so you can't even pack a bit of water for them. That got tossed aside. The cell-phone looking thing works alright- he plays with it occasionally, but the phrase repertoire is limited, so in retrospect, I bought this junk for the binoculars, which are cute, and easy to look through because it's actually one wide opening, and my son likes those, so if you want to pay for those, then have at it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste you money","review":"This is cheap junk and isn't worth more than $15. The vest is made out of material similar to a disposable tablecloth or something. The communicator came with dead batteries that cost $15 dollars to replace.

Since it has \\"Diego\\" on it, I expect that I'm going to get charged more than the item is worth, but this is really outrageous. For the price, they ought to at least make some kind of an effort. How about making it out of canvas or something? This vest is on par with those cheap halloween costumes you can pick up at the last minute at the drugstore.

I wouldn't label this a 'must-own' book, but more of a highly recommend to read/borrow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice easel but chalkboard needs work","review":"Nice easel except for the chalkboard but I solved that problem. First, I did have to prime it many times using the Melissa & Doug Jumbo chalk. What priming basically does is it sands the board down so that it will be easier to write. Second, I realized that the chalk my child was using on it was horrible. For priming the Melissa & Doug Jumbo chalk is fine but not for actually writting with it. The M&D; dustless multicolored chalk is better but what really worked on this chalkboard is thisDIX61400 - Prang Hygieia Dustless Board Chalk, 3-1/4 x 3/8, Assorted, 12 Sticks/Box. These Prang chalks has vibrant colors, they write really smoothly and thickly and they are of great quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"My son had an absolute blast (taking it apart)","review":"Just look at those beautiful and colorful knobs! The easel is incredibly sturdy (if the child doesn't try to take it apart). But no matter how hard you tighten those colorful knobs, a little boy with mechanical aptitude will be able to take them off. They were too much for my son to resist, so he basically took the thing apart several times. One time it almost came crashing down upon him. You'd think he'd learn! But I think the thrill of taking it apart far exceeded the risk of having it crash down on him. So if you have a child that you think can resist dismantling this \\"toy\\", by all means buy it. My son is 3. Maybe the age recommendation should be 4+ or 5+."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Budding Little Artist Loves It","review":"My five year old daughter received this for Christmas, and spent the entire next day in front of it. It is height adjustable, and was very easy to assemble. I do recommend getting the accessory kit that goes along with this easel. It contains the paint buckets that fit perfectly in the shelf, as well as a large roll of paper designed to go on the dowel in the middle and supply tons of new canvas. The smock that goes along with this unit would also be another good accessory. It has saved a few of my daughter's shirts already."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easel made a big hit Christmas Day","review":"Our granddaughter is 2 yrs old and she colored on this Easel off and on every day she was here over Christmas. The low height is just right for her now and I can see where it will last many years as she grows taller. Also, she just used the paper to color. She wasn't as much interested in the chalk board as it wasn't nearly as bright when she drew on it. Also, it was not as easy for her to draw on. When she is a little older I'm sure she will love the chalk board and white board just as much. I researched the easels before purchasing this one and am very please with my choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great Art board","review":"Easy to assemble, easy to use. good for many ages. great activities for my daughter. decent quality very happy with the purchase. dont forget to buy paper, chalk and crayons"},{"rating":"2","title":"great easel","review":"Adjusts to even the smallest tyke, that said it is much cheaper on the Kohl's site as are the rolls of paper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Study and LARGE!","review":"This is a great easel.

It seems very sturdy and durable, obviously important when being used by a 3 yr, old, and I love that the bolts have smooth plastic covers. My daughter has already used and abused the chalk board and it is still looking great! The paper that pulls through is wonderful for painting, but she hasn't learned that the marker is strictly for the dry erase, so she used it on the paper and we had to explain to her. I think this will be truly excellent for cultivating her creativity and imagination and is a very useful educational tool as we can use it for her to practice writing as well as drawing and painting. I am very pleased with this purchase!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT Worth the $$","review":"It's very tempting for parents to want to get this sort of thing. . . but unless your kids are really into art, it isn't worth it.1. it takes up A LOT of space2. it leads to constant messes. I am picking up chalk all the time.3. my son's favorite thing about this easel was to disassemble it. :)We found 2 better alternatives which we do USE all the time.1. A magnetic black board which hangs on our entryway wall. Used all the time. Takes up NO SPACE. Hung with Command Strips. Total with markers, $302. using masking tape, tape pieces of paper to the kids table. Let them go crazy. Clean up. Super cheap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Construction and durability is HORRIBLE!","review":"Don't waste your time with this product!! It is constructed horribly and not very durable. The place where the paper roll sits isn't very sturdy and broke on DAY 1 and the paper roll kept falling down over and over again. My husband tried to rig it to stay up but it is so cheaply made that there wasn't much he could do.My daughter wanted an easel so badly and returning it was not an option since we already threw away the box. Eventually my daughter used it, without the paper roll attached. But, that is not why I bought it....I am not a happy consumer at all!! Stay away from this item.Lastly....we had it for some time now and one day I was in the basement and I was looking at it...sitting there unused and I got really angry, that my daughter got no practical use out of it. I e-mailed the owner of Melissa and Doug with a complaint...GOT NO RESPONSE. Enough said!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Arsenic","review":"I know the tests were done in 2009 (when my mother bought this for my daughter), but Healthystuff.org says in 2009 the white board part of this easel tested positive for arsenic.My daughter loves this easel and also has the Melissa & Doug easel companion set that came with paint, chalk, paintbrushes, erasers etc and loves those too. The chalk works great. The paper roll that I believe comes separate as well is awesome tho the paper is a little thin.If I had known then that this had arsenic I would've taken it back but she's been playing with it for a year now...a little late."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect toy, except for the chalkboard","review":"Our 2 year old loves this toy. He loves the dry erase marker side and loves to paint. It is everything they said it is and Melissa and Doug toys are some of the best on the market. The only knock I have with the product is the chalk board isn't very good. It doesn't show up well, erase well or generally speaking, work well like a chalkboard should. It seems they skimped a bit on that piece of the product.That being said, it is a very good product and our little guy loves it when we pull the paints and markers out for him to play. Get the additional accessory kit too. It is worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Purchase!!","review":"We purchased this for our 7 year daughter and it is great! I was a little leary of purchasing it because of the other negative reviews for the chalkboard, but ours works just fine. My daughter uses sidewalk chalk. It is great for kids of all ages because it is adjustable. Younger and older can enjoy this. The overall construction is very sturdy and feel she can use it for years to come. The trays are a great size for all of the art supplies and they are of a heavy, durable construction. We are extremely pleased with the entire product and feel it looks more expensive than what we paid for it. If you buy this, you will not be dissappointed. Also, we loved how quickly it came. We ordered it on a Friday and we had it the following Tuesday! Plus, the price decreased since Christmas and we got an even better deal!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gift item very much enjoyed...","review":"I gave this item to a soon to be 4 year old girl.

Except for some paint and chalk marks on the wood it still looks new. I was surprised when I received it because the chalkboard is plastic. I thought it would never work but it works great with every kind of chalk we have tried. The wood is sturdy and the spot for a paper roll is great. I would be nice if there was a paper cutting piece on both sides for when two children are playing at once but it's not a big deal. Wooden trays and real hardware rather than the plastic knobs would make it perfect. My kids don't but I could see many children taking it apart because of the lack of real hardware."},{"rating":"2","title":"great easel","review":"it was easy to put together (though I should have done this before my niece opened her present wondering what was in the box!!).

The oldest two I do pre-school with M-F. This easel has been an awesome purchase! My kids love the dry-erase board, but play on the chalk board too. There only two drawbacks I think. 1. It has a rod that holds large paper (to paint on). That rod only holds the Melissa and Doug paper you have to order it. I wish it had a longer rod to hold the Walmart sized paper. 2. The dry-erase bucket has nice holders for any paint you would use (which I don't use as often as the markers), but the markers don't really have an organized spot. Overall though, this easel is a great motivator for kids. The fact that it can grow with a child really adds to its advantages!"},{"rating":"1","title":"cheap wood","review":"We received this as a gift. My two+ year old was ecstatic about this. We set it up easily enough and she began drawing on it right away. While putting it together I noticed the wood was bowed in a couple of locations on both legs. That bothered me, but I thought it would be fine. However, it seems I should have been more concerned. As she moved it slightly, across our wood floors where there was no resistance, one of the legs snapped right into. It should not have been so easy to break. I'm sure it was the cheap wood the main frame/legs are made of. The rest is nice, but now what do I do without a frame? Reconstruct a new one? Not happy about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good quality for the price","review":"Although this is mostly MDF, the product is durable and feels sturdy. It does not feel cheap.

Quality is fair- not great but not bad, either. All the parts fit well and the finish is ok.

It is fantastic entertainment and really brings out his artistic skills. He also received the Melissa & Doug accessory pack for the easel and it is full of great items. The ONLY ONLY ONLY thing I would have to say that I wish was a little different is the wood of the easel. It seems that it needs to be finished with some type of sealer or finishing product. The bare wood is rough and when you have a child as young as mine (3) painting and coloring, they are going to color on the wood and it does not clean off and smears when you try to wipe it off. This is not a big deal at all, but it just seems a sealant would be helpful. Looking forward to all of my future wall art from my little artist!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Melissa & Doug easel","review":"item is sturdy and easy to assemble.

Like others have noted it does not work. One way to fix it is to use chalkboard paint. It comes in a spray can & you can buy it at an arts & crafts supply store. We purchased for $6.00. Just tape up the wood frame & spray the paint. When it dries the chalkboard works great. Hope this helps. HAPPY NEW YEAR!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"I bought this item for my 3 year old daughter and had the same problem with the chalkboard (not working so well).

I will buy Melissa and Doug toys for years to come."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kids easel","review":"I know several people who own this product as well. We all have the same complaint - the chalkboard doesn't work!

Otherwise, it's a nice easel and my son loves it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chalkboard is horrible and pieces come off easily","review":"My 2 1/2 yr old son actually loves this product but he loves to take it apart as well. We tighten the little colored pegs and a few weeks later he's taking them off again. So far he's brought me pretty much everything that can come off including bolts with small washers. Thank goodness he's past the stage of sticking everything in his mouth. Also like everyone else we've had the same problem with the chalk board scratching just from writing on it with chalk. I've always liked the Melissa and Doug products we've purchased but I wouldn't reccomend this easel at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad!","review":"My girls got this easel for Christmas 2009. The chalkboard never worked well, you could barely even see the chalk on it and we did follow the directions for priming the chalkboard. The white board would not erase. I had to end up covering the white board with clear contact paper which erased better the the board itself. Then after six months one of the legs broke off,I glued and taped the leg back on, then another leg broke off! At that point I just put it in the trash."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome buy","review":"My 4 year old daughter loves her new easel. I was hesitant in buying at first because some reviews said the chalkboard didnt work right. After I assembled it, the directions said the chalkboard must be \\"seasoned\\" before use. I took a chalk and covered the board in horizontal movements then got a paper towel and in circular overlapping motions, wiped the board. The board worked perfectly after that! A downside for me is the easel seems a bit flimsy. But as long as your child isnt hanging off of it....its great! Anyway, I highly recommend this for your lil artist at home!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great easel","review":"I bought this easel to replace a Fisher Price Spark Art easel that my daugthter received for Chirstmas, which I detested for numerous reasons. The M&D easel was easy to build, is very durable and functional, cleans up beautifully. Its just perfect. I love that it comes with clips. I bought chalk, dry erase markers and two erasers to compliment the easel. The drawing surface is dual-sided, large and height adjustable. It can also be used to paints as it has cups holes. I only paid just over $30 and had free shipping. I paid more than twice for the FP easel. The M&D easel is a tremendous value."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT STRONG OR STURDY","review":"I bought this for my daughter over a year ago and the legs snapped just under the bins a week after buying it and she hadn't even used it yet. So, now we lean it against the wall and just flip it depending on the side she wants to use. The chalk board is difficult to write on and the knobs keep coming loose on their own so they need constant re-tightening. I wanted a nice looking easel that would last, but I should have bought one of those bright plastic obnoxious versions instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"My two-year-old loves it.","review":"This easel is bigger than you might think - just make sure you have room for it.

It's heavy, so I am happy we spent the extra money for a Melissa & Doug product. Our son is tough on toys. We bought the starter kit and extra paper as well.

We keep it in the garage and use it on the driveway for painting only (never have used the dry-erase or chalkboard features). If I were getting it for inside of my house I would go for a higher end product."},{"rating":"2","title":"sturdy easel","review":"This easel was just what we needed! With two sides on which little artists can work, we have no more arguments about whose turn it is. The ability to switch from chalk to dry erase markers or paper is also a benefit. One quibble is that the easel did not come with a roll of paper (which is only available right before Christmas in stores around here), so order that and any other art supplies you might need (chalk, dry erase markers, etc.) at the same time you order your easel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice product!","review":"I am very pleased with this easel I purchased for my 5 year old daughter. The product was super easy to assemble and seems to be quite sturdy. I would definitely recommend it to any parent looking to spark their child's imagination.

Our one big complaint is that the easel screws are large bright colored objects that beckon little hands to unscrew them. We have had this about 9 months and she has probably screwed and unscrewed every screw on the easel. Overall a good value but far far to easy to take apart if you have a little one that is super curious and likes to take things apart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for small artists.","review":"We bought this for our kids for Christmas and they love it.My wife has two complaints:1) The chalkboard is much too smooth. The chalk just slides across it instead of writing, but that might change over time.2) It didn't come with at least one roll of paper. I don't mind getting the paint and other random supplies separately, but to not have basic paper to use to start out with seems rather thoughtless on the manufacturers part to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"cheap","review":"this fell apart within a year of usage. I called the company and complained and they seemed helpful and eager to replace it but I never heard from them again when they were supposed to call me back.

If you move it, it will start to fall apart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great but not so easy to fold away","review":"This is a great product. My daughter (2.5) loves it. I had read bad reviews concerning the chalkboard, but found out that it works just fine when you use good chalks. The Melissa & Dough chalks are too hard and their colors too dark.

We have a number of their items but this is cheap. DO NOT BUY!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Melissa and *Shrug*","review":"Pretty disappointed with this product. It was mostly easy to put together, but the actual construction of the parts is poor. Two of the four legs are warped and every hole drilled in it is splintered and cheap looking and slightly off in spacing requiring a decent bit of muscle to make sure the boards line up. The edges of each piece of wood are incredibly sharp, too. I had to sand the corners down so they didn't continue to slice my hand as I put the thing together and for the safety of my son handling the thing. It will definitely get the job done as an easel, but I am disappointed in the quality of its construction for the cost. Melissa and Doug is usually better than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the money!","review":"We recently purchased this product for our 2yr old daughter to give her a place to color, rather than using our walls for her canvas. I had been looking at other easels and am very pleased that I chose the Melissa & Doug standing easel. It is super easy to put together. The easel is adjustable to meet varying height requirements. I love the use of primary colors on the screws, clips, and trays. It also folds pretty flat so it's easy to hide, if need be.I chose not to purchase the paper roll and found that I could by one at a Swedish furniture store for much cheaper that fits perfectly. Speaking of the paper rolls, this easel allows the paper to feed through a slot above the white board and clamp down at the bottom to hold the paper in place. A brilliant feature.I highly recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Artist at work!","review":"We bought this for our 5 year old for Christmas. He loves to draw.

I'm thinking they must have changed it to save money. It's horrible. Can't even draw on it. It's like have a really old, worn chalkboard. Very disappointed. Now I'm going to have to spend money to buy chalkboard paint."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shoddy Quality","review":"I am very disappointed in the quality of the product. The wooden parts were barely sanded and there was no varnish of any kind on the wood. It looked like someone had run it roughly through a table saw and stuck it in the box. In addition to the poor craftsmanship, one of the support legs was incredibly warped. I am returning it immediately."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Easel","review":"I was a little worried when I saw all the reviews complaining about the chalk board. I even bought some chalkboard paint expecting to have to paint over the chalkboard. I have been perfectly happy with both the chalkboard and the dry erase board. This is a great little easel, I can't really think of anything I'd change about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing easel - the best investment in your child's creativity!","review":"I bought each of the items below for my three children ages 5, 8 & 9 for Christmas.Melissa & Doug Deluxe Standing EaselMelissa & Doug Easel Accessory SetMelissa & Doug Easel Pad Bundle 50 Sheets 2-PackMelissa & Doug Deluxe Easel Paper (3 pack bundle)Each of these items are very high quality, and I have recommended them to everyone I talk to about what to get their children for birthday/Christmas any gifting opportunity. The smock is able to fit all of my children, despite the wide age range. The easel has settings that are adjustable for different height settings, which is useful for those with younger children, when they grow, the easel can grow with them. My children were elated with this gift, and I will purchase Melissa & Doug products as often as possible, the quality is the best I've found among children's toys."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor packaging!","review":"This was to be a gift for my granddaughter. The site brags about the way the easel itself is packed, but the outer box was crushed and torn and the inner box is in even worse condition! I cannot tell if the item itself is damaged without completely unpacking it but to return it it must be unopened. If it is okay, I'm not sure if I could repackage it so I could send it to her.The only material padding the inner box is strips of brown paper -- there may as well have been no padding at all!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing Items","review":"I ordered this easel for my grandson for Christmas. When it was opened it was missing the paper and the paints. Both items are shown on the package. It wasn't much fun when the important parts were missing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"This easel is a good purchase. It has held up well and the kids enjoy using it. They especially enjoy the dry erase board. If you have aspiring artists in your house then this is perfect for them. It is sturdy, easy to assemble and does not take up too much space. I am glad I purchased it. Two kids and a two sided easel are perfect...no fights!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Easel BUT...............","review":"I love the size of this. It's easy to adjust. I have 4 children playing with it ages 10, 7, 5, & 3.BUT......... The chalk board really won't let you chalk easily and the dry erase board is staining.... No matter what brand I use...Frustrating for me and the kids.I'm going to contact the company and also do what another reviewer suggested; buy the chalk board paint to make it better...."},{"rating":"2","title":"this product is fun and educational","review":"Melissa & Doug Standing easel Board is great, i use it to teach my 4 year old daughter how yo write her name, and her letters & numbers, she loves to pratice on it , like she's in school and her handwritting skills are improving alot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun for the little ones- but spendy!","review":"We have only had this easel for a month, but my almost 3 year old has been using it daily. He loves the chalk board especially. When building it I ran into trouble and my hubby had to rebuild (haha). It is spendy to buy the easel paper as some have commented, but it is purely a matter of choice and look when purchasing- the kids like anything they can have fun with and this happens to have multiple uses (chalkboard, dry erase board, painting, coloring, sticker play with markers, etc). Happy coloring!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product!","review":"The Melissa & Doug Deluxe Easel is a great product!! My 5 year old daughter got this as a Christmas present this year and has spent many hours writing, drawing, and coloring. The only thing I would recommend is some rubber pads for the legs. We have wood floors and it moves a bit when she uses it. Overall, we are extremely satisfied."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great investment","review":"After doing much research on easels for our 5 year old daughter, this one did NOT let us down.

This is a necessity in my house. I have 2 very creative preschoolers. They use this EVERY day. We already used up a whole roll of paper in the month we have had it. It is very sturdy, durable, and lots of fun. It was a very good price. I love that you can adjust the trays and the boards for height. Buy it! You will love it (and so will the kids)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Easel","review":"This easel is awesome. I don't know why they have to cost $[...] when this one is inexpensive and great quality. My kids love it and it keeps the mess all in one place.

He uses sidewalk chalk and a dry erase and chalk eraser. We bought the markers at walmart with a cleaning solution for the white board. My 1 yr old daughter likes to pull herself up on the trays and the legs. We love how sturdy it is. we havn't bought the paper for it yet and probably won't for sometime. this was a great buy! The price was lower on this easel then alot of the plastic and not as sturdy wooden ones. We have alot of melissa and doug toys and we rate them all very high."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"We purchased this for our 3-and-half year old daugther for Christmas and we love it! She uses it everyday. She is learning to write so it's very helpful in her learning. It is amazing to see her creativity grow!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"I've come to expect great quality from Melissa and Doug products and this is no exception. It was really easy to put together (with labeling and instructions, a no brainer) and quick. My son (just turned 3) loves the white board and chalk board. I really wish I had gone over some rules like chalk on this side, marker on this side and NOT on the carpet. But, that has nothing to do with the product. :)I do wish it had come with a roll of paper. I hadn't noticed that it didn't. It doesn't have paper, or whiteboard supplies (markers, spray stuff, eraser) or chalk, etc. I now see there is a kit you can get.Anyway, there are also three heights you can set it at which is great. The lowest height is even low enough for my 1 year old to reach (and PRETEND write). :)I'm really happy with this easel. I hadn't found anything I liked in Hobby Lobby or Walmart/Target... I'm afraid to go into Toys R Us. haha!Enjoy!Tara"},{"rating":"2","title":"Melissa & Doug Easel","review":"My 3 kids love this, my only problem is they all want to use it at the same time. They love the white board most and I'm glad because the caulk board is really messy. It has educational value because I can always get them to practice writing their letters and numbers and anything else as long as they have different color dry erase markers. My kids are 2,4,and 6 and I know they will get lots of use out of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the price","review":"Poor quality. Received with extremely warped wooden legs. Bottom holes for the chalkboard did not line up and I had to drill new holes. The dry erase board must be of a low quality because leaving a mark on it for more than 2 minutes requires a cleaning solution and a scrubber to erase. Very poor quality for the price, will be sending this back and buying something else. Would not recommend to buy any of this product line."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good toy","review":"Over all it is a Good toy. My kids enjoying it well. But one of the leg was slightly bend and one screw cap color not matching"},{"rating":"2","title":"great product, great value","review":"Quality of this product is good. It was easy to put together. My 6 year old loves it. I would definately recommend this easel and purchaseing the accessories from Melissa and Doug too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everyone's an Artist","review":"We bought this for a three year old's Christmas gift. At the party, we put it together and five grandchildren, (3, 3, 4, 4 and 10) became instant artists! They waited for their turn, monitored and rated each other's work. The other mommy decided to order it for a birthday gift for her kiddos. Now that this easel has traveled home, the dry erase markers and board get a daily work-out. This product has long term value, is educational, fun and helps with manual dexterity.I would highly recommend this."},{"rating":"1","title":"ChalkBoard & Dry Erase boards don't work","review":"After struggling with these boards for many months now, I have finally decided that my only recourse is to repaint both chalk board & dry erase boards. At first I contacted Melissa & Doug for replacement boards, but was told they don't sell them. The chalk board has never taken chalk and the dry erase board stains every time you leave it on for even a few minutes. I primed the chalk board with chalk, to no avail. I wish I had read the other reviews regarding board problems before buying. All my child ever uses it for is painting on the paper roll or chalk on the paper, since the boards don't work. Also, the piece of wood that holds the wooden paper roll dowel down on one side broke off. Wish me luck on resurfacing the boards, which no one should have to do for this price. Shame on you Melissa & Doug!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product, inflated price","review":"This is a good looking easel which any 3+ year old would love. My daughter loves writing on the chalkboard and painting. But for me, at $45, it felt like a ripoff because a similar item is at Ikea for $15. Yes, a friend owns it and yes it is just as stable after a year of use. After buying paper roll and chalk and paint box, it still comes to less than $30. I guess we paid the premium for the brand name. Humpf!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Used EVERY day","review":"We use this item every day since purchased.(months ago now) Each child takes turns with the calk and white board. Althougth the paper roll (which does not come with it) comes to only one side it is easy to tear it off and use the clips provided to put up one on the other side for paint time. Folds up a bit for storage but never need to put it away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Melissa and Doug Deluxe Standing Easel","review":"We bought this as a christmas present for my five year old.

We have it at the lowest height now and will adjust as he grows."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Buy","review":"We got this one for our 20 months old daughter. She LOVES it, and has been using it since day one. I highly recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did NOT last foe the price.","review":"I have a child who loved this easel, and played with it every day just about. she is gentle as a 2.5yr old can be, and now she is about to turn four and im searching for a NEW easel because this one has absolutely fallen apart. the yellow/green/blue knobs have all cracked and broken off, the wood mid pieces where the paper roll was to sit have both broken off.. i mean, this did not hold up AT ALL. the most movement it got was transporting from bedroom to living room. i feel like for the price, i should have gotten much more than a year and a half of heavy use out of this.also, after a few months, the white board stopped erasing completely and the chalkboard takes a wash down with a wet rag between uses as well, the eraser is useless.I expected more from melissa and doug and now i'm unsure where to look for something higher quality -- anyone with helpful tips please let me know"},{"rating":"2","title":"The same for less","review":"A friend purshased this product and was very happy with it. However, we have owned a very similar one from IKEA for two years for half the price. Our IKEA product gets put outside on nice days and has been pretty beaten up, but is still in good shape and very sturdy. If you can't get to an IKEA, the Melissa and Doug product is an excellent choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recommended","review":"My 2 year old granddaughter loves it and uses it several times throughout the day. It is very sturdy,well made and easy to assemble. The trays hold the chalk, markers,eraser and paint conveniently for easy use.Great value,well worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easel Ease","review":"The Easel arrives safely packed and in good condition. It took about 2 hours to assemble, and I had the cross bars improperly linked at first. After correcting to have both cross bars going in the same direction, it became a colapsable Easel; necessary for storage in my small apartment. My Granddaughter is tall for age three. We had to set the easel at the mid-range. She still has lots of room to grow as there is another (higher) setting for the Easel White Board and Chalk Board.There are other easels on the market, made of steele or aluminum. They may be sturdier, but I find the wooden M & D Deluxe Standing Easel to perform well.My three year old granddaughter went shopping with me at the local educational supply store to pick out Melissa and Doug paints, easel paper, brushes and chalk. At her age, the Chalkboard gives her much more success than the painting. However, when she comes for a visit now, there is no need to get out any other toys, she heads straight for the Paints and Easel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good gift for the growing artist","review":"I bought this for my 7 year old daughter who loves to play school. She is really enjoying her gift. It is well made and was not that difficult to put together. I like it because the height is adjustable and we could make it be at just the right level for her to write and draw. The only down fall, if you could call it that, is the chalkboard side. It has a high gloss on it that makes the chalk I bought difficult to see. My daughter really has to push hard with the chalk to get it to write the way she wants it to. Since she is pushing so hard she keeps breaking the chalk. I think I need to order the Melissa and Doug chalk that I have seen on line as well, that probably works better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Chalkboard Great Whiteboard","review":"My daughter loves the whiteboard side of this easel, the trays are perfect for holding erasers, markers, and chalk. The easel seems fairly sturdy and easy to assemble. I was extremely disapointed with the poor quality of the chalkboard side. The chalk has never marked properly on the chalkboard, the board surface seems very slippery and leaves only a faint chalk impression. We followed the instructions for prepping and cleaning the chalkboard but it didn't make any difference."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun.. when you can get them to use it!","review":"It's not going to make anyone be more interested in painting or drawing.. but if the kiddos enjoy that sort of thing, this is great! Actually surprised on that price as \\"Melissa & Doug\\" products are usually more pricey (guess you're paying for quality, which if a toy can hold up for years, is worth it)!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great buy","review":"I bought this for my 18-month-old, and she took to it immediately. I had wanted something for finger painting, but the chalkboard is the biggest hit. It was very easy to assemble; it's sturdy; and it's cheaper than the other large easels I looked at. The lowest setting is just the right height for her. Highly recommended.Update: the easel still has a place of honor in our living room, and is still in great shape. I disassembled it for a move, and it was easy to put back together. I haven't changed the height yet, but it's about time. It's definitely worth it to purchase the rolls of paper; it remains a real hit in our house."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whiteboard from hell!","review":"We wrote \\"Happy Birthday\\" on the whiteboard the morning of our daughter's birthday. I used an Expo dry erase marker. I'm a teacher and I use these in my classroom as well. Went to erase the message the next day and you would think I used a permanent marker!!! I am very disappointed in the quality for the money we spent on this. I have used Expo wipes and the spray and I am putting some serious elbow grease into cleaning this board. We have bought small lap-size white boards that were better quality. I hate when I put my time, thought, and money into a crappy product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Melissa & Doug 2008 Upgraded Easel","review":"We purchased the \\"new\\" and \\"improved\\" M & D Easel. What a disappointment to say the LEAST. I am excellent at putting things together, but this product was ridiculous. The directions were unclear, but I continued, determined to put it together for my child for Xmas.What I found was some of the screws would not properly screw into place. One hole was just in the wrong spot and to top it off, part of the easel was damaged.I suggest instead of taking a \\"short cut\\", just go and support a local store in your area and buy an easel that is already put together!!This was not worth it. I really wanted it to be!I had read reviews of the M & D Easel and it was mixed. Obviously, the product is not consistent or dependable, but I recklessly ignored them, thinking I would come out OK. But alas, I did not!If I can be helpful to one person... Don' buy this product!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very durable","review":"Looks nice, but my kids enjoy unscrewing the colorful knobs, which are needed to keep this standing. I've replaced most of the knobs with nuts & lockwashers & tightened so that they can no longer remove. This makes cleaning the paint tray difficult. Also, the swing bars could be helpful if you were going to collapse this all the time & lean up against a wall. We don't need to do this. The kids like to lift the bars & walk between the panels. But lifting the bar makes it unstable & it can fall on the children. Lastly, we had cracks in the wood along some of the screw holes & eventually returned it.In conclusion, it LOOKS nice, but isn't durable or safe enough for our household."},{"rating":"2","title":"Melissa and Doug deluxe standing easel","review":"This is a nice product. My 3 1/2 yr old granddaughter loves it! Hardly a day goes by that she does not use it. She enjoys being able to stand and move from project to project. She even stays interested when we are \\"learning\\". There was an issue with a cracked chalkboard and a cosmetically damaged leg piece but a quick call to \\"Melissa and Doug\\" took care of that! They were extremely nice, took the information, apologized for the inconvenience and promptly shipped the replacement parts! Assembly was quick and easy. I would definitely recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Present","review":"My granddaughter loved it. I like the idea of the adjustable height and the paper dispenser is great, so she wont run out of paper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice for many ages","review":"Easy to assemble and move. Dislike the fact that you have to prime the chalkboard...still havent figured that out yet. We use both sides as painting easels. Like that the sides can be at different heights for different ages. My only complaint would be that some of the wood was still rough and pose a potential splinter hazard and that the wignut screws are easy for children to turn..if you try to tighten them too much, the wood cracks. Overall, nicely made. M&D products are very nice and we were glad to find this on sale at almost 50% off at Amazon :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the price.","review":"My daughter loves this easel and uses it everyday. It's a nice size, cleans easily and has a paper cutter for easy art work removal. However, I must warn you it does have a few draw backs. The chalk board does not function at all. No matter how much you \\"season it \\" it's practically useless and we have tried several brands of chalk. Also, I found the chalk board scratches easily. The white board is great but the minus is that it's not magnetic. If a magnetic easel is what you are looking for keep in mind the Alex magnetic easel is double the price of Melissa and Doug's with the same bad chalk board. Hope this helps ."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Easel","review":"This easel was purchased for our 4 year old grand-daughter; she loves it. Quick delivery and great frustration-free packaging."},{"rating":"1","title":"SO SAD!!","review":"I like the other costumer should of followed my gut. My husband and I are very upset as we are putting the easel together for our son for Christmas morning, the quality is bad. The wood is not even smooth!!! The chalk board has a wax finish and you can not erase the chalk all the way off. It is sickening to me that you can't find company's anymore that put a 100% into their products. I WILL NEVER PURCHASE A MELLISSA AND DOUG PRODUCT AGAIN!!!! Please don't waste your money!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great deal for a great product!","review":"We got this for our son for his 3rd birthday and him and his sister who is 1 and a half LOVE it!

On Christmas morning, we opened the easel and found there was no paint, no paper, no crayons, no nothing. I am very disappointed with this product as far as the description goes. if you have to order the supplies it should tell you that. For me, with accessories means just that. I will not buy from this buyer again."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Greatest!!","review":"I purchased this product for my grand daughter as she's often over to play. She's two years old and has the best time! Whether she's painting, coloring or using the chalk she entertains herself very well. I enjoy the ease with which to remove the paper and start over. She loves seeing her work hung up! It's also great for two kids to use at the same time. I've now purchased two more for friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Product","review":"Like all Doug & Melissa toys, this is another high quality item. Well built, sturdy construction and very easy to assemble. Unlike some plastic models, this one is really stable and difficult to tip over. Love the three adjustable height options. Low enough for my 2 year old granddaughter to use now, and it will be years before she outgrows it. We did not experience any problems with the chalk showing up on the chalkboard like a few users did, but we used crayola sidewalk chalk. The trays are nice and deep to hold lots of chalk and crayons, but don't stick out so far as to interfere with the child using the board. Also love that all of the screw ends are covered with plastic covers to prevent injuries."},{"rating":"2","title":"My kids love it!","review":"Bought this for my daughter's 3rd birthday. Exactly what we wanted for a great price. Set up was easy. Very colorful. We could set the height just for her and can still set it higher as she grows. Love that. We love the colorful trays for paints and markers and chalk. We didn't buy the roll of paper for painting. Instead we bought big Crayola drawing pads and use the colorful clips to clip the painting papers to the top of the easel. Works great. This gets a LOT of use at our house and it's been very durable thus far. Developmentally, it has really helped my daughter to improve her fine motor skills in a very fun way!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Value","review":"I bought this easel for my 6 year old granddaughter for Christmas. I originally bought an Imaginarium easel at Toys R Us and then read the reviews for it--and promptly returned it. After checking out the quality of others, this one just stood out, especially in customer reviews, even though it was a bit more money. My daughter-in-law said it was easy to put together and she is impressed with how well made it is. My granddaughter creates art for hours with it and loves it. It is the center point of her room. Whenever I get a \\"Grandma done good\\" kudo, I'm happy.

Then, they gave, or it came with, clips to hold the bottom. I will modify this and have both top and bottom spring loaded...springs between the top wood strip and bottom wood strip, so you can pull it out, feed the paper and let it spring back to hold the paper. It is awkwardly designed and would take very little to improve this item. I paid twenty five at Amazon a few months ago. That is the most it is worth. My daughter loves it. She paints and we do letters/numbers...abc's on the chalkboard."},{"rating":"1","title":"MADE IN CHINA - three scary words","review":"Melissa & Doug launched and branded themselves as Made in America using natural wood plus dyes/paints safe for our children.

I gave this to my 6year old as an early birthday present in February of this year. She does not use it daily but she still uses it often enough. It has multiple adjustable height levels and we have it on the tallest since my daughter is a bit over 4' tall. Seems to be plenty of room for growth as well. Its pretty easy to clean on both sides. Legs look kinda flimsy but they are holding up pretty well. The trays are also doing well no broken pieces on any parts of this. The paper will tear through if the kid does not learn to stop painting in one spot or wetting the brush too often but with the crayola paint it comes right off."},{"rating":"2","title":"art","review":"This product is a must have.

It's a great quality toy that my husband put together in about 15 minutes. It's pretty sturdy and we are very happy with it, as are our kids. Although I think mine was supposed to come with a roll of paper and didn't. Anyway, it's a good buy, which can be expected with pretty much any Melissa and Doug toy.Since I have owned this easel, I have found a couple of flaws. The screws are cute and colorful, but easy to turn and all three of my kids have gone through phases where they unscrew most of them and the thing graduatlly falls apart. Another problem is that it doesn't collapse easily. It would be great if would at least fold flat so that you could lean it against the wall...It takes up a lot of space."},{"rating":"2","title":"My niece LOVED IT!!!","review":"I got this for my 5 yr. old niece for Christmas and she can't get enough off it.

Ordered it 2 nights before Christmas Eve and was delivered a day before Xmas Eve, which was awesome and free. Thanks"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Design, Poor Implentation","review":"There's a lot of issues with this easel, as other reviewers have pointed out; it's hard to fold up, the chalkboard doesn't work, but worst of all, it's trivial for small children to take it apart. Many of the fasteners are bright cheerful plastic, which makes them extremely attractive to fiddle with. My easel is in pieces and I am not looking forward to putting it back together. Not worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"easel fun","review":"The Melissa and Doug Easel was not difficult to assemble but does take a little bit of time.

It was very boxed up and there were no images that my child didnt know what this was. Then we had to build it. The materials to build it are so complicated and so cheap. You can go to home depot and get better wood and built it yourself. Its like your paying for a bunch of cheap wood parts. I thought i was getting a deal but when I actually saw what i bought it was a total rip off. Buy something not from this brand. I learned my lesson."},{"rating":"2","title":"love Love LOVE IT!","review":"Buy this one!!!! Its fabulous and easy to assemble. Has 3 height settings so it can grow with your kids. Well made and so much fun!! All the Melissa and Doug products (toddler brushes and spill proof paint cups) are great with it. Would buy 10 times over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Quality","review":"Easle is good quality, solid construction that I've come to expect from Melissa & Doug products. I bought it to help give my nephew a creative outlet other than the walls. So far, so good :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointment....buy elsewhere","review":"With its bright colors, trays and adjustable height, this easel is very alluring. In actuality, though, it is a lot of flash and little substance. As others have mentioned, the chalkboard does not work, despite the prep work instructed. My 3 year old handed me a piece of chalk and said, \\"Mommy, can you make this work?\\" Also, no one has mentioned this but the dry erase board does not wipe off cleanly. We have tried several kinds of dry erase markers and I still end up using a bleach solution to clean it. Not very convenient. My parents bought this for my sons and their money would have been better spent elsewhere. I know that I have purchased easels at IKEA with similar features, a better chalkboard and a lower price. It seems like Melissa and Doug's quality has been slipping in recent years. It's a shame."},{"rating":"2","title":"plan ahead","review":"Overall this is a really good product. It took me the better part of a day to put together though so if you're getting this as a gift for a child I'd suggest putting it together the previous day and covering it to surprise them rather than having them open the box.My son is extremely rough on his toys, but it's still managed to stand up to most of what he puts it through. The only slight issue was that he broke off the plastic trays at the points where they connect. As I said before though...he's very hard on his toys. I doubt this would be an issue for most kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sturdy, good height","review":"Sturdy, good height. Once our 2 year old gets over eating the crayons, we'll be golden. But he likes standing up and drawing, and the all-wood structure seems durable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great investment","review":"my grand daughter has hours of fun with this easel---great how all the drawing tools can be stored on tray within reach. Seems very sturdy so hopefully will last for awhile. Always happy with melissa/doug products. Arrived so quickly & as always no hassle with amazon shipping."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Multi-Purpose Easel","review":"We purchased this easel for a 5-year old who loves to create art. She has used it for hours at a time. The ability to do chalk, marker, and paint (or other uses for paper such as drawing) really appeals to her. I have liked all aspects of the easel. Be sure to order paper whether in an accessory kit or by itself. I didn't pay attention that the easel did not come with a paper roll but lucked out since the accessory kit I ordered in addition to it did. I highly recommend ordering one of the accessory kits - makes all the difference since it allows your artist to use it immediately. Only downside to the easel is that the paper does not cover the entire side of the white board so paint gets on it but easily wipes off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great toy - child age 4 and up","review":"This is a great board. My son is learning letters and can practice on this board. We currently use only the white board side. We also use it for painting with a large sheet of paper. Less mess than when done on the table."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Standing Easel STANDS UP to it's competition","review":"We purchased this easel for our boys (5 & 3) for Christmas, and thus far have been VERY impressed with it; and they kids have LOVED playing with it.

Thank you Melissa & Doug for yet another wonderful product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excelellent item to help develop imagination and fun","review":"This is an excellent item to help a child develop imaginaton and still have fun.

We have used it to identify and reinforce our 3 year old's upper and lower case alphabet, numbers and shapes. He is also doing well with drawing them also and enjoys erasing them!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great toy but it is not magnetic","review":"The only things I found wrong is since it isn't magnetic none of their letters can be used with it and also unless you use real dry erase markers it's not too easy to clean. Dry erase markers aren't really for kids so i use a wet rag. Can be a bit messy but overall this is a great product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good investment for years and if you have more than one kid","review":"Our kids (2 and 3 years old) got these easel on christmas 2005. Since them they love to paint every day and there is no trouble because they can use both sides, so there is one painting area for each kid. There is also plenty of room to hold all their different pencils and crayons. We put the easel in our livingroom because it looks really nice - not like all these plastic stuff. After a year, all things considered, it was a very good investment."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a worthless product","review":"I bought this for my four year old niece as a Christmas present. It took a bit more effort than I anticipated to put it together and it was not readily apparent what was in store for me until I got to the tail end. There are a multitude of holes drilled into the easel legs for the assembly and one of the holes nearest the hinges was about a half inch lower than the other leg. As such, it was impossible to get the chalkboard put on correctly and I had to return the item. I'm writing this on Christmas Eve and am so p.o.'d now because I basically wasted over an hour on a gift I won't be able to give. What a worthless product!!!! Stay away."},{"rating":"1","title":"not very sturdy","review":"I found this art stand to not be very sturdy and built with very low quality. It lasted about a month, then the edges started to slowly crack and ulitmaley broke off.There are alot better art easels out there. I would pass this one up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Purchase","review":"I bought this for my two youngest kids, girl age 3 and boy age 5, for Christmas, they didn't ask for one but i though it would be fun! It is pretty much the only toy they have played with! THEY LOVE IT! They share it well since it has two sides! i have had to put paper on both sides though cause they both want to paint at the same time! they paint all the time and love the chalk and dry erase boards! they play school on it and write letters and their name! it is great! I would recommend anyone with kids have this easel! even my second oldest child who is 9 plays and writes on it!! my oldest who is 12 has better things to do i guess!! but awesome easel!!Great buy for the money! a MUST HAVE!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute but not sturdy","review":"The raw unfinished wood was a splintery disappointment, and the legs are wobbly and extremely thin. It lasted about two weeks before my two-year olds pushed it over and the wood snapped in a long, jagged crack that will be almost impossible to repair. I freely admit my kids should not have been playing under it, but if severely underweight toddlers can knock it over with enough mojo to break and ruin it, then maybe it could stand to be better-made. I mean, if anything is specifically made for kids of this age, then I think it should be made to withstand their creative brands of torture. Very, very disappointed. Also the blackboard was chipped when it arrived. I was going to ask them to replace it but no point now -- the easel is ruined. Spend less on one they can destroy without you getting upset and/or a plastic one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy quality","review":"Had this toy for 2 years. Then this fell apart. The wood dowel that holds the paper roll broke within the first week, the wing nut plastic caps broke within the first year. Last month, or the second year, the dry erase board started bubbling and detaching from the backing. Then the chalk board tray broke off from brittle plastic. This started out fun for kids, but then they lost interest very quickly. There is only so much painting or drawing a kid can do before being bored. But, we thought we would keep the art going and bought the Melissa & Doug Table Top Easel to replace this standing floor easel. The table top easel arrived factory sealed, with deformed and broken parts. The wood was cheap quality, as with the standing floor easel. We are through with Melissa and Doug. Bad, cheap products."},{"rating":"1","title":"There has to be better","review":"I notice this product gets good reviews, but I have to think there are better options. The plain wood frame shows every mark and doesn't wipe clean. Beware of the Melissa and Doug paints. My son spilled one on the carpet because the lids that come with the paint containers do not fit well at all. The paint never came out of the carpet even though we spent hours working on it immediately after the spill. To be honest, after having this, I don't even consider buying a Melissa and Doug product anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sub-standard product","review":"I was reading the reviews and sub-reviews for this product and will not be buying it. I did find a great Web site to a company that makes all products for children in the USA [...].

I plan on purchasing it."},{"rating":"1","title":"You missed one bolt, and the other one is broken","review":"At the end of the assembly, I realized there is a shortage of a bolt, as well as a broken one.In order to show this easel to my daughter tomorrow morning, I am assembling it by 2:30am.Shortage in bolts and broken bolt makes me a lot disappointed to Mellisa & Doug products.I am already sad my daughter is disappointing in the morning.From this experience, I think I am going to be reluctant to buy your product again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great item","review":"This was a Christmas present for the grandchildren. My mistake was waiting until the night before Christmas to put it together & realized there wasn't any paint, chalk, etc. I love Melissa & Doug's products and have never been disappointed with my purchases from them. This a good sturdy product and will be used for years to come. Just don't forget to get the supplies for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute","review":"I've been keeping my eye on this easel for a year now, and just decided to get this for my 3 year old's birthday (but I have a 4 year old who would enjoy it too..) They've enjoyed both sides, and I purchased the paper from Border's and cups separately. The black board doesn't write clearly with chalk, but maybe that's because I have Crayola chalk and not M and D's chalk?? Putting it together was ok, but my husband and I were running out of steam and were tired, thus making mistakes. It's a little flimsy, but it's nice. I hope to use this for a while, and with the adjustable trays and boards, should last a while. $45 was worth the price. I think it was much higher last year...and you can store it, so that'll be helpful!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great easel for the price!","review":"My wife did lots of research and came down to this easel and one sold at Ikea. Both were affordable and seemed stable. We chose the one sold at Amazon for convenience. My son loves the easel and uses it for painting and drawing. It is quite stable and comes with clips that are useful. I knocked off a star because the assembly was a little more difficult than you would imagine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Easel","review":"My 3 year old grandson loves his M and D easel.

Remember to buy the easel paper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Christmas gift!","review":"We bought this easel for our 22 month old daughter for Christmas. It was easy to assemble and is very sturdy. The colors are bright and it is so practical with all of the features such as the white board, chalk board and paper holders. Since she is young, we put the flip chart paper on one side and the rolled paper on the other. She has spent a lot of time using her crayons and markers to draw on both sides. The trays are great to keep everything in place. This will definitely be a toy she can use as she grows older. It's nice that the height is adjustable as well. We have it on lowest setting and it works perfect for her. A great gift - one of her favorites!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for my two year old","review":"My son is two and just loves this! We discovered that you don't need dry-erase markers for the white side if you have Crafty Dab Kids Paint.Crafty Dab 75619 Washable Kids PaintIt washes right off, looks AND SMELLS better than dry erase and stays on till you're ready to wash it off. I love the shimmery kind.

Don't forget to order all the great products that go along with it.. the dry erase markers, eraser, chalk, paints and smock, and the easel paper on the roll!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Easel","review":"We bought this easel for our son and wanted something he would be able to use as he grows. Our son is only 16 months old now but can already use the easel at the lowest level. I love that it has the dry erase, chalkboard and paper roll, making it very versatile. Our son really enjoys coloring on this easel. I had looked at other much more expensive easels, but am glad I didn't pay the money. This one has all the features I was looking for, reliable Melissa & Doug brand name and was cheaper than most others of similar quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"fun for all ages","review":"I got this for our playroom for the grandchildren.

We paired this with the Companion set and some extra smocks and makes a great addition to any family home. I only wish it had a magnetic surface as well...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality easel","review":"Overall a pretty good quality easel. The dry erase board is flawless, smooth and our dry erase markers just glides on it, and also easy to erase. The chalk board also looks pretty well made. The surface works great and seems made to last for a long time.The assembly took around 20 minutes and I have to get a couple more hands to hold the board while I was putting them all together. You have everything you need, the only tool you will use is an Allen wrench which is included. Make sure you don't lose any screws as they are all exactly how many you will need to set it up. You can easily fold it for storage by loosening just a couple of screws.I do have an easel before I bought from Ikea. I think I paid twenty less, but this one is much better quality with art supply containers and such. The paper roll holder is secured with a couple of knobs and 4 clips to steady it. I just wish they have included the spill proof paint receptacles and brushes, and erasers for this price."},{"rating":"2","title":"easel","review":"My daughter which is 6, loves it! we bought it for her at christmas and she really loves to paint and also draw on the boards,(it was a little tricky to put it together) i highly recommend this for your child."},{"rating":"2","title":"Christmas Gift for 10 year old boy","review":"When my nephew saw the easel he yell out awesome and could not wait to start painting.

Both the chalk board and white board are dented on the same edge. The box it arrived in was not, so probably shipped that way.We had to make a modification in one of the pre-drilled holes to assemble it.I was really disappointed this time and will not buy again. For the money, the quality has really gone down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what you pay for","review":"Chalkboard is terrible. My child can't even use this side.

When we went to put it together Christmas Eve it was missing a leg. I immediately went online and scheduled a replacement with Amazon and it was handled wonderfully. We recieved the replacement a few days later but the replacement was missing the screws. I didn't want to return the second one to Amazon to get another one missing parts so I called up Melissa and Doug. It has been nearly three weeks and I still haven't recieved the screws to put this thing together. I am about to return it and never buy another Melissa and Doug product again. Their customer service rep was very rude and kept trying to talk over me to tell me I had put it together wrong. How could I put it together wrong without screws?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Concept but VERY CHEAPLY made","review":"I was so excited for this easel to come and so disappointed by it. When it arrived the cheap plastic trays had already split and broken - we could only install one of them.

Just really a disappointment overall."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chalk board stinks","review":"After priming the board as the instructions indicated...it is still useless. The chalk actually cuts into the chalkboard so now, my daughter who loved chalk and drawing can't use that side of the easel. I wouldn't recommend this for anyone if they are looking for a product that does what it is supposed to do. I wonder if the makers even tried to use it...why would someone make a product that doesn't work and then expect people to buy it...very disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Our Favorites","review":"Other than our daughter's blanket and favorite stuffies, this is the most used toy in our home.Drawbacks:The clips that hold the paper steady aren't very durable (we've purchased new clips).The knobs for the screws come off easily.The paper roll falls out once in a while.The easel is a bit heavy, very large, and takes up much floor space in our family room.Plusses:The top bar holds the paper down.You can use roll paper or poster paper with it.The troughs on both sides for paint containers or for a boat-load of crayons and markers.The surfaces wipe clean.The easel folds shut.The price!My daughter loves it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great easel","review":"This easel is a must have for any parent who is considering purchasing one for their child. We got it for our two kids--5 and 2--and they immedidately started painting and writing on it. The adjustable height is a must if you're going to have more than one child using it. Our older child can advance the paper himself when he wants to paint, but he does need help tearing if off when finished. We also purchased the starter kit, which made it easy for the initial start-up. If your child is somewhat messy with paint or chalk, I would recommend a drop cloth of some kind as it can get somewhat messy underneath the easel.I got the easel assembled in a short amount of time. The instructions and pictures were easy to follow. This easel is a great addition to any little artist's collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not too stable & if you loose any piece you need to throw it away","review":"This was a decent easel for about 2 months until one of the trays broke. This really messed up the stability of the whole unit. Then about an month later one of the side braces broke off and we had no choice but to throw it away. we then purchased a plastic one (i think it was made by Step2) which was a lot more sturdy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Think Ikea meets legos with a dash of Rubik's Cube","review":"Mrs. Claus got this for our 6 year old this Christmas and asked her favorite elf to assemble it. I am fairly handy, I have installed wood floors, crown molding, tiling, you name it. However, putting this thing together proved to be an hour and a half chore. It should actually be sold as an erector set for parents. **Think Ikea meets legos with a dash of Rubik's Cube*** If \\"Santa\\" did not bring this thing to our house it would have most likely ended up as kindling in our fireplace... seriously. If your thinking about getting this easel just be aware that it has an obnoxious amount of allen screws and plastic fly-nuts. All the parts look the same and they are easy to confuse with one another. There has to be other children's easels on the market that are less frustrating to assemble.Once assembled it is actually a decent product outside of the flimsy hinges.

With the exception of one song in the 1st mile, I can barely hear the music at all. I can hear Leslie talking no problem, in fact her voice is much louder than the music. Otherwise, this one is a definite keeper! I prefer Leslie alone, as opposed to her groups, because I like to focus on Leslie's movements (I'm pretty uncoordinated!) and sometimes her group members are just a tad \\"off.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"This is for EVERYONE!","review":"I am VERY impressed with this work-out DVD. It gets the job done, great burn and the weight is falling off. This is great for everyone of all shapes and sizes-- it is very easy and you can go at your own pace. Leslie's voice is a tad bit annoying so I mute it while I work out and play my own music! I recommend this to everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast-moving workout","review":"This is a fun, fast-moving workout, that is, Leslie changes the movements frequently so you don't get bored. As always, she is so upbeat and encouraging you are happy to be working out. There are no complicated steps or routines so it's easy to relax and enjoy the movement. You can choose from one mile to three mile walk programs depending on how much time you have to exercise on any given day, but you will find yourself continuing on after the first mile just because she makes it so enjoyable. It's not high intensity workout, but a great all-over exercise program for those of us who sit at a computer all day and want to move as many muscles as possible. Very fun!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous over 50!","review":"For someone who doesn't like exercise - this is it!

This is my second dvd of Leslie's and thought that this dvd was in no comparison to the 5 mile fat burning dvd I first bought. I was really surprised to hear that half of the songs played were the same songs played in the other dvd I had. I expect when I buy a different dvd that it would at least have different music. Also, the few new tracks played were very low beat and didn't get me motivated to put my all in the workout. Overall I wouldn't recommend this dvd for veterans of Leslie Sansone's exercise dvds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed in the set up","review":"Kathy in Ohio mentioned the fact that the first and last miles of the three miles covered are not true miles since they incorporate the warm up and the cool down,and I agree this is disappointing, but the other thing I think is disapointing is that it's presented in the menu as chapters... \\"mile 1, mile 2, mile 3\\" but in all actuality it's just the video that keeps playing. I had to stop it myself once mile 1 was completed. There was also no option to just go to the abs portion except to begin the program and fast forward through all three miles. Technology is too advanced for this type of laziness... she's not saving any money in the cost of video production by just lumping it all in together. I'll be bringing this one back. Hopefully I can find a Sansone video that works more in chapter form so I can use her program... I like the walking idea for bad weather days."},{"rating":"2","title":"Walk Away Fan","review":"Great workout. I love that it's just Leslie. I have 5 other Walk Away workouts and prefer her alone. Hearing the other walker's stories day after day gets old fast: \\"this walker is a grandmother, this walker is over 50 and has lost 20 pounds, this walker is in his 70's, and etc\\". The first time you hear the stories they are encouraging. But after several months... not so much. I enjoy the workout better when Leslie stays on topic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother choose another of her tapes","review":"This has to be her worst tape ever. The cues are delayed.

I would choose another of her DVDs."},{"rating":"2","title":"what a great workout!","review":"Just love this dvd. It's one of the best workouts that Leslie has made, and boy does she keep you moving.

Defective product."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little \\"dark\\" for my taste","review":"Ok, so my biggest complaint with this dvd is not really about the workout itself, but the atmosphere. I am new to Leslie workouts. I borrowed one from my mom that is in a large, well-lit room with others working out with her, and this is just her in a room with a big black sheet across the entire back wall, which just didn't feel as inviting for me. While some may be distracted by her small talk with others she works out with, I found it made it more fun and made it go by faster. The workout itself was ok, but I like the other ones that you can use stretchy bands or other things to help. I found myself using my own 3 pound weights, to add a bit more to the workout, and I definitely was still sweating. I also like dvd's with more than 3 miles, because, while I do not do them all in one day (yet), I like the variety to choose from when I am just going to do a couple miles, so I can do different combinations of miles on different days."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must recommend","review":"I love this exercise DVD. It is not difficult to follow and do. The moves and the pace are simple and effective. I could actually feel it working immediately. I would definitely recommend it to anyone especially someone who is not in good physical shape and would like a kick start to toning the entire body. Also, I could feel my respiratory system clearing up and this was amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Walk you belly flat ... works!","review":"I purchased this DVD after gaining 3 Kgs after Christmas... with a birthday around the corner and middle age approaching I knew carrying this extra (if a little weight) was not good! I was determined to get on top of things quickly and knew that regular exercise was the key. Eating right is important, but often lack a of exercise leads to not eating right.So I purchased this and two other Leslie Sanone DVD's. I have been putting one on most days and have lost my extra three kilos and have gained excellent toning to my arms and legs. When Leslie speaks I feel like she is speaking to me! She is provides in home fitness that is accessible, challenging and worthwhile!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for what I was looking for","review":"Written for the fans:If you like her, you'll love this DVD. It's three miles, she's on her own and the music is upbeat and loud enough to hear. Not as much variety as some of her 5 mile DVD, but good nonetheless. The music is familiar, but since it's not bad, I don't mind it.For non-fans/newcomers:If you are a workout freak, Leslie in general, may not be for you. If you learn the moves, then you can do it yourself at your pace, with your own music and be happy. If you don't like a lot of chit-chat, don't buy Leslie...she loves to talk and some may find it annoying. Now if you are just starting to workout, Leslie is wonderful. If you want something very basic that you can pump up later, then you'll like this DVD. I personally like it, because I can make the workout as hard or as lite as I want.Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"love love this","review":"This DVD is motivational, and gives me energy. very upbeat. makes you sweat. well worth the money and time. great"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wife, girls love it","review":"Gift for my wife to take with her to exercise group, one of three we bought Use dvd's three times per week"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good workout!","review":"I like this, but not as much as the ultimate collection DVD.

Like she says' it's your workout' and so I combined some of the moves from the walk away the pounds and sculpt your arms with this one (i actually prefer the ones with her alone, it's like walking with a good friend :-)I don't get these for the music aspect of it so I also like the fact that when the volume is low (for the early morning workouts when the house is asleep) I can still hear her walking and talking me thru it.

It should be mandatory reading for college seniors to prepare them for the 'real world.' I recommend buying it so you can reread it when you need to be reminded that you can love living even when nothing goes the way you want it to. Forget The Secret and all the think positive nonsense out there. Bukowski will teach you how to be miserable happy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Believe the Hype","review":"This book is the ultimate one trick pony. If the point of this book is to be an indictment of the bureaucracy and soul crushing nature of working at the post office, then, yeah, that's true. But it's not exactly a mystery as I'm sure we've all heard of \\"going postal.\\" Maybe this book was the first to posit this theory that working at a post office is no good, I haven't really checked the history of that phenomenon. Nonetheless, the action is repetitive and the depiction of the protagonist is incredibly self-serving to the so-called nth degree. Basically, my beef is that I finished the book, asked myself \\"that's it?\\", and walked away with no greater understanding of anything. Oh yeah, I guess I thought working at the post office sucks, but, in actuality, it REALLY sucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Someone, explain to me what I missed","review":"I heard an interview with a man who recently released a documentary about Charles Bukowski. I got so enthused I bought several of his books. Almost all of the reviews I read were glowing. \\"LIFE CHANGING!\\" \\"MASTERPIECE!\\" \\"AWE INSPIRING!\\" Well, it was inspiring, but I'm not sure exactly what it inspired me to do. I read this book and felt nothing. No, I take that back. I felt like I was totally \\"not\\" getting the point or the genius. I didn't like the characters. I didn't like the story (I'm a government employee and I couldn't even relate to it!). But, I persevered and finished the book. Only to be left with one burning question....HUH? Seeing as how everyone seems to love Bukowski, I'm trying another one of his books. I'm giving him another shot. But I'm just not feeling it. Maybe it's a male/female difference of perspective. I just don't know."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"Bukowski's narrative voice and the confidence of his writing are always compelling, yet time after time I finish his novels feeling somehow cheated (with the exception of \\"Ham on Rye\\", which he seemed to put some effort and thought into). He's unwilling or unable to reveal insight into his own behavior and his female characters are devoid of any real presence or depth, aside from their moments of neediness, horniness and hysteria. In this particularly shabby effort, he somehow avoids dealing with what is presumably the entire point of the novel--presenting the day to day tedium of holding a job for 11 years. Soon after describing how he established himself as a postal clerk, he strangely skips the rest of his employment there... the novel then picks up a decade later with a series of warning letters he received, and ends with him quitting. A lot of promise, but shoddily done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not The Funny Book I Was Hoping For","review":"I found this book while searching for funny books to read. A book based on the trials and tribulations of a postal carrier seemed like the perfect subject for hilarity and hijinks, but the first 28 pages of this book could be summarized as \\"an alcoholic complains about his postal job.\\" Maybe I didn't give this book enough time, but I feel like something should catch me and pull me in within the first 25 pages. This book did not.If you're looking for a funny read I recommend Funny in Farsi, Me Talk Pretty One Day and Bitter is the New Black."},{"rating":"1","title":"Try Mailboxes, Etc. before you go to the Post Office","review":"While I am under no illusions that people and lives like this exist, I believe that there has to be a more talented and profound method of conveying them. Have people enjoyed this \\"novel\\" to sound liberated and intellectual? Or, is Bukowski's audience merely deprived of great literature. Bukowski's narrator, the postal temp, nymphomaniac alcoholic, gave me such an ill feeling that I turned the pages to see if he could possibly redeem himself in my eyes. His numerous encounters with women, while they may be true to life, seemed to be void fillers within the work. It was as if Bukowski was trying to emmulate Allen Ginsberg with his raw and outrageous nature. His attempts were meager and artificial. Mr. Bukowski, You are no Allen Ginsberg."},{"rating":"1","title":"Post Office by Charles Bukowski","review":"This was one of the worst books I've ever read, and I read alot.

It's a quick read and the man definitely brings you into his world. His writing style is honest and raw. Have you ever been in a cab that had the typical taxi cab smell with the guy smoking a cig ? And he's telling you a story while taking you to your stop and you are looking at the fair meter ? Well that was Bukowski writing Post Office."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great buk book for first timer","review":"Wow, I was really surprised by how quick of a read this novel is and how engrossing overall it is. Bukowski is so very blunt with his words, \\"Bitch, whore\\" and his phrases, \\"I just put it in.\\" The way he writes is like if you wanted to tell a long story but just shorten it up and tell the good stuff--THE STUFF THAT MATTERS. I couldn't but relate to Chinaski(main character) and his job at the post office that he hated. Great novel and I strongly recommend this novel as I will purchasing Ham on Rye next, followed by Women."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Novel That Break's the \\"Beat Mold\\"","review":"All too often, writers who use free form to describe unconventional living are labeled \\"beats\\".

Not for the closed-minded."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes you feel good about your own job.","review":"This is the first book I ever read by Bukowski. Being I don't like novels, what got me to read it was the fact that the story is about the authors own life as a postal Carrier.This isn't a plot driven book that keeps you on the edge of your seat with a dynamic ending, but rather an entertaining and amusing story of a man and how he dealt with the problems that he encountered on his job.Bukowskis later life proved to be successful as a writer and he maintains a cult-like following 18 years after his death.I think most readers will find his unorthodox life interesting. He definitely lived life on his own terms."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"After reading the reviews on this site, I ordered this book. I had expected the book to be keeping me laughing and yet, I don't think I laughed... ever. The tale seemed centered around a character who worked at the post office for no apparent reason and just fed his cravings for sex. The story was an easy read, I finished it in roughly two sittings but I wasn't satisfied with the tale. It didn't seem to have any direction and fell flat on the comedy front. Ultimately, I would only recommend it if you can't find anything else to read and are looking for a quick distraction."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Buk at His Best","review":"I've never read anything by Bukowski that I didn't like, but Post Office is probably my all time favorite.

I read this when i could no longer stomach the more serious non-fiction i was read. but i kept reading! reading bukowski. i can't help comparing him to Fante, a comparison which leads me to my only critisism. Bukowski seems to disregard any didactic mission for a novelist, which is fine. but, knowing his love for fante, i think that in some sense he tries to emmulate him. but he just doesn't capture the emotion that fante does. who knows, maybe he just isn't emtional. and i also get the impression that he leaves imprtant details out. for example, it must be 3 times in this book that all of the sudden his woman decides to leave him. he doesn't tell what events led up to this. anyway, these are mere trifles of complaints. the book was a good book, taken for what it is, a light and entertaining read, well written and concise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Best","review":"I'm not giving this book two stars because I'm one of those Bukowski-haters.

I was totally impressed by its profound insights into the life of an artist who searches through the darkness and still ends up with a kind of dead pan bitterness about the futility of it all. I never worked for the post office, but after reading this book I sure as hell never want to. I rated this high because it's so honest and I thought Mr. Bukowski did such a great job in capturing his characters: all I imagine were taken from real life. But when you read this try to look beyond the sex, drugs, booze, and gambling.

It has some nice touches--the Greek chorus of friends who add perspective to the situation, and the omniscient taxi driver who \\"guides\\" the relationship along. The music is terrific, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great chemistry","review":"Without David Wenham and Susie Porter, this would be an okay film. With them, however, this movie sizzles. Together, they are not only super-hot but super-adorable too (not an easy mix to pull off!)The only reason I gave this film four stars instead of five is due to the presence of the all-knowing/annoying cab driver. Her presence is totally superfluous and detracts from the charm of the film as a whole."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must-see movie","review":"This movie is thoroughly enjoyable - a light and funny film worth taking a look at with a great turn of events."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great resource for the GRE subject test","review":"This is a wonderful resource for the biochemistry, Cell and Molecular biology subject test.

I have a small patio and it works well for trimming or small jobs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Replacement for older grass shears--fits the bill!","review":"My husband had an old pair of these shears, and sharpening them finally gave way to the request for a new pair. He's very happy with them--clips grass around shrubs much easier, and the handles are very comfortable. My only \\"negative\\" comment is that the shears almost seemed to have been used when they arrived--either that or the oil lubricant discolored the blades a little. All in all, a satisfactory purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't look new","review":"My pruning grass shears did not look new when they came. They had srcatches on the blades. I was not happy to see that. Maybe they would have sent me a replacement, but I was tired to ask and have to ship them back."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent product","review":"I had previously bought some more expensive grass shears from my local home improvement store - not only did I get blisters from the lack of cushion on the handles (yes, I forgot to wear my garden gloves) but the blades rusted in the humidity of the summer. These are a far superior product - excellent value for the price. These shears have very comfortable handles, and I love the non-stick coating on the shears. These have been indispensible in the small areas and tight corners of my yard that I don't want to use my string trimmer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great quality for the price.","review":"I've been looking for a good, solid pair of grass shears for a while, something like my dad use to have from 50 years ago. I don't believe everything needs to be powered or rechargeable. I just want a tool that's going to last. It's nice to see there's a company still building tools to last. If these are oiled after each use and, maybe, sharpened periodically they should last the 40 years or so I've got left. When you get them in your hand you'll see what I mean. A quality tool."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Value, Works Great","review":"I purchased this set of hand shears after purchasing a sub-standard set of shears from a large retail outlet. This set of hand shears is excellent - The blades are sharp, the grip handles are comfortable, and the shears are just the right size. I was looking for a set of hand shears that were similar to what you would have found 15-20 years ago, and these fit the bill. Excellent value for the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Happy With these Shears","review":"These shears would not cut through thick grass. We tightened the blades and it helped somewhat, but still did not cut like my old shears. The handles are very soft and padded. The lenghth of the blade is good, but found that I could not get really close to the stone border I was clipping around. I would not purchase these shears again."},{"rating":"2","title":"good but...","review":"This is a good product but my hands get tired easily, wish was a little bigger for cutting the grass around my flower plants."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rust!!!!","review":"I only had these for 3 months and they are completely rusted. I cannot use and waited too long to return, I don't advise purchasing these."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better than I expected!","review":"After reading the reviews I did not have too much hope for this book. After the first couple of chapters I literally put the book down and pretty much gave up. I just could not take the accents! The next day I decided to give in one last shot and boy was I glad I did. The chemistry between James and Aunie sizzles! Although, I do agree that the suspense side was weak, it was still kind of there and the romance made you invest in the story.

A man's search for revenge for his wife's departure. A love affair with a macho man. Sounds exciting? That's what I thought in the beginning.

The suspense that I expected was not there and that was the main reason I purchased the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"High expections...let down","review":"I am so disappointed by this book! I hate to agree with the other reviewers but I do. I love Susan Andersen she is a great writer. But this book had me snoozing! It started out good but it just dragged and was boring. It was not suspenseful at all. I might have liked the book more if they didn't claim it to be romantic suspense on the spine. It was just okay. I would recommend her other romantic suspense Exposure however. That was a wonderful book!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"Aunie Franklin flees her unbalanced abusive ex-husband to start a new life in the Pacific Northwest. She grows close to a new circle of friends she meets there, while falling for bad boy James Ryder, a cartoonist with an attitude. As a suspense premise, the material here is slim. Perhaps that's why the plot never really delivers the expected tension. The only present danger in this book is that of being bored to death. There's way too much introspection and not enough of Andersen's usually wonderful dialogue. Readers should definitely pick up one of this author's other books for a great read. I'd encourage you to pass this one by, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not in English","review":"Had hoped that this might be a red guide in English.

I used this bit for the raised panel and sharpened the edge radius with a roundover with very good results. Not much to say about a router bit except that it was what it was supposed to be and did what it was supposed to. It was solid, balanced and the cutter ran true with the flute. After cutting about 20' by hand with an edge guide, there was no noticable dulling of the cutter and I didn't have any binding, gouging, tearing or burning issues on my panels."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good resource","review":"This is a very useful guide to the New York State 5th Grade Social Studies test. The book gives a very clear idea of the types of questions that will be asked on the exam, the level of difficulty and how to approach each problem. This is a book designed for parents and teachers who are preparing their kids for the test. There are two full exams with answers and excellent explanations. Overall, I think the book is a very good tool and is worth getting.The book's one drawback is that it does not have a very thorough review of the actual material that the test will cover. There is a very good vocabulary list. But that is really all in the way of substance. This may be because the actual exam does not test volumes of facts, but basic skills and concepts."},{"rating":"1","title":"It can not play with tape","review":"I set it up to receive the antenna cable from the wall outlet, then output to the TV, as I did to another VCR in the house.

It is there for the offering. Are you ready to indulge? I have been deeply affected by Laurel's insights and guidance, but beware. This book is only as honest and provocative as you are."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't deliver the goods","review":"This book was hyped as a \\"simple\\" solution to weight loss. The concepts may be simple but don't confuse simple with easy. The concept of climbing mount Everest is simple too. Somehow this \\"simple\\" set of solutions leads to a seemingly endless trail of products and seminars that will eventually get you where you want to be. I have no patince for a book that is merely a tease and a marketing tool to get you deeper in debt to it's author. Whatever good ideas were in this book got lost in my anger of being shilled."},{"rating":"2","title":"A cure, not a quick fix","review":"This book has changed my life. Laurel presents a program that if followed has the power to cure weight problems not just give a quick fix that will rebound to more weight gain. Using real life examples and specific questions you can ask yourself, Laurel guides you along the pathway to a weight solution with humor, insight, and compassion."},{"rating":"2","title":"IT WORKS!","review":"I've lost 75 lbs. using this method and it totally works. I din't diet, over exercise or impose escessive restraint on my food intake. I can't explain the joy I feel at FINALLY being able to shed that extra weight after 20 years of batteling it to no avail."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perhaps even better than the book.","review":"I first read the book and found it to be the best discussion of the emotional aspects of obesity that I have read. It is the only weight contol book that I deem appropriate to sell in my medical office. Since I spend a fair amount of time in my car, I thought I might give the cassettes a try. Usually I expect a book on tape to lose much of the impact and content. In this case I was elated to find that the tapes may have even more impact than the text. If you are an emotional eater, I recommend that you first read the book, then listen to these audio tapes over and over until the concepts sink in... and then sign up for a Solution Program course."},{"rating":"2","title":"This program helps you to discover yourself.","review":"After reading this book, I joined a Solution's group, and have taken it twice. This is much more than a weight loss program. Through doing the work that the author recommends, I have become much more in touch with myself, and have calmed down my emotionally driven eating episodes. This doesn't mean that I never indulge in emotional eating anymore, but I'm much more aware of what I'm doing, and I don't beat myself up for it as much. That, in itself, is a small miracle. I see shifts happening in my life as I use words, not weight, to express myself. This is a book that you have to work, not just read. I suggest buying the journals and joining a group if you can. This is a powerful program for those who choose to use it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Solution by Laurel Mellin","review":"Had I gone to a bookstore and picked up this book, I would never have bought it. There is nothing in it that I have not already heard or read. I guess I am looking for an easy solution and there is none. At the age of 60, I should know there is no magic formula for losing weight. When you are as depressed as I am, reading this book just adds to the depression."},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical Hocus-Pocus diet book","review":"This book was a big letdown.

It is well written and the case study approach is very helpful."},{"rating":"2","title":"changable","review":"I really appreciated the information to RELEASE bad habits and find the things that are holding us back from making the changes we want. Thank You! Was very encouraging, motivating and insightful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not everyone is one size fits all","review":"This book is a very 'one size fits all'. according to the writer, it *appears* she suggests that everyone with a weight issue has these 6 issues and that unless you fix these 6 issues in the way SHE states, you can not be cured. It blames your parents for their lack of 'insert what ever here'. Not everyone has these exact issues and writing a book that reads like a vcr manuel without no real guidance doesnt help I dont feel. I got nothing at all out of the book and was rather put off by her claiming to understand the root of all the problems with overweight people. I dont appreciate the blame being placed on parents. We, ourselves, are responsible for the most part. I dont like the 'know it all' approach. I didnt even get through the entire book before I took it back to the library. It was dull and boring with no real help of HOW to go about doing what she suggests.personal opinion only."},{"rating":"1","title":"read it twice and I wasn't cured","review":"I found the exercises to be really long and tedious, and the authors promises were never all that convincing. My second time reading it, I ended up becoming more preoccupied with food. I highly recommend Geneen Roth's \\"Breaking Free from Compulsive Eating,\\" (she actually came out 13 years before Mellin with her ideas on emotional eating). The two books actually have alot of the same principles, but a)the exercises are more natural and effective b)Roth touches upon other issues in life that interelate with weight, self-esteem, pain, sexuality in her life and with individuals in her workshops."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gookinaid Rocks!","review":"This stuff is really good...doesn't drag me down like sports drinks that are too sweet and ultimately not that good for you.It was great for a marathon, but I've started using it for more than just rigorous exercise because I realized that other times when I'm feeling sluggish or not mentally alert can be related to dehydration too.Definitely give it a shot - reasonably priced too."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's real T-rex.","review":"It's real T-rex, taller than I expected.Very interesting process to make entile skeleton.I had realy enjoyed the entire procedures."},{"rating":"2","title":"great harmonica","review":"i first bought the harmonica in the key of Ab and i loved it. the shape is very ergonomic, the carved shape. the bends in pitch i could make. the price , well these make this unit a great deal so i bought most all of the.what to compare the honer blues harp in g. that has comb plate cutting my mouth and sharp edges. i take the huang first"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Harmonica","review":"Awkward, hard to play, faulty holes, tastes bad, pinches mouth.

Takes the time to get the audience involved with all the characters, good or bad, rather than rushing to the scenes of killing and dismemberment.

When I tried to purchase a refill can, it seems that it is only sold with the dispensing hose and gauge. I ended up purchasing an additional two 12 oz cans at a local store to finish the job.

It looks spectacular and the one thing you can't help but notice is how well polished it is. Yet another fine product from the fine folks at Relic.A buying advice: get the regular edition, not the special edition: I got the special edition and the only difference is a small printed \\"real map\\" of D-Day, 10 little cards, a slim metalic box, and an extra CD with mostly text info and very little in the ways of content!

I bought the book on a Friday afternoon, and read it straight through the weekend, ignoring my husband and my children in my urgency to finish it. This is a wonderful book--filled with tangible imagery and compelling, tension building scenes. I found myself yearning for the characters happiness, and wondering if their dreams will be fulfilled--will Dottie and Walt find the bliss they deserve, will Caroline see how worthy she is of love, will the final scenes provide fulfillment of everyone's desires and requirements? I learned so much about the characters through Ms. Johns' tender portrayals, and the heartbreaking events that impacted their lives. I urge anyone to read \\"Icebergs\\"--it is a book that echoes long after you put it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book this year!","review":"What a book. I loved this book. My favorite character was Dottie. I loved reading about the past and the present and everything in between. What secrets does each generation hold? I felt as if I was there, when Walt was waiting for the night to pass after crashing, and years later when she is standing in front of what she assumes is Bobby's home. This book reminds us life doesn't always turn out pretty, but can be what you want it to be. Also I think it leaves you wondering what if you had taken this path vs path B?Ms. Johns is sure to be a top 10 author of all time. Her descriptions and imaginery is stellar. I couldn't recommend her enough. There was a bit left here and there to leave me wanting for me, but enough said to satisfy the curiosity.

However, it contains the information as a text should, clearly and concisely. Those who find it long and unreadable should look into another field, as human evolution is not an \\"easy\\" subject. It is a text, and reads as such (i.e. it is long and hard to read for retention of facts, but allows easy access to specific information through its organization and index). The reviews that give this text 1 star are probably from one or more of the professors who take issue with Wolpoff himself, which is why the two reviewers with locations give Michigan as their location. It is interpersonal battles and petty attacks such as this that led to certain lawsuits between these professors. That is pathetic.

I would not recommend the book or the course, as Wolpoff is often times unclear and disprganized."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lengthy, tedious, and pretentious","review":"This book is designed as a text, yet poorly conveys information to the reader. The chapters are tedious and lengthy, often ignoring the more important details in Paleoanthropolgy.

One thread seems to stick out, and that is poor customer service. I kind a passed over the reviews by people who were bolded over by having their first stand mixer. My acquaintance with Cuisinart's customer service is a personal one. I called their customer service number to ask questions about the internal works of the SM-55 mixer. My first question was about the composition of the moving parts, that is, were the gears all metal or were there pastic gears and pullies that made the machine work. The woman on the other end of the line told me, \\"Oh no, that gets into specifications, and we don't discuss specifications. My thought after reading other comments regarding poor customer service was that my experience said it all for me. Why step into that cow pie when you don't have to.

With my budget, I went for this Cuisinart instead. I am SOOO happy that I did. It does everything a Kitchen Aid can do, accessories, etc., for a fraction of the price. I have used it at least 3 times every week for cakes, cookies, breads. I can't wait to get the pasta attachment...! This product is so easy to use as well. I was very intimidated when I opened the box at first. Once it was all put together, looked over the instructions, I was ready to go to work. Very much sturdier than its appearance, doesn't shift on my counter at all. Not super quiet, but not super loud either. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"great mixer, hard to beat small amount of egg whites","review":"I bought the mixer to make chiffon cakes. My recipe calls for 5 egg whites only. The mixer is too big to do the job. Later, I figure our if I use the hand mixer to beat the 5 egg whites until some bubble forming, I can transfer the mixture to the mixer, and the mixer will be okay to do the rest, since there are bigger volume of egg whites to beat. It then was able to finish the job nicely. I also mixed dough to make green onion pancake. It worked nicely. I really like the automatic timer. The DVD included was helpful. I do have trouble with the lid. For me, it was hard to place and secure in place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bread hook jams into appliance","review":"If you are going to purchase this, be sure to have a 15mm thin wrench. You will need it to remove the bread hook. As the machine kneads the dough, the nut on the attachment tightens. The plastic splashguard to protect the nut and shaft from getting dirty also makes it really difficult to use a normal wrench to loosen the nut. A really poor design. The Cuisinart staff was totally unhelpful. As someone else stated, the warranty is useless, mail in service only and user pays shipping both ways. This thing is huge and would cost a fortune to ship."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warranty Ripoff","review":"This product is a wonderful product if you can manage to keep it running.

When I contacted Cuisinart to have this item repaired \\"Under Warranty\\", I found out that I have to pay to ship the item to them and enclose a check for $10.00 to have it repaired and shipped back.

Today the dough hook separated from the threaded pin that is inserted into the mixer - the threads stripped on the cheap aluminum dough hook.

Have not used it for bread or anything substantial beyond cheesecakes and cookies. The main beater's coating has started coming off and leaves a weird black residue on the spatula when scraping. Shouldn't the beater be stainless steel like the bowl? Evidently not. Cheesecake is a pain because the beater doesn't quite scrape the bottom. Every so often, I have to pull the bowl out and scrape with a spatula. The gears slip sometimes -- while making cookie dough. I pity anyone attempting bread. The overall quality of the mixer is poor and I expect that like others, mine will soon give up the ghost.Before I went shopping for a new model, I thought I should warn others. I intend to get a professional, commercial grade mixer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth the Money","review":"This mixer scoots when kneading even a small amount of a relatively soft bread dough, and the dough works its way up past the guard on the dough hook.

I had intended to get a Kitchenaid because my Nana always swore by hers, but Kitchenaid does not seem to pack the punch it used to. There were many people unhappy with theirs, and some received help from the company, and some did not seem to, so I started thinking I didn't want to spend a couple hundred more on a name when the Cuisinart had plenty of happy reviews, and seemed to be able to handle everything I require in a mixer. I am NOT a professional baker, but do get a little crazy with the baking over the holidays.So far I have mixed crab cakes, and baked 2 cakes. I LOVE having the timer to set, adjust speed, and off it goes, all alone, to turn itself off when done.

After reading glowing reviews of the Cuisinart, I decided to give it a try. In addition to Amazon's great price, there was a free food processor deal as well. That definitely helped make my decision easier!I absolutely love the Cuisinart mixer. It handles all batters and dough without a problem.

It was completely dead. I had to return it to Cuisinart at my own expense AND send a check for return shipping. Naturally, I was upset. The Amazon rep I spoke with felt sorry for me and issued a small credit for my hassle. Thankfully, the west coast repair center is in the Phoenix area. So, it didn't take the full 6-10 weeks to repair. They ended up sending me a brand new machine.I haven't used it to make anything that has required too much work...cake, frosting, meringue, cannnoli filling. But, I haven't had any other problems.

Any easy self fix right? NO... Quisinart WILL NOT let you buy any internal parts and the entire unit must be returned for repair... customer must pay shipping both ways in addition to the repair cost.Understand that this product works. well and I feel it is well made in many respects.... but read the 1 star reviews and you will see that it is very prone to malfunction. The fact that this company requires one to send the product back for a repair does not make sense to me.The local small appliance repair shops I have contacted all advised me to go with Kitchen Aid.

The timer feature does not begin to compensate. I prefer my borrowed old KitchenAid Ultra for thoroughness of mixing, quietness and ease of use.My experience is the opposite of \\"satisfied Cuisinart convert.\\" This machine jitters horribly even on a light cookie dough.I'll probably hate it until I win the lottery and can buy a different model.Total shocking disappointment. I will return it if I possibly can.UPDATE January 2009: Mixer was returned and refund granted. The search resumes. I note that KitchenAid is now selling mixers with a separate timer, clearly IMO the top feature of this Cuisinart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mostly terrific","review":"Bought this mixer after comparing it to the ubiquitous KitchenAid Artisan. This mixer has a much more powerful motor. The two additional accessory attachment ports really open this machine up for much more than just standard mixing. The dough hook is particularly good -- yeast bread dough comes out quite nice. Machine doesn't feel as substantial as the Artisan, mainly due to the fact that the Cuisinart isn't completely made of metal. The Cuisinart seems to move a little more than you'd like when mixing heavy things like bread dough. I find the splash guard mostly useless. Overall, however, this is a very good machine at a good price. I am happy with this mixer, and use it often."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful Machine","review":"I am just getting started using my new cuisinart. It is powerful. The bowl is large enough to contain the batter. The video DVD was helpful in getting me started.

Tom Hart, Thomas Hart, Tommy Hart. And the Germans - believe me, dear author, I got their names the first, second and third times. It was quite tedious to have them fully repeated over and over. I don't care how many books an author has published, this is the kind of thing that is blatantly amateurish. Where are these \\"bestselling authors'\\" editors?Sentimental slop. So very tired of the Noble White Man who helps the Downtrodden Black Man. Blagh. Why did I read it? (didn't finish it, but must take responsibility for slogging through three-quarters). Guess I was mesmerized by its many flaws. I wanted to see how often this writer was allowed to bungle. It reminds me of the recent New Yorker cartoon where the publisher is saying to the hopeful writer: \\"Your book stinks. We want to publish it!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"A Big Letdown","review":"I began this book with high hopes, as the plot set-up sounded particularly interesting. Unfortunately, the prose was turgid, cliche-ridden and imprecise. The grammar was bad. And the court scenes were embarassingly melodramatic, filled with ludicrous speeches that were intended to show the characters making cogent points, when in fact all they did was to wave the flag. This book was so intellectually flabby I was embarassed for the author. And I'm embarassed for the state of literature that so many reviewers seemed to think this bilge was compelling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious, Plodding, and Riddled With Mistakes","review":"I had a tough time getting through this one, as it was slow-paced to the point of putting me to sleep. Eventually I reached the point where I expected to find an anachronism, technical mistake, or violation of military protocol on every other page. For example, American pilots did not \\"click their heels\\" like Nazis when they saluted, as was repeated in the book many times. Nor did the dialogue between characters sound authentic to the period. I found it pretty much a waste of time and would not recommend it. Luckily mine was a library copy or else I'd have felt ripped-off."},{"rating":"1","title":"from ridiculous to absurd","review":"Just when you come to the conclusion that the story is ridiculous, it's absurdity is taken to another level. Although license is not unusual in legal thrillers, and even though the rights of an accused in 1944 were not as constitutionally sculpted as today, the story line here is simply too unbelievable. To top things off, the book is not well written. It's my first and last Katzenbach novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Plot, philosophy and a twist and turn mystery","review":"I don't know why I picked up this book. I was not familiar with the author and I certainly didn't need another book to add to the stacks of 'to be read' books all over the house. I started the book intending to read only a chapter or two. I got hooked and read until 2 a.m. when I finally had to give it up. The next day I took the book with me so I could read while waiting for my grandson...As you can tell, I loved this book. I liked the unusual plot and the twists and turns it took; I liked the characters and cared about what happened to them; I liked the philosophical undertones (so atypical in mysteries). Finally I liked the fact that everything was not tied up in a neat bundle at the end, the 'good' punished and the 'bad' either redeemed or dead. I highly recommend the book but don't start it in the evening!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Read.","review":"Have you ever wanted to just become someone else? Ever had the feeling that you were meant to do something else with your life? Ever been bullied, and wished that just once you could fight back? If any of these themes grab you, then you need to get Able, Baker, Charley by John Maxim. This is one of those rare reads that just keeps getting better chapter by chapter. I noted that this excellent book has recently been re-released too, so should not be hard to find. I have reread this book a half dozen times, and will probably continue to do so until Mr. Maxim DOES A SEQUEL."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Able","review":"Maybe its just me, but I just could not buy into the premise of this one. There were times I literally laughed out loud, and not because of a humorous passage, but that the scenario teetered on the brink of the ridiculous. I read MOSAIC and thought that was pretty good, but ABEL BAKER CHARLEY just didn't do it for me. I'm no stranger to psychological thrillers, and I can accept some pretty bizarre premises, but I think Mr. Maxim...I don't know what he was thinking with this. I have never felt so, well, insulted after finishing a book. I only give it a star because Maxim is not some hack and at least some effort was put into the building of suspense. I stuck with it in the hopes that I would have some moment of understanding, or at least acceptance, at the end, but I was sadly disappointed.

The author paints a lovely picture of Lucrezia, me-thinks maybe too much. The trouble with this family is they were so secretive it is impossible for anyone to know what is true and what is not. They didn't confide in people outside the family and never committed anything about their plots and plans to writing. Did this author learn more about Lucrezia than others who questioned her \\"virtue\\" or was he just partial to her? I remain drawn to learn more about Lucrezia and her family but that may only be realized by reading and researching more about 16th century Italy to glean what others from that time - who knew them had to say - people who actually left written documents at and of the time- such as Machiavelli, da Vinci, etc. So many books, so little time.

Yes, the filmmaker undoubtedly had the absolute best intentions. But no, sadly, the film isn't very good.Perhaps the filmmaker was too close to his subject, but FACADE suffers from a lack of clarity, direction, empathy, or understanding of the main character's plight and subsequent suicide. The characters of this film circle each other with murky intent, and a lack of forward motion in the film makes this a very long 89 minutes indeed, and the result, for me, was alot of guilt for being bored and frustrated in the face of obviously grave subject matter.The low-budget film's tech credits are admittedly a bit shakey, but not so much that if the acting, writing, and direction were working they would be a problem. The filmmaker's intent was certainly good, but unfortunately that isn't enough to end up with a good movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smooth and Clear","review":"The clouds of California are shown in high clarity with some fine views of scenery.

It seems to me that the scholarship in this book is a bit slanted toward the idea that the influences of Native Americans on the western landscape (using fire) were limited and localized. I believe this is pretty close to the truth, but I suspect that others may disagree, as it appears to be a controversial topic that engages a desire on the part of many to advocate the dignity of aboriginal cultures, even to the point of envisioning those cultures as \\"civilizations\\".

I really had to force myself to turn the pages of this plodding tale. This could very well be due to the fact that it's translated, it may come across much more smoothly in it's native tongue.

When I heard 'Yesterdays\\", I knew I heard something awesome. A friend of mine who didn't like Kenton admitted that Perkins solo on this was the best he had ever heard. It still is a classic. The whole album is intriguing and it doesn't get old. Holman and Mulligan were greats then and are giants now. What awesome jazz minds they were. I'm thrilled to have this on CD, even if it is MONO. The reproduction is excellent. It's worth buying and exploring the legendary Stan Kenton."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fabulous Lakota Love Story","review":"Although Lakota Moon is a work of fiction, the inspiration for this novel (and the curious piece of history that initially drew me to this story) lies in the true account of Cynthia Ann Parker who, at the tender age of nine, was captured by Comanches in 1836. She became thoroughly ensconced in the ways of the Comanche, marrying Peta Nacoma, a young chief famous for a series of violent raids on white settlements. Their tragic love story is part of the fabric of the American frontier.Jackson has taken the skeletal details of Cynthia Ann's short, poignant life and transformed its essence into a Lakota love story. Her fictional character, Mary Eliza McElroy, will capture your sympathy, your imagination, and your heart. Filled with emotional conflicts and rugged adventure, it is a satisfying novel, perhaps the wistful fantasy that we would have hoped for poor Cynthia Ann."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dialing is pathetically slow","review":"This phone is driving me crazy with slow dialing, and needing several attempts to make a connection.

With the VTech 5879 you're wait will be even shorter! I don't know why I replaced the original purchase of this phone (Jan. 07) with the exact same one (Aug. 09) but the bottom line is that the usable life went from 18 months to half that time. Despite replacing the battery and cleaning the contacts the handset will simply not charge. Result? No more Vtech phones for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Battery dies + Poor Customer Service from V-Tech","review":"We thought this was a great 2-line phone which worked really well until the handset stopped working completely. Customer service is very frustrating at v-tech. In order to replace the defective phone they first said it would take 30 days to send out a replacement phone. Then they said they would send me out the replacement first, but I'd have to give them a credit card number to guarantee I'd send the replacement phone back. What kind of company does that?Also they asked me to take down all kinds of reference numbers and address info for them, and asked that I include all of the information about my call to customer service in the box with the phone. (Why bother calling customer service in the first place?) Wouldn't it be better to have a standard form to email customers with all of this info? It seems very antiquated and not at all focused on customer satisfaction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book goes straight to the heart!","review":"Readers of all ages are going to adore Kostro's animal memories. His tales are often humorous, but also heart breaking. I was very entertained with his childhood fascination of picking on his older sister, since this is a theme that showed up in another of his books. I suspect the author is a bit mischievous? Ed Kostro's apparent harmony with nature and creatures will charm any animal lover! Especially meaningful is chapter 40, titled 'I Cry'. You really spoke to my heart on this one, Ed. Thank you.Chrissy K. McVay - Author"},{"rating":"2","title":"5 Stars! Highly Recommended! by Bob from Arizona","review":"Thoroughly enjoyed this book by an author who is a true animal lover.

I laughed and cried with this author; and I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves animals."},{"rating":"2","title":"Portrays the life of a mangrove","review":"Most striking is the artwork. The pictures are truly very engaging and magical, even for a three year old. The story told by the drawings themselves is most compelling--simply the life of a mangrove (tangle) over many years and through many storms (harboring many animals). The story shows how it sprouts from a floating seed. Very relevant book for anyone visiting or living near mangroves. The text is nice too; however, too dry for a small child. I give it four rather than five stars because I felt the text could have been more engaging."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good solid basic dictionary","review":"Although I understand the technical reasons for not doing so, I wish that the examples and compounds were in the Tibetan script as the base entries are. I appreciate, however, the citations being full phrases so that the dictionary helps one learn written Tibetan. I especially appreciate the providing of the Sanskrit in devanagri where a Tibetan term is used technically as a translation of a Buddhist Sanskrit term. This is especially important for those whose primary language is Sanskrit but must learn Tibetan because so many Sanskrit Buddhist texts were lost."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works perfectly well for me","review":"I'm surprised at the bad reviews this product has received. I have no complaints whatsoever about this hotplate; it heats my food in a snap, brings water to a boil quickly enough for my needs, and is built well.Some people have complained about the fan noise. If you read the reviews, you would know the fan is louder than its competitors. If the sound of a fan is too much for you, you should avoid this product- and perhaps seek therapy. Also, you might consider the obvious fact that a powerful fan is a safety feature. What's more, the fan turns off when you unplug the device- and unplugging it promptly following use is suggested in the instruction manual.Some people have also made mention of the heating element smoking. This has not happened for me at all.Several people in my office use this hotplate, and we're all very pleased with it. I'd certainly purchase another."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Plate","review":"This is a really nice hot plate.

Yes, it is audible but it certainly is not annoying.We use our Aroma on our outside patio (my wife doesn't like to smell up the house with food odors ... which I think is absurd, but the Aroma was a lot less expensive than a divorce).

Although Millie is clearly the main character most of the story revolves around the people around her. Millie and Hugh, her love interest, spend the entire book, up until the last chapter, denying their feelings and avoiding each other. Their interactions at time seemed childish.I have also read many books set in different countries around the world and this was the first time I felt like I couldn't picture myself there.

The writing was decent, but nothing special. It was hard to keep up with the different viewpoints--one minute we're reading Millie's mind, the next we're reading Orla's. The story itself was nothing new or interesting, though I did give it a chuckle once or twice (the predicaments Hester finds herself in are a bit amusing). The ending was the biggest disappointment of all. It seemed like there should have been at least one more chapter to give the audience some closure. However, if you ever get trapped on a desert island with this book being the only thing in your posession, I suppose you could have done worse."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"I got this book for free and also because it has a high rating on Amazon.

The topic could be painful and distressing, and any parent looking for this kind of help is most likely to be in some distress. Yet the program maintains a light hearted and humorous tone in order to make such a topic tolerable. Frankly, the program is entertaining! The program is presented very clearly and should help parents to engage their children successfully.

Destiny brings together an older, well established business woman (Paz) with spirtually free younger man of the land (Juan Manuel). Both respectfully of their committments to marriage and a chain of events leads them to each other, then marriage and family. Always struggling along the way, just like your typical telenovela.It has a different story, and has a bit of action in it when Paz hires Juan Manuel to protect her from threats on her life.

It has a green focus assist light that works very well. It is very bright and works in total darkness and has a very good range. Seems that the focus assist light has come a long way. Some of the earlier generation assist lights were next to useless. Not the F30. It's an ideal club/dance/bar camera for very low light conditions - using a flash. Sure beats my Canon S70 - which had an orange focus assist light that was useless at helping the camera focus in low light."},{"rating":"2","title":"YES, this is a 5-star digital camera.","review":"After reading hundreds of reviews on this FUJI F30 digital camera at so many websites, I finally purchased one at Amazon.com and this is a 5-star digital camera.

Battery life is excellent. The Natural Light & with Flash (two shots sequentially) mode is very useful. Overexposure/blown highlights/purple fringing is annoying when it makes an appearance; correcting using the exposure controls is annoyingly only available in manual mode, so you can't combine expose adjustment with the various scene presets. No way to delete multiple images at once: it's one or all only. Having enjoyed this camera's low light capabilities, I don't think I could do without them: there are too many shots I wouldn't have got without it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best picture quality","review":"Yes this camera takes great pictures in low light, capturing subjects and background alike. As well, it does beautifully outdoors. It seems to have rave reviews but I didn't find the quality of pictures to my standard. I like crisp, clean, and sharp photographs. I found these to be a bit fuzzy and dull. While it has nice features, I expected better and was highly disappointed in the pictures themselves. They aren't bad if you just want average pictures, but if you are expecting nice clear images, you may want to be sure to try one out first. They look ok when you playback on the camera too, but not as well on the computer or printed out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Underwater Camera - Do not buy Fuji until replace xD memory card format !","review":"I will never by a Fuji or Olympus camera again as long as they continue to use a non-mainstream memory card format such as the stupid xD-Picture memory card format.The camera is good. Both the stills and video are great - even sound comes through nicely using the Fuji underwater case.However once I discovered that taking and viewing underwater videos is much more interesting than stills I quickly came up against the limits of the stupid xD-Picture memory card format Fuji uses. While you can get a 32GB SD cards for low cost for every other camera on the planet, the highest capacity Xd memory card you can find is a tiny 2GB; fine for stills but sucks for video ( especially when you have to open an underwater case to replace). The xD format is a dead end - do not expect to see increased capacity memory cards.-Ed"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good camera with some disappointments","review":"This camera performs very well at low light condition as described by others. Battery life is superb. The disappointed things are minor, but sometimes they can be very annoying: (1) It increases speed to achieve \\"Anti-blur\\" effect which is fine. But if you want to use this desirable function (in this mode), one cannot use manual or aperture priority, nor \\"Scene Position\\" mode. (2) Software design flaws: when viewing blow-upped pictures using the camera, one cannot advance. In addition, there is no date recorded ON each picture taken for replay/view or printing except when using Fuji's software for printing (I have not figured that out yet). This function has been standard for all the film cameras, but not this one. Very inconvenient for saving pictures in file (users need to type and label dates?).After 6 months of rare usage, the lens stuck in the body. We have sent it for repair, and hope it can be fixed (under warranty)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oscar Winning Low Light Performance","review":"I bought the F30 to replace a broken Canon SD700IS. I liked the 700IS, but I knew it was a very smart point and shoot. I wanted a camera as small as the SD700, but with manual features so you can make the camera work for you. Lo, the Fuji F30. This camera continues to amaze me. The low-light capability is truly incredible. Read the numerous reviews and look at the sample results. It's true. The F30 at ASA800 is BETTER than the Canon 700IS at ASA400.I particularly like the \\"photometry\\" button easily accessible, so you can switch from spot, centerweight or average metering to get the effect you want. And the manual exposure really is - you can set the f-stop and shutter. Flash is decent for the size of camera. And what's up with the battery? It never seems to run out. I highly recommend this camera. I'm a pro and very picky about my carry-around cameras. This is the best I've had."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best compact digital for available light","review":"I enjoy available light photography with fast lenses and Leica cameras. When using P&S digitals, I've been frustrated by poor image quality at 400 and higher ASAs (like muddy old VHS tapes), slow lenses, and sluggish shutter lag. The Fuji definitely takes a huge stride at the high-speed image quality problem (possibly the best 800/1600/3200 images of any digital P&S), has a reasonably fast f2.8 lens and decent shutter timing. It can definitely take good photos without flash in bars and restaurants and general indoor conditions. Forget stabilitation if you want photos of people, if they are moving, nothing can stabilize that; you need higher sensitivity or faster lenses. The kicker is that the camera is one of the least expensive cameras I've ever bought, so even as digital depreciates the value of the camera, you don't feel like your investment is for nought."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice camera but not a great one","review":"This camera is very impressive for the price. It does an impressive job in low light, has a very nice screen, the menus are fairly intuitive, time from power on to first shot is quite satisfactory and the refresh rate and shutter lag quick... just what I need with kids who keep moving.I do notice quite a bit of noise in photos (very disappointing) and flesh tones often take on a peachy or pink tone which is unnatural looking. I also find the inability to adjust the ISO manually frustrating.This F30 is a very nice camera, for the most part I enjoy it and the pictures it takes, but it does sometimes miss (with the noise and color issues). Overall I would buy it again, but it reinvigorates my desire for a digital SLR for those times when I need more than a \\"nice shot\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fine instrument","review":"I was looking for a compact digital camera capable of producing 8 x 10 prints of a quality similar to my D-SLR. Phil Askey's review convinced me that there might be such a thing with the additional virtue of performing exceptionally well under low light conditions. After three months and several hundred photos the F30 has certainly lived up to my expectations. With aperture and speed priority options it delivers welcome flexibility in unusual situations. It has a larger than usual image sensor.The big LCD screen is nice, but occasionally I miss a conventional viewfinder as a help to stabilize the camera against my forehead. I also think a greater speed than F5 would be nice at long focal lengths."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast, good resolution and LOW NOISE","review":"For a number of years I have been seeking the best small digital camera, where for me the best equates to portability, fast action, good resolution and low noise particularly in low light conditions like indoors (I refrain from using flash). The F30 appears to be the current leader to satisfy these requirements. It produces excellent pictures at ISO 800, not bad at 1600 and can at a pinch be used at 3200 for that \\"available light shot\\" you just cannot get any other way. I have tried Canon and Panasonic cameras and have been disappointed with their noise levels. If there was an improvement I would like to see it would be to extend the wide angle down to an equivalent of 28mm focal length."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just buy it...you'll like it.","review":"I've had the f30 for 10 weeks and I really like it. I take it everywhere in my pocket (in a 3x6 inch plastic snack bag to protect the screen from scratches).This a remarkable piece of technology. The images are as sharp as many larger and more expensive digital camera but pictures at the ASA 3200 are pixelated. The power engineering is amazing...daily pictures for a week without recharging.The camera controls are are good as possible with a tiny camera. The minimal shutter delay is a welcome improvement over older digital cameras. The auto mode takes great pictures in many different lighting conditions. The macro mode usually gets the focus sharp. The double picture mode, one with flash and one without, is great for the many picture when you really want a good picture and are not sure whether to use fill flash. The museum mode, no sound no flash, is great for stealth photography.Everyone who I have allowed to try the f30 wants to buy one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Camera","review":"I bought this camera last year as a gift to myself - it's amazing, beautiful clean shots, hardly any editing neccessary (for red eye reduction etc). The only reason why I did not give it a full 5 star rating - is because the zoom on the camera is only x3 and the digital zoom is not even worth mentioning, however don't be distressed - you can more than make up for it, when editing on your computer using the software that came with the camera.Sadly, my own was stolen & had it not been for that, I would still be quite content to use it, so now I'm looking into upgrading to either the F31 or F50, but too be honest, I'm more leaning towards the F31 - it's almost exactly the same, but has face recognition!MichelleTrinidad & Tobago"},{"rating":"2","title":"Met all of my travel needs!","review":"Lightweight, compact, long battery life, 500+ photos with 1GB card.

I bought the book for my son to use in detailing model cars and model superheroes only to find that a large part of the book is devoted to painting nude fairies! These are anatomically correct women with butterfly wings on their back. Needless to say, we won't be using this book. I am writing this review primarily to warn other parents considering this book for their kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"TRY THIS BOOK FOR PERFECT SKIN COLORS","review":"I am very happy to own this book which explains how to professionally paint human figures and aircraft with airbrush.

I opened the sensor unit and found the magnetic sensor broken in two. I called the customer support line (5) Five times and left a message. NO REPLY! I tried e-mailing the \\"support\\" in box - NO REPLY! ZERO customer service - NIL - ZIP - Anyone want a defective weather station. I would avoid La Crosse Technology products at all cost."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice temperature station, otherwise worthless garbage","review":"Our rain gauge and wind meter almost never worked. After fiddling with them for years, I finally gave up. They would work for a few minutes then stop, or a few hours, or days. It makes no sense whatsoever. Next time I will buy a wireless indoor/outdoor temperature & humidity unit for a lot less money. As countless others have said, this is disposable high priced techno-garbage with miserable technical support who lie and blame me for their defective junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"La Crosse WS-9035U","review":"I had great hopes for this product when I ordered it, but, after a little more than 1 month of use my unit is consistently +/- 6 to 10 degrees from actual temperature (figured by cross-checking with other temp sensors in the yard) that is just not accurate enough in my opinion. In addition to the temperature question, the indoor unit \\"loses\\" the signal from the outdoor unit at unpredictable and varying times even with fresh batteries and for no apparent reason. This causes the entire \\"outside\\" measurements to \\"blank out\\" for several hours at a time. The readings always seem to come back eventually, but all in all, for anyone who is more than just casually interested in weather observation, this system is too undependable to be relied upon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this product","review":"Unfortunately I couldn't even get to try my La Crosse Technology Weather Direct weather station because the necessary download to my computer just wouldn't take (tried five times). Registration was constantly rejected. Not surprisingly the so called \\"help\\" section was useless. FAQs were useless and there was no \\"Contact Us\\" feature on their web site or 800 number to call. Into the trash with this useless piece of junk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Weather Station","review":"Great product, does what it's advertised to do. Easy set-up, if no signal just pull batteries and start over. Very accurate reading when matched to local tv weather. The smiley face guy is very good at telling you when you got the indoor temp/humid in the right range and the other animation to idicate outdoor trends (bar pressure) is uncanny at predicting the future weather. The hard wire between the outdoor sensors is bit of a pain as you have to run wire between the two, i got just the right distance and turned out OK. Oh, there is another identical (i think?) unit with \\"TWC\\" logo that cost $15 more--WHY??"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Value","review":"This unit seems to be a good value for the money. Mine has been in operation for a month and has performed well. The distance from the sensor/transmitter to the weather station is approximately 75 feet and it maintains the signal at all times. The atomic clock locked in within a few minutes of operation. I mounted the sensor/transmitter high up under the eave of my workshop roof (the directions say to mount it out of direct rain), and do I have a problem with heat collecting under the eave during the day and giving me high readings. I plan to drop the sensor a little lower to see if this helps. The anemometer works well and appears to be accurate, it does seem a little flimsy and I wonder how well it will hold up in South Florida conditions. All in all I am very pleased with the unit and its features and feel this is a good value for the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inexpensive Alternative to Mini-weather station","review":"This relatively inexpensive system has 90% of the functionality of a mini-weather station at a fraction of the price. It includes average wind speed, wind gust speed, indoor and outdoor temperature and humidity, barometric-based forecast and official atomic clock time. It uses the same outdoor remote sensing units as the much more expensive stations. Does not include wind direction or software to record readings over time. If you can live without those things, this is all you need."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wind Meter Never Worked","review":"I bought this weather station mainly for the wind meter. I watched the price go down to fifty dollars and knew this was a great deal. However, the wind speed always showed 0.0 on my display. I tried everything suggested at the Lacrosse website and by their customer service. The customer service people were limited in technical proficiency and were slow to respond to calls. Everything else works fine. However, my experienc seems to be the exception to the rule. I spent a lot of time trying to make the wind meter work. Mine is just a cautionary story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Own it and you are on your own!","review":"I thought this product would be much better than it is. Received it as a gift. The only way to change a variable in it is to try to follow the very poor instructions provided. No variable can be changed individually. You must start at the beginning and change all variables to get to the one you want to change. I sent a request to this company's product support unit from its website asking for better, more specific instructions because at first I did not believe anyone would design a unit so poorly. Its been one week and still no response from them. I thought I'd call them instead, but their telephone number is not a toll free call - obviously they do not want to hear from their customers.

The humidity levels and wind speeds are very useful, as is the windchill factor. It took me a while to find an ideal spot for the temperature sensor. The first spot I chose was to much in the sun making it innacurate in the summer. Then I put it under the deck, but near the furnace vent which made it inaccurate in the winter, third times a charam. Luckily the wire between the temperature sensor and the wind sensor is quite long so they can be pretty far away from each other. I hung the wind sensor on the rain gutter on the top corner of my house."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shameless Junk","review":"I am on my second unit which has been back to the factory, at my expense twice for repair and it still does not syncronize with WWV.

We had 60-70 mph gusts, but this unit only measured 33 MPH at its maximum. Very disappointing. I also wish it recorded historical wind gusts, but it does not.I think the forecaster is a bit more accurate than most, this is a plus. I hope they come up with a fix for the wind speed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lacross Weather Station and Weather Sensor","review":"Very pleased with this product. It was easy to install and seems to work perfectly. I did not install the wind indicator since I don't see a practical use for it in the St. Louis area. Since I didn't need that feature I didn't pursue a means for installation which would be more easily accomplished with a post of some sort that was not included. I did try it out by simply holding it in the wind and it too seemed to work well. I may install in the future just for fun. But overall I was very very satisfied with the product and the instructions for installation and use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weather &Time","review":"The thing will not keep time.

Overall I was fairly pleased, the wireless range was good and it seemed fairly accurate. Two days ago the sending unit quit sending and all remote information is now blank. I changed the batteries on both the remote and main unit, reseated the cables, all for nothing. So, the unit is broken and basically worthless.It appears that the WS-9035U is yet another example of 21st century disposable technology. Would like to buy another wireless weather station as I enjoy knowing the current weather conditions, but now I need to research for awhile. No more La Crosse Technology products for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD For Power Yoga","review":"I don't like the typical slow music for Power Yoga. This Cd with all the strong drumbeats motivates my class to really push themselves to their edge. I highly recommend this cd for Power Yoga as well as Pilates class."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not deliver on its promises","review":"I became interested in this CD based on the fact that people who purchased Sundari-A Jivamukti Yoga Class also purchased Asana 2, Moving Meditation. These two albums are radically different. I've found Sundari to be meditative and conducive to relaxing yoga sessions. I expected Asana to be more upbeat, but still meditative and inviting to do yoga by. Not true. This album is based on a continual synthesized drum beat, and despite the fact that it is billed as being by \\"various artists,\\" each track is repetitive and does not vary from the same tiresome beat of the previous track. Nothing about the album could be honestly recognized as meditative or spiritual, despite the suggestive titles of various tracks. I was quite disappointed with the album and found that it does not deliver on its promise of a meditative workout."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love This!","review":"introduced to me in my massage therapy school. love it & have told many friends about it. has a modern feel to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fits my '05 MDX","review":"Not sure why Lund/Amazon doesn't sell one for the '05 MDX, but I bought this one and it fits, kinda. Looks nice, shipped fine, and sits securely on the hood. Only 4 holes to drill, hardest part was layout as the profile isn't a flat line. Drill the holes with a 3/32 bit, and don't over torque the screws. I say fits \\"kinda\\" due to the underside of the hood--the \\"best\\" places to mount aren't where the prefab tabs are.

It shows the genesis of a great group and it's easy with 39 songs. For those who don't know well the Bee Gees of the mid-60s (with great Beatles influences), this selection is a good deal and the price is right.The collection lacks of information about year of release and album, names of musicians, duration of tracks. The 3 CDs shows the same picture of the group. Anyway I'm glad to buy it and as a Bee Gees fan I've been playing it over and over"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the professional military analyst","review":"I always look forward to new books on modern military affairs and I was excited when I saw James Dunnigan's DIGITAL SOLDIERS. However I was greatly disappointed by the book. The author's informal style of writing does not promote his professional credentials. Very few weapons systems are even mentioned, and the author jumps around all through the book from subject to subject. I would recommend Tom Clancy's series of non-fiction books such as SUBMARINE and FIGHTER WING. Jane's and Brassey's produce many excellent publications, although they are often very expensive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Borrow it from someone","review":"As a single woman in my 30's, I wanted to relate to these women but it didn't happen. Perhaps these women aren't really this self-absorbed and lacking self-control, but that's the way the author writes them. Why couldn't she have found a woman who works as an accountant or administrative assistant? Not everyone leads such glamourous lives; flying from coast to coast, meeting, dating and sleeping with high profile men. I almost gave up half way through because I was turned off by their bad choices, but I persevered because I wanted to know how it all turned out. So, in that sense, it was not a bad book. If this is what single life is like in CA and NY, I'm more than happy to stay in the midwest."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is NOT generalizable","review":"Brilliant and innovative idea for a book--but did Roth have to select three vapid, self-absorbed clones to represent the late20s-early30s single woman? The text was certainly entertaining, but I feel that the premise of the book would have been inordinately more effective if the women were a bit more divergent in their jobs and pursuits. Not all of us work in entertainment and date a bunch of jerks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad production, but now without it's charm.","review":"I'm a bit of a collector of superhero memorabilia and wanted to pass on some information on the CD. The material was originally released by Golden Records in the mid to late 60's. The Lp would have been released with a comic. In this case, it would have been a special reprint of Avenger #4 (Captain America Joins the Avengers) and followed the comic word for word.Golden Records didn't put much production value into it's children's records. There's no incidental music and the sound effects are a bit harsh on the ears.This CD has a couple of things going for it that the Superman & Batman releases don't. Number 1, It's fairly easy to find reprints of Avengers #4. One can even find scanned pages in various Yahoo groups or on usenet. Number 2, Avengers #4 reintroduced Captain America. Cap was one of the more important characters of comics Golden Age and having audio that faithfully follows the comic is fun. It's geeky, but it's fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Doesn't look \\"homemade\\"","review":"Ilove finding books with patterns that don't scream \\"homemade\\" that make people ask if you would like to sell it. This book contains patterns that are just like that. I wish that they had instructions for larger size in a couple of them. I can figure that out on my own. I also would suggest that yardages for yarn would be listed, it makes it easier to subsitute, esp when the yarn is not available in the states. Also you have to remember that a double crochet is a single in the states.

It is also a British book, and that means that the stitches are very different to American stitches, so unless you know the conversion, it's very difficult for an American to follow the patterns. Plus, the author tells you to do certain things, like particular embroidery stitches or pom-poms and then doesn't tell you how.Definitely not for the beginner, and a real disappointment to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great ideas!","review":"I look at a LOT of knit and crochet books. This is one I am willing to buy. It has wonderful ideas that are a step above the standard baby crochet style. I found the instructions easy to follow, and the results rewarding. Even the book itself is a compact square shape, which fits easily in a project bag. I am an intermediate crocheter; it is possible that this book is a little beyound total beginners. But buy it anyway to get inspired!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great find","review":"I absolutely LOVE this boook. I'm relatively new to crochet, and would consider myself an advanced beginner. That said, this book is definately NOT beyond the grasp of someone who is new to crochet. She does use british crochet terms, but they're all explained in detail (including pictures of how to do each and what they look like) in the first pages of the book. I've never made anything besides baby afghans and booties, and so I tried the smocked dress that's on the front cover of the book. It came out great - I had NO problems with the pattern. I would recommend this book to anyone, whether you're a beginner or you've been crocheting for a long time. There are a lot of great, unique, and absolutley adorable patterns in this book that you won't find anywhere else.

It comes with some hardware which was unnecessary for the SVn. The screen will mount directly onto the stock naked mounting bracket. However If you want the maximum windscreen height and optimal angle you will have to modify the screen by lifting the screen to it's max height on the vertical eyelets which are the headlight housing bolts (The screen fits best between the outer steel plate and the inner mounting bracket) and then drill holes below the horizontal eyelets so that they align with the flange on the stock bracket."},{"rating":"1","title":"F16 windshield","review":"I have CB919, and thought that this windshield was designed for this bike, how I was wrong.

These novels are fun, intriguing and semi informative. And, they're about AFRICA.For those largely ignorant (as was I) of the Italian invasion of Abysinia (aka Ethiopia) in the mid-Thirties, Cafe on the Nile is especially interesting.The White Rhino HotelA Cafe on the NileThe Devil's OasisShanghai Station.

It can be contrasted and viewed as a continuation of Snow White's life story.I think this movie can be used to teach young children about growing up, getting married, and having a family. Snow White as a mother and King (Prince) Charming as a father may be hard for older Snow White fans to accept, but young children will see it as a natural phase in life. The seven friendly giants (the dwarf's cousins) can be used to teach values such as honesty, and compassion.I think this film has educational value and should be shown on TV more often during the holiday season."},{"rating":"2","title":"Camaro Repair manual","review":"Having owned a 1997 SS Camaro for the last Fifteen yrs and planning on keeping it, felt I needed a repair manual for car.I do most of my own repairs and sometimes you need plenty of help with how to.Ordered this repair manual because I needed one and the price on this one was a lot better than in the auto parts store.Came quickly and was as expected."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super service for supersolano","review":"I really appreciate the service.

It both starts off bad and ends bad. Mr. Wogglebug (again in this book he is a professor) tells the Scarecrow that he has no family tree. But he would NEVER say a thing like that. It's IMPOSSIBLE for him to EVER hurt ANYONE'S feelings. Then the Scarecrow goes searching for his family tree, he finds his bean pole and comes to the Silver Islands where the inhabitant's look like China people. And he discovers that he is their emperor, Chang Wang Woe, and he has a rather large family, but he later returns to Oz. This book is SO stupid. So please don't read it.

I think that Ms. McMillan should have stuck with just writing fiction since I just felt more irritated with each page. Even with the things that you see in the films today, I can't remember coming across anything with more illogical plot points and sloppy construction in telling a story. This reminds me of when we had to write fiction for our 3rd grade English class except for the fact that those stories were much better. Avoid this book and read her earlier titles, such as One Better, Knowing and Blue Collar Blues."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good try but falls short","review":"This has the potential to be a wonderful book. McMillan's attempt to incorporate events from the Civil Rights movement could have helped make this a gripping family epic.Unfortunately, the historical events are like unrelated news flashes interrupting the storyline. This black soap opera is long and unimpressive. The characters lacked substance and believability. This was less the story of a Southern Black family caught in the Civil Rights era and more of a movie-of-the-week melodrama."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed!","review":"First, I had to read nearly a third of this book before it peaked my interest. Then, I found it to be too far-fetched and the family had a MUCH too tragic existence. From death to disease, it was more than I bargained for. The history lesson was decent and it demonstrated that a great deal of research time was spent. This was my first book by this author and despite the fact that I did not enjoy it, I will read others.

There are many adjustments and the results are consistent and repeatable once you know what you are doing. The instructions aren't very good. It took me about 4 trial and error arrows before I figured out how to set it up properly. I have the right helical clamp, and it's easy to adjust the thumbscrews on the main unit to set the vane on the shaft for proper contact. Much of the fletcher is made of plastic, but it's a very stiff, durable plastic that feels like quality. I've made 2 dozen arrows (some vanes and some feathers) and plan on making many more with this fletcher. Some people are worried about the fletch glue sticking to the plastic clamp. I use fletch-tite glue and have no problem picking the excess off the clamp with my finger.

Maybe it works better for larger quantities--we've only used 2 or 4 cups. Maybe it would work better if we added more water.

The foam inserts don't seem that they will last too long, but they do perform their intended purpose, and keep the arrows mostly secure (there is some movement of the arrows). I wanted something a bit more stable, so I used the plastic spacers/inserts from the packaging my arrows came in to secure them, as the inserts fit well in the case (two inserts each holding 6 arrows, side by side, for a total of 12 arrows) and provided a much better fit. I also use this case for my crossbow bolts, again using the inserts from the bolt packaging to secure the bolts in the case, and use the foam to pad the top and bottom of the bolt bundle, so they don't slide about. There is room left over in the case for field tips, broadheads, etc. I would recommend this case; the only thing I didn't really like about it was the foam, but using the above method remedies this shortfall quite nicely."},{"rating":"2","title":"MTM Case","review":"Love this arrow case, perfect for a weekend or a long week of hunting, great for taking on trips.

The \\"Turn the Page\\" alert has been removed, but all other references to the comic are still on the CD.Golden Records didn't put much in the way of production value into their children's records. The acting is stiff. The sound effects are a bit hard on the ears. The CD's one saving grace is that it's fairly easy to find reprints of the comic.

I believe this book is intended to both the scholar and the dilettanti (like me), because of it's structure clearness, and the care the author takes in giving enough examples for making clear what he is thinking. Nevertheless, due to the lenght of this book, it is imposible to attain a detailed overview of Pound's poetry (that is why I give to it only 4 stars). Despite of that, this book is a MUST read, if you wish to make a smooth approach to Pound's works (not only the so-called Pound's poetry is revised, but also his Translations)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book-A must for all Christian to have a sucessful life","review":"Dr. Manley has found a way to explain God's plan for our lives as Christian's.

She is one versatile actor.The plot is almost predictable and at times just a little far fetched. But, who cares, it's a movie and it does leave you with that feel good all over feeling when you're done watching.I see this movie has been discontinued by the manufacturer.

I bought it about a month ago at a local kitchen supply store, and have been really happy with it. It heats up instantly, doesnt stick, etc.The reason I left out 1 star is because of a bad design. It's very hard to hold on to the handles when taking the food out of the Wok. They should have implemented one big handle, like on a pan. Secondly, their temperature control is sort of hidden under the wok, makes it a BIT hard to change the temperature... but it's not a big problem.Conclusion: If you want a great electric wok, for the price, this is defenitely a great one.

I figured they may have made a few improvements in that time, so opted to by a new one. It was well worth it. Heats up much faster, cools down quicker, larger cooking surface. Since I have a pantry, it stored in the same space as before. I like the metal lid. It is lighter than my first one so I can lift it with one hand and spoon contents out with the other.

A good story about two brothers coming up in 1930s Germany, and through 1945. However, the quality of the dvd was not good. To me it looked something that was copied off a VHS, (by an amateur) onto a dvd. The movie quality was not professionally restored. I have a top of the line Plasma TV, and I could not improve the picture with my remote by changing picture modes, size, contrast, etc. If this was a quality dvd restoration, it would be excellent.------Don Sawyer, Rochester, NY"},{"rating":"2","title":"CHSimon","review":"This fictional dramatization of the life of a typical middle class German family and the effects of the third reich and Adolf Hitlers 12 year reign of terror, does an excellent job in humanizing what must have been a horrile dilhemma for German people in the 30s and 40s. David Warner is terrific as the heartless Reinhardt Heydrich whose influence on the oldest son in the family changed the boy from skeptic and cynic into fulfledged believer. Tony Randall is also excellent as a \\"Joel Grey\\" type emcee at the local Night Club who dares to criticise the NAZIS and pays the ultimate price for his performances. All in all the performances are believable if you can get past some of the heavy British accents which are mixed in with bland American accents like that of Carrol Baker who plays the mom. The sharp contrast in accents is kind of distracting."},{"rating":"1","title":"2-hours of bad history","review":"There are so many inaccuracies in this film that a history of the SS by the National Equirer would be closer to the truth.

Well, even when there is water left in mine, the loud annoying buzzer goes off, and poached eggs are barely showing any white.

The plastic rack feels flimsy when you have to pick it up fully loaded and carry it to the sink without scalding yourself. You need a large bowl of cold water to lower the rack into because the eggs are very hot. So, I have to stay nearby and wash a large bowl and the unit. For hard boiled eggs, I really can't see the advantage over the pot on the stove with my kitchen timer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so great","review":"I purchased this because of the brand(Krups)but it turned out to be one of those not so great items. Cooked the eggs OK but just not good enough to keep. Too many other egg cookers for the same or less money which are probably better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weird shape poached eggs","review":"This egg poacher just arrived today. I unpacked it and saw that the poaching trays are each semi-circular and LARGE. The pan that I have used for years is like an insert to a stove top saucepan and each of the four compartments holds one egg, about 1/4 cup each. The Krups pans look like they'd take twice that quantity, which means your egg is not only going to be a weird shape but extremely thin. This is going back without even being used."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT AS ADVERTISED","review":"No timer. No second tray. Hard to clean. What you've got is a thing that boils eggs -- no sound to alert you when the eggs are done and it just keeps cooking, no automatic shut off.

Last night she told me that she ruined over one dozen eggs trying to 'cook' them to make deviled eggs for New Year's Eve.

I definitely want to find all the paperwork to send it back to you!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazon is selling defect product.","review":"This \\"brand new \\" machine failed after 1 week of use.

It's easy to use and the timing is correct for each style of eggs. When I used the egg poacher however, I found that unless you use an extra large egg, the poacher container is only half full and produces a flat poached egg. It also imparts a distinctly plastic flavor to the egg even after I washed the plastic inserts by hand and in the dishwasher. I pitched it and bought the Chef's Choice egg cooker which is only about $10 more and doesn't have these problems."},{"rating":"2","title":"Idiot Proof - almost","review":"I love this product.

I definately recommend this cooker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total waste, no support","review":"Not bad at first, though supposedly hard-cooked eggs didn't get quite done enough. However, before I even had a chance to fiddle with water and such, it quit working. I didn't have the receipt so I couldn't return it -- and it had been discontinued by the retailer anyway. Repeated attempts to reach Krups were unsuccessful, nor would they respond to multiple emails.

Overall a very good addition to my kitchen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Junk","review":"After carefully reading the reviews on Amazon and other sites, I decided to purchase the Krups egg cooker. What a disappointment. The poached eggs come out long and thin, not resembling any sort of poached egg I am familiar with. Despite following the instructions and puncturing the eggs before hard boiling, at least one explodes during every cooking cycle, creating extra clean-up work. After only 4 or 5 uses, the buzzer alert signaling the eggs were finished stopped working (although this may be a blessing, given how horribly annoying the sound is). All in all, a disappointment, and I wish I had never purchased this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Krups Egg Cooker poorly designed","review":"Krups 230-70 Egg Express Egg Cookerbad design. the included water measurer is very hard to read and difficult to get the right measure. Eggs sometimes crack open and contents spread about. The alarm indicating that cooking is done is too loud and harsh, offensive actually. When one load of eggs has been cooked, it is necessary to wait another 30 minutes before the appliance has cooled enough to be used again - if you try too soon you get that loud, harsh alarm. I had a Sunbeam egg cooker many years ago and hoped for the same kind of quality. Very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review of Krups egg cooker","review":"Very useful item. Much easier than boiling eggs in a pot. I use it every day and wouldn't want to be without it. I actually got this as a replacement for the one I had before, after the egg-holder part of it got broken. That part wasn't sold separately, but it was worth it just to replace the whole thing. Interestingly, after ten years it's still the identical product; they didn't see the need to make it fancier, more complicated, or more expensive. I recommend this highly to anyone who likes boiled eggs."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Eggmaker","review":"I purchased this item based primarily on previous reviews. It certainlyis an excellent product at an attractive price through Amazon.com. The first time I made poached eggs, the timer went off way too early--I don't know why; however, the next time (and every time since then) the eggs were perfect. Hard boiled eggs were just right from the very first time I made them. Instructions and operation of the unit are simple and should be read thoroughly prior to use. Clean-up is easy, too. You'll also like the way the power cord stores in the unit's base.

You know the perfect Martha Stewart looking ones with no green rings. That alone is fantastic when you're making eggs for company. Secondly, it frees up a pan and a burner and we all know that is priceless during the holidays. Just made all my eggs for dressing and deviled eggs in just minutes. No guess work, really no work at all. The cooker comes with a plastic cylinder that has a needle on the end of it. Just poke your eggs so the steam can escape. The cylinder itself is a measuring device for the amount of water to add. You just fill to line based on how many eggs and how done you want them. Turn the cooker on and it beeps when the eggs are done. And now your done! How simply is that!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Krups egg cooker","review":"Krups egg cooker, is an easy way to cook eggs.

I assumed I understood what the two settings meant based on their picture. WRONG!

Unfortunately I could never get them 'just right'. Now I have this egg cooker and they are perfect every time. Hard boiled eggs come out perfect as well. I do not like poached eggs, so I cannot comment on that function.Something to point out is that this machine is really very tiny (smaller than my 10-cup Krups coffee pot) so it moves easily in and out of a kitchen cabinet.It is very convenient in the morning to use this machine while getting ready for work. It is no fuss cooking!I highly recommend this cooker if you enjoy eggs.11/2/2012 - update - After TEN years, I am happy to report this little guy is still cooking perfect eggs. Perfect eggs, every time. So pleased with this purchase!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best!!!! (much better than Cuisinart CEC-7 Egg Cooker)","review":"I had the Cuisinart CEC-7 Egg Cooker and ended up returning it. Krups is much better because:- it accurately cooks the eggs for the doneness you want- it is small and light (v.s. heavy and chunky cuisinart)- it cooks & warms the eggs- it doesn't burn your hand (cuisinart's metal cover burns your hand)- it is $10 less expensive than cuisinartJust a great product overall! Get this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Three tricks for using this egg cooker","review":"First, pierce the rounder end of the egg, not the pointy end. If you pierce the pointy end, the egg white will often leak out, making a mess and leaving the egg inside slightly misshapen.Second, for hardboiled eggs only, is to place the cooked eggs immediately in cold water or even ice water. This makes it easier to remove the shell.Third, I find I like my hardboiled eggs a little more cooked than the machine produces, so I add a little more water for a longer cooking time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great for me!","review":"I brought this egg cooker into work to cut down on my breakfast costs. It works wonderfully, cooks all my eggs to a perfect hard boil. I haven't tried any other settings. A couple notes - the gunk it leaves on the cooking element is pretty gross. Also, the buzzer is more annoying than it needs to be - I have to run to it from my desk before my coworkers kick me as the buzzer just goes and goes until you flip the switch to off. I would have preferred a 'ding' or nice bell. But for $20, I can't complain too much. Worth the money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"hard to clean","review":"For poached eggs this is not the machine.

Decided to try unit as damaged items appeared to not affect it's function. Followed enclosed directions and ended up with a great hard boiled egg, but also a large puddle of water surrounding unit. Also you cannot use it again until unit has cooled completely, around 45 minutes.

I took the lid off as directions and the steam burned my hand. Atleast when i open a microwave popcorn bag it warns me of steam, this did no such thing.

Amazing the pleasure that $20.00 purchase has given me. Love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for boiled eggs, not so great for poached eggs.","review":"We have used the Krups 230-70 Egg Express Cooker primarily to cook soft-boiled eggs, which it does well, although the markings on the included water measuring device are a little hard to read, which makes it harder to cook them to the same level of doneness each time. When we have cooked a single poached egg for each of us in the poaching pan, however, we found that it was too large to do a good job, producing an egg with a very thin white section, although the directions say it's meant to cook a single egg in each cup. We haven't tried putting two eggs in each cup, though, so it may do a better job with those."},{"rating":"1","title":"No automatic shut-off","review":"I had a Sunbeam egg cooker from 1971 until 2008. It shut off automatically when the eggs reached the desired consistency. Sadly, it finally died. This one looked like a good replacement but it only alarms when it is time to turn it off (has to be turned off manually). If I have to stick around and wait for the alarm, I might as well cook them on the stove in a pan! I want to be able to do other things--leave the room, go outside, etc. I returned it and bought another brand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works as advertised.","review":"Works pretty well. Much easier than using the boiling water, faster too. Only complaint is the lack of \\"Cook\\" and \\"Keep Hot\\" labels, instead they have two icons, which I guess we are suppose to memorize. I use it once in a while and always get confused which side to set it to. Why not put labels with the icons? I had to put the labels using a permanent marker to prevent from having to refer to instructions before each use.

Maybe, but this well acted A Budget flick is worth watching and thinking over. The blu ray version is of course the only way to go when watching this movie because it just looks and sounds incredible. The story is well written and believable with a interpol agent trying to bring corrupt banking officials to justice. Certainly; some banks have financed evil wars and warlords in the past, and that rings true as one character says: \\"whoever controls debt wether personal or nationwide controls a nation\\" or something along that line. This is a good conspiracy movie with top notch acting and A movie budget, it has shoot outs and interesting characters and is a excellent flick all around. It's not a 'shoot em up\\" like Clive Owen's last movie by any means though, it's a traditional thriller and it's a good one at that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing final product","review":"This movie just doesn't deliver on its potential. Chemistry and characterizations are lacking. Background of characters is missing to make you care about these people. Naomi Watts, normally one of my favorite actors, was wooden and one-dimensional. The whole storyline was rather commonplace and uninspiring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Half a bag of popcorn","review":"The gunfight in the Guggenheim Museum is the whatever of the movie and it was childish.

As part of the capitalist conspiracy against the great unwashed, banksters are a key part of moving cash from one disreputable organization to another. It's the way the world works. Too bad for us.The International takes a look at one such (fictional) bank, and you get to see just how hard it is to bring justice to such a criminal enterprise. Clive Owen is excellent as a jaded INTERPOL officer who has been trying to bring down this bank.The action is tight and so is the storyline. We find out that the good guys may not be quite so good as we think they should be, while the bad guys are worse than we can imagine. It should tell you something that one of the eventual heroes is a former STASI officer.The film is quite enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull and lifeless, but original","review":"I really wanted to like this film, I really did. However, there's really no saving grace for this film besides Clive Owen's acting, great cinematography, an original plot, and an outstanding shootout sequence. I have never seen a film so devoid of life. There is no humor, barely any action, and the dialogue is overly complex, bland, and lifeless. I wasn't expecting a shoot-em-up thriller like Taken or even the 007 films, but I was expecting a smart yet entertaining thriller. 'The International' does manage to be smart, but TOO smart, to the point where it is just not an enjoyable film. However, if you enjoy a very intelligent political thriller with much of the plot advancing through dialogue, then 'The International' may be your type of movie.On a side note, the picture and audio quality is great. Not the best, but very impressive."},{"rating":"1","title":"International House of Flopcakes","review":"Wanted to like this.Had one highlight - the shootout at the Guggenheim Museum.Inconclusive ending.

Its beautiful. But under the surface of that beauty, is nothing. Clive Owens is Clive Owens. There is nothing new in his performance. Its the same as every other movie he has been in since Bourne Identity. Naomi Woods has a throw away role. The studio could have saved money with a lesser known actress. The dozen or so supporting actors save the movie, making it watchable, but the story isn't engaging. You don't care about the good or bad guys. You just wait for the next pretty location shot. There is a blip of hope in the middle that makes you think this shouldn't have been a box office failure. That feeling of hope doesn't last.

It involves a bank based in Luxembourg buying Chinese arms to sell around the world with the aim of controlling something or other -- I was never quite sure what.Clive Owens is an Interpol agent, Naomi Watts plays an assisant DA from Manhattan. The two have zero chemistry.The bad guys are never really developed so there's no-one to root against, just a vague unseen enemy. The scene shifts from Berlin to Milan to Istanbul -- but there's no sense of place. The biggest scene is a violent shoot-out in the Guggenheim Museum in New York -- I felt more sorry for the damage being done to the building than the bullets thudding into the various characters.This is a very poor effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clive and Naomi fizzle","review":"I wanted to like this movie. It stars two of my favorites Naomi Watts and Clive Owen. It has an interesting concept and it just... misses.

There was only one good action scene - a shoot-out in a musuem. The rest was tedious with confusing dialouge.

It's really bad! I am just glad I only paid $1.99 to rent it from Amazon. There are things that happen in the movie that make you say out loud, \\"This is really stupid\\", because it defies even the believability of movie logic, what the average movie goer is willing to accept when watching a movie. Naomi Watts is awful, she seems to be sleepwalking through all her scenes. The failure of the movie reminded me of the banking industry bailout - it was a big, glossy movie with expensive & luxurious locations, high salaries to the stars and ultimately with no content."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was this?","review":"This was possibly one of the most boring movies that I've ever seen. There were a whole lot of loose ends and no clear bad guys. I'd give a Short Attention Span Summary, but this would be hard to do for two reasons: 1) It was all I could do to stay awake through a first viewing of the movie; 2) It would take a second viewing to try to put together all the convoluted chracters, and I just don't have any masochistic tendencies.What else? The cinematography was pretty decent, and the acting was also believable. But the movie overall just didn't have enough well directed plot to keep anyone interested.Save your money-- even if this movie shows up on the dollar shelf (where it should be a week or two from now)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better Quality & Quick Delivery","review":"Needed a nice gift for my wife and didn't want to pay top $$ at the local stores.

For anyone wanting something a little different, this is a wonderful book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Holmes Film Ever!","review":"This 1939 version of \\"HOUND\\" is, in my opinion, the best film version of a Sherlock Holmes mystery ever done.This is the first of 14 motion pictures teaming the outstanding duo of Basil Rathbone as Holmes and Nigel Bruce as his bumbling cohort, Dr. John H. Watson (although we see a not-so-bumbling Watson in this film).Whoever cast these two fine actors in these roles was a genius! For me, it's hard to accept ANY other individuals (except Basil & Nigel) in the roles of Holmes & Watson. (Although Peter Cushing's Holmes in 1959's \\"Hound\\" remake was very good also.)This version of \\"Hound\\", which was first seen by movie-house patrons on March 31, 1939, exudes the perfect eerie and foggy atmosphere that is ideal for a Sherlock picture. It's a highly re-watchable version of Doyle's classic.The supporting cast of characters is good here as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sherlock Holmes: The Hound of the Baskervilles","review":"This is the excellent beginning to the legendary film series (14 in all) starring Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce as the original dynamic duo of sleuths.Based upon the classic story by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (and well adapted to the silver screen), Rathbone's commanding presence as Holmes is even more impressive by the fact that he only appears occasionally throughout the film. Instead, Nigel Bruce as Watson does most of the detective legwork on screen covering for Holmes' absence from Baskerville Hall until the great sleuth is finally able to join him to hunt down the dreaded monster dog (and its sinister master) awaiting in the moors for its next victim.Lovingly restored by UCLA, this is an impressive film, to say the least! Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best version of the \\"Hound\\" ever made!","review":"Basil Rathbone, epitimizes the essence of Sir C.Doyle's Sherlock Holmes! Being a fan of the colorful sleuth for years, I have seen almost all the Sherlock Holmes movies ever made. To date, no one conveys the total character to me as well as Mr. Rathbone did. The Hound of the Baskervilles is one of my favorite Sherlock tales and I have seen almost every flick made from this delightful titillating tale. Mr. Rathbone's is by far the best rendition. I highly recommend it for the diehard Sherlock Holmes \\"hounds\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Ever","review":"I watched this movie many times and thought it quite the best version of this classic Arthur Conan Doyle mystery. Only much later did I find out that every painting in this movie, including the painting of Sir Hugo Baskerville that figures so prominently in the conclusion, was painted by my grandfather, Hector Serbaroli, who worked for the studio. In those days, the set and artistic directors got credits at the end, but the artists who worked on the sets got no credits. How different it is today, when the credits for every movie include even the outfit that catered the food on the set!Bravo Doyle! Bravo Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce!And Bravo Hector Serbaroli!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Read this and watch Fear and Loathing in Vegas again","review":"By reading this book before watching the movie, you will see what Dr. Gonzo's life was like right before he decides to become a lawyer.

The writting stands alone from his fellow gonzo HST, and is equally refreshing and challenging."},{"rating":"2","title":"wallowing in the trough of excess","review":"Once one gets past the multiple occurences of multi-hued vomit and the daily self-love in the shower... As autobiography, one would do well to read this with some skepticism; Acosta makes himself into an icon of the 60s and 70s, and less a faithful recorder of that time. However, the book can also function as a wonderful novel read in the tradition of pulp novels of the 70s such as Valley of the Dolls. The last chapter shifts from the searching bravado and life on the edge quality into a moving testimony of who Acosta is, and what he is. The book has become one of the important books in the growing recognition of Chicano literature, and Oscar's papers are in a collection open to the public at the University of California. There's a 60 minute videotape of him, 10 of which are Acosta reading from this book. I wonder if his virtual voice is as wild and rich as the voice of the author in print?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A superb book","review":"This book is one of the most memorable I have read in many years.

It is extremely clear for anyone reading the Bible: God doesn't let you in on everything that He is doing in the universe. Groothius' viewpoint isn't only uniformed about NDE's, he lacks ANY firsthand experience with the phenomenon. I'm a born again Christian and yet I don't believe her book verbatim. But it is clear she is a Christian who has Christ as her savior. What makes Groothius believe like he's some incredible expert. The tight, unforgiving, fundamentalist views he clings to just doesn't hold water.As for the person who reviewed the book and thinks NDE's are all some new-age pyscho-babble, the person has absolutely zilch knowledge about the subject. NDE's have been RECORDED throughout history in various ways, not just in our time. Get off the couch and do some research.

I tried using it several times and the bread always came out burnt on the outside and uncooked on the inside. I have a full-size breadmaker and have never had trouble with it, so I read the instructions carefully, bought and tested new yeast, followed their recommendations for each of the two problems, etc. I contacted West Bend and they suggested that I try their bread mixes that are designed just for this product. I ordered some, waited a few weeks for them to be delivered, and tried them. Same problems. At this point, the Amazon warranty was expired. I contacted West Bend again and was told that they could not help me, as their 90-day warranty on it HAD JUST expired.

I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE NICE TO BE ABLE TO HAVE BREAD FRESH EVERYDAY IN A CHOICE OF FLAVORS AND STYLES. I AM A KITCHEN NUT SO I HAVE HAD EXPERIENCE WITH BREAD MACHINES BEFORE, JUST NOT IN THE SMALLER SIZE LOAF. I GAVE IT THREE SHOTS TO IMPRESS ME. THE FIRST ONE WAS LIKE A HOCKEY PUCK, VERY HEAVY AND DENSE. THE SECOND WAS A LITTLE BETTER, I WATCHED AND ADDED A LITTLE WATER BECAUSE THE DOUGH SEEMED TOO DRY, DID NOT HELP. THE THIRD WAS BETTER BUT STILL NOT GREAT. I DECIDED AGAINST THE BREADMAKER. THE WHOLE POINT OF HAVING IT WAS TO BE ABLE TO HAVE FRESH BREAD WITH MEALS WITHOUT HAVING TO BABYSIT THE MACHINE. I HAVE HAD 5 DIFFERENT BREAD MACHINES OVER TIME, I HAVE 2 NOW. THEY WORK MUCH BETTER THAN THIS WITHOUT HAVING TO WATCH THEM CLOSELY.

It's so easy to use and clean up is a dream. Just remember that when you use this it to read the directions and follow them perfectly. You MUST measure your flour just like they say - fluff it up or you'll have too much. My first two loaves were all clumpy because I just put my measuring cup right into the flour bag, then leveled it off. This gives you TOO MUCH flour. Also, you do have to add ingredients in the order they appear on the recipies."},{"rating":"2","title":"YUMMY!","review":"First I have to confess that I didn't realize how small the loaf of bread is that this machine makes. But I'm not going to give a bad review because this was an oversight on my part.This is a FABULOUS little breadmaker. It takes 22 minutes to mix and knead, then 45 minutes to bake, and another 20-30 minutes to cool. If you want something to make bread \\"just for dinner\\" for 2-4 people, this is perfect. It makes one small loaf, perfect for a few people for one meal. If you are looking for a breadmaker that will make one large loaf of bread, this is not it. It is perfect for making a few different kinds of bread if you are having more people over, but be sure to give yourself enough time between loaves for the machine to cool.The bread is TASTY!! Moist on the inside and has a perfect crust outside~ not too thick, not too thin. PERFECT!Great for couples and small families. HIGHLY recomend! :-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Gotta like sweet bread","review":"I bought this a couple of years ago, used it 3 times and it's been sitting on the shelf since then. While I love how fast it is and how it makes nice small loaf, what I don't like is how all the recipes included call for some form of sweetener (sugar, honey, etc.), and it's usually an amount that is noticiable in the final product. For me it's not a health issue so much as a taste issue. I simply prefer savory breads most of the time. Also, even though I used the fast-rise yeast specified, sometimes the granules wouldn't be completely dissolved before it started to cook. I still regret ...what was essentially an impulse buy.There is one good thing about this machine--it got me back into the habit of making my own white bread from scratch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad little breadmaker.","review":"I was disappointed to learn after buying this product that it will not do 100% whole wheat bread.

I am very disappointed in this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best","review":"We have been using the bread machine now for about a year. It is the greatest invention in bread makers. we love it and use it at least once or twice a week. Even my husband uses it and likes trying out different recipies. The ease and quickness of baking is a definite plus for busy people or time crunch needs. It can even be adapted to other larger bread machine recipies by adjusting amounts of the ingredients. That takes more time (and demands careful measuring)and trial and error attemps but it is fun to attampt."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly for Two","review":"I simply love the 3/4 lb. loaf.

Some of the flour is left on both sides (since the mixer is oval) and the remaining bread has 1 teaspoon too much water -- causing the bread top to collapse.Also the bread is too small.

However, all recipes seem to have the same texture...which isn't unpleasant, but not exciting. We use it in our RV with lots of success. It just doesn't make bread like our regular breadmaker that we have at home. It's also very difficult to adapt regular breadmaker recipes to this size...and, if they aren't exactly right, the bread isn't too good. So, it seems that you're limited to using only the recipes in the booklet that accompanies the breadmaker."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Breadmaker","review":"This breadmaker is very simple to use and makes great bread.

I highly recommend this machine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Little Breadmaker","review":"For just 2 people, this will make fresh bread in a minimum amount of time. I had to adjust the recipes slightly to get a better loaf however. First, decrease the sugar to 3/4 Tbl., increase the salt to 1/2 tsp. and use 2 Tbl. of dry milk in any of the recipes that require it. Put in all the ingredients ending with the flour topped by the yeast. After starting the breadmaker, I wait until the first knead is done and unplug the machine, set a timer for 15 minutes - when it goes off, I restart the breadmaker and let it complete the cycles. I find the extra rise makes a difference in the appearance of the bread, it comes out light and tasty!Once you play with the recipes a little, you can get a restaurant quality loaf anytime at home, with a minimum amount of effort!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not many features","review":"I bought this bread machine about two years ago, and I've used about a handful of times. It makes a decent small loaf of bread, but that's about it. It doesn't have a timer or a knead-only cycle. It is difficult to adapt recipes for the normal sized loaves (despite what the instruction book says), so you are pretty much stuck with the recipes that come with the machine. The plus side is that this little machine makes a decent small loaf of bread in a short period of time. If you only want to make fresh bread for dinner, then this machine will meet your needs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great appliance, great bread","review":"The classic white bread was my first loaf. It was perfect. The rye bread was next and I only needed to add just a little more water during the kneading process. The size is perfect for my little family.

Every loaf turns out just fine including the ones where I've substituted ingredients willy-nilly. I've had many other bread makers and they were either too noisy, didn't mix ingredients well, or, usually, turned out loaves that were too big to eat before they turned stale. This turns out a perfect small sized loaf. If you eat it too quickly, it is easy enough to make another. Just remember to let the unit cool down before starting another batch.I do always check when the unit is mixing because when I sub ingredients they sometimes don't mix in as well and I just use my finger (usually clean of course) to shove everything together. It is so easy and convenient that I use it several times a month, unlike other bread machines that I was lucky to use several times a year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Bread Machine","review":"I grew up with homemade rolls/bread every night for dinner, so I was reluctant to try out a bread machine. However, we finally made the plunge and got this little wonder....and it was well worth it! Every time we've made bread (which is often), it has turned out wonderfully....every time. You can't even say that about homemade bread. The recipes included are delicious, and I've even made up a few of my own, which are great. The manual gives you different recipes, as well as a formula for making your own. Definitely worth the purchase!The bread size is perfect for 2-4 people, and you can make multiple loaves in a small amount of time, as it only takes 45 minutes to bake up a loaf of bread. If you have a bigger family, you might want to consider something different, but for a small family this is perfect.A tip - for the honey wheat bread, add in cinnamon roll flavored oatmeal for cinnamon roll bread - it is delicious."},{"rating":"2","title":"does what it's supposed to do","review":"This is a great little product.

For a family of two, I'm able to prepare better quality regular bread than I'd get from the grocery store and without paying high speciality bread prices.

Very simple to use and makes perfect loafs everytime. There is only two settings (1)Basic/Specialty (2)Wheat You can't any easier than that! It makes the perfect size for dinner. We always eat the whole thing. You know as well as i do that bread isn't as good the next day anyways. You just start the bread when you start dinner and its done when dinner is ready (45 minutes).

The problem has always been having to plan ahead by at least 4 hours. I bought this one because of the short time from start to finnish (bread ready in 45 min).I absolutely love this machine. I can decide right before I start making dinner to make bread too, because it is ready to eat in only 45 mintues! Bread comes out great and the small size loaf is perfect for 2-3 people with out the waste of left over bread.One hint would be to add raisins (if you are using them) just before bread starts to rise.

For me, simple is just great.My minor complaints are that the user manual is a bit disorganzed for beginners who need to traverse the booklet for ingredient sizes, flour proofing, basic instructions, etc..The manual should also provide information for more experienced breadmakers like how one can use standard active dry yeast as opposed to the small and expensive rapid rise packets, ingredients that can substitute for others (with measuring amounts!) and the like."},{"rating":"2","title":"The size is perfect and it does its job!","review":"Really cute bread machine, veeery easy to use, just follow the recipe and keep an eye on the moisture of the dough.

I am sad to see that it is not available on Amazon, and possibly will never be. This is a great bread maker for a small family or for having warm bread \\"Just For Dinner\\"! I use mine at least once per day sometimes twice in one day. I have not thrown away any bread since I started using it. This was always a problem for me with other bread makers and with buying bread.

I have nothing to compare it to except supermarket bread, but I have to say this machine does a great job. The loaves are really not that small, and the machine is quick and quiet. Everything I made came out great the first time. My only complaints are that the little packets of fast-rising yeast cost $2.49 for three (!!) in my local supermarket, and all the loaves I've made came out tasting too sweet. But there is also too much sugar in store-bought bread, so if you're used to that, you'll have no problem. Other reviewers have said you can't reduce the sugar without affecting the results.

I purchased this unit on total impulse yet with the thought that it would be a smaller-sized unit -- well, it turned out to be just shorter! However, the cooking time of 45 minutes I found great, and even more to the point, the loaves of bread made from their recipes are great! I am addicted to their feta cheese with black olives bread, but there are a lot of recipes included with the unit and I haven't tried a bad one yet. I would recommend this breadmaker for anyone who would like hot, fresh homemade bread to add to their meals. A real treat. Can you tell I'm a bread lover?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the trouble","review":"This is suppose to be one of the best bread machine within its price range. But after a month of tedious learning and adjusting; it still didn't turn out any good bread. The quality of the bread were substantially inferior to what one could pick up from the local market, and the process to make them was really time consuming. I would say either pay more money to get a higher grade bread machine, or stick to your local bakery instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just for dinner and half the counter","review":"The Just for dinner breadmaker DOES make a small loaf of bread in a short amount of time.

This tea is very close to what I've gotten in Thai restaurants, but the price is outrageous...especially after shipping. I bought these two teas before venturing to my local Asian food market - stupid, I know. But when I got to the market, I found the price on thai mixes to be between $2.50-$4. So it's not even the shipping that makes the price high. It's good, but not enough to warrant paying the extra cost.And if you're looking to make Thai Iced Tea, don't follow the recipe on the label. I found a recipe online that works out very well - 6 cups water, 1 cup sugar (or splenda), 1 cup tea."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great tea, exactly like from a Thai restaurant.","review":"I've read a lot of the reviews here for different people's preparation of this tea.

I recommend this for anyone looking for really good, authentic Thai iced tea."},{"rating":"1","title":"Right flavor, but very very weak.","review":"This tea has the right general flavor for thai iced tea, but we haven't been able to get enough of that flavor out of it.

I'm disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasantly surprised","review":"I've never been a big fan of thai tea, but my husband loves it, so I looked on Amazon for a thai tea I could make myself. I've always found that if I make something myself, it's more enjoyable than when I buy it pre-made, and this tea is no exception. I boiled it as directed and strained it through a coffee filter; the first time I made it I mixed it with sweetened condensed milk, which was very tasty. I then tried it with soy milk and a little honey which I liked even better. Added some boba that I also got on Amazon...Heaven. The only beef I have is that it has food coloring, which I try to avoid in my diet. I expected something more on the lines of whole leaves, but this was pretty powdery, which wasn't a problem, just not what I was visualizing. Overall, I'm glad I purchased it; my husband loves it and I enjoy it a lot, too. No more restaurant thai iced tea for me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY hard-to-find and wonderful tea!","review":"I used to get this tea at Thai restaurants when they first appeared in the U.S., and at Asian groceries as well. Then, for some reason, it became harder and harder to find it. Thai teas just seemed to all be conventional teas. This tea contains a blend of spices, but it is not Chai. I myself like it as hot tea, and I like it without a mess of fattening condensed milk as well.This package will make hundreds of cups of tea, so you should put it in a series of air-tight containers after opening, so it is not exposed to the air and it doesn't go stale."},{"rating":"1","title":"buyer beware","review":"I bought this cat food as per the breeders recommendation with out checking out the history of the food.My sweet kitten started throwing up this food,i checked every aspect of my kittens heath and changed his foodand he was find , no longer vomiting. he had been eating it since he could eat dry food and then,I think something in it buids up in his system and then every day and night about 30 mins after he eats he becomes sick.

The game is hard enough. (Even Alekhine said that \\"Chess will be the master of us all.\\") The graphics are unsympathetic for ease of play. The desert 2D is probably the most viewable. Beware of seeing black pieces on black squares. There is a long, noisy start-up that KIDS will like. And the effects showing blown-up pieces will thrill them. The engine is strong even on the beginner level. If you can find this expensively used-which is likely due to mass-production and overstock-it could interest a young player that does not have a defined interest in chess.

Also omega-3/fish oil supplements might be something to try.As for this one (if you do decide to try it) the pills are not too big but I found them tricky to swallow because they are a bit porous so they stick to tongue/mouth.

Also, the blade dulled very quickly and is difficult to re-sharpen. One of the most disappointing parts of the grinder is of the two plates with different size holes for the meat to be pushed out. They are not stainless steel, rust easily and produces a funky smell. After I wash these plates I need to dry them right away before they start to rust.

Stern and Ron J. Feldman examine the \\"too big to fail\\" doctrine, and show how policymakers made the financial system riskier by implicitly promising to bail out the biggest banking institutions. In the wake of the global financial crisis in which several major institutions failed in 2008, getAbstract welcomes this reissued, lucid assessment of one of the most perplexing, perverse policies in financial regulation, the idea that some institutions are too big to fail. Former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul A. Volcker's foreword helps sharpen the book's focus, and the authors' advocacy for an end to bailouts is quite persuasive. This book is recommended reading for anyone seriously interested in understanding the calculus of financial policymakers, financial system risk, and the tilted playing field that benefits huge, risky banks and their shareholders."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Psychology of the Market Place","review":"This is fundamentally a psychological interpretation of the relevance of the variable Too Big To Fail(TBTF) on the interactions of policymakers and the banking system. Although the authors do not stress their analysis as a psychological approach their analysis as a psychological approach is a compelling example of a Skinnerian analysis of reinforcements contingencies. It provides a compelling analysis about the causes and effects on TBTF. on both the national and international economies. It recommends essentially a carefully controlled use of incentives and to a lessor extent punishment to reduce both the need for and expectations of TBTF. The contrast between the recommendations of Stern & Feldman in 1994 and the present state off fiscal chaos through contiguous extremes of reward and punishment exerted upon the market by policymakers defies the shaping of not only rational behavior but lends credence to the claim of a \\"manic depressive market\\" and why."},{"rating":"1","title":"tough to review","review":"Shaw's latest collection is a tough one to review.

While both men are scholars in their own right, Svenden is hampered by a very narrow 20th century \\"evangelical\\" viewpoint that refuses to take into account the actual history of the Catholic Church from Jesus onwards, and also ignores the extensive writings of the Church Fathers, a vital task that Stephen Ray has carried off magnificently.The Church Fathers consistently point to the unity and authority of the Catholic Church, a fact of history that Svendsen has unfortunately missed completely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Derivative and very disappointing.","review":"This book is a total rehash of information that anyone with a weight problem who has attempted to do anything about it would already know.

It's purely a demonstration. It's an hour of watching this make up artist put make up on three different asian girls. She never talks about why she's using these techniques or skin tones or anything of any value. She never discusses or mentions the differences of make up for asian women vs caucasion women. She says things like, \\"now I'm mixing the foundation\\" & \\"now I'm putting some color on her eyes\\". She mentions in the beginning how important sanitation techniques are and then, to my horror, blows on her brushes and uses lipsticks straight out of the pallette with the same brush.

She even stresses in the beginning that sterilization is very important when working on other people.

The truth is, Thompson is a brilliant cultural critic/mythopoeic sociologist/poet observer but he is not superior to Chomsky if what you desire is a clearheaded and real world analysis of the forces and powers that are shaping our world. Chomsky is coming from the Enlightenment and Humanist traditions and knows exactly where his knowledge ends and continually informs the reader as to why he is saying what he is saying (he makes himself as transparent as possible). Thompson, by contrast, does the exact opposite. He entertainingly composes poetic banners of thought that are dense with aphoristic insight and cutting philo-historic observations. This is the only book of Thompson's that I've thus far read but I would like to read at least one more. He has a cool style and makes many points that intrigue or promote pondering.

They also contain large amounts of history of the countries occupied by Britain. It contains hours of newsreel coverage of his activities with narative which describes things that are not mentioned by book writers.

There is simply no comparison between this version and the 1965 movie, as the old movie is far superior in every aspect: drama, suspense, cast, story telling, and on and on.In the first movie, you had a sense of why things happened the way they did. The acting quality of the actors in the old movie is far superior. Unlike the new movie, it portrayed a great display of the clash between the cast's characters. The conflicts in the new movie gave me the impression of fights between children, kind of working during a picnic. It is laughable, but the new movie portrays the Gobi dessert as a far cleaner place than the Sahara, because the characters in the new movie always appear very clean.If you want to see a really great movie, see the old one, and forget about this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"is it good???? part 2","review":"this movie rocks!!!!!!!!! did u read a review called:IS IT GOOD????well if u hadent, u wont get this review becuase this is the seconed part!!!!the begginig was awsome.i think AMAZON should make FLIGHT OF THE PHOENIX 5 STARS!!!!!agian,this movie rocks!!!!cant wait till it comes out in DVD WIDSCREEN!!!!!!!!!!!!!RATED PG13 FOR MILD VILONCE AND LANGUGE"},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie is a joke!!!","review":"Well, it's a movie so it wants us to believe that with whatever tools they had, they can design, build and sucessfully fly what looked like an airplane...

A group of people are stuck together in a situation where they need to solve the problem of getting UNSTUCK. Some of the best movies ever made adhere to this old formula. And it usually works, hence it being a formula. I haven't seen the original FOTP, but so what? Maybe I'll catch it on some movie classics TV station. If that movie also entertains, then I'll consider myself lucky again.

And there are so many small factual errors that I have to wonder if he's really seen some of the shows he writes about. Was there no one to proof this book? Did no one reading it know that there is no Oscar for \\"best soundtrack\\"? And in addition to factual errors, Singer also fudges the truth from time to time to support his pre-existing conclusions. He doesn't seem to have much respect for the art form, and from what I can tell from his book jacket bio, he's never worked in the musical theatre, so he has virtually no interesting insights into how musicals work.

Beautifully acted film; unfortunately, the ending completely negated any value it had for me. I wish filmmakers would stop wasting our time with more bad movies that pair lesbian women with bisexual women, or characters that sacrifice their true love for societal approval, as this film does. Such a tiresome theme. The ending of this film was not only disappointing, but stale and rediculous. I always feel so sad when I watch women give up their true love, for valuing external approval more than their own. What a high price to pay! If you enjoy movies with positive lesbian characters, on the other hand, I recommend 'I Can't Think Straight.' I found this film fun, funny, and thoroughly enjoyable.JT - Tucson, AZ"},{"rating":"1","title":"item not available","review":"unfortunately, this item was not sent and apparently unavailable, so the seller refunded my account.

He's got some really fresh stuff on here, and I'm actually glad that he released this on his own record label rather than on Shady Records. Since it was released on his own label, I didn't know what to expect, especially production wise. But, I don't think any of the beats fall short, and they all match Proof's rough and tough vocal tone. Proof had something pretty good to offer, I've also heard much of his underground stuff which is also very good as well. Best track is easily Kurt Kobain.

The instrumental sets are some of the best ever recorded, with melody emphasis on Molloy's flute and O'Flynn's piping wonderfully complemented by Irvine, Lunny and Moore on mandolin, bouzouki and guitar.

You have to hold the spout in with your hand to begin the process. To start pouring your hand has to remain in place to keep it from self-sealing. Then you can move your hand out of the way, but it's too late. Gas leaks on your hand as you tip it.I went back to where I purchased it and the saleman said that the same thing happens to him.

What a pleasure to read one that is clear, well-written, and above all, truthful. The authors pull no punches, insisting from the outset that \\"American urban education is a national disgrace.\\" From there, the book is cogently argued, challenging the many shibboleths that distort the school reform debate and refusing to be boxed in by the conventional reform wisdom. See, for example the discussion on \\"hardwiring innovation\\" in Chapter 11. Best of all, the analysis carries the debate about public education in America to the next level, i.e., what we can actually change now to starting making things better. Overall, \\"Legacy\\" is both perceptive and engagingly written. This book, if widely enough read and heeded, can do what most books on education reform only dream about--make a difference."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Ideas -- Disappointing Book","review":"As a firm believer in educational reform, the need for standards, and the virtues of choice, I eagerly awaited this book. Unfortunately, it is a disappointment. While Kearns and Harvey cover the basic ground, their work lacks detail, rigor, and true insight. The book should have covered less and covered it better. The strength of the book is its diagnosis of the current situation.If you're interested in a better education reform book, I would recommend Hirsch's \\"The Schools We Need and Why We Don't Have Them\\" or Harvey's \\"It Takes a City.\\"I'd like to be more positive, but the book is mediocre at best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can you expect much more in this price range?","review":"I prefer a pan tilt like this having a setting for each direction than using something like a ball head.

I have a Nikon D300s and with the 18-200 lens I have no problem making adjustments.

Overall this thing is a cheap, lame design. Bogen should have never replaced the 3030! I have two of them! I needed a second 3030 recently and I was lucky to find an almost mint one used on eBay. My advice to all of you is to find a good used Bogen 3030 instead of wasting your money on this thing. Yes its a little heavier and larger than the 804RC2, but it is well made and it will last!

Some of the thee's and thou's are sometimes hard to get through, especially for those who are new Christians and want easy reading. I have all three volumes that takes you through the Old and New Testaments.

Where his arguments break down are in the solutions. Lester tends to prescribe government intervention to resolve the issues, rather than letting the free market play a role in resolving the issues. My impression is that he believes that both the Europeans and the Japanese have superior systems, and that we should copy what they have been doing, which involves a lot of government money and buraucracy. The book is certainly good reading up to the last few chapters, when the government solutions start to creep in.

Outlaw Star is the first series to buck this tradition, giving the viewer a FULLY developed plot that can be easily summarized!

Coming from someone who had to suffer through purchasing all 8 evangelion dvd's this way was a god send. The animation and sound get a good boost because of the digital quality, but I just love to view it in it's best form. Also I love cartoon network, but they love cutting out seens that in my opinion help develop the characters and story. This series has everything from extreme action to the cutsey romance stuff, and Aisha Clan Clan shown on the cover is all the comedy you need. If all you've seen of this series is the cartoon network version I urge you to check this out. Its also a good anime for amatuer otaku (anime freaks) who just now realize other anime exist beside Dragonball Z and Pokemon.(There cool too of course). Not too bloody and not too kiddie this is an adventure series for all ages"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pass at his Very Finest","review":"If you could own just one Joe Pass album, this would be the one.

Despite the cover, the bears on the *inside* of this book are less stylized and cutesy than the bears in the newer books, and the story is an early reader instead of a longer read-aloud.It's a cute little story about a cub suffering from \\"grass is greener\\" syndrome, but unable to decide which hat to get. Eventually he decides his old one is perfect - you saw that coming!There are only a few words per page, with a basic vocabulary, so this one is perfect little-little ones learning to talk. I do find that many of the words in this book are too uncommon, too long, or follow too odd spelling rules for this book to really function as an early reader. But it's so funny that I don't think that really matters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Old Hat New Hat","review":"The illustrations and vocabulary are limited in this book but it's amazing the funny stories you can tell with two word sentences - we follow the main character into a hat store, he tries out a whole bunch of hats, 'too blue, to spotty, too red, too dotty, too frilly, too silly ...and he finally settles for - well, his old hat.

That was on May 9th, I still have yet to receive them (as of May 29th). My twin boys were born on Friday and came home today (Memorial Day) to a nursery with no way for my wife to breastfeed comfortably.

However, it is not made for comfort! As much time as I'm going to spend in a glider (I have an 8 wk old baby) I expect better quality. My husband and I tried the glider last night and both agreed that its not worth the money. It is now (24 hrs after receiving it) sitting on our front porch waiting to be picked up by UPS.

VERY SATISFIED!","review":"My husband and I tried all of the different gliders at Babies R Us, this one was the prettiest. My husband prefered another larger glider because it was more plush. But it was also close to $500. This was a very economical choice for our nursery and it is very comfortable! I put it together myself in 25 minutes (7 months pregnant). The box was in excellent shape upon arrival (less than 1 week) and the chair was in PERFECT condition. The cherry wood does not scratch easily which was another concern for me. The fabric is very soft as well! I'm very happy with this purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks better than it is","review":"My husband and I excitedly ordered our entire nursery set on Amazon including this chair, the cherry dresser and Madison Cherry Crib. The crib came with a huge scratch on it, the dresser was okay but this chair is a huge disappointment. First of all the cushion is flattening out but not too bad yet but there's a crack in the back. The wood is severely cracked and I can't imagine it will last for another year. It seems much more cheap than what you could find at a furniture store. The wood almost seems porous and light which would make it prone to cracking. If you're overweight, I don't recommend this chair. Luckily he and I are underweight. I am hugely disappointed with many things I purchased here and our roommate has had the same experience. Many damaged items have been shipped to him too from Amazon. I am convinced the \\"happy\\" reviews are from people who work at Amazon or the manufacturers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Awesome!","review":"I received this as a gift, for our last baby, I love gliders, and Was just blown away at how lovely it glides, and soft and comfortable it is.Its PERFECT!

In that time we have had to oil the chair to stop the squeak!

But after just these 4 months of use, the seat cushion is flattened to the base, and it creaks like a rusty hinge in the wind! I can hardly put my baby to sleep in it, and although it looks nice, my lower back aches if I sit in it for too long. This rapid deterioration of condition is very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"squeaking lousy cushions","review":"My husband and I thought that since we weren't \\"cheaping out\\" that this glider would look good and last.

So far, I've described the perfect beach read, but Emerald has far more going on than that.Two examples, and then I'll let you read the other recommendations that yield this novel an astonishing average rating of 4 stars.First, Emerald spends her adolescence in Mexico, where she has her first boyfriend. His name was Nacho.Second, the man she's in love with throughout the story, the star-crossed lover in question is ... her adopted brother??? Ew? This is never addressed properly, in my estimation.

They have fashionable costumes for all occasions: shopping, winter outings, and, of course, Shannon's afternoon wedding! On the last plate is Shannon's beautiful wedding dress.

Finally a problem solved."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete waste of money","review":"Do not waste your money on this latch. I bought one to replace the latch that had broken off my 1984 F-150 after nearly 30 years of use. Tried installing the new latch and one of the screws broke in half while running it down with my Porter Cable cordless drill with the torque set at 2. Had to drill a new hole up to 3/16 to get the old screw out, then after filling the bigger hole with JB Stick, re-drilling and installing another screw everything seemed fine. After reading other reviews about the latch breaking, I knew I had to be very careful. Even then, I started slowly pushing the latch down to lock it, and with very little force the plastic snapped. I'm not going to bother returning an item that only costs $5 as it is not worth the trouble, but wanted to write a review to let other people know that you are better off finding a latch in a junkyard."},{"rating":"1","title":"REAR WINDOW LATCH, OLDER DODGE","review":"Don't buy.

It's undeniably clever (i.e., \\"read more of me, aren't I clever and academic\\"), and skipping forward beyond the point where I stopped, much diligent research is evident. However, for those of us who don't speak the language, it's annoying having to guess what the regional words lavishly interspersed throughout the text represent. The \\"voice\\" is too contrived -- the constant striving for clever effect is what spoiled it for me. I'm so disappointed since I personally enjoy the India of Ruth Prawar Jhabwala and Satjajit Ray, and had been looking so forward to this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book everyone should read !","review":"So few people in the western world know of the terrible times in India at the time of the partition. This very human story depicts the life of a Sikh girl who has so little control over her own fate and the story of a family trying to survive the horrors of racial and civil war."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stylistic Weakness","review":"I think that this novel would have been greatly improved by reduction from 500 - plus pages to 300 or fewer. I appreciate that the author is trying to convey both the political background to the Partition, and the treatment of women in a patriarchal society, as well as telling the story of certain individuals. However, I often found the long-winded narrative tedious,and the references to a multitude of named characters highly confusing. Unlike many other Indian novels I've read, this one did not capture my imagination. Characters were not realized in depth, atmosphere was lacking, and plot was flat. It doesn't begin to compare with Arundhati Roy's \\"The God of Small Things\\", a novel that stayed in my mind for weeks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Real; evoking memories, a Sikh family depicted very well","review":"The lives, aspirations, compromises, hypocracy, nobility of the many people is depicted in a lush manner. The culture, particularly of the Sikhs from the Rawalpindi area, during the pre-1947 partition days is narrated very well. The Sikh woman's point of view, raised in a joint-family, dowry-burdened context of India, very rare to find in English literature, is a treat.My one peeve is that the novel gets lost in itself near the end. The self-pity gets to be a bit suffocating, yet the author, bravely, does not succumb to a pat cliche end.The choice of vernacular lends the honesty to the landscape."},{"rating":"2","title":"A huge story poetically told","review":"\\"What the Body Remembers\\" is the story of how India was broken apart into India, West and East Pakistan to satisfy the demands for sanctuary and autonomy by its different religious factions. This epic story unfolds through the story of Roop, the second wife to an older, wealthy Sikh who has spent his government career under British rule. The warring family represents in microcosm the tumult tearing India apart as she fights to survive and grow into independence from British rule. The struggle of new wife against old is the struggle of women within India, striving for dignity and independence in a system that protects them as property.This is a powerful story told in a stirring and poetic voice. The more you learn and care about its central characters, the better you understand the complex forces tearing India apart. Strongly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Borderline novel","review":"This is a good story but poor in the telling. Ms. Baldwin was trying for a \\"stream of consciousness\\" effect but the end result were too many run-on's (complete sentences within each other) and lack of references (too many places where you don't know to whom or what she is referring). Confusing. Where was her editor?More than that, however, were a lack of definitions (a glossary, perhaps) for the innumerable Indian words and a detailed map of the whole of India. Not least, the author assumes the reader has at least a working knowledge of Indian mythology.Too bad, as the subject deserves a hearing."},{"rating":"2","title":"The making of modern Burma","review":"Very interesting concise history of Konboung Dynesty'd last days.

However, I thinkThe Making of Modern Burmais far more important by a long-shot. This is a more academic work, but it contains several key insights. The most important message is that, unlike many other colonial relationships in Southeast Asia, in 1886 the British essentially destroyed all of Burma's precolonial institutions. Before colonization, Burma had a fairly strong state (at least in the central part of the country). With independence, Burma lacked any institutions or sense of nation to fall back upon - no king or similar rallying point. The book focuses on the 19th century, but this is history that will change the way you look at the country today. It really is about the making of modern Burma."},{"rating":"1","title":"Classic Italian Tales--BIG disappointment","review":"I bought this \\"book\\" based on all the glowing reviews above only to find something that could be best described as a homemade pamphlet arriving in the mail.

The pricing is better than other offers out there and very quick shipping."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great","review":"The whole point of boxer briefs is to offer support and comfort while staying in place. Hanes products only do this for a short period of time before the legs become loose and the boxer briefs turn into regular boxers. I got so tired of this problem that I just bought all boxers because there was no point in wearing boxer briefs anymore. I would recommend boxer briefs made by Old Navy, Under Armour, and Nautica over Hanes.

The support is lacking and the elastic on the legs is already stretched after two weeks.I don't write reviews, but these are such an obvious drop in quality I just had to.I guess if you never had the older ones that truly are comfortable (and still are much better after 3 years) then you may think these are nice...I have to find a new alternative.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ultra comfortable underwear!!","review":"Perfect fit!

The standard style provides a more even fit both at the legs and at the waist area.There is a benefit to this type, which depends on the time of year in which you wear them: they seem to be made of a thicker fabric than the original style, which is nice for insulation in winter months. (Of course, there's a big caveat in this benefit: they're less comfortable in summer months due as a result)"},{"rating":"2","title":"DO NOT WANT TO TAKE OFF!","review":"SOFT, PLESEANT TO TOUCH, NICE COLORS.

He was very understanding and said he would take care of this right away but I never received the replacements and had to write to him again.

These boxer briefs have a very comfortable fabric waistband, they go down far enough on the leg to be modest looking when the pants come off, but not too long to feel in the way.

I actually sold this crap to Funco Land (now Game Stop) for nearly the same price I bought it and even offered more money to take it out of my hands.

Maybe for the most part he's not a nice man; I don't know. I'll tell you one thing after reading this book you won't know either. This author has it in for Hoover from page 1.

I strongly disagree. Hoover had failed drastically to protect his country from the Pearl Harbor disaster. This despite being handed vital intelligence material and information months before the attack. Hoover was much more an acute policeman than an intelligence officer.

I really enjoyed Matlock's daughter and the role played by the actress cast, but this new character steps into the series very well.

It was troubling that the author began by seemingly supporting that she was guilty but by the last 1/3, he really was leaning towards her innocence.

Perhaps I am lacking in symapthy but one minute it seems the author wants to portray Darlie Routier as a mother who killed her two sons, then about half way towards the end makes it like somebody else did it.

That is a very misleading and shady thing to do just to sell a few books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't read it if you think she's guilty","review":"The title is very deceiving--seems a good title to sell the book. The author makes his opinion clear as the trial approaches that he believes in Darlie's innocence. However, her story of what happened is akin to Jeffrey MacDonald's alleged 'hippie attackers'.

Do I think she did it? Absolutely not! She was railroaded by the Texas justice system who thought it was a lot easier to just take her in instead of searching for the real killer/killers. This woman was almost murderered herself, just go to her websight and look at the pictures of her, how can anyone think she did this to herself? The book was well-written in spite of what some of the other reviewers think. James Cron is a dunce.

It's true - they were not experts in taking evidence and investigating a homicide. BUT that does not change the guilt of Darlie! I bought this book to see what Don's take on it was... and I must say: this is the most poorly written book I've ever read! Don obviously is sickeningly one-sided, chooses to leave out things, misspells things... especially irritating was the mistake of the name of the Routier living room. DON - it's the \\"ROMAN\\" room, not the \\"ROAMIN'\\" room! Reading Darlie's statement should have shown you that much!

Basically a silly romance, starting with the tough guy marrying the beautiful blond he hardly knows (only to run off to battle), and culminating with the a menage a trois between the hero, heroine and hero's ex-gay lover. Kate says male-female role reversal was a key part of her first book, and the woman with two men seems a natural extension of that, but the book became too engrossed in this and the need for an interesting plot (as in Jaran) sort of fell by the wayside."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"The book was badly damaged...possibly through the mail system.

I ordered this one to replace it and was very disappointed. Cheap, flimsy light plastic and hollow shell. I can't imagine this lasting more than one good sanding session. Typical of things made these days, including most cars, appliances and tools. 3M used to be a quality-based company. Guess the good people in charge who cared about quality passed away. I would not recommend this to anyone looking for a quality sanding block."},{"rating":"1","title":"3M Sanding Block","review":"As has been pointed out in other reviews, this sanding block has little or nothing to recommend it. It IS made of a light weight plastic, it relies on four small plastic pins to hold the block together in use, and is not in any way contoured to fit the hand.I have found that the block will not stay together unless I tape the joint on both sides of the block (duct tape). It is far too light, too insubstantial to do any serious work with requiring far too much energy and attention to work at all well.Maybe for modelers but I can not see this used anyplace else: I would certainly suggest a different sanding block."},{"rating":"1","title":"this product is the reason that buying things online can be dangerous","review":"This item LOOKS like a regular hard-rubber sanding block.It isn't.Much like a cheap movie set, it is just a flimsy hollow plastic thing in the SHAPE of a sanding block.It breaks into pieces after just minutes of use.Products like this are the reason online shopping can be a bad idea: The product LOOKS like something you want... in a distant photo."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice","review":"Needs too much sandpaper to use. I suppose is best used with adhesive sand paper. It has a nice weight to it though. I've tossed it a few times at Chip&Dale with a nice effect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy","review":"3M 9248NA Sanding Block Kit, 2.75 in x 5.25 inThis sanding block is made of hollow plastic and just feels incredibly cheap. I thought I was buying the heavy rubber one that has been around for years, but instead I received a block of hollow lightweight plastic that I wouldn't trust not to shatter as soon as I put some real heft behind it. I will be tossing this thing in the trash and continue to use an old scrap piece of 2x4. This product is utterly worthless."},{"rating":"2","title":"sanding block","review":"These are excellent sanding blocks and they last a very long time. That is, until your puppy dog decides it's the perfect chew toy."},{"rating":"2","title":"3M Sanding Block,","review":"I bought it because I know I'll need it soon, looks perfect for my needs, I suppose you should get one too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unorganized book offers little that can't be found freely by searching","review":"Bob Bly is a wonderful person and a very good copywriter. But I don't like this book. It seems to go all over the place and yet no place. It really doesn't educate you on writing a white paper. Doesn't get into format or much else.You can find much more by doing a search.I know I'll get a lot of \\"not helpful\\" clicks. But that's okay. I gotta' tell it the way I see it. And, of course, it's only my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"A rehash of other books","review":"After seeing the disparate comments on this book, I will venture my views. I generally like Bob Bly's books and I have quite a few of them on my shelves. But this is not his best. It's basically a rehash of a lot of material he has published elsewhere, with the term \\"white paper\\" in the title, I suppose, to attract sales. If you're looking for an introduction to all sorts of marketing ideas and a rundown on various formats for marketing documents... and you don't already have a lot of Bly's books, this may be useful to you. If you're looking specifically for a guide to how to create an effective white paper, or you already have some other books from Bly, this is not likely to help much at all. There are better books on white papers from Stelzner and Kantor, and on marketing with content from Ardath Albee and others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great guide to writing better edu-marketing pieces","review":"This book makes you think of great questions to ask your client before you write anything - like these:What vocabulary does your audience use - are they techies looking for specs, execs looking for ROI, or buyers looking for the best price and terms?What do you want your audience to do after they finish reading? (Don't laugh - some clients forget the contact info at the end for interested readers - the main point of doing a white paper.)What should the focus be - what problem does your product solve?(This one's not always in the client's mind either - you may need to nudge a little to get to what their customers think is the most valuable part of their solution.)The book's detailed road maps lead writers and marketers to white papers and related pieces that interest and snag prospects. It gave helpful reminders for recent articles I've done for high-tech clients.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"If You're Willing to Waste Your Time, Read This Book!","review":"I found this book to be only marginally helpful in the quest for information about marketing white papers. I was surprised and disappointed given that it has received many good reviews.To begin with, it is long, boring and in severe need of editing. There is significant repetition from chapter to chapter. It feels like the author jammed together previously written articles into a book. I will acknowledge that there are some useful resources provided, but for the most part this is a hodge-podge of marketing tools and ideas that are not particularly insightful.If you need advice on marketing your white paper, I suggest reading Chapter 11 in Michael Stelzner's book, entitled Writing White Papers. It contains more useful information than this whole book."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you market to a sophisticated audience, this book is for you.","review":"Amid all the overly simplistic books on getting new clients, White Paper Marketing stands out for its practical advice. If you market to a sophisticated audience, and the \\"shout-at-you\\" school of promotion leaves you cold, you will find this to be a very valuable resource.Bob Bly discusses, in his very pleasant and easy-to-read style, the various options marketers can use to generate initial curiosity about their products or services. This is an excellent resource that belongs on the bookshelf of anyone who wants to build brand new client relationships."},{"rating":"2","title":"Handy guide to marketing through information","review":"This helpful, how-to manual explains the essential elements of writing white papers and using them to generate business as part of your overall marketing plan. Author Robert W. Bly is a veteran practitioner. He covers every conceivable issue, from appointing a writer to choosing appropriate images and typefaces, to distribution. He has a fluid style and includes check lists that will give you a great framework for any white paper project. We recommend this handy guide to any marketer who is considering an \\"edu-marketing\\" strategy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Epidemiology Text","review":"This book is easy to read and understand. The book gives examples that are interesting as well and make learning epidemiology enjoyable. I would highly recommend this text to anyone studying epidemiology."},{"rating":"2","title":"Marvelous","review":"Rie Fu writes great songs that just flow naturally, with evocative lyrics and interesting music. Her style touches several genres, but I can't put it in a single category -- it's like nothing I've heard, yet quite distinctive in itself. The songs on this album range from mellow to driven, and her seamless mixing of Japanese and (good) English is something that is quite marvelous.I agree with the other reviewers' opinions, so I won't bother repeating them. My favorite song on this album, though, is \\"Tsuki no ue\\" (\\"Over the Moon\\", or \\"Above the Moon\\"). To describe it briefly, it's a song with mellow guitar but a solid beat. The chords are simple, but the melody wanders to interesting places. The first half is in Japanese, and the second half in English; it's not a translation between halves. The Japanese lyrics are somewhat metaphorical, but the English is even more so, which really gets me.This is an import, so it's pricey, but Amazon's price is particularly egregious."},{"rating":"2","title":"Body,Mind and Soul","review":"Having absolutely no knowledge of Tai Chi, one video basically looked like another to me. I decided to take a chance so I purchased it. This is a definite choice for anyone wanting to get started learning the basics. After one viewing of this video I found it not only to be inspirational but absolutely calming. I wish I had found Tai Chi years ago. This video is easy to follow and does not require any skill upfront. The scenery is the perfect background to inspire you. In my opinion this is an all around two-thumbs up for beginners."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great for beginners.","review":"Jason Chan teaches some very simple tai chi movements which are great for beginners, but more experienced players will be disappointed. This is not the Yang short form nor even the simplified 24 movement form. It is Jason's own short sequence of some simple moves and some chi kung movements as well as warm ups and cool downs."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Thank you.","review":"Our Dachsund did not like this at all.

Now if you take dietary suppliments you know that very rarely are the directions to simply take one a day but this product advises you to take 4 pills 3 times daily. That's 12 pills a day. That seems a little much. I mean they could make them bigger or something. Seems like maybe a marketing ploy to make it seem like the bottle will last a long time but NOT SO TRUE. The other major concern is that the pills contain Iron. Iron is a very dangerous vitamin and can easily cause overdose. I do not want to take 12 pills for fiber that also contain Iron."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Thanks","review":"Don't waste you money I would get lots of water and magnesium instead these just constipated me."},{"rating":"1","title":"NEVER RECIEVED!

I tried several other colon cleanses with my quarterly fasting but none of them worked as well. As a mater of fact, some of them didn't work at all. I accidentally got one that didn't have acidophilus and that one really threw my body out of whack. I had stomach problems for a short while after and even got a yeast infection. Note: I have never taken these with food like some people do. It has always been with fasting and when starting back on foods I have to do it slowly. If I do have too much food right away, it tends to cleanse it out right away which toilet-bounds me for a couple of hours. I don't know if those who take it with food have the same problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"works like a charm","review":"yes - I agree with some other reviews that several doses a day are too much (unless you never want to leave the bathroom) but once you adjust and see how your body reacts - you can decide how and when to take it.

Just in the first couple of pages there are numerous odd characters and misprinted words which are annoying.There is nothing wrong with OCR, but you need to edit it before you sell it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Political Book.","review":"This book started of well and was an interesting book on the 2004 Democratic Primary Process. The problem with it is that you can tell that the author lost interest in this book and was all over the mao on his thought and writing. I would not reccomend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"An comfortable look into the 'Invisible Primary'","review":"Shapiro does an excellent job covering a topic that is complex and straught with emotion, but doing so in a way that is neither biased or hard to read. It's been mentioned already that he is a stand-up comedian, and that really shows in his writing. It's engaging and insightful. It gives depth into character traits of the Democratic candidates. And although I'm not a fan of any of them, it made me feel like I could relate to them and understand where they were coming from and what they were struggling with.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very solid but . . . .","review":"The product has a nice weight and feels solid in your hand, but . . . . it doesn't cut the cheese.

While the Chantal feels like a designer product, it simply does not function adequately.

There are some parts that are fine about the author's dog, but there are too many \\"foul language\\" parts, and the author's own opinions about God and Christianity that are not really true.

It does have the information I need for the class."},{"rating":"2","title":"Far from his best","review":"Genius delights in its own genius. Nabokov's verbal brilliance delights in playing games with his characters and their realities. But the greatest Literature touches the heart. And this story has little story and little character and very little to touch the heart. The main character Parsons is one whose heart is fragmented in such a way that we cannot really feel any deep emotion for his fine perceptions. Who cares what happens to him, or what goes on next? One reads only hoping for some spark of the old Nabokean fire which to my mind has burned most brightly in 'Speak Memory' 'Pnin' and 'Ada'. All in all this is very far from his best and however elegant the intricacies of its games it gives off no human warmth whatsoever."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE RIDDLE OF BEING","review":"THERE is little point in attempting a review of these 80 pages of ephemera. A study of one man's inability to fit into his own skin. To put it mildly, a depressing excursion into the one character, Hugh Person's, life. The author says that had Hugh not had his transparent side there would be no point to the book. But I found the transparent side just as infected with this fetish for trivia.However, the author gives some great advice if the reader could sort it out: Don't \\"explain the inexplicable.\\" Live with the \\"supposition that 'reality' may be only a 'dream'.\\" \\"The very awareness of being aware\\" may be just \\"a built-in hallucination.\\" And don't forget this quote: \\"There is no lake without a closed circle of reliable land.\\" This reader is still searching to find these transparent things."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for summer salads","review":"A great penne pasta that substitutes well for traditional wheat penne in hot or cold recipes.

He is allergic to most grains including wheat, but spelt is apparently an exception for some wheat-allergic people.Somehow, I expected it to taste strange, but we all were happily surprised that spelt pasta tastes very much like \\"regular\\" pasta. It makes a great side dish with even a simple marinara sauce. Try it, you'll like it.I sent home all the extra boxes with my grandson when he left, so I didn't have to eat the leftover pasta all by myself for the next 6 months (:D).

This is not easy because of the pleats and points and gathers on these dresses. This book only had three boy patterns, and they were for outfits that would only be good for halloween costumes. The patterns themselves have to be inlarged using the 1in=4in grid which is timeconsuming and troublesome. There were very few accessories, and in total only eleven outfits. It would have made more sense for me to buy a couple of patterns at the store, most come with several different designs for dresses, full size patterns in the size you need, and clear directions. I have bought other similar books over the years, but none as poorly writen as this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"This book is based on the premise that Karl Rove is an evil genius.

He got lucky in 2000 (lets face it the election was Gores to win) then rode off 9/11 to win in 2004. Given Bush's approval ratings in 2002, to assist in the loss of Congress in 2006 points to terrible advice.Cannon may be transfixed with Rove (and it comes across in this book) but you shouldn't be!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Original music gone !

For fans of these old series, it is a no-win situation. If you buy this DVD, you're telling CBS/Paramount that is okay to release a half season of cut episodes minus the original music and charge full price. However, if you don't buy this DVD, you run the risk of CBS/Paramount not releasing further seasons due to poor sales. Probably the best thing to do is write to CBS/Paramount and let them know that you are interested in the DVD but do not appreciate that they are charging full price for a half season's worth of episodes which have been altered from their original format.NOTE: This rating does not reflect the quality of the show which would warrant 5 stars.

This is about a woman from an incrediblely dysfunctional family who also dabbles in witchcraft. People around her die mysteriously, including her mother, who is found in a trash can inside a rented storage shed. It is scary to think people like her and her family could be living and working next to you! The book is fast paced, beginning with the find of the body in the trashcan and following with the usual background family history of the killer.

Scumbag killed scumbag(s). How are we supposed to feel sympathy for that? Puit is a little too redundant in his writing. One gets the point, however, Puit pounds away various points at least three times each; perhaps to fill the book.

The author was a bit too self-important for my taste, and new information became more and more scarce as the book progressed. One of the later chapters isn't even an original work, but is instead a wholesale reproduction of a coroner's report.Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste money on this book","review":"I love true crime books....but this book was terrible. The book is not well written. The author writes in a style that is gossipy and unprofessional - dropping the f word as if he's having a smutty conversation with a buddy. I also didn't really get into the story, and it was pretty boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelieveably boring & irrelevant","review":"I have read hundreds if not thousands or true crime books. I've been to law school and specifically studied female serial killers. This book is badly written. It is organized poorly. However, ultimately it has a catchy title with no backing. It mentions black magic three or four times and really doesn't dwell on how it deals with the deaths. For that matter, I'm not even sure I'd convict her. She may be crazy but it doesn't mean she isn't crazy like a fox and that undercover work like you see in Ann Rule and Aphrodite Jones books just isn't found here. This is a boring book that I prayed would real some nugget of information (but didn't) before it ended and then literally threw it away--it's not worth the passage to others or even the space on my bookshelf. I had assumed that a professional newspaper journalist with the back ground that this writer has would produce a better book, but it didn't happen."},{"rating":"1","title":"poorly written","review":"I was shocked to find out that the author is a journalist/reporter. The subject matter is a very good choice. The writing is bad. The author goes off on unimportant tangents for perhaps 20 pages at a time until you start to lose track of what the main story line is,and he does this abruptly without warning. Has gratuitous sex and profanity. By gratuitous I mean just that,a large amount that is not important to the story and therefore not only ceases to shock but becomes boring. I finally only decided to finish the book because I was unfamiliar with the case and wanted to know what happened. I would have thought the author would have learned his craft before attempting to write a book. Ialso do not understand why it was not edited by the publisher and allowed to go to market this way.Avoid this author. Maybe read something like True Story: Murder, Memoir, Mea Culpa by michael finkel instead to see how a journalist is capable of telling a real story.peter soldan"},{"rating":"2","title":"good true crime","review":"All I read is true crime and this is a good book.I thought the author did a great job of researching the characters for this book and really brought them to life.It is unbelievable how much this women got away with!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good - Despite the Author's Shortcomings","review":"Witch is the unbelievable story of the life and crimes of Brookey Lee West and of her parents, Christine and Leroy Smith. The book opens with the discovery of Christine Smith's mummified body in a Las Vegas storage locker in February 2001. Police quickly begin to suspect that Brookey murdered her mother.Surprisingly, the story gets even weirder from there, as author Glenn Puit delves into decades of gross dysfunction in the Smith family. The story involves witchcraft, drug and alcohol abuse, child abandonment, police corruption, and rampant criminal behavior.Unfortunately, author Puit isn't always up the task of telling this story. For instance, one horrific chapter goes on for almost thirty pages and consists of little more than a verbatim transcription of a statement that West gave to police. However, Puit cannot ruin a story this good.Witch won't change your life, but it's well worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant realist late film noir","review":"Kiss Me Deadly seems light years ahead of the studio made film noirs of just ten years earlier. Seventy-five per-cent of it is shot on location in Los Angeles circa mid fifties. Likewise the performances by Ralph Meeker and company are gritty and disturbingly honest. Meeker is the master of understatement and his Mickey Spillane is by far the quintessential reading of this pulp detective. Meeker inhabits his roles so thoroughly it's hard to pick him out in his various screen performances. The great fun of this cienimatic ride is following Spillane thru seedy L.A. and meeting the underworld characters, B-girls, and working-class joes that populate his world. Hold on to your hats for the surprise ending as Spillane follows the links to the contraband he was hired to find."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whats in the Box\\"?","review":"Robert Aldrich takes us all on a roller coaster ride with murder and sadism as main ingredients. Ralph Meeker plays a very \\"on the edge\\" Mike Hammer in this terrific story about the great \\"Whatsit\\"You know that this is not a mainstream film when you see the opening credits on a reverse roll. Albert Dekker plays the sinister Dr. Soberin with style. When Gaby asks him \\" whats in the box\\" Soberin says \\" The Head of the Medusa\\" She shoots him and then finds out for herself whats in that box!The screenplay is a real corker wriiten by A.I. Bezzerides. There always seemed to be a big controversy about the films running time..106 minutes..To this day I dont know if I have ever seen the complete version. (MGM UA VIDEO)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Taking The Hammer to L.A.","review":"Mike Hammer is transplanted to the left coast in this overrated but entertaining cult classic. Rather than being a two-fisted gumshoe, here Mike does sleazy divorce work and practically pimps out Velda. The picture starts off strong, but sinks into a very convoluted plot. The thrills come from the ahead-of-it's-time violence -- some of the most sadistic of which is handed out by Hammer. The picture also takes the cynisism of 50s noir and extends that to the political climate with it's much vaunted apocalyptic ending. This seems to lay the groundwork for 70s thrillers like Parallax View and Three Days of the Condor with their paranoia and suspicion.Meeker's okay, but the picture might play better if the other women were as good as Cloris Leachman in the opening scenes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Film noir, yes, Mickey Spillane, no","review":"I admit to liking this movie. Spillane hated it and what Aldrich did to the character of Mike Hammer, turning from a violent angel of retribution to simply a violent and not too bright thug. The ending (or endings if you like) have to be the strangest ever for a film noir."},{"rating":"2","title":"Noir Endgame","review":"For all intents and purposes, the era of film noir ended on a symbolic note with director Robert Aldrich's \\"Kiss Me Deadly\\" (1955). Ralph Meeker gave the performance of his career as Mickey Spillane's Mike Hammer in a tough, gritty crime drama - further enhanced by its evocative Los Angeles locations and timely subplot centering on an atomic Pandora's Box. Aldrich rightly believed that the genre would not survive the nuclear age. This low-budget cult classic has grown in stature during the past 20 years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic forgotten film noir","review":"Mickey Spillane was famous for his trash detective novels in the '50s, read by nearly every crime-fiction buff. Director Robert Aldrich turns Spillane's trash into one of thje best - and most shocking - film noirs. Ralph Meeker makes a nasty Mike Hammer, who finds himself drawn into a terror plot by a woman he rescues on the highway lae at night, only to discover himself captured and the woman tortured by the thugs seeking to smuggle fissile material. I don't want to spoil the plot, but Quentin Tarantino fans will recognize he paid this film homage in \`\`Pulp Fiction.'' Don't miss this.

Class A all the way."},{"rating":"1","title":"A++++++++++ Product, F--------- For the Box Art","review":"Criterion puts out another absolutely stellar release. Nothing whatsoever can be said bad in terms of the quality of any of the products they offer.

Because they spoil the ending on the front cover of the box."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!","review":"I cannot believe this movie can be in the Criterion collection, nor be given the Amazon review, nor the other reviews. This is perhaps the most awful movie I have ever seen. The acting is terrible, the story completely outlandish, the cinematography juvenile, the plot utterly, utterly stupid, and the dialogue dreadful. I was forced to give it one star by Amazon. This is western civilization at its nadir."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fast-paced detective movie, Kiss me Deadly","review":"Kiss me Deadly grabs you by the throat and does not let go until the end of the movie. I saw Ralph Meeker in old Hitchcock show and found this jem of a movie. Seeing Cloris Leechman act in such a desperate role is worth the price of admission.Sometimes the movie gets a little violent, but much visual impact is left to the imagination. I am surprised how much I liked the movie. Anyone is fair game to be shot or killed during the hunt for the special \\"prize\\". If you are tired of the animated behemoths like Avatar, you will love Kiss me Deadly. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing film noir","review":"As a huge film noir fan who was aware of this film's importance to various directors I admire, I was very interested in seeing this movie and then extremely disappointed by it. Some of the acting is fine but some of it is atrociously bad. The story is preposterous which would be fine if it were more entertaining. And the film as a whole is a big dud. If you're looking for great noir, check out \\"Double Indemnity\\", \\"Chinatown\\", \\"The Maltese Falcon\\" and others.

The title is a little misleading since most of the book concerns the author's prison time, but the stories are interesting nonetheless. I don't feel like I got an \\"inside look,\\" at the psyche of an armed robber, but rather an autobiography of a life gone wrong and the redemptive power of education. It's also an excellent display of the importance of childhood upbringing.Sometimes books of this nature are somewhat rough around the edges, but this one was very well-written and edited. It is a very enjoyable piece although, as an American, I struggled a little with some of the Cockney references."},{"rating":"1","title":"geisphobia","review":"While Lord Trevallyan's reason for not wanting to have a relationship with Ravenna --- he's resisting fate --- is plausible, it gets a zero for dramatic effect. Trevallyan is also in constant battle with his hangup about their age difference (rightfully so) which just made him seem insecure. In turn, Ravenna hates Trevallyan for sending her off to an English school where she was shunned and ridiculed. Again, plausible, but boring. Ravenna's story within the story I simply found distracting from the real story and not particularly interesting.Having no great obstacle but stubbornness and resentment, the story just dragged on and on. Still, no matter how thin the plot, if told well, any story can be great. Unfortunately, this story just did not catch my imagination.And last but not least --- I know it's essential to the plot, but if I had to read the word \\"geis\\" one more time . . ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gentle Art of Staying Awake While Reading","review":"I really wanted to read this book after reading the great reviews it got.

However, the author wrote this book in a very dry and monotonous tone and could not keep my attention even after a whole cup of espresso straight. I suppose this is a good book, if you have a very good atttention span."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely Worthless","review":"I guess just about *anyone* can get a book published nowadays. The author clearly has no understanding at all of rhetoric outside of her own personal experience of having been insulted-- which I imagine must happen quite often. Essentially the entire book is centered around providing canned responses to eight verbal attacks, and arranging them in an 'octagon'. Why this arrangement is preferable to any other, or what is to be gained by any sort of arrangement, remains unexplained. The one thing I do recommend in this book is the (presumably unintentional) humorous maternalistic tone that seeps through when the author writes about the protection that her fragile women need from strong, angry men... very funny indeed. If you really are looking for a book that will teach you something, rather than give quick and empty entertainment, try \\"Logical Self-Defense\\" by Johnson and Blair. I haven't finished it yet, but they are obviously on a whole different level than Elgin."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Gentle Art of Verbal Self-Defense","review":"This remains the very best book ever written on the subject. I own several copies... all out on loan at the moment! Dr. Elgin explains how to handle verbal attacks (some of which you may not have recognized as attacks although they started an argument and/or made you feel rotten) in ways that put a stop to hostile language with no loss of face on either side. Looking for one-upmanship tips and snappy comebacks? You won't find them here. What you WILL find are eary to understand, step by step instructions that will stop verbal abuse and leave room for real (necessary, useful) communication.I think the first three books (The Gentle Art..., More on..., and The Last Word on...) are the cream of the crop, but any of her books on the subject will give you good information that you can put to use at once."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book on the subject that I've read!","review":"Wonderful! Ms. Elgin treats the subject on verbal self-defense with great care to be neither too technical, nor too simplistic. It is well written and thoroughly engaging. This book introduces the reader first to idea of the verbal attack, then subsequently to the steps and cues required to UNDERSTAND the attack. Once an understanding of what the attacks themselves presuppose has been achieved, then a defense may be mounted.The subject, I believe, is treated fairly, ethically, morally and promotes diffusing a confrontation without unneeded verbal bloodshed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Re-visit what you think you know","review":"Relationship manipulation through words is unmasked.After reading this book, you'll have no excuse for being made to feel bad, or doing things through others' manipulations.An eye opener.

Each essay is not only brilliant, but manages to autopsy several regions that poetry encompasses in a respectful and honest way. Her first essay, \\"Poetry and the Mind of Concentration\\", is a tour de force in and of itself, the rest of the book follows suit.

I just need to still set up the voice dialer on my phone, so I don't have to dial by number, just tell the device to call so and so. Really happy so far, this is the third bluetooth device I've tried and so far the best. I only gave it 4 stars because of the volume."},{"rating":"1","title":"piece of junk","review":"I've gone thru 3 of these already, in the last year or so...I trusted the reviews here and like how comfortable it fits on the ear...but it just doesn't last! after a few months it would automatically lose signal for some darn reason! just yesterday I noticed my iphone can't pick up the signal to this thing anymore, and I just changed a new one like 4 months ago! darn piece of junk...I'm no longer supporting this brand for sure!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Happy with product.","review":"Very clear, easy to use and stays on my ear with comfort.

A few years later, I tried thePlantronics Voyager 510 Bluetooth Headset [Retail Packaging], and it was amazing. For the most part, people can't tell that I'm on a Bluetooth headset!The Pros: Great audio quality! Good battery life.The cons: I only wish it had a better earpiece... on that really goes INTO my ears, like mySony MDR-XB20EX 9mm High Sensitivity Driver Extra Bass EX Earbuds. The volume and mute buttons are kinda small and hard to reach/press.Those are just small details though.

I have been through a few headsets including the Motorola and absolutely love the 510.

Every once in a while I would even tell them to turn the bluetooth off.But I finally decided to get one and the most important feature for me was sound quality. Because if either you or the person you are talking to cant hear each other then whats the point of a headset. I read the reviews for the Plantronic and they are right on target.

So much for that. The call quality was horrible. The audio was all distorted and would constantly break up, and forget about using it outside, picks up all the wind noise and drowns out my conversation.

So now, I'm stuck with a defective (perhaps even used or refurbished) piece of junk. \\"Do a manufacturer's warranty claim\\" you may say to yourself aloud? But for what?

This design has you loop over the ear, decide on ear bud size, select earbud a size smaller so that it can nest in tight and away you go.While it's cumbersome to get in place over your ear (especially with glasses) I love how it's snug allowing me to hear well and stays that way."},{"rating":"2","title":"thoughts","review":"The headset is light, and the interchangeable earpieces provide more options for a better fit in the ear. The 510 does work with a RAZR V3M as a few people have said even though the Plantronics website says that it does not.

This device fits into my ear very comfortably, and the sound quality is very good. I've seen reviews that mention that the power switch on this device is too small. I have very big hands, and don't find the button size to be a problem. I highly recommend this device."},{"rating":"2","title":"More than happy...except","review":"This is the first Bluetooth headset that I have owned. It works wonderfully. I have very good range with my phone (Motorola). In fact, I can go to a different floor in the house or outside before realizing I did not have my phone with me. It has very clear sound quality, and it does reduce the background noise (at least compared to the Scala). It stays connected. It is easy to use and easy to switch from left to right. This headset would be fantastic, EXCEPT for the simple fact that I could not get it to fit. It has nothing to do with the ear pieces, but everything to do with the fit around the back of my ear. The height of the curvature was too tall to fit my ear and cannot be adjusted. Consequently, it caused great frustration with every use because it just would not stay put. I ended up trading with a friend. He now has mine and it works great for him. No problems at all. I now have his (Scala), which does fit, but in my opinion, does not perform as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for trucks too!","review":"the plantronics 510 works well even in big trucks.The noise cancelling works well so you can hear and be heard pretty well.You can easily be 15-20 feet away and still stay connected with clear reception to handset.A good choice in bluetooth headsets."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best if you care about voice quality","review":"Owned it for close to a year and it has been exceeding my expectations every time. Loud and clear in most all situations. I work near some loud laser machines and still manage to hear people really well.Its a bit bulky and hard to stow away. The choice of ear plugs were nice as I got one of them to \\"glove-fit\\". On-off button is a pain to get to but I dont see why too many people would mess around with it all the time. All electronics need getting used to and this one is no different. Volume control is not too bad and high volume setting is really \\"HIGH\\".Muffles the ambient pretty well and havent once got a comment that there is background/static/wind noise.For its price and performance, and you are the person who is a power bluetooth user with voice quality as the numero uno requirement, you cannot beat this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Yet","review":"I've had several bluetooth headsets with my cell phones. The quality of the Voyager 510 is by far the best so far and the noise cancelling and volume quality is great also.

Two others quit functioning after a few weeks or kept loosing their bluetooth connectivity.I have had this headset now for 3 months and it works great with my Samsung D807, including the voice dialing and the answer from headset functions.It would be nice if it came with a car charger, but at least always keeps its charge for the day."},{"rating":"1","title":"cool design...that's about it","review":"I like the Voyager's modern design and the ear piece that sits inside the ear, however the ear hook is too large to fit over my ear without messing up how my glasses or sunglasses, which I need when driving, sit on my face. It also randomly disconnects from my phone - in fact, just today I was trying to call someone and it randomly disconnected, connected, and disconnected so quickly that I couldn't even hang up my call! (It stopped freaking out finally once the other person on the line hung up their phone after hearing no one respond to their greeting.) Furthermore, whenever I'm talking to someone with it, they get a lot of static on their end - which the company claims isn't supposed to happen. I've already replaced this bluetooth headset once and I have no desire to pay more shipping to replace it again. I do not recommend this item at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not load enough!","review":"The only good thing about this set was that it's comfortable to wear and that's it.

Ugh!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"First bluetooth headset","review":"After a lot of research, I decided to go with the Plantronics 510 as my first bluetooth headset. Overall so far, it works very well in a quiet place. The problem I have had is when I'm in the car with the A/C going strong and the listener can't hear me because they think it's static. At those times I've had to turn the A/C off and sweat just to continue using it. Other than that, it took a little while for it to first get paired with my phone (Pantech Duo) but after that it pairs up quickly. I like the look of other products without the boom mike but I went for what was supposedly good quality and reliability instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't live up the hype","review":"Buttons were very hard to push and hard to navigate around when driving.

The sound quality was ok if i was very close (5 ft.) to the bluetooth host. Most people i spoke to said that they could hear me but i sounded like i was under water. I also found the sound of other peoples voices to be muffled and significantly worse than the speaker in my Moto Razr.But the quality dropped fairly quickly.... around 10 ft. the signal degraded and at 15ft it was unusable.I have better freedom of movement with the desktop microphone i currently use.If you are using this so that you can use your mobile phone handsfree, you might be ok with it.But if you want to use it for skype, you are better off with a wired microphone sitting on your desk like this one:Logitech Desktop Microphone (980240-0403)(note that you need to use that microphone with a powered microphone port or else it will be too quite)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, but a bit big","review":"Excellent quality audio, very good noise cancellation, very good battery life, and it fits securely (the plus side to its large size).

When I contacted Plantronics support (\\"We Pride Ourselves On Delivering Industry Leading Customer Support\\"), I was told that they support their devices, not operating systems. Hmmmm, now if the device requires an operating system to work...let's just say, as someone in the IT and telephony industries, that is definitely not industry leading support. I'll be purchasing another brand of products and sending my customers to other brands as well. Good luck to you if you buy Plantronics!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Comfortable, great sound quality","review":"I have at least three other bluetooth headsets and, because my hearing isn't that great anyway, I have trouble with reception with all of them. But with the Voyager 510, I'm actually able to turn the volume down. The snug fit of the earpiece combined with the high quality of the receiving unit seems to have solved my problem. I use it mainly when I drive, but I'm often surprised to realize I still have it on long after it was needed.I don't like the bulkiness when carrying it. I've been putting it in a little zip-lock baggie before putting it in my pocket. I could have bought the carrying case that comes with it, but that looked like it would add even more bulk. It might work for woman with a big purse, but I don't want more stuff hanging from my belt."},{"rating":"1","title":"eh...love to find a decent bluetooth headset","review":"This product has a great ear piece. It is comfortable and the sound quality out is great. The microphone on the other had is horrible. I've tried two of these and both are bad.For once I'd like to find a decent bluetooth.

Does not work at all with my Mac even though it had no problem connecting to it. The range is very limited, maybe a foot. Your head seems to interfere with the reception, for if you move the phone to the other side of your body, the reception gets worse. Basically, it's just not worth the money. You're better off buying a good $20.00 plantronics wired earpiece. Would never buy this again. Ever.

However I would not hesitate to purchase this headset again because it has a very good sound quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great!","review":"After comparing reviews on ear pieces, I narrowed my selections down to the Jabra BT250 and the Plantronics 510. Since the BT250 reviews were not consistant, and there were possible issues with the Treo 650, I went with Plantronics. It turned out to be one of the few purchases I was very happy with. Pairing it was simple, as was adjusting it to either ear. It hangs on the ear firmly, but is so comfortable, you can forget you're wearing it. The sound quality is excellent, on both my side, and the person I'm talking with.I have only one issue with it. The activation for incoming and outgoing calls should be faster. There's a noticable delay of one or two seconds, which may cause you to miss the first couple words of a conversation. Part of the problem may be the phone (Treo 650), but other than that, I'm very pleased with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply the Best","review":"With the introduction of the Voyager 510, Plantronics has taken their headset expertise from the wired world to the unwired world of Bluetooth. This is by far the best Bluetooth headset I've ever used. It's sound is so clear and loud, I almost can't turn my phone down far enough. The sound quality on the recieving end is crytal clear. And, with the ear piece inserting into the ear in addition to the noise cancelling microphone, the noisest environments are a non-issue. Combine all these features with the low price and it becomes the best Bluetooth headset on the market."},{"rating":"2","title":"voyager 510","review":"This is the first Bluetooth device I have owned and I didn't know what to expect. But, it is easy to use, comfortable to wear and has been a pleasant experience so far. Went to a Devil Rays game today and called my son on it during the game. It was very noisy but the voice dial worked perfectly and we could hear each other very well. Also made several calls in a mall and they went smooth. Yesterday I left the phone in the car in my garage by mistake. Got a call and answered it. The phone was in the car, went through 3 walls and was easily 25 ft away from where I was with the headset--went perfectly.All +++, no negatives."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Bluetooth Headset","review":"I'm using this headset with a Nokia 6600 and it works great.

It's slightly difficult to depress with the headset right in front of you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Satisfied","review":"I've never reviewed anything before, but at the prompting of an email from amazon I will throw in my 2 cents. I love this little plantronics 510 headset. It's my first bluetooth headset, but I have tried countless wired products over the years with nothing good to say about any of them. This thing comes with 3 different sized ear pieces that, I assume, should fit most ears, one fit mine perfectly. I was worried about the durability factor, as I refuse to just wear one of these things at all times, like so many people I see everywhere. I wanted to put mine in my pocket or in my shirt collar when not in use and so far, after a month of use, it has been stellar. More soft and flexible than I thought possible. As a sidenote, the thing sounds fantastic. I'm hooked on this thing now, just try and take it away from me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Voyager 510 Bluetooth - Great item!!!","review":"The Voyager 510 Bluetooth is a great item. It's comfortable, practical and works great. It has noise reduction which allows people to hear your voice and not the surrounding noise.

After a while, you can't even tell you have it on. A Great buy and I'm very pleased."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as expected","review":"I bought the 510 based on the volume of positive reviews.

Battery life according to standards. I though I would be able to use it directly with my laptop but I didn't realize that in order to do so I would need to buy a 100$ adaptor. The same holds true for a regualr telephone. Sound quality is great. I can hear people loud and clear and so can they. I compared with a Jawbone unit and my unit seeemed to be louder. The noise cancelling doesn't work that great. If I have the AC on or wind in the car people can't hear me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Bluetooth headset","review":"Wonderful bluetooth headset. Great sound and minimal background noise for those on the other end of the phone.

I can hear and be heard well enough, but there is an annoying tendency for the connection to drop for no apparent reason between the device and my phone (an AT&T Sony Ericsson W350a). Additionally, the only button on it that still works is the connect/disconnect button on the side of the boom. The others on the back of the device are broken, even though I've hardly touched them. I would not buy another one of these devices."},{"rating":"1","title":"muffled","review":"I read all these reviews for this earpiece and had great hopes for it. the LG I tried a couple of years ago had really poor sound quality and was very uncomfortable, so I've stayed away from bluetooth headsets.

The second replacement (ordered from here)- no one could hear me - the sound was muffled, choppy - almost as if the noise cancellation was hyper-active. I read a review on here that Plantronics had permitted some lemons to get loose on the market. So shame on me.. I ordered a third one, thinking that the odds of my getting another lemon would be fairly astronomical.Well.... I'm not going for the \\"some lemons\\" theory now. Plantronics had an excellent product and they have mucked it up. I'm beginning to think it is a case of planned obsolescence. I have a friend who still has their original - still works great and has no reason to replace it. Plantronics will make money from this model as long as the Amazon ratings stay high..even though the ones they are manufacturing now are junk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great quality","review":"I had a $5 Samsung one previously and my friend kept complaining that he can not hear clearly.

It's comfortable and easy to put on. I only wish the on/off button was a little bigger. My previous Plantronics headset was flimsy (sorry, I don't remember the model number): the ear piece snapped off in the middle after maybe a year of use. This one seems to be more substantially constructed, and the speaker has clearer sound and is easier to hear while driving. For the price, it seems like a good choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh...","review":"I lost my old headset (different model) so I started looking for a new one. I purchased this headset because I read good reviews on it, and it's highly rated by Consumer Reports. I find it to be uncomfortably large. I need to use both hands to put it on or else it falls off. The sound quality is fine as long as it's no more than two feet away from my phone. So if I'm wearing my phone on my hip (like I usually do) both ends of the call are static-ey and tends to break up. It works fine when I'm driving due to where I place my phone. I would not purchase this one again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get the older version","review":"Earpiece has multiple places that it breaks/comes apart.

It is very comfortable. I leave it in my ear while driving and working in the garage. It is very stable. Sound quality is excellent. If I were to lose this one, I would buy another without hesitation.The only negative is that you don't know how much battery life you have left. The device will give you an audio intermitant beep and a flashing red indicator light when the battery needs recharging. This works fine, but I would rather have an indicator that I can view at any time verses waiting for the device to tell me when it is low. Not sure anyone offers that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good while it lasted","review":"I purchased the Platronics 510 after I lost a Jabra Bluetooth unit earlier this year. After charging it up it worked well for about a week and then it failed to hold a charge for any length of time, if at all. I was also disappointed with the earpiece. The Jabra was almost twice the price but it worked very well, had great distance and multiple soft rubber earpieces. When I tried to exchange the Platronics for a new unit their customer service claimed they had not yet released the model and implied that I had obtained it \\"inappropriately\\". After 30 minutes and a discussion with her supervisor it was determined that it had been released and Amazon was indeed a legitimate source. They had a rather complicated return process so I gave up on Plantronics and returned the earpiece to Amazon for a refund."},{"rating":"2","title":"Only one I've used but very happy with","review":"This was recommended to me by a friend as the only one of several he had tried that worked well, so I bought it and am pleased with it.

I can hear callers just fine, but often they can't hear me very well and they tell me it sounds muffled. I use my phone for business all the time, and stopped using it except for personal calls on long trips. I'm not sure whether it's a Plantronics problem, or Motorola, but I am dissappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lasted exactly an year","review":"I bought this last July right here on Amazon. I was very pleased with the headset from the outset. It had a great fit and did not hurt my ear lobes from constantly wearing them. I used to have a motorola headset before this one and I would have to constantly take it out once in a while because of the poor fit around my ears. The voyager 510 also is very good when having a conversation when driving or even in moderately windy conditions (outside).What has stopped me from giving 5 stars is the plastic housing has started to come off after just about a year of usage (this is the part that is curved and goes onto the back of your ear). I have not abused it and only used it when I am driving and while at work and need to take a personal call. Other than this it has been working great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comfortable and Secure!","review":"This is my third Voyager 510! (The dog munched on the first one, lost the second) I really love the way this thing is designed; probably the best available. The controls are easily accessed It feels totally secure, and .

The volume button also broke, and the rubber started peeling away. It's too bad, because I'd really like this headset if it would continue to work. I would not recommend this headset."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fine, when there's no static.","review":"I am very disappointed with this product. I bought it to use with my Treo 650.

I don't have a problem hearing one or them hearing me. While it's bulky, it's not heavy at all.

The charger works fine, the ear piece looks good, and the price was terrific, too, only about 40% off the original with free shipping. I really can't imagine there being a better product.

Overall, I would highly recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the price","review":"First off, I must say that this is the only bluetooth earpiece i've ever used. So, I don't have much to compare it to. However, reviewing it independently, it is a great headset for the price. As long as you aren't in a noisy environment, you can hear clearly. And, the headset itself seems to pick up voice clearly. It will also pick up other little noises clearly... so be careful where you use it. lol It seems to filter out noises like wind well."},{"rating":"1","title":"MUCH BIGGER THAN IT NEEDS TO BE!!!!","review":"This is possibly the best headset ever made from an audio standpoint.

This model has been out long enough and only needs to be tweeked a little and shrunk slightly and everyone should buy it!!Your other, much smaller models don't compare in sound quality.So how about the best of both worlds for those of us that have been spoiled by the 510 but can't quite stand the bulk, and it being flipped off our ear by the bottom of the BTE hitting our jacket collar??!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great product not so great customer service","review":"It comes down to how they handle returns...It is poor navigation and not user friendly.

I tried it with both my iPhone and my computer for VoIP. The mic pics up too much area noise on the street if you're a public transit green like me, and at home with no other noise it was pure static with the Bluetooth computer 2 feet away. I'm really disappointed. I'm a tech geek, and usually can figure out how to fix and configure electronics, but this one seemed like a terrible option. Guess I'll buy a more expensive one and see how that works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Expectations Met","review":"I spent quite a bit to time researching bluetooth devices and technology and the Voyager 510 consistently came up as the best buy - not only for your money, but as the best product on the market. The 510 has the best overall package when it comes to Bluetooth when you consider noise cancellation, ease of use, features and functionality, comfort and of course voice clarity & reception. It does take a little extra time to connect to my phone when I receive a call, but that minor inconvenience is worth dealing with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value, most comfortable headset","review":"This headset proved to be a very pleasant surprised after tryinga bunch of others. Was definitely the most comfortable, hadgreat sound and actually fits in your ear. Variable ear piecesare a great touch and this unit should fit larger ears better.Sound quality was very good. Only downside is slightly hardto manipulate buttons. But this is minor.If you've tried a bunch and can't get a good fit, try this one,it'll probably work - did for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good","review":"Reception is good, it was easy to set up. Only issue was the manual wasn't clear on the set up and I had to go to their web site to get clear instructions. There was a special keystroke to put it in to pairing mode that I did not find in the manual."},{"rating":"1","title":"doesn't work well with the Jabra BT adapter","review":"I have a Sanyo 8200 cell phone using this headset with the Jabra BT adapter.However, like the other reviewer using the Jabra Bluetooth adapter, I had major problems with the transmitted voice. The adapter and headset connected fine and lasted a long time battery-wise, and on my end, the sound quality was excellent.BUT, the transmitted voice quality was very poor. My friends reported that they were only getting portions of the conversation with a lot of background noise and echoes. Therefore, this headset is useless.I am very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Loser!","review":"I bought this head set after all of the great reviews I read but I've had nothing but problems. The unit doesn't hold a charge through one average length phone call. I found it difficult to keep the unit in my ear while talking. The Ear piece is so bulky that I could not wear glasses or sunglasses while using it. I have wasted my money on this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great out of the box","review":"Using the device with an LG8600 cell phone.

You bet ya!","review":"Suprising good quality. Usable even in my convertible on the freeway. It's just what I was looking for."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice headset","review":"This Bluetooth headset is comfortable, has easy to use controls, and sounds great. I bought one prior to this that was twice as expensive and I don't wear it anymore. My only complaint would be the little blue flashing LED on the side. During the day it's not a problem, but in the dark it's kinda distracting because it is super bright and flashes a lot during calls. So if you are next to anything that reflects the LED, you definitely see it. I finally put a small piece of black electrical tape over it to keep from annoying people.But really, that is a small complaint. This is a nice headset."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent Headset Overall","review":"I bought this headset because the USB port on my phone broke and I was used to using a wired earbud. I read the reviews and it sounded like this was going to be as good as the wired connection. Well, it's not. However, I have tried several other bluetooth headsets, and this one is better than any of the others I tried.As for the wind cancelling technology... that is deceptive. For ME, when the wind blows, I do not hear it in the headset. Yet whoever I am talking to can apparently hear it like they would on any other headset. I'm not sure how this works really, but it seems that this actually causes me more problems in windy conditions, as I don't realize that the wind noise is bad, but the person on the other end can't hear me. Still, this is a minor complaint. Talk time on the headset is great, and quality is very good as well. If there is a better headset out there, I haven't found it yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"#1 It Works - #2 It is Comfortable","review":"You can tell by the other reviews that this headset works and pairs easily with most phones. It is a great device that has restored my faith in bluetooth technology.The other piece you should know is that this headset is extremely comfortable. It is not the best looking, but the design distributes the weight evenly across your entire ear, not just the top. It looks bulky and heavy, but the unit is very light. Other headsets I have tried don't stay on, flop around, or are just in general uncomfortable. This one isn't - I put it on in the morning and pretty much forget that it is there the rest of the day.OK - the one flaw with this headset is the power button. Thankfully, you really only need to deal with it two times each day. The problem isn't necessarily that it is small - which it is - but it has a hard point on it and the button is difficult to press down.I highly recommend this headset. Enjoy"},{"rating":"2","title":"a satisfied consumer","review":"the product is very easy to use. it is well designed and comfortable to wear. the sound quality is good and very clear. the only negative is adusting the volume button."},{"rating":"2","title":"Plantronics Voyager 510","review":"The sound quality is great. I did not have a problem connecting to my phone. I recieve pretty good range with the bluetooth as well. I love having this wireless device, especially with little cell phone signal where i live. I found one place in my basement where I get signal, and the wireless lets me put my phone there and walk around freely.My biggest problems with this device though. The side button which should be used to answer calls, or activate the voice dial does not work with my phone. It sometimes disconnects from my phone also.I have a motorola Razr V3i, and that is most likely the cause of my problems. There were some disclaimers with motorola devices inside the package, but I still tried the device anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good Device","review":"It's a pretty good device.

I bit the bullet and bought it, and I was surprised of the clarity of the headset. I've had no complaints of people saying they can't hear me, inside or out (make sure it's not TOO windy out, of course you'd hear that). All in all it's a good head set at a decent price. Plantronics makes probably some of the best head sets so it's a smart buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Audio - Poor Peering Reliability","review":"I've had this headset for over two years now. The audio quality is quite good, but it's ability to reliably peer with my Treo 700w is poor. I don't believe this is a problem with the Treo as I've had a cheap Cardo headset that peers every time (but with poor audio). I often make calls while driving, have Bluetooth on, and end up having to put my phone up to my ear while the Plantronics is in the other ear. I have to imagine that there are more reliable headsets that provide good audio quality on the market. I just haven't found one yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good While It Lasted","review":"I purchased my voyager 510 based on the exceptional reviews on Amazon. It worked well the first week, but after the second charge it started making a popping noise and cutting in and out during calls. People I spoke with using the headset told me that it sounded as though I was in a wind tunnel.Likes:- Comfortable and light.- In ear design which makes calls in noisy places possible.- Long battery life.Dislikes:- Bulky and difficult to carry if you are not wearing it.- Tiny power button. I wish it was easy to turn on and off like the Motorola HS850.- Poor quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty easy to use and good quality.","review":"I bought this due to the law changing to hands free in my state. I am not a big fan of bluetooth but I saw the writing on the wall so I read the reviews and picked this one. I am glad I did! This was very very simple to set up and charged very quickly. It synced easily with my android phone. I like that it comes with various sizes ear buds so you can get the right fit. It stays securely on my ear and I never feel like it is flapping or going to fall off. When I make calls, the person I am calling says I sound like I am talking directly on the handset so I am pleased. I have not tried any of the voice command features yet so I cannot comment on those. Overall, I am pleased and would definitely recommend this headset!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Noise cancellation actually amplified background noise. Returned for refund.","review":"When my husband tried to talk to me from within Wal Mart, the background noises (cart rolling, humming motor and fan from refrigerated flower case, and overhead PA system announcements) were actually amplified and hurt my ears. This made a conversation too unpleasant to continue.After opening and trying one ear piece, when he attempted to try the fit of another one, the first one wouldn't come out! He said that in spite of space afforded by the large design, the buttons were quite tiny. The power button was hard to press, and the volume rocker was hard to \\"find\\" and not easily pressed.For him it did not live up to the very positive review from so many (PC mag, Cnet, etc.)Will try the BlueAnt Z9i."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked great for a month","review":"The first month that I had this product I could not have been happier.

In addition, the indicator light on the headset stopped working, even when I turned it on and off and recharged it. Therefore, I concluded that the transmission on this device is terrible. Also, it doesn't fit well on my ear because of its big pack."},{"rating":"1","title":"Once again, I'm disappointed...","review":"Received this product today.

When I ordered the Voyager 510 from Amazon (shown as 'Retail Packaged', not 'Bulk Packaged' like the HS850) I thought I would be receiving a brand new unit. Nope. It was 'Retail Packaged' and looked new until closer inspection revealed that the inside of the Microphone boom was worn. After charging for the recommended 3 hours the headset would switch on and last for about a minute before the low battery light came on and it would switch off. This one is going straight back to Amazon.

During that time, people complain that they can't hear me and ask me to speak up. At the same time, if there is any noise at all around me, it drowns out the incoming audio. From time to time, it randomly disconnects from my Razor V3 for no apparent reason and then will reconnect a few minutes later. If I happen to walk out of the room, out of the headset's range, it will disconnect and to reconnect I have to either turn the headset off and back on or go into the phone's connection menu and repair the phone and the headset.

Yes its bigger than the MotoWHo headset, but you will enjoy the fact that you can actually lie down on the sofa,bed,floor, on your back, and not have to feel the stupid headset lifting of your ear because its over your ear(motowho).

It's comfortable to the point I forget I have it on and small enough my hair hides it most of the time.UPDATED: When it's good, it's very god and when it's bad, it's horrid.

Simple list of important features right? Then why is it so hard to find a decent BT earpiece?! Anyhow- after a year the battery wouldn't hold a charge on the first on I got. The second one lasted about 3 months and then everybody said I sounded \\"really far away\\". Trying a Motorola H695 now.

I have tried several other bluetooth products for my phone (not going to say who's, but there name begins with an M and ends in an Otorola...), and none of them did the trick. This is by far the most comfortable of any model I've tried. I know that seems odd, considdering the size, but it's true! The headset is extremely lightweight. I sometimes forget I'm even wearing it until I get a call. The soft rubber Plantronics uses for the over-the-ear part of the unit actually makes wearing a bluetooth headset and glasses comfortable! Sound quality is great. I am able to use my voicedial features and have crystal clear conversations even in noisy and windy conditions!

I also get few complaints about ambient noise, difficulty hearing me, etc.I resisted buying one for years, partly because I hated those dorks who walk around the airport and talk to themselves with the right side of their head lit up like a Christmas Tree.

I would not reccomend this device to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"good product, excellent battery life","review":"So far I've found the battery life to be excellent. It's pretty comfortable to wear because it comes with different size ear pads. Most people I talk to can't tell I'm on a headset - even outside. Range is good for about 20 feet - beyond that, the sound gets choppy. The on/off/mute switch is tricky - you can't feel any click - you have to watch the LED. Volume is fine, sound is clear. Just make sure push the ear pad a little into your ear canal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Headset Rating","review":"The headset was okay perhaps, but I did experience echoing as I was told by people that I would call. Also, there is a slight delay in hearing if you don't use the headset for a short time.

I found it not too comfortable as it didn't fit my ear very well and the volume buttons were small and hard to use.

My previous headset cost more, would not work in the slightest breeze, and it also fell apart after 2 months. The Plantronics is obviously superior to many bluetooths costing twice as much. The stiff on/off button is not a problem once you get used to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"overall good buy","review":"I love this product, it fits so easily in the ear and is barely noticable, would reccomend this to anyone.

The connect for the power cable broke and that was the end of the headsets. I tried, in vain, to contact Plantronics, to report the problem but never recieved a reply. Overall when the headsets worked they were great, but the weak connection doomed them and I would be cautious in purchasing one of these headsets until they are redesigned to make the power connection more durable.Buyer Beware."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good value","review":"UPDATE 8/6/09: Experiencing some interchangeability issues when re-pairing after use; sometimes it takes several minutes to find the other phone. Otherwise, still very good.Have been using the Voyager 510 with both an iPhone (personal) and Motorola Razor (work) for about a week. The headset fits comfortably and snug around the ear. The mic can also be adjusted slightly. I've tested in different conditions with consistently strong results. Both incoming and outgoing sound quality seem very good. Battery life and ambient noise cancellation could be better, but for less than $40 USD, this is a very good buy for most users."},{"rating":"2","title":"I can hear you!","review":"Before the purchase, I called the customer support of Plantronics to find the highest volume (loudest) model, and they said \\"Voyager 510, by far\\". I am very glad that I finally got one that works in city noise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well, it works","review":"There are much better bluetooth headsets out there, though this one is pretty cheap - in price and quality. The most annoying thing for me was that bright blue led light. This headset is big and bulky, didn't fit my ear well, and was uncomfortable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good for more than one year!","review":"I found this one after trying jabra and motorola. I found it very good in terms of quality and battery life. But things do not look the same way after a year. I don't think this product lasts more than a year!! Other parties are always complaining that they couldn't hear me.I have to shout if I am on this headset.This wasn't the case initially. I wouldn't recommend this to anybody."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fast Start Fast End","review":"The Plantronics Voyager 510 Bluetooth was easy to load and comfortable to wear.

I've gone back and forth with service via email. They claim it's not their unit and to try it on another phone. I tried it on another model of LG with the same results. After a long time of back and forth emails, they SAY they are sending another unit. We shall see. I wouldn't recommend buying Plantronics at all!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesnt work as good as other plantronic ones Ive owned","review":"Goes in and out even if phone is right next to you. When it is working its very clear and sounds great, however it wont keep connected to the phone. You can have phone right next to you and it will jump from phone to bluetooth constantly. Maybe I just have a bad one ..so dont base your decision on one review. I have had several ones from this brand and they have been GREAT! When this one does work its sounds great so maybe just a defect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent accessory for cell phones","review":"This headset has continued to disprove many common complaints about Bluetooth technology and headsets in general. Sound quality is continually very good, and most people do not even realize I am speaking through a headset, even while driving with the window open. Comfort is adjustable; there are different sized ear buds and even though the back of the clip is a bit large, it has the advantage of being easy to handle while on the ear, so volume can be adjusted without fumbling around. Connectivity is excellent.I marked four stars instead of five only because on my small ear the back is a bit large. Otherwise, it's better than I expected."},{"rating":"1","title":"irritating","review":"This works but the geniuses at Plantronics put a flashing blue light alongside your laptop, so plan on ducttaping it, unless you like this thoughtless distraction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Headset","review":"I tried a Motorola headset, but I couldn't get the volume high enough to be able to hear callers, and it didn't stay secure on my ear. A friend recommended this one and it works great. Stays secure on my ear, volume level is more than adequate, and it can work on two phones. I have 2 phones that I use constantly and it's very convienent. The only issue I have w/ the 510 is the lag time when connecting to either phone. Sometimes it takes a few seconds to connect to the phone, and the caller is wondering if I've picked up yet or not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty darn comfortable","review":"I already had a bluetooth headset but didn't use it much. Wasn't very comfortable and kept falling off so I wasn't expecting much. I was plesantly surprised. You can barely feel it. After a few minutes, you won't even know it's there. The sound quality is pretty good. I can't say for how it sounds from the other side. The folks I talk to say I sound normal on it. I guess that's about as good as you could expect.I find that I now prefer to use this rather than holding my cell. I would strongly recomment it. Also, I select it because it was one of the top five BT headsets on cnet"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good headset for the money","review":"Pro- good sound and its does have some Noise-canceling which I think is important (no wind tunnel effect)Con- you need to hold call button for 3 sec or two beeps then it clips the start of voice actvation request.also it uses a click instead of a tone for indication of a incoming calls."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good audio quality but...","review":"The Audio Quality is quite good.

Unfortunately the power plug contact on the earpiece doesn't work well (comes off) and I will have to return the product."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT DID YOU SAY AGAIN??","review":"This headset works rather well if you are sitting still, with no other noise around you. I have to speak in a rather loud voice so the person im speaking with can even hear me. The battery does last a good while on a charge, but overall, this headset should be given away, not sold. I spend most of my time driving, and again, it is terrible if you have road noise or the radio is playing. My friend has one also and the background noise resembles fingernails screeching down a chalkboard. So needless to say, the claim plantronics makes about \\"noise cancelling\\" is highly overated or they did their testing in a library somewhere...BUY SOMETHING ELSE!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible reception","review":"This product claims that it has the clearest reception. It also claims that it reduces wind sound. It does not. It is terrible. I couldn't understand anyone using this product. I don't understand because there were so many good reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Revised review - think twice","review":"Other Bluetooth headsets had a bad echo and delay so I was really wary - not this one. Other reviews mentioned issues with pairing, the on/off, etc. I haven't had that problem so far. I hve tiny ears and wish I could make it fit better, but that is the only criticism.** Review update. I lost the first so I bought another. After the return window the piece where the charger fits popped out and I can't charge the thing. I would thing a high-end Bluetooth should last more than a few months.Again, it was a fantastic product until then."},{"rating":"1","title":"Static issues.","review":"Got these for my college age kids.

I get some static at times, but no one on the other end has ever complained about the sound quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great headset for a good price.","review":"I bought this headset about three weeks ago and have had no problems. The sound cancellation feature works well, which helps when outside or driving. I paid about half what the headset costs in local stores and am well pleased overall."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great headset for the money.","review":"This is definitely the best headset I have purchased so far. I have purchased two other headsets previous to this one. The only downside to this headset is I wish it had a longer talk time for the battery. That can be frustrating at times. But all in all a great purchase for the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Durable, works well, range could be better","review":"The 510 is very durable and comfortable to wear. I have just two minor complaints with it: 1) the on off button is very small and somewhat difficult to press 2) the range could be better - it starts to get pretty scratchy when i go into the other room of my relatively small apartment. Otherwise, I think it's a great little device."},{"rating":"2","title":"necessary","review":"i had the motorola for almost one year, when it stopped working. it stopped the first week i had my new car, which is a 5 speed manual. this headset had such good reviews, i decided to try it. no one can tell when i am using it because it's so clear and it doesn't fall off my ear. and i can shift gears in my car without tossing my phone down. i recommend this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but ear piece is uncomfortable","review":"Good sound quality etc. I just wich the ear fit more comfortably into my ear like Jabra."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good headset","review":"Having used this and a motorola, this is the much better headset.

It's not as stylish as the motorola, but much better for what it's designed to do."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of what's out there","review":"I have purchased 4 different bluetooth devices since Christmas and this is the hands down winner. I started off with the Plantronics 350, but the earpiece was uncomfortable and really bothered me even though the sound was pretty good. I switched to the Jabra BT500, and the BT160, but the quality wasn't there and they fell off my ear very easily. I finally found this model on Amazon for a great price (Staples wanted twice as much) and ordered it. Plantronics quality is way better than Jabra and this one fits much better and it even comes with 2 other earpieces in case this one wasn't comfortable. Stop searching and buy this one because it is the best you will find out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective product","review":"The headset would not turn on even after charging as instructed. It would turn on when plugged into the wall while charging, but would just not turn on when I attempted to use it normally. Must be some defect in the power-up component.

However the fit for me is not snug because I wear spectacles, otherwise it works well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything Everyone else says it is!","review":"After using a low-end JABRA bluetooth for the past year, this Plantronics voyager is so welcome! It paired easily with my phone and with the different ear cushions, you can have one custom for your ear canal.While I found it to fit easily onto my ear and hold well, my boyfriend who has his ears more flat against his head had a hard time hooking it on his ear and having it stay there without much adjustment needed. Also, he said that it was too bulky for his liking, but I like it just fine!The sound quality is great, I can hear others well and I'm told that I come through very clearly. I have had it for almost 2 months and only had to charge it once besides that first time and I use it everyday for 1-2 hours each time - that's good battery life!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good sound, comfortable and easy on your wallet!","review":"The headset works very well. The noise reduction is not that great, the Jawbone is better at it. However, the overall sound quality both ways is better and the fit is more comfortable than the Jawbone. It is light and seems large at first but is very easy to fold up and is quite sturdy. Especially for the price, this is a great choice!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Voyager 510","review":"OK not the prettiest Headset on the market but I have been trying Headset's for some time now and have owned quite a few. The Voyager 510 is the best hands down... Best Sound, clarity, noise cancelation and battery life out there. Plantronics came out with the Voyager 520 I guess as the successor, it looks good but you can't get more then 3 feet from the phone before it breaks up, bad, bad, bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"worth buying","review":"This is the only bluetooth product I have used, but when I lost my first Voyager 510, I purchased the exact same one. The sound quality is excellent, most people can't tell I am using it. It is easy to pair to a phone (mine is a sprint), and simple to use in general. Though it comes with earpieces that are of various sizes, my only complaint is that it feels like it may fall off my ear sometimes. The price is reasonable and I definitely recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works but Yuck!","review":"This headset generally works, though there was times I needed to re-pair it. My problems with it that are:1) Its hard to turn off - if you pay attention you can turn it off easy enough, but nothing like the Motorola H700 where you just flip the boom.2) It's big! It's comfy enough on your ear, but its huge in your pocket and since things stick out of it, its hard to get out of your pocket.3) Flashing blue light is way too bright! When is dark and I'm in the car, I keep thinking that the cops are behind me the way it blinks so brightly. It disturbed my passengers too.4) Wind tolerance - it's better than my H700, but its still too noisy to hold a conversation in any level of wind.I'm sending mine back and getting another H700."},{"rating":"2","title":"plantronics 510 bluetooth headset","review":"i am a truck driver and really like my headset highly. it filters out all the noise inside the truck so people can hear me clearly.i would not be without it. it is the best one that i have tried. i highly recamind the plantronics 510 bluetooth headset.it is well worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tough little earpiece","review":"I just ordered my second 510. I drive a truck over the road, so I deal with a lot of wind noise and background noise. This is the perfect Bluetooth for higher noise enviroments. I used and abused this thing for 2 years now, and it finally just fell apart. It was still working when it fell apart and I still got a day and a half use out of one charge.The on/off button is hard to get to while wearing it, and it is a little difficult to get on and off your ear at first, but once you get it where it fits right, I found it very easy to get on and off.I have tried others, but this is by far the best I have found for my high noise, dirty, rough environment. If I can make mine last 2 years in a truck, there is no telling how long it will last someone who is less demanding."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Headset Available for the Money!.","review":"After reviewing all the bluetooth headsets available I am most satisfied with this purchase, first the savings was fantastic, 46 dollars versus 99 from my cell company. Also it is very comfortable on the ear and very easy to pair to the phone. I also like the fact it is rechargeable. The reception and clarity is unparalelled. I wouldnt buy any other headset and highly recommend this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying To Use, Buzzing Sound, Poor Quality","review":"After so many great reviews, I figured this would be a good choice. It is not. The power button is very annoying to turn on. When using it, there is a clear buzzing noise, even when the phone is close by or in my pocket. The switching is slow, which cuts people off and with my Treo, the voice command doesn't work. If and was to do it again, I would NOT purchase this product. I got two - yes TWO different headset that were defective - before Amazon sent me another to correct the mistake. It works, but when it's not convenient to use, it's pretty much useless.DISSAPOINTED IN PLANTRONICS!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bulky and Noisy","review":"This product was received packaged well and on time. I wouldn't not recommend it however because of the physical size and quality of the audio. You will get a lot of ambient noise when used in a car or and area where background noise is high. The battery life is not as advertised if you talk on it a lot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Six Years and Works Great","review":"(Voyager 510 bluetooth headset)I want to praise the Plantronics bluetooth headset I own for lasting so damn long.I ordered it in the summer of 2006 and it serves me well still.I should mention that I carry it in an Altoids tin for protection against physical damage and dust, but the battery has also lasted this entire time. My hat is OFF for that alone. Not a daily user, either, so add that to your own needs. A heavy, daily user who just throws it in a pocket or purse might not get six years mileage out of one, but you never know. Good job, Plantronics. Color me impressed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very pleased w/ item & seller.","review":"This particuliar bluetooth headset works very well, is simple to use and cuts out all the noise from around you.

Has three interchangeable ear-pieces so that you can find the one that fits you best. sits comfortably around your ears.I would like the volume to be a little higher and mic to be a little more sensitive. so far haven't had much complaint from my friends about the quality of voice and clarity when i switched to bluetooth.Overall a nice buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"STOP SHOUTING IN MY EAR!","review":"First off, THIS UNIT IS LOUD!The big bonus with this headset is the VOLUME. I am very hard of hearing and even I turn the headset volume down.I had three other headsets and this one is the most comfortable one of them all.The clarity of the callers voices is excellant. I would of given five stars but my voice is not as clear as I would like it to be. I would add though, that I have a very large head, so the distance from the mic to my mouth is probably the issue.I use this for both my cell phone and my PS3 (Thank you multipoint technology!)

On the plus side, the headset easily paired with the phone and kept the pairing without fail."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incompatible charger","review":"This device uses a proprietary connector for the charger.Motorola RAZR, many headsets from Motorola, and many other mobile devices use the mini-USB connector for charging. With a common connector, a single charger can charge all your devices. Ditto a single charger in your car will suffice. And with a mini-USB cable you can charge from your computer. When I travel I bring my laptop, the cell phone, a headset, and a mini-USB cable.Not the case here. When you travel with the Plantronics device you have to remember to bring an extra charger with you. And if the headset needs to be charged while in your car, you're out of luck.Instead, go with a headset that can use the same charger as your phone."},{"rating":"1","title":"headset","review":"When I could not get the 910 to work, I bought this one.

Amazon just passed the buck onto them, to which they told me to contact the manufacturer and tell them to fix it. LOL! I called plantronics and they tell me to pay $6 to ship it to them for repair - a $30 dollar bluetooth, which I diagnosed as I just needed a functioning charger. Thats it!!!!!!!!!!!!

Probably worth noting that this is my first BT headset, so I have no basis for comparison.PRO: Comfortable to wear, light, good range, long battery life, sound quality seems high.CON: A little difficult to put on in a hurry - annoying if a call is coming in and it's sitting on the desk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too slick by half","review":"The device works well, when it does work. I like its feel, and sound quality, and would recommend it to anyone who wants to become an expert operator. Me, I just want the stupid thing to work. As there is really only one button to operate its features it relys on the number of pushes, etc. This is a problem if you lose track of what your doing, which is easy to do when your multi-tasking (aren't we all). The device will suddenly switch sounds back to the phone for no reason at all. I suspect my problems are due to operator error, but I don't want another device I have to study to operate. Its a good device, but certainly not 'plug and play'."},{"rating":"2","title":"I wanted a headset to work with two devices","review":"I was looking for a headset to work between two devices and this headset does that well.

People can understand me clearly and I can understand them clearly. This is the best headset that I have tried thus far."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good for those of us who wear glasses!","review":"So, I bought this item because of the rave reviews about it's clarity. I didn't realize how hard it would be to put on. The directions are simple...run the large piece along your ear and fit the ear piece into your ear canal....not that simple. I have small ears to begin with so that large back piece is too heavy. And since I have to wear glasses, there isn't much more space back there. Don't get me wrong, the ear piece has great clarity and I haven't had any problems with the other person hearing me, even when driving. I just can't get the darn ear piece to stay put.I keep having to adjust it when I'm driving, which isn't safe. So, if you wear glasses, even sunglasses, or have small ears....steer clear of this piece!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Works ok","review":"It works OK. As long as there is not a lot of outside noise (e.g., driving) it works great. But, it fits a bit loose so I sometimes have to press it up to my ear so I can hear clearly. And, it picks up extraneous noises which sometimes is very annoying to the other person on the phone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Static, difficult to use, slow response time","review":"After reading glowing reviews, I figured I'd finally found a decently priced BT headset to replace my crappy Verizon cheapie. No such luck. It turned out to be worse than the $20 one from Verizon. Many people I talked with complained of static, strange electronic sounds, and faintness. I found it difficult to get in place quickly, which is important to me because I don't walk around with it all the time. The side control that allows you to enter commands verbally, or that lets you know your dialing is being registered, is slow on the uptake compared to the Verizon one. Also, I found I had to take it off the change the volume because the control is non-ergonomic and non-intuitive to touch. Finally, I hate its bulk. The verizon one was lighter and smaller and a lot easier to place. Wish I hadn't let the return period expire."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Buy!","review":"The Voyager 510 is a great pairing for my Palm Centro.

The reception is pretty good, I wished the volume control can be louder when I'm driving with the window down {minor detail). The only thing that can be improved on is that it hurts the inner ear a little after wearing it for awhile, even with the smallest of three ear pieces attached, but I would still recommend this item"},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality Bluetooth Headset","review":"The Plantronics Voyager 510 is the best kept secret in bluetooth headsets as far as sound quality.

It also includes multiple sized fittings for inside your ear. Overall, a great product at a reasonable price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's true!","review":"I got a new cell phone recently (SE W300i) and the volume is too low and sounds tinny.

I drive a lot and wear it all the time I'm in the car. Its great, comfortable, and I have to turn the volume on the headset down. I can hear people easily and they sound great. They are surprised when they learn I'm on a bluetooth. It will also pair with two units at the same time.

Dont feel like have something on my ears.-Bluetooth syncs with phone very easilyCons:-Functionally, none. The headset is not as sleek as other ones in the market, but given the quality of this product, i highly recommend it.- The blue light on the headset keeps flashing, but that can be turned off.You can buy a dock to connect it to your desk phone separately, which i dont have, but some colleagues use it and love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"If the headset fits......","review":"Fits the ear perfectly.Does not interfere with glasses.Ample volume range.Comfortable.Excellent battery life.Good value for the money.Excellent earpiece sound quality.Excellent microphone voice quality (when not in a noisy environment).Cons:If you're in a noisy environment, the microphone sends the noise to the person you're talking to.I was hoping volume would be loud enough to use for my one ear that has 60%+ hearing loss but, that's not the case. I did not include this as a factor in my rating of this productThis headset is not as stealthy as I would have liked but, I don't really care about that. This may be a problem for some."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Bluetooth of all","review":"I went through two other Bluetooth devices before I got this one. The first one (AG) was great but everybody told me I sounded like I was talking underwater. The second one (Motorola) everybody could hear me but I couldn't hear anybody else. This is my third one and I love it in all respects. And Plantronics virtually invented the headset technology years ago -- I used them as far back as the 1970s as headsets for TV production. I'm a happy camper. Don't waste time looking at other brands or models. This is the one."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the better ones","review":"I had purchased another brand for my wife a while back, paid $100. Her ears are small and it kept falling off.

It's the best one they tried and the price was right."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Ear Piece","review":"I love this ear set. It was easy to sync with my PDA. The clarity is wonderful.

I can't keep the charger plugged in properly - the slightest movement on any surface disengages the connection so that when I retrieve it, I can't tell if it's charged or not unless I press it in and set it down just right and wait for a blue light. It's as if the unit and the charger were not properly designed to work together.I also thought all bluetooth units came with a car charger - after all, the point is to be mobile, and you want to be able to charge it when it runs down on the road. I suppose for the price I should not have expected that I'd have to get one separately, but I've never bought one before, and all the ones I saw in stores looked like they included one.I never actually used the unit on a live phone call, so I can't comment on its quality, but having to fiddle with the charger connection constantly to be sure it didn't disengage is reason enough to return it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Headset Review","review":"I would not purchase again, nor recommend purchase.

From what I've been reading it seems there are some issues with the buttons. The unit will not start. I called the manufacturer whose number was right on the box and connected to a support person fairly quickly and we walked through all the steps. He recommened I send it back, and, if Amazon could not or would not take it back they would exchange it for me.Though it fits comfortably and is secure on the ear, unlike the Motorola which feels like it going to fall off at any moment, I will be ordering another.

I can always hear who I'm talking with and they have always been able to hear me without any problem. It pairs with my Treo seamlessly when I turn it on. It's light weight and comfortable. The price was great, got it for >$50.00 delivered. I have no real complaints so far.Cons: The only down side in my opinion is that it protrudes out from my ear enough to sometimes get caught in my hair and other things. I previously had a Jabra 550 and I loved the way it fit. It never got caught on anything. I would completely forget that I had it on. I even went to bed with it on a couple of times. I got the Plantronics Voyager 510 first because of the price, second because it has noise canceling ability and it's design is somewhat like my Jabra.

I researched for well over a month before purchasing a BT headset. After all of the reviews from other people I settled on this product. This device was supposed to pair well with my V710, others said they had success with it. I did not.The static on this unit made it virtually useless. After trying 2 different units, 2 phones, and unpairing/pairing hundreds of times I was left to the conclusion that it just isn't a good match with the V710. If the phone wasn't within 2 feet of the earpiece & unobstructed, the static was so bad you could not hear the person calling you & vice versa. If I can't keep my phone in my pocket & be on a call with the headset, then what is the point of having a BT headset in the first place.Other inconviences:* Non Standard charger. A mini-usb plugin would be ideal.* No voice dial capability.One thing I can say, is that it's a VERY comfortable unit. I just wish it worked better."},{"rating":"1","title":"This thing is a waste of good money.","review":"It works fine when people call me, but when I call people it doesn't work 50% of the time.

I would like a product that fits comfortably in my ear, is stable, loud enough, provides good reception between the cell phone, adequate battery life and thoughtfully designed buttons on the headset. Guess what. Such a product does not exist. Perhaps the greatest problem is that Bluetooth technology is a poor design and provides variably poor reception depending upon external conditions.

I gave one to my son and keep one in the auto, and one for swapping. My first one has lasted for three years. I cannot believe the batteries have lasted, in spite of one of the previous reviewers having failures. I plan topurchase this model as long as they are available."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite Satisfied","review":"I'm quite satisfied with all aspects of this product with minor exception of long term comfort. The over the ear design is not going to be quite as easy on the ear as those locust-looking things that just hang on by sticking in the ear hole, but at least I know that it's not going anywhere as I move around all day. Plus, it is quite easy to adjust to use in both ears so as long as you are, I guess, ambi-aural, comfort does not become an issue. Everything else - pairing, battery, sound quality, durability, volume control, etc. I give 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"best headset!","review":"I compared this with the Plantronics Voyager 520, and I really believe this 'older' model is better than the 520 in terms of comfort and features. If for nothing else, think about this--with the 510, if that blue flashing LED is annoying at night, you can disable it. With the 520 (as I believe with most other headsets), you're stuck being blinded."},{"rating":"2","title":"No noise","review":"This bluetooth blocks out the outside noise and you can actually hear the person you are talking to clearly. I recommend it highly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great headset --- Lousy charging.","review":"I will admit that this headset is a great one. Easy to operate and very clear on my Treo 700wx. However, the propriety charging system sucks! They use a small, non-standard connector between the headset and the charger. Mine stopped working just 3 weeks after I got it. When checking for repair, I was told that I \\"must have abused\\" the headset. I guess they consider pluging and un-pluging the charger abuse. Dumped the set and purchased another brand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent headset","review":"This is my second one. I bought one originally because I didn't like the Motorola's. I just bought a second one for my father. They're excellent ear sets. It hooked to my phone (Nokia 6682) very easily, look a couple of minutes to have it hook up.I've had excellent battery life, talking for 7 hours without having to recharge. It comes with different size ear pieces, which just twist and lock. I keep it in my pocket at times, and they haven't fallen off a single time. The set also twists so it'll be one flat piece so it'll fit into your pocket or wherever nicely."},{"rating":"2","title":"great choice","review":"The Plantronics Voyager 510 is the best blue tooth headset we have found. I'm sure there are more expensive and more sophisticated units on the market, but this is great for our needs. The unit is light weight and comfortable. Ease of operation is a great asset. Very satisfied and the purchase price and prompt delivery was excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"I haven't tried all the features on this unit, however, it pretty much works as advertised.The battery seems to work as long as advertised.

In fact, with the motorola black razr, it sounds better then using the phone.I do definitively recommend the unit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better than my last bluetooth headset","review":"It had really good sound. Others could hear my car radio but only when I wasn't talking. They all agreed it was much better than the other headset I had. For the price this was very nice. I don't recommend leaving it in your pants pocket and washing it. Mine still works but the sound is not very good at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Headset","review":"I have been very happy with this headset. The quality is far superior to the Jabra headset I have used in the past. The price is great - I fully reccomend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Voyager 510 BT headset with sidekick 3","review":"Perfect combination, very easy to pair with my sidekick 3, sound quality is excellent and the battery life is amazing. The multipoint tech. also allows me to switch between my sk3 and msn messenger phone calls just by pressing one button. This is one of the best BT headset out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super clear, long battery life","review":"I've had the Voyager 510 for about a year now and it works very well. The audio quality is *very* clear on this unit and it has a long battery life. The on-off button is a little difficult to use because of its size - its about the size of a large pin head, and the behind the ear battery is a little large - otherwise I would have rated five stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's the only one I've tried but...","review":"I really like this headset because the earpiece fits nicely in your ear without being uncomfortable. This makes it easier to hear in a crowded room, etc. Also, it stays on quite well weather you're working in the yard or whatever. The signal is probably as good as any 10-meter headset but if you have your phone in your left pants pocket and the headset in your right ear, you will get some static. This is the second one of these I've had and one thing I would suggest to anyone buying it is to fold it up when you put it in your pocket (fold the boom upward and twist the earpiece inward so it is protected) if the earpiece falls off, good luck trying to find a replacement!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A quality bluetooth device.","review":"I am very pleased with this so far. Compared to the Motorola H500, this is a wonderful piece of gear although it is much larger. Regardless of the size, it sits well on my ear, delivers great sound and is comfortable. Due to road noise it has been hard for people to hear me with the H500; so far this has not been a complaint with the Voyager. It's been worth every penny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Design And Functionability","review":"The headset fits comfortably and does not flop or jiggle on the ear like most of the rest of the ones I've tried...the volume could be a shade louder at the maximum, but overall is easy to connect/disconnect to your phone and use the \\"dial the last number\\" feature. I would recomend this one highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does all and more","review":"I tried two other headsets and found them uncomfortable and without the clarity of the 510. Whether in my car or outside, those with whom I speak always comment on the clarity of the call. Linking is seamless with my Motorola E815. I often forget my phone in the car, walk into a WAWA and the headset beeps telling me when I exceeded range (about 15 feet) yet when I return it picks up the connection again and off I go. The battery life is fantastic as I went an entire week and a half on one charge.I could not be happier with this purchase and Amazon had the best price by $30.Wishing you all the best in your next purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for PS3!","review":"Works great out of the box. I was searching for a headset where I would have no problem getting reception at all times, and this headset is great for my ps3. The volume control is great! Comes with 3 different size earpieces and fits very comfortable. I wear for hours on end without any discomfort at all. This is a great product for any ps3 gamer without wanting to go for the \\"official\\" ps3 headset."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall Good Value for the Price","review":"I have been using this product for a month now. For the most part it works well although the reception at home and in my office is not that great. The reception problem existed prior to this purchase. Overall, this item has given me the freedom to multitask (with both hands) while talking on the phone. Excellent value for the price!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"This product is hard to turn on. The sound is very distorted and breaks up. The people on the other end can't hear you at all. I returned this item, as it was useless."},{"rating":"2","title":"P150 BL Headset","review":"More comfortable to wear and less fragile than the Motorola HS850 it replaced. The slow rep rate blink of the blue on indicator LED is not as obvious in the car at night so it less distracting. Having red and blue LED indicators you know when you are turning it off or when charging is underway or complete. Voice pickup is just as good as the Motorola unit and it came with three sizes of ear bud pads making it easier to find a comfortable fit. No more flopping around which was the second drawback of the HS850. The slender boom make you look less like a 'borg, but it is a little difficult to set it up for optimum position. Battery life is good enough to keep up with my phone. I would probably buy another when this one needs to be retired."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great bluetooth headset","review":"I bought this after seeing good reviews for it. They were right on. It is big, but the size means that it is nice and loud (that's a good thing) in your ear and has plenty of battery life. I would definitely recommend this to others. It took me switching around the 3 ear pieces sizes a couple of times to pick the one that I liked, but now it fits, sounds and works great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great all around","review":"This is personally my first blue-tooth. I bought it after a lot of research. Prior to purchasing the 510 I spoke with many friends who use blue-tooth headsets, and their voice was often muddy and garbled. I have been told by many that my voice was clear and they could not tell I was on a blue-tooth headset. The quality on my end is quite good too. I also like the headset controls for answering and making calls using voice dialing on my phone (works great with my LG Chocolate 3)."},{"rating":"1","title":"I give up","review":"All I'm wanting is something that doesn't fall out of my ear, doesn't break in less than 6 months, and has decent audio quality. I've tried ten different Bluetooth earpieces, and all of them have issues. This is the latest. Worked wonderfully last night -- even used it. Charged it over night... and now when I make calls, the other ends hears the WORST static ever.I'm going back to my wired headset. This is just too hard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped working","review":"This headset worked great for a couple of months, and then promptly ceased all operation. I do not recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"dud","review":"bought this because of the supposed advanced wind and background noise cancellation. when working it seemed to work fine. my unit kept losing it's connection and would then be difficult to pare. after 3 sessions w/tech support(2 out of 3 very courteous and helpful) all recommended returning it. i did. easy and painless to do. puchased motorola h710 and have been very pleased w/it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Regret buying","review":"It loses it signal to often even though i have it right here on my waste band one foot away from the phone and both batteries are charged to full capacity. I love the fit on my ear, this item needs to be upgraded"},{"rating":"1","title":"not a great design","review":"This bluetooth headset has great sound. That being said, it doesn't fit me at all. It falls off of my ear, which is not only annoying, but hazardous while driving. I'm sure it might fit larger people - and if it does, the sound truly is clear as a bell. But if you're small like me (5'2\\") with small ears, you may want a different headset for the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would not recommend this item","review":"I found this item to be lightweight and comfortable. Sound quality was fairly good. That's about all I can say that is good about it.Talk time is maybe 2 to 2 1/2 hours, stand-by time is about 50 hours, both are less than acceptable.The headset would not accept a charge after about 3 1/2 months of use (light usage at that). It also seemed to have a mind of it's own when it came to staying connected to my phone, constantly having to re-boot phone and device in order to get connection (used with a Samsung cell phone).I would definitely advise others to stay away from this item. Also, Plantronics would not give any assistance and would only refer me to the retailer, zero customer assistance is not a good thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"conversation lags","review":"Excellent as a phone blue tooth but it doesn't work well when using on your pc, as conversation lags, when one talks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good bluetooth headset","review":"I got it as a gift for my boyfriend, and he loves it! He loves how he can talk on the phone and walk around without any wires tangling up or having to hold a phone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Voyager 510 Bluetooth HEadset","review":"This headset provides very good quality audio reception. The only negative of the 510 is the size of the headset. All things being equal I would purchase this product again based on its performance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"After many different bluetooths, this is by far the best one ever. A little on the large size, but stays on the ear. Sound quality is great, people hear me and I hear them, even when windy out. Easy to pair with your cell phone. Best price I found was with Amazon.com If your looking for a low priced and high quality BT this is the one to buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Delayed Reaction","review":"After reading so many good reviews for this item, and trying more than 5 different Bluetooths for my Treo 755p, I was ready to be impressed by this Plantronics. Ho Hum. It's as good as any others I tried but it seems like half the time there's a good ten second delay before it switches over, and the switch over period itself is a good 2 seconds. On the plus side, I had the fewest complaints about the sound quality. At this point I'm resigned to the fact that it may well be my cell phone, not Bluetooth that is the issue. So if you want to buy it go ahead, but if you've tried many others for your device, this might not be the Holy Grail you're looking for. Sigh."},{"rating":"2","title":"Voice activated calls","review":"I really like the headset now. It took awhile to learn how to do voice activated calls with my old razr. Just hold down the button on the mike arm socket untill it beeps twice, then say the voice name."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works good","review":"This product works good. This is my second one. I lost the first one. I bought the first one in a retail store, and paid twice as much. I just ordered the car charger so I won't lose this one charging it in the house. The headset was here two days before it was suppose to be here. I have no complaints."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Product","review":"I chose this ear piece because it was highly reviewed. I bought it to pair with my ps3 and occasionally use with my phone. It works great for my use. Since I have not used it with a phone yet I really cannot comment on voice quality/wind. It fits comfortably on your ear, but it takes a few tries to get it situated right so it doesn't fall off. Thats my only complaint, but maybe it's just me. I would recommend it, but there could be something better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Headset, Battery & Charging Problems","review":"I used this product and was impressed with the volume. However, the connection for the charger is iffy at best. Mine lasted about two months. Now the battery will not hold a charge. I tried all the memory reduction tricks I know to make this battery last, but to no avail. The price is right, the volume is good, the power button is difficult to use and the battery is gone after a short while. If the power supply was better, I'd buy another one. For now, it's back to the wired headset."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for bluetooth, not as good as corded","review":"It was easy to setup and use, unfortunately there was still static when working with my Treo.I still like corded better."},{"rating":"1","title":"dont work with long hair","review":"If you're a female, or if you have long hair, you might want to think twice about purchasing this headset. I bought it because it is small and light, but the hook goes on your ear is not designed to work with long hair. My headset pops out easily, just a 2-3 minutes after I put on, it gradually moves upward because my long hair gets in the way. So, you can imagine how painful it is to fuss with it, and trying to make it stay, so I can talk for a few minutes. After trying to put up with it for a week, I gave up. I am looking at other bluetooth headset that works with my Razer and my long hair. :-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Angry, Upset Amazon Customer","review":"BEWARE!!!!!!! This is a horrible product. I ordered two bluetooths, one for my Iphone and one for my husband's within two months both of the microphone tips had fallen off all by themselves. At first I thought my husband was being rough with his, so I chalked it up to one faulty bluetooth, but after a couple of weeks mine did the same thing. Also the volume on them is not all that great and there is a lot of static. I noticed the price has dropped dramitically since I purchased them. I bought mine for $49 a piece in Feb '10, I have a feeling the price will keep dropping until they almost give them away. As an added note, there is not a warranty for these after 30 days, so you are SOL if something goes wrong. STAY AWAY FROM THESE BLUETOOTHS!! YOU WILL BE THROWING YOUR MONEY AWAY!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"Works great. I had a Motorola H350 and would get complaints that I was difficult to hear. I also had trouble hearing people even at full volume. With this unit I have to turn the volume down and no complaints about being heard. It is comfortable to wear and I also use it with Skype on my computer. My only complaint would be the size of the unit. It is not as compact as other units."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Bluetooth I've used yet","review":"I am very pleased with this headset.

Never misses a beat."},{"rating":"2","title":"My first bluetooth headset","review":"I use this headset with my treo 650.

It would be nice if it could connect a little quicker. All in all I think this is a great headset. My friend even got one for himself and his girlfriend after he tried mine out. I plan to keep this headset until the battery goes dead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product!","review":"This is a wonderful product.

With the body of the device sitting behind the ear, it is surprisingly very comfortable to wear. It sits solidly and doesn't jostle in the ear when walking or if moving your head from left to right. The sound quality is crisp and clear and it does a great job filtering background noise. I've even gone as far to asked the party that Im talking to on their option of the sound quality on their end.

With the Voyager 510, I'm on the right track now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Gadget","review":"This bluetooth works well with my cell phone. I looks big and bulky, but it fits well on the ear.

One downside is that it will make loud static if you get too far from your phone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most comfortable earpiece yet","review":"A friend has the same headset, and I recently saw him engage in an exercise I've experienced: turning the house upside down looking for my bluetooth headset... when it was in my ear all the time. I've tried the Jabra and Motorola versions. This one is the easiest to don and the easiest to control. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is that the voice reproduction could be better. That is probably the fault of the short microphone boom, but I can live with that."},{"rating":"2","title":"great deal with some quirks","review":"Pairing the 510 with my Motorolla E815 was a breeze. The sound is clear, headset is comfertable to wear. Initial static problems were solved by Verison with a software update.

I have had so much trouble with this thing, it loses it's link up with my phone way too often. For example, in a 20 minute call, it will switch back and forth 4-5 times. I bought it to drive with, and sometimes I have to hold my phone to my head on one side, and have this thing in my other ear. Trying to drive like that makes me wonder why they called this thing \\"Voyager\\".I can also get an echo, and it also seems to amplify background noise at times, which gets annoying during a call because it comes and goes, regardless of being in a relatively quiet environment.The highs one this thing are great...when it works the way you think it should, it's fantastic. When this thing acts up, you want to chuck it out the window."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good at first then went south","review":"I have been using this headset for about 6 months now. At first it was working great but then about a month ago the quality of the voice (transmit) started to degrade. I could hear people fine but they complained that I was always braking up.

Now that I have the Voyager I no longer have any problems hearing or being heard. The only complaint I have is with the power button. Turning on the unit weather it is on my head or not is never a problem but turning it off is sometimes tricky. I usually find that when I am ready to take the unit off I just turn it off after I remove it. Aside from the pain of the power button this has been an awesome purchase with no regrets. It's battery lasts a long time, it sits right on the ear and doesn't flop around like the H500 did, and I can hear everything.

I can usually go a few days without recharging the headset (with moderate daily use).Last week, I used the headset to make a call while on my bicycle traveling at 15 MPH, and the other party had no idea that I was talking hands-free and under a helmet.Sound quality (both ways) is exceptional, and I've never experienced a dropped call/connection.The user-interface on the headset (buttons, LED, ear buds, etc.) work well for such a small form factor, even with big hands/fingers.I've even dropped the unit a few times (@ <= 6 feet) and it hasn't broken or had pieces pop off.Overall, a high quality unit with excellent features at a reasonable price. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"Excellent Bluetooth headset. Works better than the Motorola H700 and H850 which I own.

I tend to use it for long conversations (3+ hours) and I find it very comfortable.It paired immediately with LG phone and required equally little setup with my MacBook. The sound quality is obviously limited by its small speaker and wireless connection. Voice tends to be good over my cell phone and over Skype, but static sometimes breaks through. The connection remains strong well over 20 feet. Several times, I've walked away from the phone/computer to another part of the house and had no static whatsoever several times.I got it on sale, but it's definitely a good value.

I have tried several of the Motorola headsets and did not like the sound quality nor the fit on the ear. The Plantronics 510 fits the ear and doesn't move when you turn your head. It has 3 sizes for the earbud, and most assuredly one will fit. The headset is light weight. I wear it all day long and don't even notice that it is there until I hear a beep in my ear. The battery has lasted me for more than 5 days with constant use. Overall, it is small and easily fits in a pocket. While the on/off button may be small and difficult to use while on your ear. The easy solution is to just turn it on or off while it is off your ear.This Plantronics headset produces clear, loud, static free sound. It really works as advertised and provides the user with an easy way to make handsfree calls.If I ever have to replace it for whatever reason, I would definitely purchase it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent bluetooth headset","review":"This is an excellent bluetooth headset.

However, I had to return it because it would not stay in my hear. It was extremly frustrating because I could not walk with it and found myself tilting my head to the side so it would stay in. Maybe I have abnormally small ears, but I doubt it.

I would say that the device works as reviewed except for the range. I don't seem to get the range (60')they did. I do have one little gripe the charging of this headset has to be done on the charger,I wish that it could be charged on a usb port like my Motorola which makes for very convenient charging, Laptop or in car. I do have one hint for current owners. If it feels a little tight rotate the headset forward towards your temple this will make it considerably more comfortable and for me it seems like is its not even there."},{"rating":"2","title":"finally!!!!","review":"i just want to say this is the best earpiece i have owned and i,ve had 6 since 2005.sound quality is great and i can actually talk with my truck window down now,the volume control is great on this unit. very comfortable as well forget that i have it on half the time.i thought it was alittle bulky at first but when i discovered the sound quality and the comfort it was a no brainer. recommend this to all,great price as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sound quality","review":"Excellent product, sound quality is great.

We had the old type headsets that wouldn't fit, dropped calls, cost twice as much, and just wouldn't work well. I enjoy the different size ear buds because being a woman it's hard to jam the one-size-fits-all types in a small ear. The best thing is you don't hear back ground noise. At times I forget I have it on. The price is so right, and when people see me with it on they ask questions then end up purchasing it. Yes, it's that nice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to loose","review":"Works well but the larger area behind the ear causes it to flip off the ear when putting on sun glasses.

I saw the photo and figured it'd work for her. About a week later, I got the package in the mail, shortly followed by an email from the seller saying they might have sent the wrong one. Sure enough, it was a cheap, used jabra bluetooth. I verified that they had sent the wrong bluetooth and they did refund my money in exchange for the return of the jabra , but they said that they didn't have the Plantronics 510 headset in stock...

Couldn't justify spending money on another one. Got home and had another complaint about the sound quality of a call with a business associate and caved as Amazon had it for a really good price. I paired the Voyager and was immediately impressed by the instant improvement in the quality of the calls. Sound is clear, range is good and it is so comfortable. This is unquestionably the best BT headset I have ever used.

Well who wants to have a flashing blue light on one's head anyway?Sound quality was great on both ends though I was somewhat dubious about the noise cancelling microphone as with people complained about wind noise when I was in the car and the fan was on minimum blowing air past it. Maybe it was related to the broken LED? I'd be interested to hear other peoples experience.What killed it finally was that I must have over rotated the microphone boom as the side button no longer works which makes it impossible to pickup calls.Needs a USB power connector which they now appear to have on the newer more expensive models which also come with poorer reviews."},{"rating":"2","title":"Plantronics 510 Bluetooth Headset","review":"This wireless headset is an excellent product.

The two problems that i always seem to have are; 1) comfort and ability for the unit to fit in/on my ear for long periods of time and 2) Volume level. The 510 excels for me in both areas. Having just thrown out a Motorola 850 because it felt like it was always going to fall off of my head and when it would stay on you could never hear the person on the other side loudly enough.Don't let the less than sexy styling of this unit turn you off, it's inconspicuous enough once on your head and the directional mouth piece works well without getting in the way.Highly reccomended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not rugged enough for me","review":"I used the 510 for about two weeks. The mic portion of the unit quit on me. We have a farm-feedlot operation. I didn't want to wear it on my ear all the time. I carry my bluetooth in my front shirt pocket between calls. I found it cumbersome to untwist and place on my right ear (it swivels around to fit either ear). It seems everytime I took it from my pocket it was configured for my left ear. On the plus side it had good volume and they could always hear me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Just Bad Really Bad!","review":"This ear piece has a mind of it's own, sometimes it works but most of the time it doesn't. I don't know if it is incompatible with my phone or just a bad product. When I call someone I can hear them but they cannot hear me, I have to push the button on the ear piece several times before it finally connects or I have to hang up and dial again. Out going calls are a challange for this ear piece receiving calls are fine. I would not recommend this to any one. I have yet to find an ear piece that truely works they way they are supposed to, I guess I will keep looking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works nice, fits nice","review":"The Voyager 510 fits nicely on your ear and even comes with extra pads for more comfort. This is my first Bluetooth headset.I tried it on my Playstation 3 with Warhawk (online action multiplayer with voice chat) and it works, but I couldn't understand much of what anyone was saying. I think this was due to the game's limitations, as I've heard comments online saying the same thing.Pairing was easy once I learned what to do.I used it when I talked to a friend for an hour with my orange LG ENV phone. It worked fine and there were no issues. I stayed mostly near the phone at my desk, so I haven't tested walking away from the phone while talking.Cons: The power button is uncomfortable to press.

Sometimes, I have not heard calls come in so reliability for me has been around 95%. I am giving it 4 stars because for the price and comfort, it works quite well. Watch out for battery drainage on the cell so if not using, make sure to power off the bluetooth Power On to Off. It is a concern not to lose it - it's small and without wires.

Maybe the Jabra I bought was defective, but I didn't love it anyway. It was a little hard to hear as well, and it was awkward to wear. It always felt like it was on the verge of falling off.Those complaints were all remedied with the Plantronics Voyager. Easy to wear, easy to hear, even in my convertible.

The sound in and out of it is very good, BUT the on/off button is too small and tricky to use, you need fingernails to operate.NOW here's the REAL problem-the bluish/grey rubber that covers one side of the unit that goes behind the ear and covers the wiring that goes down to the boom starts to disintegrate after about 6 months to a year later and just gets worse as time goes on. It will start to crumble and break up leaving you with just a wire going to the boom. I don't know if Plantronics uses this rubber on their other units but if they do they will do the same thing.PLANTRONICS, BUILD A BETTER PRODUCT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Plantronics Voyager 510 Bluetooth Headset","review":"I got a Bluetooth because I'm hard of hearing and the chatty Cathy sound quality of my cell phones never quite cut it. I had the Jawbone which promised but did not deliver superior sound quality; when my puppy chewed the headset I was relieved and replaced it with the Plantronics Voyager 510. This headset is much better. The sound quality isn't as crisp as I'd like but the volume makes up for it. Also, my callers can hear and understand me, which is an improvement over the Jawbone. This headset also stays in place and is comfortable to wear."},{"rating":"1","title":"angry","review":"i got this product and after just one use it doesnty work porperly . it makes me very unhappy.. how do i get a refund?"},{"rating":"1","title":"everything that says new is not!","review":"received the plantronics voyager 510 bluetooth headset that was said to be new but only the ear plugs were new. the bluetooth and the charger had obvious usage (dirty tip and loose parts)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked good until battery stopped keeping charge.","review":"This product worked ok for the first 2 weeks. I work an 8-5 job and talk on the phone maybe 90 minutes of the day, and starting out, the headset would keep it's charge until midway through the 2nd day (nowhere near the 100 hour standby and 6 hour talk time mentioned in the product description). Then it started only lasting until around 3pm the first day after it had been charged, so I had to charge it up every day when I got home. Now, after owning it about 6 weeks, I can't even get it to hold a charge past noon - less than 45 minutes of talk time maximum. When I did charge it, I would hook it up to charge overnight before the days I would work, so maybe that fried the battery memory, but you would think it wouldn't change it that much in just 6 weeks. Very unsatisfied with this unit.Off to shop for a different headset now... :("},{"rating":"2","title":"Good headset","review":"I think this is a good headset however I was disappointed with the noise reduction, it advertised great noise reduction but when I'm on the phone the people on the other end talk about noise. It is not a big problem but just something that I made note of once I started using the phone.Great battery life, and comfortable fit. I would recommend to other people."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great headset...","review":"First, let me get the 2 minor negatives out of the way.1. There's no \\"beep\\" when a call drops or if your hung up on by mistake (Hello? Are you still there?).2. The \\"Power/Mute\\" is tough to use, but pushing/pulling the button to the left from it's right side as I push down made using it easier. These 2 things are why the Voyager 510 receives 4 stars instead of 5.I'll just ramble on about what I like. Clear and crisp sound, the cushion in your ear doesn't leave you listening to your environment in mono, the wind doesn't interfere with the mic or bluetooth signal from the phone as much as my other 2 headsets, the mic picks up my voice commands with little repetition and this unit just made an appearance in this weeks \\"The Simpsons\\" where Bart gets ahold of Dennis Leary's cell phone....it was being worn by the bully Dolph."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product but not for small ears","review":"This is really a great headset in terms of sound quality and overall. The noise cancelling/wind reduction feature makes a big difference. My only reservation was that it was bulky and heavy on the ear if you have small ears like me. It kept falling off and so I was adjusting it so much that it became dangerous to have on since I was fumbling with it more than i would if I was holding the cell phone by itself. I recommend the Plantronics Discovery 610 if you don't like anythng wrapped around your ear.Overall good product though. Volume was a bit hard to adjust if it was on your ear though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Product","review":"This is my first bluetooth device and after reading the reviews, I must say it does work very well.

I still am not sure what all the beeps are that I hear. But I do have small ears and other hands free devices don't feel comfortable or stay on and this one does.

This product was ADVERTISED AS BEING COMPATIBLE with the Palm Treo 700p Smartphone. So I purchased it. It never worked and I attributed this to the Treo 700p as being the problem. Today I went on the Palm website to the Bluetooth compatibility info for the Verizon Wireless Treo 700p Smartphone. It specifically lists the Plantronics Voyager 510 as NOT being supported by the wireless Treo 700p. I couldn't believe it. I hope it's not too late to rectify this error. Thank you."},{"rating":"1","title":"BlueTooth Headset","review":"purchased this item to use skype and listen to music on my desktop computer. Sound quality on the headset is poor, sounds like a cheap transister radio, i use wired earbud and it is much better, but wired. as far as using skype with the headset goes, there is a second or so of latency, so when having a conversation, there is a lot of waiting, people will answer the phone and think no one is there. the range for the bluetooth is good but that is the only bright point in the setup. i'd wait until the technonogy is better, sound quality is a real bummer. the idea of not having wires is great but the negatives outweigh the positives, i'm back to the wired earbud."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very noisy.","review":"I had this one for several month.

The company I purchased it from through Amazon immediately shipped me another via Priority Mail and the second did work. I will update my review as I use the item, but the low rating is due to needing to get the 2nd one.Things I like so far:-multiple sized ear buds-I can't wear many devices with MP3s, cd players, traditional headsets due to the size of the ear buds-I can wear it for hours and have no problem. I even wear it with my glasses-The battery is lasting a long time and I will charge it to make myself feel better and it will be fully very quickly.-I hear everyone fine and they say I come through clear.-It easily converts to the Left or Right Ear.Things that I do not like:-The on button is such a weird shape and small that it takes work to turn the device on if I am not pushing the button just right."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Quality ... Bad Button Design","review":"I paired this headset with Motorola SLVR L7. I have been very pleased with the sound quality and battery life. Very easy to configure and use once it is turned on.

Technical support from Plantronics support says the problem is with my phone. I told them I 've tried other Bluetooth headsets and devices without this issue. They refused to even examine my Plantronics for any do defects. I had a case opened with Plantronics and was dealing with a very arrogant support peron IMHO. I am not one to roll a person or product under the bus , but I never had such rude support. btw it was not overseas support. Go figure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Item","review":"Great Item. Exactly as advertised. Extremely comfortable. The headset doesn't move around on your ear like previous bluetooth headsets I have used. It comes with 3 different size ear pieces. Sound quality is excellent and everyone I talk to says that it sounds better than the last headset I had. The price was right also. I paid $49 on Amazon and avoided buying it at my wireless company's store for only $99.

It is well worth it. Simple setup to connect to my phone the first time and every morning when I turn on my phone. The ear piece goes in just enough into my ear canal to eliminate outside noise and I hear so much better. People talking to me don't complain of hearing their voice echo as happened with the Mortorola brand. The headset fits better on my ear and I can wear it for long periods of time.

I highly recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product, but made for a man.","review":"I used this a few times and really liked it. Everyone can hear me for a change and I hear them well. It was pretty comfortable to wear. It is really made for a man sized head/ear and not a woman. I am 5'7\\" and it barely stayed on (around my ear), I could not be too active or it fell off. OK for driving or setting and talking, but that's about it. I have long hair and it would continually get wrapped around the earpiece *OUCH*. It comes with 3 different sized foam earpieces which was nice! I used the smallest one. I will be returning this one and trying the Plantronics Voyager 520. I would recomend this product for men or larger/taller women."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit disappointing","review":"I was excited to finally get an ear piece that would allow me to be hands free. I choose this item because of reviews and brand rep. But I was diappointed. I could hear everything just fine and it was easy to use, but the callers on the otherside said there was a lot of static on the line. They had difficulty hearing me. When I went back to just using the phone, everyone could hear me sans static. So...this plantronics sits up on a shelf collecting dust. In retrospect, I should have gotten one of the other ear devices."},{"rating":"2","title":"better than the others","review":"I don't use my headset all the time but when I need it I want it to be good.

It's very comfortable and the buttons are easy to use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comfortable, works well","review":"Headsets with hard plastic ear-hooks do not always fit and can even be painful. The 510 has a soft rubber hook and is very comfortable, and the size and weight are fine.Sound quality, the most important factor for a headset, is excellent both for the earpiece and the speaker.The one-touch button works but here is also a handy rocker switch for volume control. A blinking LED gives feedback that it is on. My only complaint is that the power switch is difficult to press and hold for the 3-4 seconds required."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sound & easy to use","review":"I've had many head sets in the past and this by far is the best. Sound clarity is superior and the control button for volume is easier to access so you won't get mixed-up with the command button."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Wonderful","review":"My husband and I both have this headset. It is absolutely wonderful especially if you have a blackberry. The reception is clear and though when you first see it you think it's big, the 3 earpiece option provides a fit for everyone.

All the great reviews and I picked it based on that. The first one I got the side button did not work, Amazon quickly replaced it. The second one worked great for a few days then it started dropping the connection constantly. Then I had to keep pairing it, then it wouldn't go in to pairing mode even though the buttons seemed to be working. Two strikes and your out. I went back to my trusty Scala 500. The voice quality is not as good as the Plantronics but it works every time and keeps the connection. The Scala is not as comfortable as the Voyager either. I use Plantronics BT for my home office and it is great - don't know why I had these issues with this great headset. Maybe I will try one in a few months."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good and reasonably priced","review":"this earset is great. has plenty of volume to overcome road noise and the speech is very intelligible to others who have to listen to you, even with some wind.

Aside from occasional interference from microwave ovens and other unknown sources, the sound quality has been good.Unfortunately, the ear piece is not secured to the headset and frequently falls off when I pick up, attach, or remove the headset from my ear. Since it is small and somewhat round, it bounces and rolls all over the place. Plus, I frequently use this in my car, so every time it falls off it sends me crawling on my hands and knees to try to find it.I am thinking of using a hot glue gun to attach the ear piece more securely; has anybody else tried that? I figure I will lose about one ear piece every month until I can find a way to attach it better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so happy","review":"I bought 2 of this one for my wife and the other one was for myself. The one that I have doesn't have enough volume and it is bulky and it still does work.

I also had bought them here on Amazon for 40 bucks apiece and now I see them at 137.00, are then nuts!!, I will not buy any product again by Plantronics.

The seller did inform me there would be some dirt and scratches but to me it appeared used. I have a very old Plantronics headset for my cell phone and it didn't look as bad as this one.While I wasn't happy with the actual item the seller responded to my email quickly and credited my account, minus shipping, once she received the headset back. If you are not concerned with appearances of the headset and more concerned with saving money this is the way to go. If you are leary like I was then the new one is the way to go.

I got one for my girlfriend and I can't even tell when she is using it. She loves her's as well.The only drawback that I've found is that its a little bit big and I wish they used the standard USB powersupply power receptical for it so that you could use other chargers with it. These are minor in my mind when compared to how well the unit works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great pairing with LG VX8300 from Verizon!!","review":"The Plantronics Voyager 510 BT headset is a great match with the LG VX8300. I tried the Plantronics Discovery 655 DSP and it was a HORRIBLE match with this phone. If you own the same cell phone that I own, then take my word---Voyager 510 is for you. Sound quality is just like using your phone itself. Pairing is very quick and simple. The over-the-ear design is a little more cumbersome than the Discovery 655, but I quickly got over that once I heard the clear, crisp sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"Peerless Performance","review":"I purchased this item because I knew that Plantronics makes excellent aviation headsets. This bluetooth has far exceeded any of my expectations. I work around noisy machinery and in the open and the audio is clear as a crystal. I have stopped polling the people I talk to because they all respond that the audio on their end is without any of the distortion sometimes associated with other products.The only downside is that often for no apparent reason, the connection is lost, but it usually quickly restores itself.

Could be my big head... I'm not sure.I recently purchased the new model of the Voyager 510, the Voyager 520, and love it!It still has excellent battery life of the 510 (in fact, slightly longer battery life!), excellent noise and wind reduction, and very comfortable, all in a more traditional style.Search for Voyager 520 on Amazon, and check it out, if the 510 didn't quite work for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent voice reception","review":"The reception on both my end and the other end is really great.

I read several reviews before buying the Plantronisc Voyager 510 headset. I am very happy with the buy.Pros: easy to use, responsive buttons and time (very short delay in answering the phone call upon pressing the ans button. I had trouble answering and redialing my calls using the Motorola H350), light, long battery life, easy to wear and switch for left or right ear, clear reception but pick up surrounding noise more than voice at times such as running the tap while using the headset, but other than that no complain of poor reception.Cons: the swivel part that allows left or right wear seems flimsy and loose after some use. No carrying case.Overall, I think it is one of the best bluetooth headsets available and very reasonably priced too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not thrilled, but satisfied","review":"The Voyager 510 works like a charm. Connects easily and fairly quickly, I guess (my first cell phone and my first Bluetooth headset). Range is incredible, although I can't conceive any situation in which I'd need to go more than five feet away from my phone (it's usually in my pocket or on my desk). So far I've gotten great battery life. I like the blue LED.A few downsides:-Frequency range of the headset isn't fantastic. The sound quality of it is good, but not superb. This is more of a problem with Bluetooth than with the headset itself, though.-Ergonomically questionable-- it fits very well once you get it on, but it's a little hard to adjust, especially when it's on your ear. It also feels very flimsy. I wouldn't mind having a little more weight so I could feel safe just putting it in my jeans pocket.-Volume buttons and especially the power buttton are rather hard to fiddle with while it's on your ear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Voice Quality is OK but its little heavy","review":"Voice Quality is OK but its little heavy and ear pains if you wear it for long."},{"rating":"1","title":"Used this for one year-Picks up a lot of background noise-","review":"It picks up a lot of background noise...people I call are always complaining that they can't hear me well and I end up having to switch to phone mode and then they can hear me well.

The replacement has been fine for a a couple of months now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Great, With Minor Issues","review":"I purchased this headset, after reading numerous customer reviews. Turns out the reviews were on the mark. The quality of the headset in terms of construction and sound quality are both superb. People I speak to are not able to tell that I'm using a bluetooth headset. Construction is high-quality as well. The minor problems I read about, are there as well. It takes a bit of practice, and patience to figure out how to get the headset comfortably in place on your ear. Once on however, it's very comfortable, and you may even forget you're wearing it. Also, as has been previously pointed out, the on-off button is very small, so best to turn it on or off when it's off your ear. Overall, it's a great headset for the money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than expected","review":"This wireless headset exceeded my expectations after having tried several others. The reception is perfect. Receivers on the other end say it is as clear or clearer than if I were using the cellphone itself. Background noise is nonexistent. The only complaint I would have with this product is the on/off switch--it is extremely small and difficult to turn on and off with the headset on your ear. But the performance more than makes up for this small shortcoming. Buy it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best headset I've owned","review":"I have owned several Bluetooth cell phone headsets, and the PLT 510 is the best so far. It fits my ear perfectly, I can wear it for hours without noticing it, and it gives great sound. I had no problem syncing it to my iPhone, and although I haven't tried any other devices, I anticipate no problems.I only have two complaints:1. The on-off switch is very small and hard to use. I find that I have to push it with my thumbnail to make it work. If you have smaller fingers, you may have less of a problem.2. Plantronics uses a proprietary connector for charging, while other manufacturers are switching to mini or micro USB. A proprietary charging interface means one more wire to carry with me.In summary, a great purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't like it","review":"Does not fit well for those who were glasses. Had it for 3 months and does not hold a good charge and it has alot of static. Hope I can find a better one that fits and sounds better without static and interuption. Would not recomend.

Boy did I ever miss having it. The ease of use and noise-canceling feature makes this unit almost perfect and still deserving of a five star rating. Good thing for me that as technology marches on, prices drop. I paid almost eighty dollars for my first one. Today, I'm getting the same thing here on Amazon for less than half that amount. Don't waste time looking elsewhere for a better price. I just wasted a full hour-plus comparing prices and as of right now, the best price WITH FREE SHIPPING is on Amazon. Way to go guys!!

The power button has a section that points up and hurt my fingers when trying to turn it on and off. I had a difficult time fitting the headset on my ear, it seemed to fall off frequently. In the end I decided to return this headset, too many negatives."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellant Performer","review":"Bought this as a replacement to a previous generation Plantronics headset. It's easy to use, easy to match with phones. I've paired it with both LG and Blackberry phones with no issues. Sound quality is excellent with no issues. People can hear me clearly on the other side as well and can't tell I'm on a headset. Range is good, but I wouldn't leave the room, tends to quicly degrade after about 15-20 feet from the phone. The earpiece fits well, although it's a bit big behind the ear for those who are smaller, but it's not a big issue. Been using this unit now for aobut 4 months with no issues, definitely would recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"Ordered 3 and trying out now number 3 with hopes it too won't be defective.

Refurbished earpiece that's been crashing around in someone else's earwax come on really that's not what I signed up for here. This was not advertised as a refurbished product, and the first time I have been disappointed with amazon.

The first one was GREAT. So after 3 years it died and I made no hesitation to buy another one. But the new one is HORRIBLE. I literally have to hold my phone in the air above my head for it to work. I cannot move more than 2 feet away from my phone before it quits working. It has a constant static sound in the headset so bad that it is completely useless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great headset","review":"While its size and bulk may dissuade some people, this headset weighs very little and is very comfortable. The volume at which I can hear conversations surprised me--I don't have it at full volume and I can still hear over the noise of freeway traffic, something I have until recently not expected of a headset. It was remarkably easy to link with my Motorola phone and I have not noticed significant battery drain (still running on its first charge!). The only thing keeping this headset from getting 5 stars is the fact that--like all headsets I've tried--it starts to make my ear hurt about two hours after beginning to wear it, even though it's remarkably comfortable for the first hour or so."},{"rating":"2","title":"510 Plantronics bluetooth","review":"Product is working as described - very happy with it - does cut the noise level while using a headset.

Sometimes I can make/receive calls, sometimes I get the \\"two beeps,\\" which means my device is having trouble connecting to my phone. Pretty frustrating. I've tried re-setting/ connecting the two devices multiple times, even to the point where I take the battery out of my cell phone --that sort of thing but nothing seems to make it work properly. But I shouldn't complain too much as I only paid $40 for it and it already seems way outdated. I only purchased it because I like the ear design. Buy something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very comfortable","review":"This headset was replacing a Motorola H350. The H350 was too loose and I felt like it was always about to fall off. I couldn't hear very well either due mostly to the fact that the speaker hangs next to my ear and not in it.The Voyager 510 is very comfortable for an in-ear device. I wear it for hours at a time and simply adjust it occasionally if it is getting uncomfortable. Volume is great and most on the other end of the call cannot tell I am using a headset.The only complaint is that the windscreen doesn't seem to work as well as expected. I am in a fairly windy area and whenever I am outside the person on the call complains of wind noise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as impressed as others","review":"I had been and am currently using a jabra. This was my very first bluetooth device. I was having some difficulty with answering the phone on the actual headset as well as hanging up calls. There's no sense in being hands-free if you can't be hands-free. Having looked on amazon and read the reviews I bought this plantronics device. It gets great reviews.I did not hate it. Initially I was able to answer calls more easily but hanging up was still an issue. The biggest draw-back was that, after 4 months of no complaints regarding sound quality from those with whom I was speaking, I regularly had people telling me that there was fuzz and that they couldn't hear me. I also experienced a lot of noise on my end.I returned to my original jabra, practiced, and now really love it and use it regularly. If I knew which model I would tell you. Sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"I received the headset about two weeks ago. The headset fits fine, paired rather easily but the sound quality is horrible.

The headset itself is a nifty design, with good sound quality and it paired easily to my Tmobile dash smartphone. The only problem is the stupid POWER ON button, you have to have callused fingers to be able to press that thing and after two months of use, it stopped making contact and thereby, the thing is useless, have to throw it away.BTW, another problem is that the rechargeable battery is not removeable, so what are you supposed to do after it's lived it's life?For the above, I have to give it a 2, which is a pity, since the rest is a great design"},{"rating":"1","title":"Plantronics Voyager","review":"Loved the sound quality of this, but didn't stay put securly (especially while on a bike).

Good headset."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bulky, but comfortable","review":"It's bigger than it looks in the photo, but I don't mind because it's very comfortable, which is a big need for me.Besides that, the main con is the incredibly stupid charger with a never before seen connector.

Charger: Fail."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good quality, not very comfortable","review":"I haven't owned any Headsets before, so I don't have much to compare to. This headset is not comfortable enough for me to say that it is perfect. It might be that my ear is not big enough, but it falls out of my ear :)Sound and build quality seems to be good though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good when it works","review":"I bought this headset because I read alot of positive reviews. However, It think I got one of the few lemons. When it works it's great, audio is loud enough even though my wife says I'm deaf and you can't really feel the ear bud in your ear. However, once in awhile, the blue tooth connection will be lost with the phone. I just press the button on the headset to re-establish the connection but that can be a pain when you're in the middle of a conversation and that button is the same one that hangs up the call."},{"rating":"2","title":"Plantronics 510 - comfort not withstanding","review":"I really like the 510 ease of use and form fit. The adjustable volume helps in the different call scenarios. The ear piece does not fit well into my ear allowing other noie to interfere with the call.

He loves it and now I'm going to get me one. Not only does the other party on the other end hear you but it grips to your ear so it doesn't fall off. The other party sounds crystal clear and so do you, which with other bluetoothes makes this a plus. The only thing that my husband says he has a problem with is when he shuts it on and off while driving. He said you have to hold the button for a minute before it does either or action. Other than that he says he highly recommended it. This Bluetooth is one of the best on the market."},{"rating":"1","title":"Downfall","review":"I bought this exact model of Bluetooth headset a couple of years ago, and it was excellent. When it died on me, I ordered another one, but to my great disappointment, Plantronics changed the design of the microphone. The result is that your voice is muffled to the point where people have trouble understanding what you're saying, especially if you're driving a car, since the noise reduction has suffered as well. Plantronics effectively broke this device when they changed the design.I can no longer recommend this headset.UPDATE:Since writing the above, I have come into possession of another, identical headset, which actually works well. After examining other reviews, it seems that the problem is rather a number of 'lemons' floating around in the supply chain, which are not extracted from the batch offered to consumers in a timely manner. Be aware of this, and be prepared to return your purchase as defective if you are not satisfied with its performance."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great headset with a \\"tiny\\" flaw!","review":"I bought this headset for my Verizon RAZR V3c and loved it so much that I recommended it to my family members also. The device comes with soft ear pieces in three different sizes and is very comfortable and fits snugly on either ear. The sound quality is very good and the range is excellent. I have had perfect conversations with this devices over 50 feet away through two walls and a floor. The battery life is excellent and since I use the device only casually a charge lasts me roughly a week. The only thing that bugs me about this headset is its mute/on-off switch which is very tiny and is very hard to press - I have never been able to press it hard enough to mute a conversation while I'm wearing it. All in all, the best headset you can purchase which works wonderfully and won't make you feel like a borg."},{"rating":"1","title":"Alas it had to be returned","review":"I had high hopes for this product. I have had a lot of success with Plantronics headsets in the past. However, this headset would connect to a Jabra BT adapter, a LG PM-325 phone, and a Kennsington BT USB adapter. The received voice quality was good. However, the transmitted voice quality would go very poor and break up. My friends reported that they were only getting portions of my transmitted voice the rest being a metallic sounding robot voice.

A month or two later and the second one did the same thing. This time I know I was very careful about unplugging it since I knew it was delicate.This model works very well, if you baby it whenever you plug in the charging cable.

It's comfortable and has good talk time too.But I have problems where it drops connection all the time while in standby. It also frequently will pick up a call, but have no sound. the phone has no sound either. So I have to disconnect the thing and call the person back without the headset. This can be a major pain.The other problem I have is that the conversation is very half duplex. I can talk, or listen. But due to the lag from the headset and the cellphone combined, there's lots of stepping on other people's words back and forth. I think this is due to the noise cancel feature.I would used this headset all the time if not for those problems. As it is, I only use it when wire and hands free is priority.

Problems with the voice dial feature as well as connecting with the phone just drove me crazy. So much so that I actually tore the unit in half (not recommended). Perhaps the unit was not designed to work with the phone I had, I'm not sure.

It has great sound quality, both for me and whomever I am speaking to. It's easy to get on and reasonably comfortable, so that I sometimes end up wearing it and forgetting that it's there.It also easily converts from one side to the other, which has been a big help to meThe downsides for me are that A: the ear pieces don't really fit. The small is too small and the medium is much too big, so I put up with some looseness, but that also reduces the pressure in my ears.And B: that awful power button. REALLY, there is no excuse for something that bad these days, it has taken me quite a bit of struggle to find a way to live with that, and that is really not excusable these days and at that price.Over all, though ,I am really pleased to at last find a bluetooth headset that fits well enough and functions just as it should"},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely Disappointed","review":"I have always used Plantronics. Upon reading reviews of this model I decided to roll with it. It is very difficult to put on with one hand and then I would be forced to fix the microphone in order for people to hear me. This causes a problem when driving, which being in sales is a deal breaker. I would say that half my conversations, people continued to say that couldn't hear me. I also had problems syncing with my Motorola Q. Several times on the road, it just simply would not sync. Also, that last Bluetooth I had would beep once it's connected, with this it did not beep and would not know if the device was connected or not until I answered the phone. This could be a problem with the phone rather than the Bluetooth as this is the first Bluetooth I've synced with the Moto Q. Not sure.However, I cannot recommend this product at all just simply by the ease of use and conversations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very comfortable","review":"From the first time putting the Voyager 510 headset on, it was the most comfortable headset that I have ever tried on.

Did not shut down even after 4hrs of constant use on PS3. Clarity is great, but the only thing that was confusing was the Multipoint feature. Found out that both of my bluetooth devices,PS3 & cell, had to be on at the same time to switch between devices. It remembers the last paired device and will not automatically link unless you re-connect to the other device.

It also holds a charge for several days at a time, however, I do turn it off when I'm not in the car. My only criticism is that since I don't leave it on my ear all the time while I'm driving, it's sometimes a little tricky getting it on my ear when the phone is ringing and I'm trying to drive.

I am able to hear others and they can hear me, so other than the bulky size there's not much more I could ask for. It is also surprisingly comfortable. Ultimately I will probably also get a headset w/ noise cancellation as I travel a lot and callers have commented that they could hear significant background noise in airports and train stations, but otherwise this works very well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Headset","review":"I get a constant buzzing noise in the background when using this headset. Also, the microphone picks up everything so the person I'm talking to always comments on the noise even if I'm not in a noisy area. I bought this headset to go with the Treo 650 based on a recomendation from a friend and the reviews on this website. But, much to my disappointment, it is practically useless for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Echo for other person","review":"I tried two of these headsets and it was horrible for the person I was speaking to.

Annoying to say the least and THANK YOU Amazon for being so amazing and taking both headsets back!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Plantronics Voyager 510","review":"I was drawn to this bluetooth device because it is made by Plantronics and my other Plantronics devices have been very good.

I now have an Aliph Jawbone and it is not as comfortable but far surpasses the Plantronics in voice and call quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"great headset","review":"This is a great headset (my third one). great voice quality, volume control.

After several weeks of use, the bluetooth product stopped working completely. It was fully charged, but wouldn't turn on and work. I finally had to buy a new bluetooth(jawbone).

I am VERY disappointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mouth piece came off after 6 months normal use","review":"The mouth piece cover came off after 6 months of normal use. It seems like some poor quality adhensive has been used to attach the mouth piece cover to the main body. See the custom pics I have uploaded on what happened to my device. Audio quality suffers badly without the mouth piece cover. I can tape the cover to the main body, but since it is under warranty, I will try to send it back. The device still works other wise. I will update with the outcome of trying to send this back to the reseller.6 months is too short a life-span for a blue tooth device. 2 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Headset for the Money","review":"So far I've had this headset for about 3 months and I must say it is working quite well. I had one minor glitch in the beginning but was able to call the plantronics 800 number and get help immediately. The fit is very nice, I have used it on both ears and don't even realize I have it on. The sound is also pretty good, although you also want to make sure the volume on your phone is up too, as they work in concert. Overall a very good headset for the price. I couldn't imagine spending any more than this and I'm pleased with what I got for the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"HappySmiles","review":"First Bluetooth product and I'm very satisfied.

It's comfortable to wear. It's loud and the person I'm talking to can always hear me. The charge time is good. The headset does disconnect sometimes.

I gave it to my girlfriend and it works GREAT on her blackberry curve."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible headset; people complain about the noise","review":"Headset has quite bad microphone; people complain much more than with my old Motorola Headset about the voice quality and amount of noise. Not worth the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disconnets a lot","review":"It is a good headset. It has a major flaw though. For no reason, and at random, it disconnects from my phone. This happens even on a full battery, and even if the headset is in the same pocket as the phone.I set up a hot key on my phone just to go to the Bluetooth connection.The problem is, sometimes the phone rings, you put the headset on, and no sound. You have to get used to reconnecting a lot.Don't buy this headset. Buy something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont use it too much now.....","review":"I bought this item after seeing so many positive reviews primarily for using it while driving. Even though I myself do not \\"hear\\" any problems at my end, numerous times I have heard from the person at the other end that they could not hear me properly.I had been using a wired headset for so many years, and maybe my expectation was higher because of that.I also used the headset at home and at other times when just walking, and it has worked. Therefore, the headset did not serve the intended purpose of use while driving, although i still use it off and on.I have a Sprint Mogul phone. Maybe the bluetooth driver on that phone is not good - which could be part of the problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for the money","review":"I purchased this product and love it. Only one person had a hard time hearing me at first (he was also using a blue tooth headset) but I realized that if I turn the unit up (almost straight up) that everyone heard me crystal clear. Great unit for the money and I only have to charge it once every few days. Use it on average of 1.5 hours a day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bang for the buck!","review":"It works exactly the way it is supposed to. The sound is very clear on both ends. I have not had anyone complain on the other end about the sound. It is a little bigger then other bluetooth headsets, BUT I can overlook that because it is very comfortable to wear. I have talked on it for more then one hour straight without a problem. I have it paired with a Nokia phone. I liked it so much, I bought another as a gift. I usually keep it in my pocket or at home if I am not using it. I find it dorky to be walking around the mall with it in my ear as if I can't miss a call."},{"rating":"2","title":"Generally a good product","review":"People that I talk to while using this headset have all agreed that it is very clear and they could not tell whether I was using a headset or just on my cell phone. However, the sound on my end seems a little muffled, it is not as clear as it is had I not been using my headset. Also, I'm not sure if it is just me, but I have a hard time making the headset stay on, it just does not fit as well for me. Overall, it is nice to have a hands-free headset, but if you are looking to purchase one, maybe you should look around & check out newer models perhaps."},{"rating":"2","title":"Performance","review":"I have found the product very easy to use.

I used to have problem with the other party hearing me with other bluetooth headsets, but not with this one. I also can hear the other party very well and clearly. My only issue is that the ear piece starts to hurt my ears after I wear it for more than 20-30 minutes. The Motorola was so comfortable I'd forget I had it on after awhile. With this one, you definitely know it. It's because if you want the ear piece to be over the ear canal to get the best sound, it has to pull away from the back part of the ear because the rest of the unit is behind the ear. So the tension eventually starts to hurt. I pull the earpiece out to relieve this problem, but then it feels less secure on the ear plus you have to put it back in when you make/receive a call."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, not what I expected","review":"The ear piece and loop are very large and cumbersome and difficult to adjust for both ears.Seemed ok at first but kept losing my bluetooth connection this Treo and finally crapped out completely.Will return and try again."},{"rating":"2","title":"So far so good","review":"I've been using this product for a few months now with my Nokia 6620 and mostly in the car. I bought it upon reading the good reviews about it and I agree with them. As opposed to the one I had before, I can hear people clearly and mostly people can hear me clearly as well. It connects to my phone automatically, which is convenient. Easy to charge and it lasts long. I just wish the speaker portion could come closer to my mouth so people could hear me more clearly and I wouldn't have to talk loudly at times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally a Great Product","review":"I have tried many many bluetooth headsets. This one is fantastic. It's comfortable, doesn't move around your head when you move, it's loud enough to hear very well, and the noise cancellation actually works. I highly recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just an all around perfect headset","review":"I bought this headset primarily for my Playstation 3 and it works perfectly. I can hear the others talking very clearly and they can hear me clearly as well. I get no buzzing or static of any kind when I am using it playing Resistance. The pairing process took about 10 seconds and was very easy.Then I decided to try it with my phone and I get the exact same results as my PS3.It is very comfortable on and in my ear. The soft ear bud makes it very comfortable in my ear and even while in my ear for hours my ear doesnt hurt at all. The headset sits on the outside very easy too and after a while I forget its even in my ear.I highly recommend this headset to anyone gor use on a Phone or a PS3 especially for this price. You wont find it at any Best Buy or Circuit City for less than $100. GREAT DEAL."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Headset but Missing Parts","review":"This is a really nice headset and it works well, but the users guide stated the headset should be charged with the \\"supplied wall charger\\". The one I purchased came in a sealed retail box, but did not have a wall charger. So beware that when you purchase this item, you have to purchase the wall charger separately."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best cancer inducing invention ever!","review":"I love this earpiece.

Its great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wishful thinking","review":"I was really hoping that this headset would work with my LG VX8300. I was told that once I upgrade my software on my phone, it would work. Well, it doesn't. The static continues to come through. The phone loses the signal on this headset constantly. And if someone tries to call in...forget it! 4 out of 5 times, the phone won't pair correctly to answer a call. A shame really.On a good note, it pairs easily. It charges extremely quickly and feels comfortable on the ear. I'll probably have to sell mine off. No point trying to kick a dead horse."},{"rating":"2","title":"great product","review":"I use this thing every day. I listen to audio books and podcasts on it. I am using a nokia 6133.

The first one was stylish but had terrible sound quality. This one is much better. The reason I am giving it 4 instead of 5 stars is that it doesn't have noise canceling technology so I still can't make calls with the sunroof open."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't like it","review":"I bought it and returned it two days later. I had to re-pair it everytime I wanted to use it, Sound was great, but out of all the headsets i've owned I never had to pair it after the original pairing"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good","review":"I got this as a gift last Christmas (2009) and it has served me well. As my job requires me to drive all day, and I am constantly in and out of my vehicle, I need something that works well as mobile communication is imperative. This fits the bill. The sound is good, it stays charged for a long time, it is light and easy to carry. My only compliant is that it can be a little difficult to initially place in the ear and until properly seated it can be uncomfortable and can fall out. But get it in correctly and it is problem free. Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"best bluetooth on the market","review":"My husband wanted a bluetooth so we did our research and based on the reviews, opted for this model. Turns out it was the right decision. The noise cancelling is fantastic, considering he's tried a few other models and I couldn't hear him while he used it in his car, windows down. But with this 510, I can hear every word. And he can hear me. I own the newer 520, which works well for me (it's a bit smaller but doesn't have the noise cancelling as good as this 510 but since I drive with my windows up, it works well for me). We've bought one for our son and just bought 2 more - one to replace hubby's 2nd 510 (he's pretty rough on it and the rubbery part that goes over the ear tends to eventually wear out for him) and the other to set aside just in case Plantronics opts to stop manufacturing this model. We've found it's good to get extra little covers for the microphone - over time they tend to fall off or get lost (did I mention hubby's kinda rough on his bluetooth?)."},{"rating":"1","title":"A product who's quality has declined over the years...","review":"The quality of the Voyager 510 has declined over the past few years. I got two in 2007 and really liked them. Bottom line up-front: the earpiece speaker sound on the new ones becomes distorted once the volume is about half way up. At lower volumes it's not a problem, but get it to half way or above and the speaker sounds tinny and static-y. I still have one of my 2007 models and the side by side comparison to the new one is painfully obvious. It was so bad on the new one that I thought it was defective so I exchanged it for another: same problem. I'm very disappointed in what was once a great product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good choice for the money","review":"I read a lot before buying this headset and was kind of nervous because some bad reviews I read but I must say it was worthy because this headset is really good, I can hear perfectly when using it, it doesn't hurts my ear or anything, I don't use it like everyday so the battery has last for almost a week so far.

It connected flawlessly with my Motorola E815 phone and all the voice commands seem to work well. Range is fine as long there are no walls, obstructions, etc. between you and the phone. Adjusting the volume and turning the headset on and off is a bit cumbersome, however I turn it on before I put it on my ear and once you have the volume adjusted I have never needed to change it. Voice clarity on the headset is great and I have never had the party I'm talking to even recognize I'm using a handsfree headset. Battery life seems to be at least as long as the phone, either in talk mode or standby. Undoubtedly probably the best $46 bluetooth headset on the market."},{"rating":"2","title":"Plantronics 510 - Very clear","review":"I just bought a Plantronics 510 to use with my Motorola Razr. It has been very clear and plenty loud. Others can hear me very well. I was a little leary when buying a blue tooth headset after hearing so many complaints about clarity.

With few biographies of Yo-Yo Ma on the market, Mr. Attanas' book fills a big void, and it fills it well. Not only are Yo-Yo's life and musical career interesting in and of themselves, but the book is beautifully and succintly written in an almost lyrical way. The book is nicely organized with short chapters that tell you everything you would want to know.Whether you're a fan of classical music or just looking for something interesting to read, I would strongly recommend this book to everyone, young and old alike!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm returning this item!!!","review":"Please don't waste your time or money with this book... I breezed through this book in no time at all, as it was printed in the hugest font possible and was a measly 150 pages or so. It left so many holes in Mr. Ma's life, and I barely learned anything about him. This book really did NOT do him justice, and I don't understand why there hasn't been a better biography of him published.There were also no photos/pictures in the biography, and the cover had a hideous drawing of Mr. Ma that was the complete opposite representation of his loveliness.So save your money, because after I read this biography I was tempted to just write one myself on Mr. Ma.

It covers more diseases than you will see or have heard of and then gives gives you information on how to do a postmordem autopsy and tells you what variations mean what diseases. Good book, I would recommend it by itself or as a second book to Storey's Guide to Raising Chickenns. It basically covers how to identity and then react when things go wrong with your birds. It runs the entire chicken liftime from egg to egg or meat producer to death.My only problem is I would like to see this book updated especially in the disease category. Unfortunately it does not mention West Nile disease which has recently become a problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great general purpose chicken book.","review":"I've had pet chickens for years, but got this book from the library to update my knowledge for a backyard chicken class I was teaching.

I highly recomend it for anyone that is or is going to raise chickens. Whenever you have a problem you just turn to the diognoses charts, match the symptoms and the age, and find out what it is. You then go the back and find the disease, and then it tells you how to treat it, prevent it, if there's any human health risk and much MUCH more!! It also tell you EVERYTHING else you need to know on how to raise them.

The depression era is a rough time for this Virginia family and you can see why. The Waltons brings you a family that lives on Waltons Mountain in Virginia. It shows the struggle and heartache it can be to live in these times. It also shows how much fun that John-boy Walton has (Earl Hamner) and how he makes the most of the times.

I was beyond the average books, and wanted more! Although this book has lots of fancy words, the actual information is not anywhere near insightful. In fact I knew most of the information from another behavior book I had read. The research is horribly out of date, and who knows what exciting new findings have come up in the past 20 years -- certainly not Dr. Beaver.

What a piece of garbage - I'm so mad. I needed 3 of these for the upgrade and now I wish I had my old broken openers back :("},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure Junk.

Mind you, a sealed garage, no pets, no ventilation and doors alarmed and yet to walk out to my car parked in the driveway in the morning and to see the two 100w bulbs in the garage door opener glowing away, presumable all night, it's extremely frustrating.Please look elsewhere for the switch because this one will only cause you anger and frustration."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wireless Lan Utility Error","review":"After only a few days use, the Wireless Lan stopped functioning and I recieved an error of \\"ENUM Interface Failed\\". I called customer service at Toshiba only to be told that \\"this is a known problem and a software fix will be available in the future\\". Well the future can be a LONG, LONG time. From the number of used e755's for sale on E-bay, I don't think I am the only disatisfied customer!It is no wonder that the price is dropping on this model!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Welp...","review":"I just got the new e755 yesterday. I was the proud owner of the e310 so this is a bit of a jump for me in models. So far I like the unit, as far as hardware goes I am impressed. With a little fumbling around with settings and WEP I was able to get my PDA online with a few minutes. The speed of the WiFi is great, though loading graphically intensive websites can really slow it down. Java Script doesn't seem to work well on IE for PocketPC 2002 OS, but that's not Toshiba's problem. I don't see the need for the CF slot. The CF slot is taking up a lot of room and making the unit more bulky. All in all the Toshiba e755 makes for a great portable PDA. With its fast Wireless connectivity, 400 MHz CPU at 200 MHz bus, and 96 Megs of ram (32 for os) I think it's fair to say the Toshiba e755 is a powerful PDA."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy So Far","review":"I purchased the e755 several days ago. So far, I'm really pleased with it. The display lives up to the hype - it really is that good. It's crisp and bright, real easy on the eyes. The wi-fi is fairly easy to set up and use. I like the ActiveSync over the Palm's Hot Sync (I use one at work). WindowsXP Explorer treats the e755 as just another drive and I can copy/paste files back and forth easily. Am also happy with the battery performance so far. As for the negatives, The master power switch and the wi-fi switch on the bottom are too small and too close together. I already wiped out the memory once by moving the wrong one. However, I had done a full backup to Flash the night before and the Restore function worked flawlessly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Toshiba does not support their PDA's properly","review":"Based on the track record from Toshiba on their PDA line, customers can expect to NOT receive support for the many bugs and problems seen in their PDA products. The e740 has too many unresolved bugs to list. The e75X series has been suffering from \\"enum errors\\", dead units within days and other problems requiring owners to keep swapping units trying to get one that works.Toshiba's horrible record of support on their PDA line is the reason to avoid this product. They refuse to address the problems on their units and quickly orphan owners of units that are less than a year old. They prefer to make users pay full price to get newer models so they can resolve issues or run the llatest software from Microsoft.Buying a Toshiba PDA should not be considered a long term solution as you are liable to be left with a problematic and unsupported unit in a relatively short amount of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money on this device","review":"This PDA seems like a good deal, but its not. Unless you buy the extended warranty and you don't mind dealing with the many quirks of this pockpet pc, do not get it. First, the WiFi was difficult to use and I could connect, even when only 8 feet away from the router.Also, after a couple of days, the screen would not react to tapping, it became useless. I'm not saying that this particular thing might happen to you, but there are quite a few things that can go wrong simply because it has so many features.So if you want to avoid this frustration, just go with an IPAQ or DELL AXIM. They are much more reliable and have much better customer support."},{"rating":"1","title":"E755 is bad for Gaming, bad buttons!","review":"You cannot press more than one button at a time, so this makes playing any kind of game impossible. This is especially unforgivable since this was a major failing of the e740, an earlier Toshiba unit. If you do not like to play games, and firmly belive you never will, then this is the pocket pc for you. However, if you think you might ever play a game on you pocket pc, avoid this one like it has SARS. My three year old palm pilot is better for games than this thing.However, besides gaming, this unit has it all, wifi, lots of memory, a fast processor an every option except for good buttons...its a shame because for me that means I have a expensive paper weight."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you are used to Palm, forget it","review":"Over all it appears to be a good machine. However I returned it three days after I purchased it. I'm used to Palm so that may be the reason but I found it big and clunkie and slow compared to the Palm. Also it was fairly unstable with an interface that was not intuitive. I ran it side by side with a Tungsten C and at that point returned the Toshiba and bought the Palm. If you are used to PPCs you'll problably love it but if you are used to Palm I really don't think it's worth the money and the Palm is just a much better machine with a better OS."},{"rating":"2","title":"great cookbook - note this is the British version tho","review":"I love this cookbook. A friend gave it to me and I've used it and enjoyed it over the years.This year, I decided to give this book to a family member for his birthday. I mulled over giving the paperback or the hardback version and I elected to go with the hardback because I thought he'd use it a lot. I gave the one with the artichoke in the white \\"colander\\" on the cover:VERDURA: Vegetables Italian Style (hardcover published by Grub Street Cookery).When I gave the gift, they asked me for my favorite recipe in the book. When I went to point it out -- I was a little surprised to see that my favorite recipe called for courgettes instead of zucchini and rocket instead of arugula. This copy is the BRITISH version, which is perfectly understandable except when it isn't.I would recommend the version of the book I have over the one I gaveVERDURA: Vegetables Italian Style (hardcover published by Ecco).Be aware."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointingly limited by format","review":"Numbers 3 and 4 of this series were updates of specific topics, much like the \\"current veterinary therapy\\" series. This, like Editions 1 and 2, attempts to cover all of zoo medicine in one volume. As this is a rapidly expanding body of knowledge, it is no longer really possible to fit into a single volume. There are very brief overviews of each species without enough depth present- this is not due to the authors, but the format. Especially disappointing is the apparent limitation on the number of references for each section. Providing references on where to look for further information would have made this book much more useful. Hopefully future editions will either show a return to the topic oriented format of 3 and 4, be a multi-volume set containing enough information to be useful, or at least contain sufficient references to be useful as a good bibliography."},{"rating":"1","title":"And RAF makes another trash pile","review":"Honestly-- another piece to add to the trash pile. This is pornography to every level. What a waste of time. Usually you can at least make a few jokes and get a few laughs out of a bad film... it was impossible to even find enjoyment in that attempt.

The acting was terrible and the writing was substandard at best. It was so disjointed and bizarre. No character developement. It seemed as though the whole of the movie was flimsy bridge to make it to the final act in the cabin which, I admit, was hot but soon got very boring. It seemed like this director was really wanting to do porn more than anything else. The sad part was I saw great potential, but it was all so terribly wasted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Excuse for an Educational Publication","review":"Much of the information in this book in innacurate and misleading.

So I bought 2 of the XMat's and a long \\"stay off\\" mat that beeps really loud when they get on the furniture, to start training for when the new items arrived.I want to tell you that I LOVE the Xmat! The dogs have figured out how to get around the \\"stay off\\" mat by just pulling it off the couch with their teeth, so in the morning it is laying on the floor. But not the Xmat. They do not go near the chairs. It is just not comfortable for them to lay on. My cat also will not lay on the seat, although she has figured out to jump from the seat to the back of the chair and now lays on the top. I'm ok with that for now, but for the new furniture will probably buy a few more to lay on the top as well. Great product.

I order online alot and have never heard of this type of shipping, especially a book. I am assuming it is in someone's backpack and they are walking it across the country to deliver it to me personally. I ordered two other books at the same time and received them within the week.

Mamis discusses not only market indicators so you can better time buys and sells, but explains what happens on the trading floor and how the professionals -- the \\"they\\" many investors refer to grudgingly -- benefit from herd psychology. After reading this you will better understand why the \\"average investor\\" is more likely to lose than win, and why many people, in fact, subconsciously prefer to lose. Mamis has an easy style which reflects his many years of investing experience -- it is not a dry, academic discusson of the market.Along with \\"Reminiscences of a Stock Operator\\" and a couple of others, this is one of the best and most informative books I've read about the market."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best trading book I've ever read","review":"I have been an investment professional for over 20 years. I have read dozens of books--most long before the flood of \\"you to can be a super trader\\" trash of the 1990s. This is the best one. Mamis is an original and independent thinker. The book deals with psychology, tactics, technical indicators. His \\"How to Buy\\" is not nearly as good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Book","review":"Though Justin writes in a easygoing, breezy style and with humor, this is a book you need to take time with and go back and over with to really get what he is teaching here. If you've spent much time trading or investing you can sense that the author has seen and traded almost every market scenario and figured out what happened and what works and how best to give yourself a chance to succeed and make money. It's not written in a complicated fashion nor has much math but there is tons of insight that can easily be overlooked. My only small issue is wondering whether the continued technology advances in investing and trading make any of this irrelevant, but it's unlikely that much has or will change because he's really writing about patterns based on human nature and simply learning how to be disciplined in managing risk and cultivating the advantages even a small investor can have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Story Teller","review":"I think it's a novel about some studya cases.

On this record they do the same except it's all drowned in studio washes of conventional, contemporary pop music ranging from new-age Enyaism to blah-rock. Casey's beautiful vocals are not trusted by the studio so soulful new-age echo (oh, those lonesome Irish moors!) is added. Musicians are credited with playing instruments on the record. Perhaps. A synthesizer might have produced the same sounds. An unimaginative, unambitious record.

Basically, it is formatted like a dictionary with various business-related vocabulary listings and their definitions. Usage applies to the spelling and capitalization of the listings. My expectations were that this book was similar to a Chicago Manual of Style within a business writing context that includes recently created words germane to the business world. Unfortunately, it isn't useful in this regard. For example, if you want to find out how to use colloquial business language such as \\"leverageable\\", you probably won't have much luck with this text as such words appear to be absent....Lastly, the organization leaves something to be desired as the usage topics such as Abbreviations are mixed in with the vocabulary entries, which essentially is the entire book. I really see very little value in acquiring this book..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A winner!","review":"Yes, some of the recipes DO take some time, and others take less, but there's plenty of variety here for everyone. Rodgers often recommends taking certain additional preparation steps, and that's what makes his recipes SOOOOOOO much better than some of the awful things that a few of the manufacturers have published. I especially like Hot Fudge Spooncake, and prepare it regularly--it's great to come home to the smell of of freshly baked dessert! For those recipes that require a precise cooking time, I just use a $4 lamp and appliance timer that I picked up at my local hardware store to turn the pot on while I'm at work--problem solved! Now that I have this book, my slow cooker stays on top of the counter and gets a regular work out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good slowcooker cookbook.","review":"The recipes in this cookbook are easy and healthy. The only reason I gave this cookbook 4 stars is due to the fact that the recipes are primarily for a 3 1/2 quart or 4 quart slow cooker. I prefer to use a larger slow cooker since I like to freeze part of the meal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great tastes!","review":"Nicely written recipies, easy to understand and no fancy ingredients or techniques needed.

Yes!","review":"This book really got me excited about using my new slow cooker! True, the meals don't exactly \\"cook themselves,\\" but boy, are they fantastic! Rick Rodgers really knows his stuff! His comments are both entertaining and insightful, and his recipes are superb. Thanks to Rick, I have come to view my slow cooker not so much as a time-saving device, but as more of a general cooking appliance, and a great one. If you want to get the absolute best possible results from your slow cooker, this book is a MUST!"},{"rating":"2","title":"For the gourmet or foodie with a slow cooker","review":"The slow cooker is another kitchen tool. I noted that several of the previous reviewers criticized this book for being too difficult and requiring too much work. I disagree. Delicious, richly-flavored food will take some effort. In the case of Mr. Rodgers' recipes, the effort is minimal and definitely worth it when you taste the results. This was a wonderful cookbook for me because it provided many ways to use the slow cooker as a tool to maximize flavor and minimize prep time. I learned how to use the slow cooker as a bain marie from this book.This book is NOT for those who want to throw all the ingredients into the slow cooker, plug it in, and then return to the resulting gruel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much trouble...too little payoff","review":"I can appreciate that Mr. Rodgers is trying to perk up slow cooker cuisine, but the whole point of a slow cooker to me is to save time and trouble. Too many of these recipes call for much more preparation than I have time for in the beginning, and extra steps at the end. The recipes I've tried have had mixed results. I have had to tweak all of them to make them more appealing for my family. My family will indeed be \\"ready and waitng\\" while I have to do all the extra steps for these recipes! It was dissapointing overall."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pot Size Matters!","review":"I received a nice, 6 quart slow cooker for Christmas, and ordered this book for it as I wanted recipes a bit more than \\"dump in one pot.\\" Well, I wish the description had mentioned that nearly all recipes in this book are for a 3.5 quart slow cooker! And it emphasizes how using the right size pot is important. As I'm not going out to buy yet another slow cooker, this book is a big disappointment for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"very time consuming set up.","review":"If I wanted to be that complex I would forget the slow cooker, and just cook the traditional way. This book is a disappointment. Most of the recipes sound great, but my schedule doesn't really permit me to spend two hours prepping then have everything the crock pot with 8 hours slow cooking time then another 30 minutes of hands on prep before dinner. This book needs another title. It's title is deceiving.

When I purchased my Rival Crockpot from Target less than a year ago, I wondered if I'd actually use it. With several books on the subject, I find myself pulling out Rodgers' cookbook often. The red beans and rice recipe is worth the cost of the book alone -- a good rice and dab of creme fraiche and you're a star. From the goulash to the pot roasts to the chicken recipes, I've been really pleased with the flavors,textures and taste of everything I've made. I don't agree with other reviewers who say prep takes a lot of time. True, these are not \\"dump ingredients and run\\" recipes, but the time to prepare is pretty modest relative to the outcome. This cookbook's definitely worth a try."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for a working mom","review":"I've owned this cookbook for years, and it's one of few that I use on a regular basis.

It is not the prep times before or after preparing a dish, that is to be expected with anything you cook unless you pull a frozen dinner out of a package. It was the overly done up recipes, sounding too much like fine gourmet cooking. I want down home, tasty, simpler recipes, meaning ingredients I normally have on hand and ones my whole family will eat without begging.

I take one daily, then take a second, open it, divide it in three and apply it topically to both of my nipples using a water soaked q-tip then, using the same method, put it in my newborn's mouth. We have both seen great improvement and I believe we have beat this horrible infection!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Help for IBS","review":"I've been taking Culturelle for several years now.

I'm not sure if it's the die off of bad bacteria or this particular strain, but I would approach with caution if you suffer from IBS or IBD.

Eventually I read all of the reviews here and someone mentioned VSL#3 and they sell it on Amazon but do not buy it except from the pharma company. It needs to be cold. Just got mine today. It is not cheap and it's OTC. They ship FedEx. Take from 2-8 pills a day comes in 60 count specifically for IBS. The next one VSL#3 DS is a script but I doubt my insurer will approve but if I can rid of the pain it will be worth it. 3 others prescribed by the second doctor did not work.

I have just finished chapter 16, but to this point I am disappointed. Instead of identifying some of man's sin struggles, all responsibility has been put on the church. The church is all wrong and men are just right the way that they are.I can't believe all of the scriptural values that are made fun of and thrown to the wayside. I wouldn't be suprised if the fruit of the Spirit are thrown out next for being not \\"manly\\"Love, joy, peace, longsuffering, goodness, kindness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control.These are the kinds of things that the author claims to be not masculine.

What about hispanic or other cultures? The author really did not think too well about how diverse our nation is and did not acknowledge that he sees beyond a white-middle class culture.Besides the negative, I do think he brings out a very important discussion. I just wish he was more culturally aware since he most likely is preaching to a choir that already hates anything that is too creative and is looking for validation."},{"rating":"1","title":"church marketing trash.","review":"Murrow gives a wake up call -- with 61% of the adult attendance of our churches female, and even higher numbers for volunteers, clearly the system is broken. Or more precisely, as we come to realize in reading this book, it is perfect for the results we are getting.Why is Christianity the only major faith system in the modern world that is dominated by females? Islam and Judaism are balanced without the gender gap we see in Christianity, so we can't accept that the gender gap is due to women being more \\"spiritual\\".But it is obvious Murrow is a first time writer. And this book, while pointing to the issue, treats the issue as a \\"marketing\\" issue. It engenders a solution approach that is purely a whitewash. Throw a new coat of paint on the church, change the vocabulary, and let's go? I've engaged in discussions with fans of this book, and it is clear they are trapped in the system so deep they can't see that yet another church growth type solution is not going to fix the issue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific observations on 'missing men'","review":"I really liked this book.

I would have given it five stars but it read fairly stiff for my tastes. But if the content connects with the men that need to hear it, I'd amend my rating.Bravo for tackling such a tough topic in the feminized church!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great book to pass on to Christian leaders!","review":"A worthwhile read, something I will reccomend that pastors and church leaders read. The author does an excellent job of pointing out a problem that many don't even know exists- church is geared toward women. The sermons, worship songs, and Sunday schools all meet the needs and wants of women more than they do of men. He points these things out in a non-judgmental way as well. Buy and read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but wordy","review":"Overall this book is great and raises some interesting issues facing the modern church structure today. My largest complaint about the book is that the first third to half could be summed up in one or two chapters. The author painfully slams his point home continually over and over again. It got to where I almost put the book down because it seemed to only criticize with an overwhelming amount of statistics and offer no solutions or suggestions. It was not until I reached the second half of the book where I found it useful. Here the author sites examples he found in various churches, still slamming those statistics, but at least with some suggestions on how to make church more appealing to men while not excluding the women. Needless to say it is a challenging topic to cover and I appreciate his book. I would have given it five stars if he had been more concise through the first half of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is POINTLESS, MEANINGLESS,","review":"This book is only good for firestarter.The tone of the book is such that makes the auther sound like he just \\"wanted to write a booK\\". Sort of like somebody who speaks just to hear the sound of their own voice.The points in the book are shallow and worldly. Not once is there an exhortation for men to be drawn to Christ. The theme of the book is program, psychology, male vs. female differences, etc. Christ, Who is the true reason for a church \\"service\\", isn't even considered in this guys book.The men he speaks of in his book do not like going to church because they are probably not even Christians. But then he offers no effective suggestions to remedy this.The book is a waste of money, time, and even the effort to write this review. I decided that I would go through the effort to save others from the experience.THIS BOOK IS SHALLOW."},{"rating":"1","title":"bogus book","review":"What is overlooked is the historical record: male clergy have always attracted a lot of women and fewer men to church. His convictions are based on a lot of assumptions, one being that men are 'created' to lead and rule over other genders; white men over other ethnicity/races?! This 'ruler-ship' mentality is the original sin. We need men to PARTNER with women and stop trying to assert their chest-thumping-aggressive-territorial dance. Grow up guys! You are MEN by modeling Jesus. He was fully human and fully divine. Our Savior to follow, a man of compassionate, caring, fierceness, who gave up POWER for the sake of the powerless.

I thought that I was getting an updated version of the book. It was very disappointing see that it closer to a REWRITE than an update. The chapters don't match. The narrative doesn't match. The flow doesn't match. The content was so different, and so much from the first book was completely left out. For example, the first book has the phrase \\"Dangerous Men\\". I couldn't find the phrase in the \\"update\\". Looks like the author \\"feminized\\" this release. Very disappointing. If you need an ebook version, buy a paperback and scan to a searchable PDF.

While there are no huge revelations or surprises and the topic really isn't that new, it will open your eyes to some issues that are unique to men and church.

Otherwise, hit your knees. (Luke 10:2) Then ask yourself,\\"What did Jesus do?\\"No amount of mental gymnastics, programs, puzzles, tests, giftings or gimicks will get anyone engaged.

There are valid points, to be sure. However, there are so many sweeping generalizations, assumptions about what is \\"masculine\\" and \\"feminine\\" (something the Bible nowhere defines but usually come from pop culture) that I find it offensive to men as well as women. He assumes that women love church and men do not. I think the problems of the church affect both sexes, but there are reasons for women to stay that may not apply to men. In short, this book is full of cliches and assumptions, and it is designed to appeal to the current fad of \\"manly\\" Christianity. What we need, from both genders, is mature Christianity. Save your money. Look at Jesus--the perfect example for both men and women."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing book. Powerful solutions.","review":"Growing up in the church, I was used to a lot of things mentioned in the book. However, I was certainly not comfortable with some of those things but struggled to put a name to some of the things that bothered me about church. This book helped me identify those things and give me an action plan for how to solve my concerns. Simple, easy, and cheap things. While not everything mentioned in this book is a negative for me, as I work in a secular world, I see and hear these reasons for my non-churched, non-christian friends frequently. And they're right. Now I see a way to make a difference. I've bought 8 of these books and began passing them around the church. I'm going to make a difference."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pot calling the kettle black","review":"The author has done a fairly good job of noticing certain trends.

Our group has enjoyed it very much. It is a deep issue. I think this book addresses it well."},{"rating":"1","title":"As a male church goer...","review":"I have to say that I believe the biggest reason men do not attend church is that they do not know what they are missing. You hear people talk about having a personal relationship with Jesus, and yet they are unwilling to spend even an hour with Him during Mass and to have the most personal relationship possible in receiving Him in the Eucharist.How can you not want to go? To hear the word of God, the greatest collection of love letters ever written and then to partake in the same wedding feast that exists perpetually in heaven.I'm speechless."},{"rating":"2","title":"an important voice for genuine masculinity","review":"This is an excellent book. It's a plea for men to get involved in their churches, and for churches to welcome a distinctively male approach to church life.This book explains why many men are repelled by church from effeminate ministry, to flower and creche rotas. Men need clear niches and roles within the church, and not to feel that they have to hide their masculinity away when they get to church. When they have to do this they would sooner be anywhere else.This is a well written, well observed book that describes well the problems many men have with many churches. Some of the criticism are sharp, but the message from this book is necessary and timely.I highly recommend this book to those who run churches. I recommend it to men who want to understand their reaction to church more fully. It may not be your fault that you don't feel at home in church."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why Men hate going to church","review":"This book pointed out how normal I was about what I would be feeling in normal church services and also how the average church operates. Men want varianceof presentations, they are not into touchy- feely minsitries that most churches have and that is why so many women are involved and not men. Highly reommend this book to pastors and leaders of the church so they may tap into the opportunies that men serve in their churches."},{"rating":"2","title":"When you can't see the forest for the trees . . . .","review":"An expression I remember from my adolescense to express frustration and confusion was 'he can't see the forest for the trees'. I think that defines what I've experienced in mainline, traditional churches for years.You sense that something is missing, but you just don't know what it is. Somehow, church and worship don't feel right, but you can't put your finger on it, and sooner or later you just stop going.Well this book was a lot like a book I read back in the 60s by Alvin Toffler called Future Shock. He had the ability to bring current events into a focus that allowed you to see the forest as well as the trees.Reading this book was just like that - one of those 'AHA!, THAT'S IT!' moments. Murrow hits the nail square on the head. I'm not sure (and neither is he for that matter) that all the answers are presented. But for perhaps the first time, the problem is out in the open and open for discussion.Get it - read it - THINK! THINK! THINK!"},{"rating":"2","title":"He nailed it!","review":"I can finally articulate to the church leadership and my wife the reasons why I felt this way about our church. Thanks Mr Murrow for nailing the problem to the wall and explaining it to our leaders.Now, are they man enough to do something about it?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read for Church Leaders","review":"Whether you are a Pastor, men's ministry leader, or just a guy in church -- this book is for you! This is one of the clearest, most practical guides for getting men connected to the church that I have ever read. David Murrow does an outstanding job making the case for a renewed emphasis on masculine presence in God's house, based on solid research and a keen mind for details that matter.If you're a woman whose husband won't go to church with you, read this book ... it may help you understand why. Then give your copy to your Pastor to read, and ask him to do something to make the church more man-friendly. You'll be glad you did."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved this Book","review":"I liked it so much I bought four more copies to give away and when those are gone to worthy readers, I will buy more. If you're a man that thinks Jesus was effeminate and Mr. Rogers represents a role model for Christian men, this book will slap that idea right out of your head. The Bible is filled with real men doing courageous things that if understood will change your whole perspective of the faithful as viewed by most in the Church today.It's not about chest thumping and macho posing. It's about reaching out to unchurched men in a way that recognizes that God made them men, to be men in the first place. It is more likely you will draw men to a BBQ than a quilting Bee. That's obvous, but what is not so obvious is the underlying principly, why. That will be revealed as you read with dozens of examples to verify. Did I mention that I liked it? I think you will too."},{"rating":"2","title":"wake up call to blokes - better ways to do things","review":"Amazing book this. Lots of ideas to think about. As a bloke - helped me realise WHY I am drawn to certain things/ministry, and repelled by others. Pretty exciting to think of the possibilities of what could happen when a lot of christian men get a flame lit under their behind and focus on doing \\"blokey\\" stuff with an aim to encouraging each other and reaching out to their non-churched mates.One of the biggest things for me in the book was that blokes develop mate-ship through \\"doing things\\" (sport/ trips / motorbike rides / ski trips) rather than sitting around talking - like the bible study / church mode. Highly recommended. I am buying more copies to give to mates - guys and girls."},{"rating":"2","title":"The REAL effect of the book happened AFTER I read it!","review":"A good friend who is an elder at my church gave this book to me to read. It took me all of two days to read the thing as I found it fascinating and oh, so true. My friend and I have grown up in the church (an incidently were both MK's). We both agreed that we were immune from a lot of the feminizing characteristics of church since we grew up in it.We found ourseves talking about the book constantly and began to evaluate all our church activities in that light.The part which made the most sense to me was the feminization of church music especially a LOT of current praise and worship song.This book is well written and very to the point. That direct style of writing is refreshing. I get so sick of non-confrontational feel-good writing. David Murrow says it the way it really is.I hope he writes more on this topic- especially feminized music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why men hate going to church","review":"WHY MEN HATE GOING TO CHURCH by David Murrow ....Why do men hate going to church?, this book offers some ideas why. Are churches setup for the female and not the male, the author believes that is part of the problem. Another problem is that the church teach the soft side of Jesus ( the lamb of God side not the lion of Judah side.) The church needs to teach both sides of Jesus.The author offer some solutions for the church to take, I do not totally agree with the chapter about the mega church being part of the answer. I believe a smaller church has more to offer and is more friendly, this is from my own experience.The book offers a good information and has a lot of good points and even at time is humorist.I received this book free from the publisher through the [...] book review bloggers program.

I could have tried to splice on the male connector from the old mirror, but chose to simply get a manual mirror instead (which had its own problems - see other review). According to various checks I did at the website, this was the correct model for my 2004 Camry. Physically it looked correct, but the electrical issue was not worth the trouble. I was concerned that if I spliced on the old connector and there continued to be problems, the motor/gears would prevent manual adjustments of the mirror.

However, when all is said and done the heroine realizes her love for the hero (82% Kindle talk) before he does (89% Kindle talk).The plot was entertaining with a lot of humor.

In homeopathy, it is believed the water has a 'memory' of the active ingredient that was once there before dilution and it remains powerfully curative.

Nappy Roots started with Po' Folks and took the cake with Ho Down. The whole album is worth listening to. They even included some entertaining skits throughout the album which for once wasn't just a waste of space. Two thumbs up to Nappy Roots! I'd say one of the best of the year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD!","review":"Kind of like a fusion of Outkast and The Roots, Nappy Roots shows us all that southern hip-hop is alive and well, and that it can come from places other than Atlanta, GA. A very well-balanced CD, with some great grooves and rhymes. I'd never heard any of their songs until I heard P.O.D.'s remix of \\"Awnaw\\" (a great remix, by the way) and wanted to hear some of Nappy Roots' original stuff. Not only was I impressed: I was blown away. Standout tracks include \\"Awnaw\\", \\"One Forty\\", \\"Headz Up\\", \\"Po' Folks\\", and \\"Blowin' Trees\\", but in truth not a single song on the album is anything but pure southern goodness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nappy Roots","review":"New and works great. Very pleased! Couldn't find a better price any where else for a new cd. Would recommend this site."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING!!!","review":"This CD is by far one of the best that I have ever heard. If you like Bass Blasting music, like so many here in HOT-LANTA, then this CD is for you. The beats are off the hook. THe lyrics are sooooo good. This is just an amazin cd, especially Country Boyz and Awnaw, the two best songs on the CD. BUY IT and BUT IT NOW!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Album of the Year!!!","review":"Nappy Roots came through on this one. Every song has a creative and tight beat to it.

You won't regret it, trust me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice, nice, nice","review":"I listened this album here yesterday...then I called why favorite record store in order to know if they already got it, and thank god it was there.

This is a great album, tight beats, only one skit (I think) and clever rhymes...Long live to Nappy Roots!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the most original hip-hop CD's out right now","review":"Most of you have probably heard \\"AWNAW\\" but you need to listen to the rest of this album as well. Nappy Roots has a very similar sound to Outkast, and they are incredible lyrically. I can already tell that if for some reason this group were to have a falling out, at least 3 of them would do very well as solo artists. Big V has a Scarface/Xzibit sound, Skinny Deville sound like the third member of Outkast, and Prophet's unique reggae style sound would make him an outstanding session rapper (such as Nate Dogg). Give this CD a listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"True Kentucky Sounds","review":"In the state where bluegrass was originated and hip-hop artist are hard to find, Nappy Roots Comes with a true Kentucky sound. The Bluegrass roots are an eminent pat of there sound, yet bringing out some of the best contemporary hip-hop today. Nappy Roots gives a fresh new sound, and keeps away from the monatony of some of todays hip-hop. Instead of rapping about cars and girls, Nappy Roots comes correct with lyrics tha compliment there way of life... just ordinary country boys. The group charmonizes well with each vocalist showcases a different talent. They definately surpass the last Kentucky artist Buckshot, who as well came with his one unique sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"OFF THE MEAT RACK Y'ALL","review":"This cd is tight, this is the best hip-hop cd I own,orginally I brought it for AWNAW, but I listen to the whole thing and there are about 14 good tracks,If they keep on this road,they will be around for years and years to come.The best MC of the group is Skinny Deville,he can lay downa rhyme like i've never seen or heard,they all bring a new meaning to the dirty south!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth watching","review":"It's too bad the celtic tiger government doesn't support its film industry.

At the end of each chapter are review questions and definitions of key words, which are useful especially for students.It comes with large construction drawings on three projects that were actually built. Although they should have printed them on separate pieces of paper instead of having them on both sides of the sheet, this makes it hard to compare and study those construction drawings.Also, the paper used for publication I find is a bit thin, you have to read the textbook on a flat surface, otherwise it will curl up. The same goes with the construction drawings, after a couple of times of folding and un-folding, the papers tend to tear easily.I would recommend this book for anyone interested in the building industry."},{"rating":"2","title":"NI HAO KAILAN DVD","review":"This is a great dvd.

But that's the whole point... it's a general-audience show for all preschoolers, and it does a great job at that. The characters are loveable -- and easier on the eye. The young actress who does Kai-lan's voice does a superb job -- she's my second favorite Nick Jr. voice actor, after the SpongeBob guy. :) This DVD features 4 episodes, as well as a \\"My Favorite Places\\" music video.

In listening to Dr.Whites approach,he does not aknowledge the Bible alone and its entirety, he adds his church confessions as well as twisting scripture by not examining the ones he quotes in light of the whole bible to form a conclusion. If we listen to Dr.White, we are to worship the church doctrines and confessions and people with Degrees because they are the \\"Pillar and ground of truth\\", not Gods Word which is THE BIBLE ALONE AND IN ITS ENTIRETY.

Here is a ministry that has devoted itself, under the impeccable leadership of Brother Harold Camping, to being as faithful to the Word of God as humanly possible. And what a fine job they have done! If Dr James White can find anything wrong with such a noble pursuit (especially when churches everywhere have put their \\"Confessions\\" above the Bible itself), then I would ask Dr White and anyone who agrees with his nonsense (Mr Horth) to \\"make your salvation sure\\".

It is THE book on the subject and the only thorougly researched history of this war. Linn provides a detailed account of the big-battle operations of 1899 and then looks at the guerrilla war in the various islands. There is a detailed and fair analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of American and guerrilla forces--and the notes show Linn did research in both American and Filipino sources. This book has a lot to teach about our current military situtation, which may be why troops in Iraq are reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A sound work on a forgotten war","review":"Along with the Malayan Emergency, the Philippine war is the most often cited successful counter insurgencies. Again like the Malayan Emergency there is little written on this war and even less that can be called sound scholarly work. Dr. Linn is the exception and has written a detailed, well documented and easily accessible book.Dr. Linn breaks down all the major players on both sides of this conflict and traces them through the war. He breaks down the strategies and tactics that all the different factions. He also shows his research skills by showing what the tactics the U.S. Army actually employed and that there has been an over inflation of atrocities that were committed.This is good book for someone interested in the war, and it is an excellent resource for the student doing research. Either way the book is a must have for one's own personnel library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good but missing pages","review":"Very good book but when I got to chapter 14 on Samar, several pages were blank.

This is unfortunate because my research paper is about the Balangiga battle which in located in Samar."},{"rating":"2","title":"Philippine War 1899-1902","review":"A well balanced study in an oft missrepresented war showing both sides of the war. Note: The Philippines are who they are today as a direct positive result of this war. This book has many modern applications in what it will take to win an insurgent war today. You often feel like you are reading today's news complete with an opponent who seeks to effect an American election by American military casualties. We didn't fall for it in 1900. This book takes you by island by island, challenges, defeats and victorys. A positive read. Informative. It is not a page turner which is why only four stars. But if you have a space on your shelf for this time in American military history about a successful strategy, this is your book. God Bless America and God Bless you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quetionable citations","review":"With as much detail as Linn provides concerning units and their strengths, battle dates, all of which can be taken from most history books, he is 'light' on some of his citations. There is a note of personal vindictiveness in describing some of the historical figures relating to their personal character, yet he does not really back up his 'barbs' or accusations with fact. That said, his 'novelist' approach to what should be strictly a historical document and an objective perspective undermines much of the book's credibility.Stuart Creighton Miller's 'Benevolent Assimilation' remains the gold standard, Linn's book is simply entertainment."},{"rating":"1","title":"The apologist/centrist view from the West","review":"Although Linn and supporters of this view (including elitists such as the editors of the Council on Foreign Relations' Foreign Affairs)consider the deliberate provocations and genocidal fury of the United States, exhaustively detailed by Stuart C. Miller and other critics of the war, to be a \\"myth\\". This is an outrageous assertion, that Linn fails to support, while attempting to quietly paper over the history and repair the reputations of the Americans who killed a military disadvantaged opposition with brutality. Linn brushes off the butchery of Samar as no more than \\"harsh\\", while pushing the idea that Filipinos actually welcomed the US. Linn's bias in support of \\"benevolent assimilation\\" is clear. This dry blow by blow of military operations does not go into the much more important decision making at the all-important policy and geostrategy level."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fails to Cover All Events","review":"I bought the book because I was interested in the battle of Malabon. Specifically, to get a history of the 71st Company, Coast Artillery Corps and the 3rd U.S. Infantry involvement. The battle for Malabon is not mentioned in the book even though companies of the 2nd Oregon Volunteer Infantry and the 1st Washington Volunteer Infantry were engaged on 25 March 1899. There is no mention in the book about the C.A.C. and just two brief entries about the 3rd Infantry. A definite waste of my money."},{"rating":"2","title":"?Ol��!","review":"With this book, I spent long hours outside the real world.

BRAVO!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very well done","review":"Obviously if you don't like history, you shouldn't read this book. But if you are like me, and love to learn about history, then this book is a must. Do you want to talk about diving head-long into the Roman society? Do you want to talk about the beginning of the rise of the Caesars? Do you want to talk about all the gods and their influences on the ancient Romans? Then pick up this book and read it! Rome, in all its glory, comes back to life as you flip through the pages. The whole idea behind immersing you into the Roman civilization is astounding; Mrs. McCollough does a FANTASTIC job! I almost gave the book 5 stars, but I held back because it is incredibly long and sometimes overly complex or redundant. But other than that, I absolutely loved it! I am currently reading the next book in the series: The Grass Crown. So far, it is also excellent. Read On!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Anachronistic and shallow","review":"I did not find the book rewarding, although I completed it. It read somewhat like an introductory textbook on ancient Rome written for young teenagers. I found the prose flat, colorless and wooden, anachronistic in some cases, shallow in most cases, and the characters more like twentieth century Brits, at best. In my opinion Ms. McCullough did not make any effort to delve into the minds or characters of these persons. I query whether Ms McCullough has studied any of the literature of the time or any scholar treatises on such literature, or on the events subject of the book. I have not yet read the sequels and am reluctant to buy the books, although I have deeply enjoyed study of this era and the Latin language for many years."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Start to the Series","review":"I really liked this book despite having little knowledge of ancient Rome (I mainly read English historical novels). I have to say at the beginning I almost gave up. I found the names hard to get used to, both of the characters and of the different sections of Rome and was flipping back and forth from the glossary. Then I just started reading and not worrying about the detail so much and started enjoying the book.At times it's a bit slow, but when a story is 1000 pages it can't all be action! My favorite parts involved Roman family life and the lives of the women and my least favorite parts were military and political strategizing, although I eventually became intrigued by that during the course of the book.I will definitely read the rest of the series...but take a break and read something else in between since it took a month to finish this one (and I'm not a slow reader)!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Written Character-Based Historical Fiction","review":"\\"First Man in Rome\\" is an extremely well written and conceptualized piece of historical fiction. McCullough has painstakingly recreated the world of the Roman Republic during the late 100s BC. Her research is in full display as she created her own maps, glossary and even pencil drawings of some of the key characters.The story is full of political intrigue, history, and character-driven drama. It's enjoyable, but will require a bit of patience to work through the multi-threaded plot lines and overwhelming amount of characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterfully Done - Historically Accurate","review":"As a scholar of ancient civilizations, I find so many historical fictions books completely without basis and wholly inaccurate. Having read this book all the way through once (having started and stopped several times due to the myriad of characters to remember) now, I thoroughly enjoyed myself and can't wait to read the 2nd installment in The Grass Crown. The portrayals of Gaius Marius and Lucius Cornelius Sulla are believable and completely in line with the personalities and other traits as I understand them from my studies.Ms. McCullough has outdone herself yet again. The Thorn Birds can never be unseated, but this book is a close second. The myriad of maps, definitions and other reference materials only added to the enjoyment of the book (if not also the length and weight).Kudos"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a tough read.","review":"And not very enjoyable either. It's interesting in the fact that I love the subject matter (ancient Rome), but it's just not a compelling story.

She uses a few too many hackneyed cliches in this one, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Remember that its fiction.","review":"Highly enjoyable, full of intrigue and petty immoralities. A vivid parade of corruption and political survival. Its easy to put yourself into the period once you get past the unpronouncable names. Obsessively reseached, but like all fiction, sculpted to fit the storyline's widely known conclusion. It humanizes the history text books from college, with more than a few Ah-ha's as to why events occurred the way they did. I have read all the books in this series up to date, and will continue to do so for the sheer pleasure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Book I've ever read about Rome of the 1st Century BC","review":"You'll never learn as much and as easy as you do when you read this book. The main reason why I read McCollough's books in english is that I don't finish them in one day - this way it takes a week. Colleen McCollough describes the circumstances in Rome at this time more detailed than I thought it possible without being boring. Just read the first 50 pages and try to stop !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lifts the \\"historical fiction\\" genre to new heights","review":"This novel, my \\"virgin voyage\\" into historical fiction, has everything. McCullough's genius is apparent; from villianous creatures to noble statesmen, from intricate details to sweeping events laced throughout the story, one half-expects to set down the book, glance out the window witness a busy mid-afternoon marketplace in ancient Rome. The thoughts are conveyed that well. Quite possibly, the fastest 900-plus pages you'll ever devour. Do yourself a favor and PLEASE READ THIS BOOK.

There are a lot of characters in it so it can be hard to keep them straight. Thank goodness for the character index in the front, for I had to flip to that numerous times throughout the book. I must say though, that the book lost one star because it did become boring at some points and I did have to put it aside to read something else more entertaining. A book that long can do that, begin to lag and sputter in the middle, which is why I think the author should had trimmed it down about a hundred pages or so, in order to keep the flow going. That would have kept the good parts just about back to back, and myself able to read it without pause.

I normally love historical books, but this one was incredibly boring. It was a struggle to get through it. That the author did her research is undeniable. The problem is, she seemed to be more concerned with showing off all her research than with writing an interesting story. In a historical novel, this is inexcusable. It read more like a bad textbook than a novel. She did a good job with The Thorn Birds, but this was terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"A snore","review":"I listened to this book on audio while commuting to and from work. When the author wrote about the relationships between the main characters it was OK, but the political speeches were so long and so boring I actually couldn't wait to get to work so I could turn it off.

I will not be listening to any more books in this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very tedious read","review":"I purchased this book to learn more about early Roman history prior to a trip planned later this year. This is one of the most tedious reading experiences I have ever had! It provides limited background and understanding to the culture, and instead is a boring composite of internal issues between several primary characters - none of whom are developed to the point that I cared about them. Dealing with the 3-4 word Latin names for each character (many of which were almost identical), added to the torment. I rarely do not finish a book - but after 600+ pages, I give! And unfortunately, I asked for (and received) the entire series for Christmas. What a waste!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Historical Fiction At Its Finest","review":"This series of books has been the best reading experience I've had since Michener. Ms. McCullough's research is impeccable and the plot moves along at a furious speed. The characters themselves are great, forcing you to invest time into understanding what motivates them. The 2 main characters of Gaius Marius and Lucius Cornelius are so well-crafted that one feels an immediate bond with them. Of all the books in this series, the first two are the best. As the author inevitably moves on to the great Ceasar, the books get bogged down.

Science has also played a significant role in raising issues about abortion and how we view the fetus in relation to its mother. Through genetics and digital forms of viewing scientific data it is shown that we do not always have to rely on what we see but the ideas that lead up to or are raised because of these images.

The lock and key turning is also difficult, felt like I was going to bend the key."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well, don't overtighten","review":"This does it's job very well. After I saw my toddler boys hit a tap handle with a ball I knew I needed two of these.My advice would be: It works well, just don't get the wrong idea about it. The key really just enables you to screw down the mechanism to prevent the tap handle from coming forward. You literally advance the stop with every key turn.Don't go too far, it feels like you could over-tighten and break something.Does it's job well.Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"The lock is a simple mechanism that permits me to use my kegerator without fear of minors getting a taste!! The only drawback that I see is that there is only one key. It is solid, and appears to be very durable."},{"rating":"2","title":"works great","review":"We purchased this lock because we have 3 teenage boys in the house and didn't want to worry about them or having to fend off their friends who might want to sneak from the keg. It works great and is easy to use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect!!!","review":"This product is so simple it's perfect. The lock pushes right up to the tap and locks it into place. Only problem...comes with only one key."},{"rating":"1","title":"lock up","review":"A key is meant to lock and unlock. People have a tendency to turn the key too far to achieve a tighter fit. The threaded section that comes out is of a different metal than the brass section that turns. If turned too tight the threads freeze up. When this happens, the key is hard to turn thus twisting the key. If this happens several times the key can actually break off in the cyclinder. Then you have to use a screwdriver to push in on the part of the key that is broken off inside the cyclinder and turn to open up the lock. Then unless you can get the piece of broken key out the lock is useless."},{"rating":"2","title":"One day read","review":"Maddie and Devlin are characters that captured my heart from the first few pages, then pulled me through the rest of the story wondering how it would all work out. I appreciate that the characters are 'real'. They are not perfect by any means, who is, but neither are they stupid or inordinately arrogant or milk toast. I admit that what touched me most in the story was my ability to identify with the characters. I intensely disliked the villian, just as was intended. Her secondary characters are also interesting and inspire the desire to know more about them. The interactions between the various characters doesn't feel forced, lending the feeling of the story moving naturally forward. And I'll be reading it again and again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated it","review":"Okay, I can grasp that Farley, the villan, used Madeline as a pawn after he ruined her. Where things go awry for me is that she is from a quality family and is whored out by the guy. What? Devlin wins his time with her while gambling against Farley. After he goes in to make good on his winnings they have this absurd interaction and dialog. THEN she offers to 'make love' with him very willingly and has mind-blowing sex. Now, keep in mind she is about 15-16 at the time. Fast forward to Chapter 2. Three years pass when Devlin wins gambling yet again, well, what do you know, he is offered Madeline who happens to have a toddler. I just can't go on relating all the dumb stuff.Everything about the first 3 chapters sucked. None of the characters had qualities that made you care about them. Trite dialog and far-fetched and contrived situations. Did not continue to read after Chapter 4. Do not recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deuce Anyone?","review":"If Devlin said 'deuce' one more time by the last page of this book, I think I would have screamed. Not to mention the MC was a spineless pushover. I give this book two stars and I'm being generous."},{"rating":"2","title":"Art, race, power, obsession -- Wow!","review":"Andrew Dietz weaves an incredible tale around the phenomena of self-taught folk art, proving again that truth is often stranger than fiction. I usually read books in bits and pieces, but once I entered the world of Bill Arnett and Thornton Dial I couldn't put the book down. Dietz is a great story-teller with incredible material, but he trusts the readers to make their own judgments about the very ambiguous world of folk artists and collectors. Read it and enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly, a very well written, remarkable and entertaining true story that you can't put down.","review":"This is a narrative that reads like a thriller. Dietz has taken us behind the scenes of the (folk)art world and with a sharp,witty and engaging writing style has revealed the personalities, motives and spirit that drives the artists, collectors and curators. Good guys, bad guys, victims and innocents, Dietz sets the stage for you to decide who fits where as the principles either wheel and deal, connive and contrive or just try to survive. Well researched and very well written. I hope Dietz has another book in the offering soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful,well written book!","review":"I absolutely loved this book! I think that you must have put a lot of effort, work, and time into this masterpiece. Love the word usage and the story overall. I hope that you write more books.Great Work!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your $$$","review":"This product does not work, you are better off buying the \\"sauna\\" shorts or the \\"sweat\\" suits that boxers wear to work out if you are looking to shed some inches.

Sword and Shadow was an incredible read! A wonderful conclusion for those who have followed the Sword in Exile Trilogy. The characters seemed real, and, as often happens, they became my friends. I shared their trials and their joys with my heart racing and my mind spinning. Often during reading, I would laugh or jump up and down and then look around and realize that I was in my own house, and not on the battlefield with my favorite heros and heroines-a good feat for an author. The reason I give this book only four stars is that, as is often characteristic of Marston, the ending left somewhat to be desired. The epilogue gives a quick explanation of the years to come, but I, of course, yearned for more. Perhaps this is simply the mark of a good writer, but I think the story would have been enhanced by added pages. A wonderful read- enjoy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm so, so terribly sorry.","review":"If you have bought and read the rest of these, and you're wondering what the last ever is like, I'm so, so terribly sorry for you. Because this book is a complete cop out. Now, don't get me wrong, I love EVERYTHING I have ever read, but this *was* a cop out. She got to the end, and went, \\"Oh my god, the end, better finish!\\" and that's all I think I can say..."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's the difference?","review":"Reading all six of Ann Marston's books is like those games in magazines and newsapers \\"Spot the difference\\". All the books are alike except some minor details. It's actually quite boring reading these books when you already know exactly what happens only by reading a few chapters. And to finish: an advice to all you fantasy readers out there - Books that evoke a sort \\"prophecy of a hero that will defeat evil\\" or something like that gives away the ending already."},{"rating":"1","title":"How can the authors themselves write reviews?","review":"Most of the reviews are by the authors themselves.

So now i have to buy a new one to give a new gift ver. a flea market item."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Dual Disc","review":"This is a great low to moderate workout. It keeps the waistline in check. I love the 20 min. stretching segment, really makes you feel good afterwards. This disc may be old school, but it works."},{"rating":"2","title":"She's got the Magic Touch","review":"I like the choices available on this DVD. In the beginning when you are not sure of what to do you can do the light aerobics and then get more of a workout if that works for you. It is easier than going to a gym class which tends to be different every time. Once you learn the routines you can get a good workout every time. Jane is so sweet and encouraging. Nice going."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just say \\"no\\" to chocolate!","review":"Now I used to be known as a \\"choco-holic\\"; that is, someone who just can't get enough of the brown stuff! I'd tried diets, pills, just about everything until a friend of mine turned me on to this CD. 50 pounds lighter I feel marvelous and each day is a celebration of life. Jane Fondo takes you through each step and helps you realize that ACTIVITY is the key to physical health and mental clarity. Now, I don't care what Jane did back in the 1960's. People say stupid things when their young. I would give it 5 stars, but hey, nothing is perfect! My advice to you is to buy this excellent set and wonder where the pounds went!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great workout DVD","review":"Jane is great to work out with. She gives such excellent directions throughout the entire workout and what a great workout."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe OK if you're a beginner -- but SO dated!","review":"I LOVED Jane's original workout (now out of print) and used it for years. I might still, if it were available on DVD. But I didn't like any of her subsequent workouts, and about 12 years ago I graduated to The Firm tapes, which are better in a lot of ways and certainly more effective, especially for the upper body. Still, I wanted to give Jane's workouts a fresh look and thought they might be worth owning for \\"lighter\\" workout days. But sorry, this one is too easy -- especially the very low-intensity aerobics -- plus the 1980s perms and tacky outfits are the WORST, and there is too much silly whooping and sound effects from the cast members. On the plus side, Jane does give excellent form pointers, and this is a good intro to weight training if you've never done it before. So, if you're a beginner and not bothered by whoops and \\"Yow, baby\\"s and jungle-print leotards with matching headbands, you might like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay workout, too much fake squealing!","review":"I wanted to enjoy this workout - I love workouts that include both cardio and strength training - but the \\"eee-yahs!\\" were just ridiculous. What makes it even worse it that it is obvious these sound effects were DUBBED IN afterward! You never see anyone actually making those sounds -- in fact, everyone seems to be to busy concentrating on what they are doing to stop and give a \\"yee-hah!\\" about it. I also found the big blonde who led the high-impact aerobics to be somewhat fake. Ride 'em cowboy?!? It seemed to me that the brunette who led the low-impact aerobics was also mildly irritated at her \\"partner's\\" over-enthusiasm for aerobics. Oh well, at least the DVD didn't cost me very much!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Outdated aerobics vid","review":"Crappy, outdated, 80s aerobics workout repackaged to appeal to today Mom's. Don't waste your money - buy my copy cheap!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jane Fonda Collection","review":"The content is a fantastic exercise routine. The only flaw is that every time I want to start the exercises I have to wait for all the titles and there is no way of skipping them."},{"rating":"2","title":"so glad this is finally on DVD!!","review":"I have used this video for many years and still think it is the best on the market for a complete body workout. You get quick complete instruction during the aerobics part - which foot is moving next and in which direction, etc. There is no jerking and the tempo is just right. I love the warm up, and cool down parts, which are so important, and the COMPLETE stretching out section so there are minimal sore muscles next day. AND, it is a GREAT trip back to the 80s hair-dos and outfits - so fun! I wish they'd do a reunion video - wouldn't that be fun? I've been watching all the participants for so long, I feel like I know them! It would be cool to see them today.... I also love the abs workout on this video with the different positions for different parts - upper and lower abs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reliable workouts for all ages","review":"I've owned (and worn out) many Jane Fonda workouts over the years. The Complete Workout/Stress Reduction and Personal Trainer series are now both out on DVD and I rely on them. Because I'm \\"a little older now,\\" I particularly enjoy the Light Aerobic and Stress Reduction routines on this DVD: low-impact aerobics and stretches. Easy on the joints, etc., but not boring. The Personal Trainer series also has excellent low-impact and stretch routines. I recommend both DVDs."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome throwback!","review":"I am so thankful that I decided to get this. I remember doing this TAPE w/my mom when I was younger (she still has them, I just found out today). The hair styles & clothes made me crack up...not just that it was ridiculous style choices, but that I also remember dressing the part. The video itself is a great workout. Work up a good sweat w/the high impact, the weights section is still good (although I don't have ankle weights...do they even sell them anymore?). More dance like. Yelps & Ha yelled in the background to keep you going. How much more fun do you need a video to be? Gotta get this."},{"rating":"1","title":"WTF","review":"So, I purchased this DVD back in 2008 for the low price of $6.97 as a gift for my mom. My review is not for the quality of this product --which my mom loved so much that the DVD now skips -- my complaint is the ridiculous price of $112.00. I really want to buy my mother this workout DVD because it seems to really help with her back, but there is no way in hell that I'm going to pay this much for a single item."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jane Fonda's Complete Workout Review","review":"I bought this produdct when it first came out as a vhs. I liked it SOOOOOOOOOOOO Much, that I bought it again on DVD this time. It is SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO fun, and it's easy to learn the steps. It's a great way to get a fantastic cardiac workout. It covers upper and lower body and warmups and cool downs. It just rocks! You have a choice of both high impact and low impact versions. I use the aerobics part of the class as a warmup for days when I do the treadmill and lift weights. It's a must have if you want a FUN workout that won't practically kill you, especially if you have joint problems or are older. Try it! You'll like it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"Buy the real work of Joe Ross (Trading the Ross Hook, trading by the book,..), not the weak copy \\"TNT\\".The illustration is very poor (no time no price on the charts..?) the introduction up to page 113 is useless (if you like you can read for Mark Douglas instead). weak language not at all what Joe Ross used in his real work.too much marketing and advertising for the seminarsAppendixes are copied from trading the Ross Hook.

It will take the fear our of the unknown and create the confidence you need to begin learning about the stock market and how you can make money with it.In his book, Chris explains stock market terminology in easy to understand terms, he gives you step by step procedures you can put into place to practice buying and selling without spending any real money until you are confident, how to open a brokerage account and much more.He offers resources and information on measuring how profitable your investements are and how to protect them.If you can't decide if you want to make money with the stock market, pick up this book to help you decide and see how easy it really can be."},{"rating":"1","title":"The very beginning of Patterns movement","review":"This book is really reserved for pattern's fans, because material inside is essentially focused on processes patterns, and design materials are expressed in a textual way.

I buy it for my friends who own restaurants, and put it on the hold music for my company."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother!","review":"I am giving this record two stars instead of one because there are definately worse \\"down-tempo\\" and \\"chill\\" compilations floating around, but this is the worst Cafe del Mar CD I have heard. There is nothing new here. It sounds as though the DJ's could not decide if this was supposed to be funky chill or new age music. It reminded me of the band \\"Delirium\\" with Latin vocals. I truly do not recommend this album. It was given to me and I gave it away. It was that uninteresting! Try Volume Six instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scandalously dismal","review":"Annoyingly, the lowest rating I can offer is ONE STAR. Way too much. How on earth is it possible to produce such complete drivel. From the first tedious 30 seconds of track one (I can't be bothered to turn the CD box over to see what the 'track' is called ... it simply doesnt matter), one's heart drops as you simply know you have been sold a total dog. Make no mistake this is a totally uninspired depressing groove-free load of tosh. The price they charge for these things is also incredible. For the cost I expect something really decent ... I have the receipt, and its going back. Generally CD's of this type are a bit of a lottery, I sense this is one CD in this series that never should have made it out of the re-cycling bin. Surely its a mistake! In a word, R U B B I S H ."},{"rating":"1","title":"What can i say....different","review":"I have been a big fan of Cafe del mar for the past couple of years. My favorite albums would have to be volume's 6 and 7.Volume 8 on the other hand, is a very big let down. It has none of the flare of the other volumes, giving the audience the impression of being a movie soundtrack instead of an album to listen to after a night of clubbing.The songs were weak and mis-matched, reflecting poorly on the skills of the two no-name DJ's who put this together. With the exception of a couple of songs, such as \\"Any Other Name\\" by Thomas Newman (Which was incidently taken from the American Beauty soundtrack) i was dissapointed with the album.Long gone are the days of Jose Padilla and his musical genius for matching together songs for his albums. However, even without Jose Padilla, Bruno Leprete did an excellent job of volume 7. I just don't understand why they didn't get him to compile Volume 8 aswell. I hope that this error in judgement is corrected for Volume 9."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overall Disappointment","review":"We are music collectors. We enjoy classical, jazz, new age, soundscape-type music, jazz-fusion etc. We found the combination of songs on this CD to be an inharmonious blend. The song \\"Any Other Name\\" is a beautiful composition by Thomas Newman--consistent with his outstanding body of work. There are perhaps a couple of other tracks that were okay depending on your mood. Otherwise, we are extremely disappointed that we could have purchased 3 or 4 other quality CDs in terms of theme and musical motif--more in keeping with what was expected based on the single representative song (Thomas Newman), instead of this one. The cost for this one CD exceeded the aforementioned (3 - 4 CDs). The cover of the CD is evocative of peace and serenity, but upon listening, only a couple of songs reflect the relaxing scenario the cover suggests. In closing, be wary of specious first impressions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Up To Standards","review":"I found this CD to be disjointed and confusing in it's \\"feel\\". Not the type of Cafe Del Mar I enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"subliminal bliss....yet again!","review":"Aficionados of dance music will not deny the extent to which the Cafe Del Mar series has contributed to the success and popularity of balearic sounds. For dance-music lovers in search of ambient, cool and soothing Mediterranean beats, Cafe Del Mar will prove to be the perfect blissful companion. With 7 previous compilations already released, the latest volume 8 just proves to be bigger and better. Tracks like Sunrise by Afterlife, Gula Gula by Mari Boine and Gabriel by Lamb subliminally evokes idyllic scenarios of forgotten sunsets and dreams. This latest compilation will undoubtedly catch on quick with you ambient and chill-out music lovers out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Getting worse","review":"It seems the Cafe Del Mar series just gets worse. Aside from Goldfrapp's introductory track (mesmerizing), and a funky Digby Jones track, this CD does not impress. It has a nice variety of musical styles, which I can appreciate, but get the first few Cafe Del Mar CDs before this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS IS A CAFE DEL MAR COPY!! DO NOT BUY!","review":"As a loyal fan of Cafe del Mar in San Anotnio, Ibiza and the downtempo, beach vibe, I felt that I had to write this review to spare some of you from spending your hard earned dollars on this record. The original Cafe del Mar series started with DJ Jose Padilla and continued with new resident DJ, Bruno Leprete, after Jose left. You will notice that neither of these players had ANYTHING to do with this volume 8 release. As part more big record label you know what, two unknown DJs slaped this together, stole the Cafe del Mar name (if you look close enough you will see that it is not the real logo), and took the series to number 8.As a good friend of the folks at Cafe del Mar, I already own the newest, AUTHENTIC, release which is called DREAMS 2 compiled by the Cafe del Mar resident Bruno Leprete. PLEASE look out for this release and save your money to purchase it because it is even better than volume 7 - trust me!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Seductive Sounds","review":"This CD is worth the price in any currency! One photo in the CD's liner notes conveys the compilation's mood almost perfectly. A beautiful, bikinied woman floats half-submerged in gentle azure waters, her arms outstretched as she takes in the pacific sky above.While most tracks capture the above essence, namely Thomas Newman's \\"Any other name\\"(2), Mari Boine's \\"Gula Gula\\" (5) and \\"Will you catch me\\" by Tiny Tunes (10), the CD does have a few weak spots. But what CD doesn't? Overall, its vibe is soothing and satisfying.If you're looking for an instant connection with previous Del Mar volumes, skip straight to track 6. If you know well volumes I-VII, you'll know what I mean. Enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good enough","review":"Track 1-4: Volumen Ocho wants to set it off with some downtempo songs. These songs are so light (read boring) that I skip these first 4 songs everytime I listen to the CD. These song dosen't belong on a lounge CD.Track 5: Mari Boine - Gula gula on the other hand is an excellent track, and really the only reason for buying this CD.Track 6-11: The rest of the CD is more uptempo, but still lacks quality. A decent track is Digby Jones - Pina Colada, while Lamb - Gabriel is listenable.All-in-all the Mari Boine song safes this CD from getting 1 star. This CD can hardly be called a lounge-CD, and resembles more the \\"Pure moods\\" and \\"No stress\\" compilations. For true lounge you would be much better off with an older Cafe del mar compilation (4-7) or try instead all Hotel Costes (especially vol. Quatre), Buddha Bar (II), Om Lounge (2,1,3), Thievery Corporation \\"The mirror conspiracy\\" or St. Germain \\"Tourist\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"This album is a great album.

Sure, it's not Dog Man Star but anyone who has listened to their third CD, Coming Up, had to know something like Head Music was on the horizon. The first three songs, \\"Electricity,\\" \\"Savior faire,\\" and \\"Can't Get Enough\\" start the CD with a kind of intensity and sexiness that introduce you to the rest of the songs. They are fun songs that get you in the mood for what follows. The next two \\"Everything will flow\\" and \\"Down\\" are heartbreakingly beautiful and bear repeated hearings. The title song is a rare tongue in cheek piece as is the next song \\"Elephant Man.\\" The last third of the CD slows things down and ends on a very mellow tone. I'm not sure why this was so savaged in Suede fandom. It is a solid CD with lots of high points, a lot of fun, and moving lyrics. If it makes you want to get up and dance, if it makes you smile in recognition of a shared emotion . . . . then I say it works!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Fairy Tale With A Dora Twist.......","review":"Dora embarks on a super sized fairytale, adventure,along with her Monkey Pal Boots, and Swiping Fox Swiper.

My recommendation is do not buy this item."},{"rating":"1","title":"New transfer on Amazon Unbox, why not on DVD???","review":"I haven't seen the DVD shown here but it seems to be a bootleg from a VHS source. I have the old Vestron laserdisc and the transfer leaves a lot to be desired- from what I've seen of the new Unbox transfer from MGM (who currently owns the rights to the movie, as it was owned by Orion beforehand) it looks like they've done a nice new 16x9 transfer with cleaned-up sound- why isn't THAT transfer available on DVD? I would buy that in an instant.I live near where this was filmed (even work across the street from the place that serves as the gas company headquarters!) The old gas station still exists but is now a California Recycling Center; the nicer Chevron/Pyramid station was torn down and paved over a long time ago, it's now just an extension of the parking lot!

I HAD TO GO BUY ANOTHER COPY OF IT JUST TO GET THE MISSING PAGES."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Photography Ruins Book","review":"Very disappointing book. Comes across more as a gimmick to make some fast cash by self publishing a book that includes the authors photos combined with Christian \\"inspirational wisdom\\" scattered across the pages from Lewis, Mullins and others.The best thing this book has going for it is the cover design. It's downhill after that. The photography is poor at best. Several images are blurry, while many suffer from poor exposure, lifeless composition, and a printing that renders the photographs dull.If you are looking for a gift book or coffee table photo book with eye popping photographs with \\"inspirational wisdom\\", this book does not deliver. Do not buy this book based upon it's cover.Highly disappointed. Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heh...whatever","review":"Well, first off, i don't want anyone dissing me because said bad things here. That is your warning.This toy is ok.

This listed at about 7 dollars at your web site and when it arrived it was considerately smaller than his other paperback books in this series and it had a sticker with 1.98 still attached to the back of this tiny book. I was ok with the ended up price of 11.00 dollars with shipping and handling, but it was an insult for this lower price tag to still be attached on the book and this made my patient feel bad because I was obviously ripped off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dr. Dave is a credit to Parents & Their children","review":"I found this book, especially the specific exercises to be extremely helpful. However, as an avid reader of all of Dr. Dave's work, I still think his first major title is his masterpiece, Selling Out America's Children. While this title has many positive messages for parents and their children, in his earlier work Dr. Walsh prophetically outlines the longterm effect that the media have on children. Reading it now is especially enertaining because it shows how on the money he was over 7 years ago. This current title takes his work to a new level, but once you read it, be sure to check out Selling America's Children!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally , Some Common Sense!","review":"I was afraid this book would just bash media, but Dr Dave has written a remarkably balanced book that is amazingly useful to me as a parent. The chapters each cover a kind of media and provide thoughtful exercises and questions that we can use with our kids. Last night at dinner my daughters and I went though one of his suggested exercises about advertizing messages. Later, we had some fun together \\"catching\\" some of the hidden ads on TV. I also found his chapter on the internet enlightening. I would absolutely recommend this easy read to other parents. It has given me hope that I can influence my kids attitudes about media without being heavy handed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why all the hype?","review":"Based on the reviews I was really looking forward to this book. To my shock I couldn't even get into it. Felt slow, boring and missing some realistic element. I just read the Kite Runner and that was excellent. If you want to read this do yourself a favor get it from your library....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Badly over-rated","review":"This is one of the worst books I have ever read, although I did persist from beginning to end in the hope there would be some sensible resolution. The \\"story\\" line is at best improbable, heavily dependent on coincidental meetings of poorly portrayed characters. We also are asked to believe that all three of the very different females fall instantly and madly in love with the three men they encounter. The CIA characters are equally absurd. On the plus side, if you know nothing about Afghanistan, the book does provide some background - - although you will get more (and more accuracy) by reading a good newspaper."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved it!","review":"It took me a few chapters to really get into this book (the first few chapters are battle and assasination-necessary to lay the groundwork for what follows-but not really my thing), but once the female characters showed up and this became a story about people, I was hooked. I finished the last 2/3 of the novel in a little over two days because I just couldn't put it down- really! The location descriptions of Afghanistan, Pakistan, Amsterdam, and Venice made me feel like I was there (which I enjoyed immensely since I've never been to any of these place), but most of all I loved the ending. Not only was it a complete surprise, but it left me teary-eyed and it just keeps popping up in my mind two weeks after I finished the book. I highly recommend Winter in Kandahar!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A thoroughly entertaining novel. . .","review":"When I finally got through my last pile of books, Winter of Kandahar was on the bottom, and what a wonderful surprise. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and yes, it is hard to put down. For a first timer, I thought the author had well developed characters and a credible plot. When reading about the Afghanistan landscape, it became a vision I could see in my minds eye with his very descriptive style. The Tajik characters were certainly the better formulated with the Americans being stereotypical. This being the only flaw for me in what we need to remember is not historical fact, but a work of fiction. When I came to the end of this book, I felt I left behind a friend - a feeling I haven't had since I read Trinity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Average Story","review":"I can only give this novel an average rating because I found the writing style stilted and the characters a little pretensious. It's more from the author's view of how struggles take place rather then having a feel of experience. Still, it's probably worth reading if you like that sort of thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad, bad, bad","review":"I always read reviews when choosing my next book to read. Often I ignore the poor reviews and give the book a try anyway. In the case of this book I should've listened! This book is just bad. I can look past the many typos but the writing itself is so amateurish it's hard to stomach. Shallow characters. Soap opera names. Ridiculous plot. Pointless sex. I gave it one star only because I couldn't award less. Read it if you want, but don't say you weren't warned!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I got the bug-gripping thriller","review":"I had some time off the last two weeks and really got into this book. It's an imaginitive tale that kept my attention from beginning to end. I found the science intriguing and more than a little scary, especially the possibility that a virus could really be manipulated the way it is as the plot unfolds. Ahmed Jan was a character who gained strength through the book- clearly by design. I thought all the Tajiks were well done and the CIA agent Stone is probably a lot closer to what a case officer really is than some of the James Bond or Bourne Identity types might lead you to believe. Anyone who says Wilson didn't provide the background for why the Tajiks and Pashtun are continually feuding in Afghanistan either skimmed the novel or didn't read it at all. It's one of the key points that makes the ending special- at least for me. All things considered- an excellent effort and an author worth keeping an eye out for in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Winter in Kandahar","review":"Exquisite detail of a rugged countryside interwoven with remarkable ethnic contrasts between tribal groups. It is the beginning of a fascinating tale that moves to three continents and back again to Afghanistan. The plot involves heroic women and a scheme to target specific genetic groups with a newly created biological weapon. It is truly a great read with its execution of plot and character development and surprise ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting Concept, good attempt by novice.","review":"I read lots of thrillers and this is a good first novel to a point. The plot is a bit far-fetched, like a romantic fantasy from a serial from the 1930's. Coincidences are stacked upon coincidences until deus ex machina applies throughout far more scenes than the final.Editing suffers and I agree with a previous review about the stilted conversation that is totally out of character from the characters using that dialogue. It's just not believable dialogue.The book is published by Hailey-Grey Books, and a Google search for them turns up only winterinkandahar.com...apparently the novel is self-published, which while not necessarily a bad thing, explains much of the draft style dialogue.Overall, its an okay book for reading if you're killing time waiting for your flight.I'm hoping Steve Wilson improves with effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable story line and POOR writing","review":"I eagerly awaited my copy of Winter in Kandahar based on the setting of the plot and the wonderful reviews readers left on Amazon. I was disappointed. The setting offered a grand opportunity for an excellent novel but Dr. Wilson was unable to pull much more than a predictable story line with this opportunity. Worse, Dr. Wilson needs to learn sentence combining and to write effective dialogue. Where on earth was his editor? The sentences in this book are choppy and do not flow easily. Often there are too many insignificant details that slow the plot. Potential here? Yes, as long as Dr. Wilson gets some writing instruction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Desperately seeking editor...","review":"Timely topic with great opportunity, but it let me down. disappointed. The excessive medical details and unbelievable love story were too distracting to enjoy the story line. How about more history, description of the people, culture, and events of the time? I started reading the book with an idea I could gain a greater understanding of the subject, but was sorely disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Novel","review":"I purchased this book because of Amazon recommendations, based on my history of reading other books with plots centering on Afgan culture and political struggles in Afganistan. Dr. Wilson's description of biological warfare interested me, but the story otherwise fell short, lacking necessarty plot development. I would recommend that Dr. Wilson take a class in writing fiction and work on developing convincing characters. His development of Afgan women did not seem to coincide with the cultural ideals and deeply ingrained religious beliefs, but rather he portrayed all the women in this story as shallow and loose. What's the purpose of exploring another culture, yet obviously developing your characters from a western man's point of view?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Miracle of Self Publishing","review":"I must say the cover caught my eye and the numerous recommendations persuaded me to try this first novel. While it does have many good points, like most self published novels there's a reason it wasn't picked up by a normal publishing house. I wish the author well on his next attempt and I'll probably give that one a perusal because most first time authors, even the self published, learn from their mistakes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intellectual, thrilling!","review":"Winter in Kandahar is a sublime novel of international intrigue, spanning not only modern global technology, but also delving into the dark, rich history and culture of a little-known area of the world, Afghanistan. Compelling and currently relevant, the theme of possible bioterrorism grips the reader in a page-turning, fast-paced race through South Asia, Europe, the United States, and Canada.As if this were not enough, Wilson lavishes upon the reader a portrayal of Afghan culture so rich in detail that one can almost taste the flat bread and feel the humility of the women, shrouded as they are in their burqas.Most interesting, however, given current political maneuvers, is Wilson's elucidation of the troubled history of the region, which has been at war, either from outside invaders or from internal intertribal warfare, for centuries. Such historical conflict provides a dramatic backdrop for a modern spy novel.A must read!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I wonder?","review":"I was considering buying this book as it is a very timely subject, and it has been recommended all over Amazon. The reviews here are mostly extremely positive, But I did notice that anytime a critical review was posted it is quickly buried by a flood of positive reviews (all anonymous by the way -meaning you can't go to their about you area and see who they are). For example, on 6/30 someone posted a negative review it was followed by 4 positive reviews all dated 6/30, seems awful fishy? I am still considering buying this book but would love to hear some unbiased reviews, positive or negative from someone who has actually read the book and has a verviable Amazon profile. Please email me your thoughts.

I liked what was different about this book--the world of deeply committed environmental activists acting in not-always-brilliant ways, the strong sense of place (Albuquerque), the subtle humor that pops up unexpectedly, the supporting cast of characters, unlike any I've ever known. I enjoyed the mother/daughter dynamic, and the brother/sister dynamic a lot.Some subplots, and some of Lynn's sudden convictions seemed a little out of left field to me at times, but I was won over by Lynn, and happy to follow her to the last page.

It has been holding up well so far (about 10 trips to the lake).we chose the yellow color for extra visibility in our not so clear Oklahoma lakes.Warning: The top handle works so well that your kids (or you) may be tempted to use it to throw the dog in the water whether he wants to go in or not! =)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"Love this product.

However the third time we used it the ring that you clip the leash to broke loose and we almost lost our puppy.Poor quality. Purchased from Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfection","review":"By the end credits, you'll be smiling in disbelief. I guarantee it.There is not a single off note or misstep about this colorful, offbeat, tight little thriller. It's laden with plenty of bite and dark humour, and the small cast (including the always great Chris Eccleston, and a boyish Ewan Mcgregor in his first starring role) is fabulous.This is Danny Boyle's best film. Yes, it's better than both 'Slumdog Millionaire' and 'Trainspotting' combined, in my opinion. This film is what a great independent movie should be, and it just seems to gain in popularity as time goes by. Ask any film buff, and you will find that most responses will be similar to this review, all using common adjectives. Memorable. Smart. Sexy. Hilarious. Provocative. Shocking.Brilliant."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Pardoner's Tale, Retold","review":"This story is an updated version of The Pardoner's Tale, that old staple from The Canterbury Tales, which reminds us all of the consequences of greed and lust for money. Kerry Fox's performance is the clear standout here, and she really deserved a lot more attention for it. I believe this film was released ahead of its time... 1994. If it were to hit the screens now, it would have an immense response, especially now that Ewan McGregor's become a household name. The soundtrack is always pumping, and the twisted ending's especially memorable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant!!!!","review":"This was my third Ewan experience, and I must say, the most satisfying. Watch this with \\"Trainspotting\\" and \\"Moulin Rouge\\" and discover what all true Ewan Mcgregor fans already know....He is a most wonderfully versatile and brilliant actor(Not to mentioin absolutley adorable)."},{"rating":"2","title":"what can I say, just a great movie","review":"its British and its awesome. Ewen McGregor is the best in this and he offers a character that is fun to watch. Christopher Eccelston's nose is the gem also, and he has a slight resemblense to my friend Marcus, sorry MArcus but its true and Kerry Fox is hot, hot, hot.a great paranoia film with a lot of body cutting up and Danny Boyle( A Life Less Ordinary, 28 Days Later, The Beach adn Trainspotting) is a great director. the end where Eccelston gets the nife in the neck and McGRegor tricks Fox into thinking she has the money, just great"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very, very shallow","review":"Director Danny Boyle and screenwriter John Hodge have proved that they make a great team on their others films like \\"A Life Less Ordinary\\" and \\"The Beach\\".But, this first film of theirs -- a moody thriller about greed and mistrust -- completely misses the mark. I never found myself caring about any of the three main characters and I was quickly hoping that they would kill each other and end the movie.Danny Boyle shows off his brilliant camerawork in this debut film, but the unfocused story seems to enjoy showing us just how gloomy the weather in Scotland is.The camerawork and editing shows, once again, that director Boyle works well with restrictions and a small budget. But, this story is so poorly written that the film is difficult to enjoy.Avoid this film, and check out the filmmakers other, better films."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best storyline thrillers ever.","review":"First of all, let's just tell the review readers that the low ratings are obviously few and far between for a reason. Take stock in the fact that the majority of ratings are 5 stars.I own this film on good old VHS tape. Long before Ewan McGregor was a household name. So please, throw away any idea that he makes or breaks this film. It's stunning. The story sucks you in and you are there, alone with just you and your television. It will be easy to block out the outside world and become mesmerized. And horrified and shocked and aghast and bewildered.I promise this film is amazing. Be careful of reading too many reviews as they'll stupidly give away too much of the film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hitchcock-Bound","review":"'Shallow Grave,' with Ewan McGregor, is the movie Danny Boyle made before he made 'Trainspotting.' This movie is nothing like 'Trainspotting.' Not even close. It's like Hitchcock. It's like 'Bound.' Actually, it's a lot like 'Bound.' No lesbians, though. It's about three British kids (two male, one female; the female played by the delicious Kerry Fox) who split the rent on an almost unbelievably spacious apartment and are looking for someone to make it a four-way split. Considering how they verbally abuse and torment everyone who comes to their door to interview for the room, it's obvious they're not really looking all that hard. Eventually, though, they do find the perfect 'flat-mate.' He moves in, locks himself in his room, and then... Well, that would be giving too much away. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, Lethargic, Unconvincing, Over-Hyped Rubbish","review":"I absolutely hated this film. I can see what all the fuss was about though. When a film brands itself \\"contraversial\\", \\"hip\\" and \\"different\\" it is bound to be popular even without proper scrutiny. For a start the plot is predictable and slow (McGregor, Fox and Eccleston spend ages interviewing and intimidating prospective new flatmates which is just unbelievably tedious) and all the characters in this film are deeply unpleasent, vicious people for whom I felt no sympathy. Add that to poor storyline development, an unconvincing and irritating affair between Fox's character and both male leads and you have a complete hour and a half of garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"JUST ,WAS A OK TRILLER !!","review":"You know when comes to thriller & suspense movies, nothing comes close to American movies. I saw this shallow grave , week ago in my friend house. Glad didn't buy it or waste my money on it.

I have a working mum and don't have time to finish them. Jane Fonda's workout only take 25 min or so.

Always interesting exercises that can be modified if you are unable to perform all the moves and can be added to, perhaps with extra arm movements, to use a bit more energy.Not just walking on the spot but dance-type steps that are easily performed in the lounge room at home without moving all the furniture or kicking the table.In between Jane's older and new workouts, I have supplemented others but always come back to Jane, over and over, and I wish Jane made them more frequently."},{"rating":"2","title":"i love this dvd","review":"i love jane fonda's exercise techniques her work is proffessional and simple to follow i trust her advice and i feel her deep honesty and sincerity in delivering the workouts for her followers world wide"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple to do, great results","review":"I have been using Jane Fonda for years to lose weight.

I love them!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jane never disappoints - great workout","review":"In 1986 I got into doing Jane Fonda's Low Impact Aerobic tape. It was a great workout that I did 5 nights out of 7. My cardio vascular system was so much better and my body toned up. I did this exercise video for nearly 3 years until I got into running. In 1991 right after I had my son and wasn't quite ready to start running again, I did this exercise video again. I lost all the weight I gained in pregnancy and it acted as a trainer so I could start running again. Now 22 years later, I have some joint issues so running is not an option. I really wanted to get my 1986 VHS tape on DVD - wasn't to be found. So I found this Jane Fonda workout and it suits my needs. The adage is everything old is new again - that definitely works here. For anyone who wants a good at home workout - I recommend this DVD. Jane Fonda has perfected the art of aerobics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Working Out","review":"If you want some good old fashion stretching and toning, without all the pomp and ceremony, this is the way to go, Jane offers a no fuss exercise routine, that is easy to learn and becomes easy to do.

I've done some pretty hard workouts and this is a great workout with a minimal amount of time. The exercises are simple, but you can really get into them and work. There are so many times that you need to work out and you really don't want to have fancy footwork to deal with. This is it! You feel sore the next day, which is good, and there are three workouts to keep it from getting boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good workout","review":"You'll definitely generate a sweat with this workout. The mix of toning and aerobic work on the first set is really great. It keeps you motivated and the steps aren't very hard to learn.I do wish there was more ab work though. There are alot of squats. For the first section you'll just need a chair for support. The third section gets into weights for your legs and arms."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just as good, if not better, than Vol. 1","review":"I wrote a review for Vol. 1, so see that if you want to hear me gush over Kurt Busiek and George Perez.Vol. 2 is awesome.You get great continuing drama in the life of Scarlet Witch, The Vision, and Wonder Man, Issue #14 featuring The Beast (which is a lot of fun), and of course the four-part Ultron Unlimited story arc.A downside to this hardcover is 3 issues are written by Jerry Ordway, not Busiek, and they're just not as strong. Ordway writes a story about the Wrecking Crew, which is cool, and does a fine job keeping the characters rolling right along...but its lacking compared to the other issues.For some reason this book has become very very hard to get for cheap. I was fortunate to find it on the shelf of a Newbury Comics, for the list price of $29.99 not too long ago. So keep hunting and good luck true believers!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Messy Re-boot","review":"I was hoping that this series would pick up after the first volume, but no, it doesn't really work.

No.","review":"This book was so funny, tears where coming out of my eyes. But I wasnt scared. First, to be scary you need to feel for the characters.
