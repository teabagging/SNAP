If you're a fan of Roman Dirge's Lenore then this is probably right up your dark and creepy alley.Because the story is so short, it's kind of hard to give a review without giving away the ending.

Be aware, however, that 1) it is not spiral bound, so you'll need to get a large clip, 2) right-hand fingering is given on many, but not all, of the exercises, 3) the CD does not include samples of all the exercises, which isn't a problem if you have an instructor, but self-taught students will miss them (many of the more difficult exercises are on the CD, don't get me wrong, but just as many exercises are not, especially in the first several sections), and 4) the CD does not contain the other half of all the duet pieces in the book, so unless you have an instructor/partner, the duet portion of each exercise isn't useful. Remember, too, that you can find videos for free on the Internet to supplement the book (search YouTube) for things like finger technique.

I had an old hibachi years ago, but this has three times the grill size, and it's solidly built. Can even do indirect cooking with it.

The problem comes with the clean-up. I'm used to a kettle-type grill with an ash receiver underneath. But, this thing has a cast-iron cooking grid. Meat sticks to it like you would not believe. And, I have seasoned it, liberally, with lard. EVERY time you cook on it, meat sticks to the grid and you can't effectively brush it off with a grill brush, no matter how hot the grill is. Because the unit is small, cooking results in grease splattering everywhere - you literally can not pick the thing up without getting grease all over your hands. It does have a handle on it, but if you pick up the unit with the grid and front doors in place, it tilts to the front. It is necessary to remove the front doors. I'm sorry - I just don't like it. All my kettle grill requires is to dump in the charcoal, light it, put the cooking grid in place and use the grill brush on it - the old residue just falls down in the fire and burns up. For me, simpler is better."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened?!!!!","review":"My husband opened his Father's Day gift today. The Lodge Sportman's Grill is a great grill but there were no nuts and bolts in the box to put the grill together. So far the only way to contact the company is through the Amazon's return. it looks as if I will have to return this heavy item for replacement or refund as opposed to the company just sending me the nuts and bolts at no charge to me to rectify the situation. when someone contacts me I will right a better review. I have to give it one star because I am mad and disappointed that my husband could not use his gift today. Happy Father's Day!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cracked Grill","review":"Since you asked...Yes, I wanted to buy a product that was made in the USA out of cast iron and would last for a generation or two. I just received an emailed request from Amazon to review my purchase and happened to fire it up to grill some chicken tonight. To my dismay, I found a crack that went clear through one edge of the cooking surface. I am not too pleased. I have only had this Lodge Sportsman's grill for a matter of weeks and can count the number of times I have used it on my fingers.I have not abused the grill in any way. So what will Amazon or Lodge do to make this right? I would give the product more than just 2 stars if something can be done. Maybe this is just a casting flaw but I wouldn't want to give one of these grills as a gift and find out later that the thing broke after just a few uses. As heavy as it is, I would think that it would be sturdier."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective bolt hole","review":"I bought this and had it shipped to Japan where I live- it looks lovely but one of the bolt holes at the base is too small for the bolt- I broke a file trying to file it open..and am too far away to exchange.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little grill.","review":"Lodge makes a great product.

Long lasting and hard working. But this grill is nothing but an expensive Hibachi.It has a small surface and it needs a cover to use while cooking. Sorry I bought it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Neanderthals Designed This BBQ","review":"Robust construction throughout, but really lacks some subtle niceties that are found in less expensive BBQs. There's only two grill height settings and you cant easily change heights when the grill is hot and cooking (the grill surface itself flips over to cause the height change). There is a door provided to stoke the coals that appears to be a needless feature. The hibachi's feet are not insulated and can get pretty hot, so beware of placement on high-value surfaces. The draft door is heavy and easily separates from the body. The heavy door already tagged me once on the foot as I was emptying the BBQ of ash. Really?, I'd give it a 2 out of 10 for usefullness as compared to better designed hibachis that I've used in the past. Conclusion: the making of a cheap, convenient, and efficient cast iron Hibachi BBQ may very well be a lost art."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Grill","review":"This grill is perfect for smaller items and when you don't want to fire up the big grill. It uses about half the charcoal of my larger smoker and easily handles hotdogs and hamburgers for a family of five. We've had it about a month and have used it for burgers, steaks, lobster, and have confidence our snow crab legs are going to be perfect tonight!This grill will last a couple of lifetimes if cared for properly. It must be cleaned after each use; moisture + ash = lye. Lye + cast iron = rust. We followed another reviewer's suggestion and vacuum the ash out with our shop vac. Also, ours is stored indoors, though I'm sure a shed would work fine.All around a great hibachi grill!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Meets expectations but heavy","review":"This is a quality grill but it is heavier than I expected it would be. I suppose it's to be expected since it is all cast iron. The one disappointment is that, unlike a Weber kettle that can be shut down by closing all airways and capping it with the hood, there's no way to \\"soffocate\\" the burning coals in this Lodge grill once the cooking is done. You have to wait until they burn down. This is a waste of fuel unless you're cooking for a long, long time. Perhaps Lodge could come up with a way to cover the grill top and cut off the oxygen to the coals once the cooking is done. This being said, the grill is a good quality tabletop grill."},{"rating":"2","title":"a superb grill for two people","review":"After one use I retired my Webber.

Bravo to the designers and production dept at Lodge."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cast Iron Hibachi","review":"This item, although expensive in my mind, is high quality and works well. It is \\"cured\\" from the factory and can be set up and used in minutes. It is flexible in the ways you can set up the grill and it has a draft slide to control the heat. The only drawback is when you carry it with the wire handle, it isn't balanced well. It will likely last a lifetime unless left out in the rain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lodge logic L410 Charcoal Grill","review":"I really like this grill. I think I paid a little more then it's selling now. I would have given a five star but there are couple of things I dislike. One, the Lodge logo in the center of the grate is just not a good idea.

My wife has long complained about the lack of true grilled flavor and serious grill marks. And this grill delivers both great tasting and good looking food.Everything we've tried has been terrific, steaks, pork chops, lamb chops and burgers.However, when it is time to do a roast or a turkey we'll have to fire up the Weber but otherwise the Lodge is the way to go."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tennessee Hibachi","review":"Have owned this product five weeks and used it several times to cook hamburgers, London broil, steaks. It produces excellent results and is relatively easy to use. The cooking grate can only be set at two levels: standing on its posts or inverted, lying on the rim of the firebox. The level must be chosen before you start cooking, which presents a problem for some preparations. The damper seems to have little effect on cooking temperature. Emptying ash is a bit awkward, as you need to remove the doors and coal grate, then lift and tip the firebox, which is heavy. The lip catches some ash, so it is difficult to completely empty. Be sure to set the grill on a pan, as grease will leak through and collect around the legs."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Agree--The Best Charcoal Grill on the Market","review":"The Lodge charcoal grill was the answer to my outdoor cooking needs. With nearly all its parts made of cast iron, this grill is made to last. It's easy to put together, and if properly cared for (don't leave it out in the rain!), will grill your steaks, chicken, fish or veggies for years to come. Its two-position grilling surface (just turn it over) is big enough for two or three people; there's a sliding draft door near the base, and a flip-down door on the side that can be opened to redistribute the charcoal. The Lodge Sportsman's Grill is easy to clean; like any cast iron cookware, the grilling surface should be scrubbed and re-seasoned on a fairly regular basis, but this is a small price to pay for such a fine product. This is one of the best purchases that I've made in some time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outside cooking","review":"When my husband wanted to buy this I wasn't sure that we would use it but when it was on sale on friday with free shipping we ordered it. We have used it several times, the hamburgers cooked on it are some of the best that I have ever eaten and it doesn't take long to cook or to start the charcoal in the chimney starter. Thanks,"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Product","review":"Well-made, sturdy grill...a snap to assemble. I'm glad I bought this pre-seasoned one. It is large enough to grill 7-8 burgers or 3-4 steaks. You will want to buy a cover if you intend to leave it outside. You may carry it from inside to out each time, but, being cast iron, it is heavy for it's size. Unlike any other charcoal grills I have owned, this one should last a lifetime if it is not allowed to rust. Amazon delivery was prompt as always."},{"rating":"2","title":"old is new again","review":"When my husband's father was 99yrs old he presented him with old Atlanta Stoveworks Grill(same patent as Lodge)he had bought from some Sea Scouts on the beach in Fort Pierce,Fla. He had been cooking on it for at least 30 yrs. We brought it home and used it regularly.It was the favorite of our 4 grills.

We wouldn't ever want to be without one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A true heavyweight...","review":"and I don't just mean it's heavy 35+ pounds. This little grill is without a doubt the best I've ever used or owned. I purchased a Silver Smoker BBQ a few years ago and found that it really is only great for slow smoked BBQ. So, last summer I bought this grill so I could have my steaks, hamburgers and kabobs. I use it almost every weekend in the summer. My wife asked me what I wanted for my birthday this year and I said, \\"I want another lodge grill.\\" I put both my grills on my dutch oven table and I now have plenty of cooking space for entertaining. Keep in mind this thing is cast iron and needs to be properly maintained if you are going to be happy with it. It takes a little work but the payoff is well worth the effort. This is one of those things that will be passed down to future generations of outdoor grill lovers in my family."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible Cast Iron Hibachi!","review":"This thing is awesome! Just big enough to cook for a small get together, but small enough to fire up for just two. I currently have 8 different Weber Grill/Smokers - but I find I use this grill more than any of them.

TheLodge Logic 5-Quart Pre-Seasoned Dutch Ovenfits perfectly on top, and you could probably get two of them to fit without issue.It's also nice to place in the center of the table and everyone can cook their foods on it, then after cook marshmallows.

I also use the charcoal chimmney starter for my coals, OMG, just easy peazy and none of that nasty lighter fluid taste to ruin our food. I will be using this at least 2 or 3 times a week all year long. I have been a fan and user of cast iron for many years now and once you are used to them, you will never ever go back to non-stick, which is just junk!

Parts fit well and are well-finished. Replacement parts are available, so this really should last a lifetime with care.Using a chimney charcoal starter with a few sheets of newspaper and no fluid, coals are ready for cooking in 10 minutes. Always wipe the cooking grate with a high smoke-point oil like canola prior to and after cooking and the seasoning gets better with each use. Lodge sells a stiff brush specifically for cleaning their cast iron products. It looks a little cheap, but works very well on cleaning the grate when used with very hot water and maybe some mild soap.Heed the warnings about placing on a heat-proof surface as it will scorch the surface below.This is perfect for burgers, brats, steaks, and chops. Works well for chicken parts, but not a whole bird."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome.","review":"Simply put: awesome. It's heavy, and it holds heat forever. I love this thing. If you really pile on the coals, you will have a raging hot cast iron habachi grill. But you can also load half of the grill and cook for two with very little charcoal. The fire door is more handy than I originally expected -- allowing me to add coals a few at a time to keep the temperature perfect. The draft door actually works too. Everything about this grill is awesome.And who doesn't love cast iron? This thing is very thick, very heavy seasoned cast iron. There are a total of 5 parts which come apart easily, making cleaning this thing almost enjoyable (and way easier than a weber).This is the perfect companion to my smoker."},{"rating":"2","title":"turning up the heat","review":"Had looked at this grill for weeks and couldn't decide, just knew I wanted to cook outdoors but wasn't sure what style I wanted.

She counts herself fortunate when she gets two cases at once, but she soon regrets her decision to take them both. Her first client is a young teenage boy who hires Carlotta to track down a 14-year-old girl who is missing. The second case involves Carlotta's longtime friend and ex-boss, Lieutenant Mooney, who asks her to track down a missing witness who can testify for him in a case against a man who accuses him of assault. As these two cases unfold, Carlotta has to deal with two irresponsible plumbers who threaten to turn her bathroom into a garish horror. Author Barnes artlessly weaves the criminal cases in with Carlotta's personal life which is often hilarious and never dull. This is a worthy follow-up to Trouble of Fools, the first book of this enjoyable series."},{"rating":"2","title":"A series that's growing on me","review":"I wasn't so sure about Carlotta when I read the first book, but she's really starting to grow on me. I'm not reading them in any particular order - which might be helpful, but isn't really necessary because the focus of the book is really the mystery, not the side bits of fluff (though in this book, the side bits were really good). Barnes creates great characters, good plot lines and a nice pace - pretty much all you can ask for in a mystery. I would recommend her Carlotta Carlisle series to anyone who likes a laid back, good ole armchair mystery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cliche-packing PI cracks smart!","review":"The Snake Tattoo runs only 220 pages or so in hardcover, but it seemed like 520, given the number of PI/police procedural cliches packed into this formulaic little number.

Turn the cliche machine off, now!This book is full of calculatedly 'quirky' characters right from central casting, but with a little side trip to marketing to give them 'edge': the sexy but emotionally volatile girl PI. The outwardly tough but soft-hearted cop. The politically correct cast of supporting characters who exhibit all the right attributes of 'diversity' except any remotely interesting characterization.The plot is predictable and overwrought.Finally, Barnes insists on using her protagonist to spout off what are obviously her own ideological biases: just a hint, Linda -- intelligent readers find this boring and insulting.Don't waste your time on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the films it rips-off","review":"Two words neatly sum up why this silly FATAL ATTRACTION/BASIC INSTINCT rip-off is better than the just-as-silly films it imitates: Yancy Butler. Glenn Close and Sharon Stone are simply no match for the intense level of comic ferocity Yancy generates with her truly terrific performance in THE EX -- she's the femme fatale to end all femme fatales. It's not just that she's pure evil, she's pure evil and she's lovin' it! She's exuberantly sexy and sinister and a lot of fun to watch. Which is a good thing, because other than the consciously (I think) campy script, she's the only thing this indifferently directed film has going for it. And since she's the only character with any life in her, you end up rooting for her to win, and are bitterly disappointed when she doesn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Herz ~ Rosenstolz","review":"This is good music and is easier for german learners to understand than Rammstein.

There is not one colorful insight into this fascinating, world-changing woman. If there was even a hint of love or respect, or even curiosity about his subject, the author never reaveals it. There is an inexcusable failure on the author's part to make this famous lady 'touchable'. He discredits her faith with one stroke of his pen and rambles about the more cerebral parts of her life and work. Yes, she was interested in other things besides helping people but I don't care to know about how many bugs she collected and how many famous persons she socialized with. I want to know about Dorothea Dix! This was one of the most discursive, spiritless biographies I have read in many years.

The lush arrangements of Souther's synths mixed with the ethereal sequences of von Bingen combine to form a tapestry that is not only sensual but downright erotic at times. Track 2 - O ignis Spiritus Paracliti - is a prime example. Cello's dark harmonies with the slow, driving beat lay a rich throb to accompany Sister Germaine and Ms. Riain's angelic melodies. Interspersed between the lyricism is Souther's own complex, yet appealing, contrapuntal accompaniments.Fans of Deleirium's \\"Karma,\\" Dead Can Dance, and other beat-driven ambient works may profit greatly from listening to this recording and its prequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coming Home","review":"Oh my goodness, just a few days ago I had never heard of either Richard Souther or Saint (and I write that with the greatest reverence) Hildegard von Bingen.

My music tastes are many and varied, but of late the likes of MYTHOS, Bluestone, Pilgramage have been my constant companions as I journey with the Spirit on a quest of self discovery. As my subject header indicates, the further I travel the closer I get to home. The music of Hildegard von Bingen and the amazing accompanying etheral vocals have truly brought me home. It is of my opinion that Richard Souther has added another dimemmsion to the music. I am not a purist, but even so this collection of songs with the soft keyboards and synths only add to the magic. I could not think of a time when listening to this music would not be welcomed.Where ever Hildegard is now I hope she can feel my love."},{"rating":"2","title":"Illumination","review":"For a beginning introduction to Hildegarde von Bingen's music, I don't think one could do betterthan this album with Richard Souther.

While the design works great and is very comfortable to use, the blade splinters my cat's claws, even when cutting vertically across the claw as directed. This happened starting with the first use, so the blade should have been more than sharp at that point. Now, I stick to using human nail clippers on her claws and achieve much superior results."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun, if abbreviated, recording","review":"A nifty performance of one of Broadway's classic scores. The biggest problem is that just about everything is slightly abridged (mostly verses, connecting material, dialogue underscoring and choral repeats--although if I'm reading the vocal score right, most of this would still be interesting to listen to); still, a reasonably good taste of the whole thing. The liner notes also don't really give a story synopsis, so if you aren't familiar with the plot, seek out a summary so you aren't completely confused by what is going on. Rise Stevens' acting is pretty mannered, and she goes over the top vocally every now and then; she seems to be shouting, not singing at the end of \\"Jenny.\\" Adolph Green is hysterically funny and acquits himself supremely well in \\"Tchaikovsky.\\" How you'll enjoy the appendix of Danny Kaye's recordings depends on how much you like Danny Kaye--enough said."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of your money","review":"This is a very poorly designed sprayer. As soon as the liquid drops below the level of the intake from the hose (which is near the top), you begin to pump air instead of whatever you put in it.I had to tip the whole thing on it's side and pump at the same time to get the liquid in the hose to spray.Even when it was working right, the sprayer is not that even."},{"rating":"2","title":"great spayer for commercial work","review":"I have used these sprayers professionally for 2 yrs. they're perfect.

It's an interesting story about these characters, but doesn't deal with the history of Bombay Beach and the Salton Sea (which is the story that most interests me), so I was disappointed.

I give the film high marks for visuals and technique but I found the film surreal and contrived. I was particularly disappointed that the residents of the Salton Sea community were asked to \\"perform\\". It's as if they are just following a script and the result is somewhat wooden and contrived. The waltz scene made me uncomfortable. I did appreciate, however, the director's intent to make the Salton Sea community a poetic commentary but I don't think the objective was obtained."},{"rating":"1","title":"A pointless road to nowhere","review":"An un-interesting collection of random scenes of a few underprivileged people living near the Salton Sea. There is no narration - just some comments by the people in the film. Can't see how this won any rewards.

But we replaced some 15 year old bose speakers with some brand new klipsch and that made all the difference in the world!!!! We mostly use it for movies and it really helps give the movie theater effect we were looking for!It is a pretty big box, so you need to have a place for it in your room.

Mine failed, and two of three of my neighbors (coincidence!) experienced identical failures. Oddly, the one other neighbor has NOT had this problem. His phone looks like it went through a blender - beat to death and scarred, dropped, kicked, submerged, but it works great.For eighty bucks? Nah. Not worth the risk. Plenty of better stuff available.

On the edges of where they cut the sub hole, it was all broken and looked like they beat it with a hammer. So I first used wood glue to gule all along the edge and clamp it and let it dry over night. Then I did the same thing with epoxy glue to both sub holes. Last I had to put some door sealant on each subs edge where it scews to the sub box so no air would come out. Finally after a week I scewed them back together and hooked them back up. They were 10 times better and vibrated my whole car. Everything else was real great! The subs sounded great and the rest of the sub box was real nice. Carpet was real flat and smooth.Also the blue LEDs make the subs glow.

Esta interpretación de las suites inglesas de Bach no es la excepción, sino que se trata de una de las mejores versiones que he escuchado; bajo las manos de Leonhardt el clavecín se vuelve un instrumento realmente extraordinario, impidiendo que el oído se canse del sonido tan peculiar de este instrumento.

The only weakness I feel is the constant use of only two or three main themes with very little variation in their orchestration. However, that is a tiny quibble with an otherwise masterly score. Doyle's use of 20th century sounds (some atonal canonic writing and Stravinksyesque rhythms) gives this score just the right edge to balance the lush Romanticism of the main themes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Melodious, Moving and Monumental!","review":"While I love modern film scores with the wild action sequences (Hans Zimmer, etc), there is something so amazing when you find a score that plays out like a classical symphony.

The brother isn't referenced much beyond the opening, this is all about Alanna's trials as grows into womanhood serving as gender disguised page in a major city.Pacing flows well, the story is interesting though could have used more description, and I finished reading in two hours.

Its a great read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"As I think of this book, I drift into a happy nostalgia...","review":"I first saw this book in my public library when I was around seven years old. I read it, and I adored it. Now, eight years later, I am re-reading the Song of the Lioness Quartet. What is a high school student doing reading a book she read in the second grade, you might ask? I will have to answer you that I am loving it. I have read this series many times and so know most every twist and turn of the plot, but each time I come away with something new along with my happy nostalgia. These characters were throughout my childhood my alternate personae, my imaginary friends, and my key to a different world. I love these books dearly, and hope that people from years to come will, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Socecery, Swash-buckling, and Cross-dressing","review":"Alanna switches places with her twin brother, disguising herself as a boy to train as a knight. Can she keep it from the others at the palace, and what happens when she doesn't always want to be a boy? Does she have what it takes to become a knight?This is my favorite of Tamora Pierce's books. As with Mercedes Lackey, her first character seems to be her most genuine, though as with Lackey, you can tell that Pierce learned much about how plot went together throughout this series.This is a great book for middle school and younger high school readers. Girls get into it easier, as the heroine is a girl, but there is enough action that boys tricked into picking it up do manage to stay interested. Warning: there is *gasp* sex in the series.As a side note, anyone having the chance to meet Tamora Pierce should do so. She's a pretty awesome woman."},{"rating":"2","title":"An AMAZING book","review":"Durring the summer I do a lot of reading. But no matter how many books i read, this one is still one of my favorites. The other books in the Quartet are just as good. Tamora Pierce combined all my favorite elments of a book, magic, mystery, adventure, and an awesome heroine. I'd recomend this book to anyone. I'm sure you will enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"So Good I got banned from reading it","review":"I have read it so many times my mom banned me from them (all books by Tamora Pierce)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alanna","review":"Ijust totaly loved these books!

It really captivates Alanna's feelings and thoughts during her stay in Corus. I would recommend it to anybody who could handle slightly adult content.My only complaint is that Alanna seems a bit too 'capable' to be real. After all, what other scrawny 13-year-old could handle a sword as large and heavy as she was? You tell me."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best books i have EVER read in my life!","review":"Oh my gosh! I love Tamora's books! I am a write, she's who inspired me. I was reading Alanna the First Adventure, and we were in the car, i felt like i was asleep, but i was really reading the book, not that it was boring. but everything else around me just kind of dissappeared and nothing else mattered. I've read all of her books that have come out so far, and i've read them eight times i think. Anyone who likes adventure, fun, a little love, stubborness (like me) and a few great books should read tamora's books for sure. I know that i'm only 13, but i've read a lot of books, and like i said, these are definitly number one on my list."},{"rating":"2","title":"YEAH!","review":"Good book it shows no matter what or who you are dreams can come true and magic is real.

This novel shows a young girls life in a fun and exciting way. Unlike other medieval novels that just tell the information, Alanna the First Adventure made the reader want to read and learn more. It was a very informational book. The novel tells about knighthood, many Medieval cities, and the hardships of being a female in the Middle Ages. This is a novel that allows readers to learn about the past in a different view and make them realize how fortunate they are. I recommend this book to readers that are interested in achieving their goals, no matter what it takes. Clearly, Alanna the First Adventure is a fantastic book that many different types of people would enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alanna: The First Adventure is for all ages (really!)","review":"Alanna, a noble girl of Tortall, knows what to expect from the life of a noble woman: first years of learning to be a Lady, then having a husband chosen for her, and having children.

It immediately became my favorite book of all time. I am in eleventh grade now and I still love it. Before today (when I finaly checked out amazon) i didn't know any one else had ever read this book. Alanna is a very intriguing character and her adventures, struggles, and growth as the first female warrior of her time appeal to everyone. I was drawn by the magic-that's the kind of person i am. The one friend imanaged to get interested in alanna was into her difficulties with romance. Others will appreciate her struggle to achieve her dreams in spite of everything against her. After 5 years i have only managed to get only one of my friends interested in Alanna. I hope i've convinced all you out there to GET THIS BOOK--you will enjoy it for any number of reasons, trust me."},{"rating":"1","title":"I cant say I loved it","review":"I am sorry but this book did not take me any where. I would have gave it a 1 but it had a good plot. Tamora Pierce's books do not pull me in. They go to fast and don't have enough details. I also wish they told more about her brother. I would NOT recomend this to boys. For reasons if you read this book you will understand. I know many people like it so don't take the book the wrong way. I just didn't like it. The next series that starts with Tricksters Queen looks much better. Even the title is better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book","review":"This book was really enjoyable.

I recommend this book to EVERYONE."},{"rating":"2","title":"I couldn't put it down!!!","review":"Alanna, the First Adventure is great! If I could, I'd give this book more than five stars. I recommend it to everybody, but especially people who like to read about strong, intelligent women. So if you're reading this right now (of course you are) STOP! Buy this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book for young girls who enjoy being different!","review":"This book has a lot to say about traditional gender roles in a way that can be easily understood by young girls. A number of \\"why\\" questions are addressed, and the main character has to be savvy, tough, and accept being a female to boot. Great read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What you've all been looking for!","review":"I remember standing in the library staring at the cover of this book when I was much too young to be able to read it. I checked it out anyway but only got through the first couple of pages . . . yet somehow the image of the girl-knight stuck with me and made me search out the same tantalizing book cover years later. And now after devouring every book Tamora Pierce has ever written, I can tell you that THIS BOOK is the one you've been waiting for. Somehow this book managed to be exactly whwat I'd always hungered to read. I couldn't design a better playground for my imagination if I tried. It's just amazing how Ms. Pierce knows exactly what her readers want in a book and a heroine. If you like this book or the rest of the Tortall books e-mail me sometime."},{"rating":"2","title":"Allana amazes me with fierce courage.","review":"Allana is an amazing girl that wants to become a knight.

I recommend it especially to young people."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"HI this was one of the best books that i ever read!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I wasn't expecting this book for a elementary grade and didn't enjoy it at all. All the sentences so short and nothing exciting happening in the book. If you are an adult don't buy only for kids."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flimsy fantasy","review":"I read the first three books of this series...and it was all I could do to smile weakly at the person who highly recommended it to me. The basic plot sounds enticing, but it lacks body. The writing is weak and stiff and really lacks imaginative whim beyond the main adventure bit, leaving an exceedingly dry read for seasonsed fantasy readers.Some people seem to think this story is one of the few that offers a strong female heroine. I suggest Margaret Mahy's THE CHANGEOVER or Libba Bray's GREAT AND TERRIBLE BEAUTY as more satisfying alternatives (for young teens to adults).Parents may also want to preview the book before offering it to children. There are some questionable scenes, which aren't detailed, but still suggest a somewhat mature target audience."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book was great! I liked the other 3 books better.","review":"This is a really cool book. Alanna is feisty and full of determination. This series really starts to get great in the other 3 books. That's where all the action takes place. I'm not saying that there's no action in this book, just not as much as in the others. I urge anyone who reads this to check out the other 3 books as well. Also take a look at The Immortals series. They're great books, too!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's such a great book. E-mail me to talk about it!!!!!","review":"First time I read this book I couldn't put it down, I've read it along with the rest of the series 6 times!! Everyone in my class wanted to borrow it!!!When everyone had read it, we sat down and discussed it! That is very strange. There are only a couple of serious readers in my class.I myself read at least two thick chapter books a week, and I'm the lightest!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a must read...","review":"Her Tortall books r a must! this is the first (with beka as a prequil). i love them all.

While walking down a back ally I saw this book laying on the in the gutter. When I got off the road to get it a car sped by. I would have been hit if I had not gotten off the road. Overall this book is a work of art. I have read it over 47 times! The front cover has come off the original, but I have five other copies! A must have for any daring young girl (or boy), Alanna shows great courage and good descions. She is role model to me! She is a great charater all through her books!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Whoa!","review":"Goddess ya'll you havn't lived until you have read this book. Tamora Pierce developes the characters beautifuly and really zooms in on Alanna, the spunky girl who is determined to win her shield, no-matter what! And let me tell you is there plenty in store for her! The Song of the Lioness Quartet will make you fall over with anticapation, I've read it three times, every book!If you've read Wild Magic, but not these, here is your chance to meet the one and only Alanna (alias Alan) of Trebond. Not to mention Jonathan, Thayet, George, Myles, Gary, Roger the Duke of Conte\` and plenty others. You won't regeret it, let alone forget it. \\"I swear on my honor as a gentleman (you'd better swear by something else since you've got no honor!)\\" That's just a joke you have to read the book to get it!Love, Purple Lady"},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite series of all-time","review":"I think Tamora Pierce created a masterpiece with this series, and I am quite disapointed with her CIRCLE OF MAGIC books. But the IMMORTALS were okay. I have read this series so many times that sometimes I feel as if I AM Alanna... It takes real talent to create a book/series that makes you feel this way. I only wish they had Alanna's story in hardcover... my paperbacks are wearing thin. If you love Pierce's books, you NEED to try Sherwood Smith's CROWN AND COURT DUEL books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific !!!","review":"The first book in the Song of the Lioness Quartet is great! The book starts off a bit slowly but if you read to about page 70 you will not want to put the book down. If you like the Harry Potter books than these are the books for you. Tamora Pierce has you hooked just as well as J.K. Rowling, though this book may appeal more to girls. Also if you are looking for a good magical fantasy you will love these books. They have all sorts of puzzling events, Magical happenings, and much more. This book is the coolest read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"T''was Okay...I suppose","review":"It was an alright book, for a bit of light reading. I'm twelve and I like fantasy novels, but this one didn't really do what it could have done. It had a lot of potential, but hasn't done anything about it. Hopefully the 2nd, 3rd and if I could be bothered by then 4th book will have more of a storyline. I would DEFINATELY reccomend this book if you are prepared to read the other books in the series before you get a storyline. So, really, it was a great introductory book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Basic moral values","review":"Is no one bothered by the essential lack of values in this book? Getting what you want is more important than honesty or respect for others. The main character threatens others with horrible, supernatural punishment, tricks her father, lies outrightly, and that's just in the first chapter.What about integrity, justice, truth as foundations of doing right?Compare this heroine with Jonas in The Giver, Frodo in The Lord of the Rings, Andy in Wolf Rider, or Karana in The Island of the Blue Dolphins."},{"rating":"2","title":"I just love this book, it's the best ever written!","review":"I don't know how many times I read this book, no all four of them! I read it for the first time when I was in 5th grade, and I still read it when I fell like it, and I'm now 17! I remember taking the book to all my classes and reading it under the desk. When I then moved to Tokyo I took it, of course, with me. This book envoked a feeling in me, I can't describe but since I read it, my greatest wish is to become a writer by myself and to fascinate people like me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"How can I say how brilliant it is in 1 line?","review":"This book has been a favourite of mine for almost 5 years (which is a third of my life!). I find it to be touching and absolutely wonderful. I have lent the series to at least 6 people now and not one of them has been able to stop reading until they finished not only it but the other 3 books about Alanna and 4 about Daine. And that I think says it all. I really would recommend this book to anyone without hesitation and I would like to thank Tamora Pierce for them."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book was the highlight of my childhood readings!","review":"I started reading the series when I was in the eighth grade and I wish I started sooner. This peticular book is one of my favorite. I opens up a world of adventure, love, and; in my case, soul searching. It helped me see what was in myself and by doing so, made me a stronger person. My sincer thanks to Tamora Pierce!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Book Ever!!!!!","review":"I LOVE Tamora's books. I have the Lioness series and the Immortal series. When I read the book, its like stepping into a candy store and you don't know what to you'll get. I also like the book, because it proves that women aren't useless obejects and that we can do anything better or the same as men! Women Rule and so do these books!"},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BOOK TO SET THE STANDARDS","review":"Alanna was the first science fiction/fantasy book that I ever read, and since then I've read it at least one thousand times! Before I buy a book now, I think of Alanna, and that's how I judge it. If it's not as good as Alanna, then it's not worth buying. The tale was marvelous and well told, and no one but Tamora Pierce could have pulled it off. I've read all of her books, and am eagerly awaiting the next books in the Tortall serries. If you haven't read Pierce's work, then you just haven't experienced the non-stop adventure, romance, and just plain good writing that is expected in a book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Girl with the Power","review":"Alanna is a very brave girl, or should I say boy? She is a magical child who wants to become a knight. Her brother, Thom, on the other hand, would rather wear a dress than be in the army. So that's exactly what he does. Alanna and Thom switch places. But what Alanna doesn't know is that she will come across people and places that are so dangerous that her powers alone aren't enough to stop them. This is a wonderful story that will have you laughing and crying your way through it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A heroine that fails to disappoint.","review":"Admittedly a huge fan of the \\"women-warrior, disguised as a man\\" characters, I have been disappointed time and again by peoples take on them, but not this time. The take on magic, the involvement of the gods, and the world, which holds different morals, gave to a very interesting atmosphere for the books to be set in. Alanna is a character that I couldn't help cheering for, and identifying with.Granted as others point out, this is very obviously a first novel that will kick-off a series. And while I did enjoy it, I do prefer to have series of novels have the ability to be stand-alones.A terrific kick-off, to what I hope to be a wonderful series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tamora writes like a godess herself!","review":"I only gave this book 4 stars because the beginning is sort of boring, but it gets better towards the end! Tamora has created a book full of magic and wonder. A migical world packed with scorcery, warrior princesses, strange creatures, and heart stopping battles with evil spirits. This book will be sure to catch your attention....at least, more towards the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good read","review":"This book was good and I enjoyed it. I also thought it was nice to see someone wrighting about how girls are just as good as boys."},{"rating":"2","title":"SURPREME","review":"This book was great. A must read.

And even though it took me 1 day to read each book I just couldn't stop until I was done!"},{"rating":"2","title":"MY FAVORITE BOOK!!(15 year old book worm)","review":"I read this book when I was in 6th grade. I hated reading before I got my hands on T.P.'s books. She can write books that abosorb you totally to the point you don't want to stop reading even if it is 2o'clock in the morning(I'd know!). If people say anything about it being not age approiate for young readers they are wrong.

It is a great read and reccemend to anyone who likes a good read.LONG LIVE TORTALL! (and tamora p i love your books!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A fairly basic beginning","review":"First of a childrens' fantasy series, this is the story of Alanna, a pre-pubescent noble girl who conspires with her twin brother Thom such that they each get sent where they want for training--she wants to be a warrior knight and he wants to be a sorcerer. Alanna changes her name to Alan and heads off to the castle for knight's training in Thom's place and he heads for the convent to begin training his magic Gift. This is made possible by a father who is a scholar with his head in his studies and somewhat indifferent and inattentive to his children.Of course trouble starts brewing the next year when \\"Alan\\" begins developing into a woman, but she is determined to find out what her dreams and visions of the black city mean. While this was an okay story, the writing was just a bit too simplistic and \\"young\\" for me. It only took a couple of hours to read, and while I think it would be a good story for children, I don't think it's a series I will pursue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tamara Pierce","review":"I love Tamora Pierce books I have all of them that are available on CD...Amazon was the lowest price around and I checked them all...

This is the first book in the quartet, and I highly reccomend it to any fantasy lover. Its not written like Tolkien, but has has bits of humor and an interesting story line. Some people say that this series follows the typical storyline; girl becomes first female knight fights villain etc, but I think this is one of the most unique books ever written, and I've been unable to find anything like it!

I really enjoyed it although it is mind boggeling from the start. you really need to read on to understand the story. Tamora Pierce must have had to think long and hard to come up with the caracters and background.It was great to read and it gave me something to do when Iwas bored. the book has lots of action and adventure but with of passion.

However, it is not appropriate for children under 14. The reading level is not that difficult, but the content is for upper grades. This book inadvertently appeared on my daughter's third grade reading list. She did not understand why Alanna's sheet were \\"smeared with blood\\" She also had lots of questions about fertility cycles, sleeping with men and getting pregnant."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I could give it negative stars.","review":"I agree with those people who have given this book negative reviews. I am amazed at how popular this series is. Not only is she a bland and wooden writer, Pierce is also an irresponsible one -- particularly in her depiction of the sex scenes that occur later in the series. Why were they necessary? Definitely not appropriate (not to mention, excessively dreary and boring). Please, please read some other children's fantasy, such as Garth Nix's \\"Sabriel\\" or Pullman's \\"Golden Compass\\" or Patricia C. Wrede's Enchanted Forest series. Far superior writing, plots, and character development. All these books have great female heroines who are far more three dimensional and original than Alanna."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expected much more entertainment","review":"Just as stated above, this piece of \\"literature\\" is an unfulfilling and truely dissapointing bookk. I personally prefer other fantasy writers like SHERWOOD SMITH, especially CROWN DUEL and COURT DUEL. Alanna is for child-like readers with little imagination, COURT DUEL is deeper, more mature, and suberbly compelling...oh yeah...the romance factors are much higher."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"Tamora Pierce's popularity is the unfortunate result of the whole Harry Potter phenomenon. Simply because Pierce is a fantasy children's writer, bookstores have been pushing her books. \\"If you like Rowling, you'll love Pierce\\" is the slogan. I'm a big fan of fantasy books for children, and I eagerly read this book. It completely bored me (plus, what's up with the sex?). The protagonist is annoying and uninteresting. My mind felt like it was rotting as I was reading Pierce's simplistic books. If you want some good children's fantasy books (or good books in general), read Diana Wynne Jones. She's way better than Rowling, and it's complete blasphemy to speak of Pierce in the same breath as DWJ. DWJ has wit, depth, and originality. I would take her books with me on a deserted island since I'm always discovering new things about her stories every time I re-read them. Start off with _Howl's Moving Castle_ (now there's an interesting female protagonist!) and go on from there."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't like this book. BORING CHARACTERS/TOO EASY","review":"I didnt like this book, it didnt do m uch for me. it was too easy and I wish I didn't waste my time (and money) on this book.

Blah."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heroine hops into bed with just about every male character","review":"Although I felt the storyline was pretty good for the four books in this series, I was very disappointed in the moral standards. As the heroine gains new skills and new experiences, becoming a superwoman, she fails to develop one of the most important qualities: self-respect. A lot of bed-hopping, little romance. A poor example for todays teens."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST EVER, ABSOLUTE BEST!","review":"If the rates went any higher I really would pick it.

Miss Treadwell's mother is a psychic--communing with Max who searches the Beyond for the dearly (or not so dearly) departed.

Absolutely delightful as usual!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hedgehogs cannot digest corn","review":"From what I've been learning about hedgies, this food would be highly unsuitable for their dietary requirements, as they cannot digest corn and this food contains corn-based ingredients at and near the top of the list.

He is also at his most cautious here, which takes some of the fun out of a Heller record, which is usually a rollercoaster ride. But the unusual choice of material coupled with a solid groove organ combo base is the kind of thing that wins over the sort of jazz people who don't enjoy the forays into bluegrass, surf, klezmer, and other styles that make his guitar style so interesting. If your taste is more traditional jazz, this is the perfect starter. But if you're into jazz outside the box, you'd do better with Mean Things Happening In This Land or Bear Flag."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what the picture shows","review":"Hi I just received the watch from Amazon.And i am very dissapointed with the quality.

The Emersons never manage to get so near the the heart of this music; the Italians are often too slow and reverential. To me, the only rivals are the Pro Arte and the Calvet - both pre-war Quartets, neither of which came anywhere near to recording the full Beethoven repertoire.But my main purpose is to point out that Budapest collectors do have an alternative for Quartet No. 13, Op.130. The 1934 HMV recording with Ipolyi on viola was reissued on Biddulph two years ago. coupled with Op.59 No.2 from 1935 (ASIN:B000EBFMDU). It was doubtless the existence of this recording which prevented its commercial duplication by Sony in the early 1940's. Whether or not it is preferable to the Library of Congess version on Bridge is a moot point. Neither recording is sonically up to the standard of these four by Sony."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a piece of...","review":"Here's a hint, if you end up buying this, which I hope you don't do, please don't follow the instructions as illustrated. If you do and you find that you can't assemble the pieces because the angle they're saying to screw the pieces in is impossible you will not be able to take it apart without destroying the furniture.

If she had written this story as something unique that happened to her, that would have been fine. However, her claims that Asian traditions hinder the formation of family relationships are based purely on her beliefs, not on any research on her part. The generalizations lack maturity and her writing sounds whiney. Poorly written."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent review of Canal's history, function and lifestyle","review":"I am using this book to research my Civil War novel, which takes place, in part, along the Canal. The book has proven quite valuable both for its medium-detail history, and for its first-hand descriptions of the Canal's function, and the lives of Canal families. (The Canal functioned in much the same manner throughout its history, so the first-hand accounts provide a good window to earlier days.)The book is well-written, clearly a labor of love for the Maryland author. It is a good historical source, and a fun read for those planning a visit to the Canal (now a National Historical Park.) There are also some funny, sad and astonishing anecdotes, giving the reader a good \\"feel\\" for the lives of the Canal folk.Paul M.

There's plenty there for both the mind and the heart and soul. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"A novel that the careful reader would enjoy...","review":"This poetic novel is not only moving, but is intelligent and measured. The author is attuned to the pressures compelling her characters and to the sources of their longing. Sharratt has written a beautiful tale of the power of language to create stories that inhabit and transfigure our lives. There is much to be admired in this book. I recommend this book to anyone who reads in order to approach a deeper understanding of the conflicting experiences that enrich and complicate our lives. The book shimmers with a subtle clarity rare even to the realm of literature. A miracle of a book. Her weaving of the fairy tales into her narrative was magical and seamless."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointing plot turn","review":"When I began this book, I greatly enjoyed the lovely language, etc. However, midway through the book one of the main characters is discovered to have seeminly ulterior motives - we had thought she was gentle, giving and unselfish and apparantly had predatory designs instead. It was a great disappointment. I have only so many hours available to read, and I'm sorry I spent some of them on this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Student Favorite","review":"There are a couple of outstanding basic organizational communication textbooks available, but this one seems to be the favorite of students.This book has a brief, concrete, and accessible approach.

The work could be titled \\"Advice your mentor wants you to know.\\" or \\"How we wish everyone in organizations would communicate.\\"This book is 200 pages of interesting, quality, useful information.

To say that these are radical reinterpretations of Posford classics in a PsyDub stylee would be technically accurate; however, that simply doesn't begin to touch on the shrieking lunacy buried right to the hilt in the body of this work. One is struck, physically, by the force of the opening of this album, placing one in a dazed state entirely proper for the depth of listening the material demands. And this material most certainly makes demands on the listener, albeit demands I happily concede: awash in thunderous bass, lilting butterflies of synth, and chattering psychobabble, OTT engages the screens of the senses in an intensely cinematic drama that is good to the last drop. Essential."},{"rating":"2","title":"Support is Great!","review":"I had 3 major surgeries in 2008-2009 for a large abdominal hernia. I have worn these abdominal binders since. I have a very bad lower back and the binders are very good to help with controlling my pain. These binders do not roll and fit well. I highly recommend them. They are durable, wash well, have great stretch, and good velcro stick (very important if you do any type of movement). I have a few of another brand and they are coming apart, not well made, and don't have a good velcro stick. They also roll and it causes a lot of discomfort--cuts into my skin. The ITA Binder is superior in support--love them. Need to reorder a few more to get rid of the old other brand binders that have not stood the test of time--3 years.

Jones, bereft of talent, experience and skill, shows us that even the worst books may be published if you're willing to foot the bill. But that is as it must be; a publisher would hire an editor and an editor would render such a book readable, consistent and punctuated,any one of which traits would mean that this book was no longer the author's product.I am always amused by self-published authors who feel the need to ask their friends to write 5-star reviews or, worse, make up profiles for the sole purpose of giving their own books 5-star reviews, as though the readers and consumers of Amazon are not savvy enough to know the difference between fantasy and reality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing.","review":"This book is a very quick read, and touches on the most general concepts of digital recording. It packs a lot of information for such a tiny volume (it's only slightly bigger than your wallet), but unfortunately this doesn't leave room for much detail. At best, this book would make a handy quick-reference to keep in your back pocket during recording sessions.

Perhaps not but I feel an obligation as it has been part of my life since I first bought it in 1967--and wore out several LP versions of it. The combination of composition, interpretation, playing, and engineering of the Barber pieces is unparalleled in my experience; each must be considered as definitive. I particularly favor the Second Essay which comes across as a major work of it era and should appear in concert more often. The contibution by Martina Arroyo is just an extra added attraction in this extended compilation. Legendary!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Have","review":"It's hard to decide if this disc is a paean to Samuel Barber or Thomas Schippers, for while it contains marvelous recordings of some of Barber's most memorable compositions, it's also one of the finest if not finest non-operatic discs led by the American conductor, containing not just the Barber pieces but also a Gian Carlo Menotti overture, Berg's Interlude from Wozzeck, and Introduction to Fervaal by Vincent d'Indy, all performed wonderfully. Going back to the Barber, however, these are perhaps the best renditions not only of the iconic Adagio for Strings but also the Overture to The School for Scandal, one of my all-time favorite pieces. And Schipper's rendition of Medea's Dance of Vengeance is no slouch, either. All in all, this is one classy and classic release, of a very fine vintage indeed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sacred Sensuouness","review":"A Listening Heart is subtitled The Spirituality of Sacred Sensuousness. This subtitle really gives the meat of the book. Brother David helps us to understand the sacredness of sensual experienes - taste, sight, hearing, touch and smell. He carefully makes his case that we can come in touch with the the divine by becoming more fully aware of our reaction to sensual stimuli. The book is very well and clearly written.I gave it four stars because of the chapter entitled Mirror of the Heart. I found this chapter rather obtuse - maybe because I am not a great fan of poetry. However, the book would have been better without this chapter.

Over all though I liked it and felt more energetic while on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"Not worth the amount of money BSN charges for this product. At 6 tablets per day, the bottle only lasts 20 days or 3 weeks. It says it takes 6 weeks for you to notice the full effects and to only take it for 12 weeks at a time. At that rate, they should be charging, at most, half the price for this product. I took the contents of a bottle over the course of 3 weeks, noticed nothing and decided not to continue use. Disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasantly Suprised","review":"So I've been taking this about a week(6 pills a day) recommended dosage. First couple of days I hardly noticed anything, however about a week into taking the product I'm feeling less sore when I wake up in the morning after a hard workout at the gym the previous day. Something else I noticed when I was shaving is that my facial hair is a little thicker, this was the shocker. I've always had a problem with thin facial hair, my sideburns never really fill in. I was a bit skeptical after reading reviews because I have heard that some people really don't feel or notice anything different. I wouldn't be writing this review If i didn't notice anything. It could be the placebo affect or that this product just works for me.I'm giving this 4 stars because the taste is so terrible you want to swallow the pills as quick as possible. Then again, usually the stuff that tastes bad really works."},{"rating":"1","title":"May have worked","review":"I'm not sure if BSN was trying to get into a market that flirts with steroids, but I took this as it reads on the bottle, and didn't see any diffrence in my workouts.

I bought 2 more bottles. What does that tell you? You get stronger, you push harder. I sweat during the workout like its cardio and I am exhausted like it is cardio.

If you are willing to work for it then this is the help you need. I need. But be careful learn your body before you start pushing it, because you will push it even if you dont realise.

Bluegrass Light by basically the same group of players was an amazing record from those years, as was Statman's mandolin debut on Flatbush Waltz.

That protects it well, but also makes a mess when you open it.The lamp comes in four sections, the flute at the top, two middle sections, and the base. The assembly instructions recommend putting the lamp together from the bottom upward. However, the cord is attached to the flute, so when you do it this way the cord can become twisted up inside. I suggest putting the lamp together on a horizontal surface with some pillows to prop up the different pieces. That makes it easier to straighten the cord.Overall, a sturdy and high quality product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Return runaround","review":"The product arrived with thw only breakable piece broken.

I bought both to print CD's and when they work they look great. But far to often I have one or more jets that are clogged giving me a worthless print out. To unclog the jets you are required to run the head cleaning routine that sucks the inks from the cartridges.Epson's support is slightly better than worthless. If you do a Google search on inkjets and clogging you'll find plenty of others to atest to this problem with Epson's printers. It seems that Epson uses a different inkjet technology that uses heat to produce the droplets of ink and it is prone to clogging if you are not using it everyday.I've wasted five times the cost of the printer in wasted inks.

Marilyn Monroe appears on the screen for maybe 30 seconds and although I was never a fan of hers you could kind of sense a strong presence about her for that brief time she was in the movie. I couldn't enjoy this movie thoroughly with Groucho narrating and Harpo as the star. The plot was ok but it was an extremly bad ending and just not what you would expect from the Marx Brothers...their true last performance was in \\"A Night In Casablanca\\" which was actually a pretty good movie. This movie is just out of sheer curiousity for Marx Brothers and Marilyn Monroe fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I love Amy Tan, but this book was so disappointing. The premise was odd and fictional (portrayed as truth). While the narrator was at time humorous, the pace was slow and the characters dull and unlikeable. I was hoping for at least some more insight into life in Asia, but again was disappointed. I couldn't wait for it to end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unbelievable","review":"I believe this may be the best book I have ever read. I have recommended it to everyone I know.Marcia Murray HolstromSan Jose, California"},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy read","review":"This is the first book I have read by Amy Tan, so I cannot compare it against her other novels. I can say, however, that this story has a very original plot, recognizable and well-defined characters and a pace that keeps you turning pages. Definitely worth a read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Smells Fishy","review":"What a disappointment. I have seldom quit reading a book in the middle of it. It became a chore to read, so I put it down about half way through. I just did not care about any of the characters. I was embarrassed by some of their words and actions. I am so glad my recent trip to China included an intelligent, well educated, and knowledgeable group of people, so unlike the group in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disapointment.","review":"This book doesn't not follow the pattern of other books she wrote. I've read all her other books and I love each one. I couldn't wait for her next book and sad to say, this one is a bummer. This book goes on and on about nothing. I couldn't figure out what the story line is. The characters get lost in my mind. Can't figure out who's who.I hope her next book will follow the same pattern as The Joy Luck Club, Kitchen God's Wife, The Hundred Secret Senses and The Bone setter's Daughter. These books are a must read.Saving Fish from Drowning, I advise you to skip."},{"rating":"1","title":"Saving readers from buying!","review":"I never write reviews, but this book is so bad, that I felt compelled to take time out to share my opinion. The overdetailed tale about poorly developed annoying characters should be passed over. I enjoyed the Joy Luck Club, so I thought this book would be decent. We read it for our book club and nobody enjoyed it. Tan goes into inane details, that really makes the book drag. The shame of it is that the premise is quite good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wannabe history lesson","review":"This book's aim seems to be to teach us about Burma past and present; but as a novel, the characters are not developed enough to make us care about them or Burma within the muddled and tedious story -- it felt like a mediocre TV sitcom. Tan's writing style is always engaging, however, and for that I give the book 2 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not great","review":"I did not enjoy this book in the least. plotlines were ludicrous, characters were smarmy, and some references to the native people of Myanmar were racist."},{"rating":"1","title":"High Hopes...","review":"I generally like Amy Tan's writing style and her books. Her books are usually engrossing with many interesting details and unforgettable story lines...a rare glimpse into the Asian culture.Saving Fish From Drowning proved to deliver quite the opposite. I found it hard to keep the characters straight, the storyline uninteresting. I read it to the end hoping it would turn around or come together at some point, which it never seemed to do.While I didn't hate it, I also wouldn't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't even finish it","review":"I have read all of Amy Tan's other novels and liked them and her writing so much that I have been to see her speak, taking the trouble to go two hours early to get a seat. I am about 50 pages into this book and have been wondering since page 1 if I was going to have to listen to the main character's snooty portrayals of her \\"friends\\" throughout the novel or if it would ever expand. In skimming later chapters for \\"the voice\\", it seemed like Bibi was there forever. So I decided to check the Amazon reviews to see if I should move on to another book with better writing. And, it appears that my intuition served me. I am so disappointed; I bought the book and took it to my reading nook with the relish a child has for a rare cookie. Oh well, better sweets next time, I hope."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not Amy Tan","review":"Saving Fish From Drowning has to be the one of the most disapointing books I have read. I consider Tan one of the geatest contemporary American writers and I cannot belive that she wrote this. What I don't understand is the extent of the metaphysical influence on this novel. She credits a NYC metaphysical library at the stert of the novel. It is a very confusing and difficult novel to read and enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to Amy Tan?","review":"I LOVE Amy Tan's writing, but I found this book to be really disappointing. I was so excited when I read what it was about and figured it would be one of her best. But it was hard to become acquainted with the characters and remember who was who. The title plays out in a very interesting scene early in the book, but then it didn't seem like she really connected the dots throughout. Or maybe I just missed it! I finished it simply because I felt I might as well once I'd invested so much time in it, but I can't say I'm really glad I spent my time reading this one. Don't waste your time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Saving Amy from this type of writing.","review":"While I learned a great deal about Burma/Myanmar and went on to educate myself about its politics, I found the book not the usually Tan work. The characters were dense when they didn't have to be, lots of tangents that didn't need to go to. The parts of the story that I enjoyed were the storytelling regarding Bibi, her mother, her step-mother, Sweet Ma and her family's history. She starts off with that somewhere in the beginning chapters and finally ends on that note.I love her past work, I've read all save her children's books. I hope she goes back to her unique storytelling, where generations of families come alive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spoiled for this reader","review":"Tan's earlier works have a charm and gracefulness in their story-telling, but that is lost in this novel. It is clumsy, slow-starting, and tired (this time, the storytelling feels completey contrived). Tan's characters assert themselves as being authorities in Chinese authenticity--why?--I'm left feeling like she's perpetuating negative stereotypes. This is an irritating element evident in her other writing as well--it gets in the way of the story. Perhaps Frank Chin et al have some valid points in The Big Aiieeeee! and have ruined Tan's magic for this reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tooooo Much","review":"It seems that the more popular (and lucrative) an author gets, the less editing they receive on their novels. (Are their editors cowed by their fame?) Now Amy Tan, like her good pal Stephen King, suffers greatly from a bad or absent editor as evidenced by her latest novel, \\"Saving Fish From Drowning\\". It's a great story and deliciously witty with scathing pokes at, among others, modern society, the rich, religion and \\"reality\\" TV. She is particularly astute at satirizing American tourists. But the book would have been GREAT at 150 fewer pages and half as many characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shocked to find it Silly and Simple","review":"I have loved Amy Tan's previous books so much, I stuck it out to page 380 before I finally quit. Then, out of guilt, I forced myself to finish it. That was two hours ago and I already forget what the book was about. So disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious book about tedious charaters","review":"I never thought I'd give up on an Amy Tan novel, but I bailed midway through this one. It's sad that a novelist of Tan's enjoyable gifts has served up this hash of pedantic travelog, heavy-handed adolescent humor, and fly-on-the-wall documentary revolving around people who are relentlessly uninteresting, self-involved, and virtually indistinguishable from each other. No wonder the narrator died rather than tour Asia with these nattering bores. On the up side, the dog lives."},{"rating":"1","title":"Look under the surface at the poor fish!","review":"The novel is readable, and to a certain extent, enjoyable as a spoof. But what about the fate of the Karen tribe described in the novel? Their treatment under the Myanmar military was horrific! And their fate at the end of the book is ambiguous. They are never heard from again, having gone to Someplace Else. Are they alive? Under what circumstances? This is the real tragedy under the surface of the spoof. So the tourists all got back safely and had predictable lives. So what?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Adventure!","review":"I picked this book up on a hunch in an airport book store, and I'm so happy I did. If I had read these reviews I would have missed this funny and sly adventure tale. I am in awe of Amy Tan's skill."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ahh, Amy...","review":"I had to finish this for my book club, but it was laborious. I kept thinking that this was Amy Tan's \\"A Painted House\\" (Grisham) -- the novel that wouldn't have been published by any other author.... Where were the descriptions, the people we care about, the plot? I felt as though I were trapped on that boring busride for 200 pages, and then forced to watch CNN for the next 100, and the final 100 was her summary of each character's life. What was the purpose??"},{"rating":"1","title":"Muddy Waters","review":"I just finished Saving Fish from Drowning.. it read like it was written by a ghost writer or something.. missing that storytelling prose of Tan's previous books. It was a heavy handed civics lesson with undeveloped characters and a muddy plot. This is so unlike Amy Tan's previous books that it was very hard to find any of her essence on the pages. It was quite a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"I've read every word (and loved them all) that Amy Tan has written - up to \\"Saving Fish\\". I tried and tried, but just couldn't come to care about any of the myriad of characters that were introduced in just the first 2 cassettes (when I gave up). Further, the unabridged book on tape is read by the author, who should leave the task to a more talented actress.Hopefully, she will work with a different editor on her next effort. My advice is: wait."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please drown this book","review":"I was so excited to buy Amy Tan's new book. I love and have even reread her other books but this was awful. In fact, half way through I stopped to check if it was the same author that I loved! It was a HUGE disppointment! Don't waste your money on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"This is my first novel by this author. It was awful. I don't like to abandon a book once I've picked it up, but I bailed on this one. The story did not engage and I could care less about the characters and their mishaps."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Dissapointing...","review":"After reading some Amy Tan books in the past, I assumed this would also be a good one... Wrong.She crafts beautiful imagery and sentences but for some reason, it just doesn't draw you in the way a good book needs to. So much so that I can't even finish the book, and trust me, I tried. Nothing in the story motivates you to learn more and keep reading..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh!","review":"I really hate to say this, because Amy Tan is one of my favorite writers, but I simply cannot finish this book (and I even managed to slog all the way through the horrid PILLARS OF THE EARTH). I'm tired of reading about everyone's \\"toilet difficulties,\\" I don't care about ANY of the characters (except the dog, so I'm glad to hear that he lives), and I cannot imagine what editor told the author that this book was a good idea.If you want to read great novels by an exceptional writer, read ANY of Tan's other novels. I am praying that she goes back to telling her wonderful stories from her Chinese heritage in her next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"DROWNING","review":"What a dissapointment--I felt as if I was drowning reading this. I love all of Amy Tans other books and looked forward to this one. I struggled to finish and ended up skimming at the end. I did a hoola dance when it was over. The plot and characters were boring and it missed the lovely language that Tan is known for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Glad I didn't read the reviews also","review":"I've learned something about myself while reading this book. It's that I don't mind being hit over the head with foreshadowing as long as it's within the context of a cracking good page-turner of a book. But if I had a nickel for every time she started a sentence with: \\"If only he/she had known what lay in store...\\" or words to that effect, well, I'd probably have a dollar, and I'm only halfway through. But some fascinating history of some of the lesser-known Asian countries intermingled with fiction intermingled with fact is making for a riveting read. Be sure not to skip the intro chapter; it's critical to the story. Just be warned that if you like subtlety in your literature, this may not be the book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"What happened? Amy Tan's normally highly engaging and emotionally empathetic style is completely missing...much to this book's downfall. Instead, Saving Fish from Drowning is hard to read and hard to follow. I thought if I kept reading I'd eventually find the rhythm, but it just wasn't there. I tried to like it because of the equity Amy Tan has earned from her previous excellent work, but this book just doesn't measure up. Too many characters, too many rambling sidebars...try re-reading Kitchen God's Wife if you need an Amy Tan fix, because you won't get it here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save this book from drowning!","review":"I have read and adored Amy Tan's previous works and was left feeling very unsatisfied by this far fetched tale. Tan attempts to lure the reader into believeimng that the book is based on factual events, but actualy I read in an interview that she fabricated the whole thing.I found the charachters and the book both lacked depth and kept waiting for something \\"big\\" to happen. The whole thing was very anticlimactic and a disappointment. Hopefully her next novel will be more in synch with her previous works, or Tan may just lose a fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Saving Fish From Drowning","review":"This is a most unique perspective on story telling, where the story is told through the eyes and ears of a recently departed Chinese lady named Bibi Chen. It is a wonderful story with great characters and takes you into the heart of darkness in the deepest jungles of Burma. Amy Tan is a great writer!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bummer.","review":"I was so excited to read this book. But when I put the first CD in my car's CD player, I was sure the player was broken. Tan's voice went in and out, blew up and down in volume, and faded away entirely at the ends of her sentences. In addition, the tracks are set in intervals that aren't over a minute--a sure sign that the audio director had trouble with Tan's reading. If I were him or her, I would have scrapped the project and found someone who could do the work justice. I would love to read my own books for audio one day, but not if it is going to be as embarrassing and ineffective as this result. I'll read the book in print, but I'm returning the audio to the library tomorrow."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not the usual Amy Tan book","review":"I always like Amy Tan books. They are usually a good escape. Light reading, but the charactors always pull you into the book. I honestly have not finished the book. I just could not get through the last few chapters, and I almost always finish books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"This book was barely able to hold my interest, and in fact I did not bother to finish it. Too much narrative; too much \\"tell\\" rather than \\"show\\"; too many aimless, unnecessary tangents; weak characterization, etc. This silly, glorified travelogue would have been a better story had it been more concise and 150 pages shorter. I don't know what Tan was thinking when she wrote it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't like the story at all. It took too long to get into the characters and the story.","review":"I would recommend it to readers who like fantasy with losts of characters. and, a story the roams around before it gets to the point if it does."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good quick read","review":"Great book. It is very different from her other books. I found it to be very fanciful, not sure if it is true to its setting or not, but at any rate a good, quick, engaging,read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save a Fish from Drowning","review":"I love her past works as Amy Tan novels are awesome and the story stays with me for years. The Bone Cutter's Daughter and Kitchen God's Wife were incredible. This novel was just strange all the way through and I kept reading hoping it would improve.....it didnt. Definitely not a keeper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nowhere Near Her Best Work","review":"Very disappointing book and a pity we had to wait so long for a new Amy Tan book and then get this!The tone of the book from beginning to end is just silly and trivializes what is an incredibly serious and horrific true story - that of the persecution of the Karen tribespeople in Burma by the Burmese military junta.Unlike her normal rhythmic writing, Tan wrote this book in a stilted, uncomfortable manner, and treated all the characters, Western and Karen alike, as simply idiots. But idiots who think they are correct about everything - which was annoying and sad. I also found the book difficult to cling onto often drifting off to read other books instead (I put it down any number of times with the hope that my interest would be peaked when I picked it back up - it wasn't!) and the story too weak to be memorable.Very little to like in this book but much to dislike. All in all, I can only say \\"I finished it\\", nothing much else is important."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment...","review":"I really enjoy Amy Tan, but this was awful. Not at all like her other work. I guess Amy Tan is a one-note, but it's a good note. She should stick to that note, because this was not only her worst by far, but one of the worst books I've ever read. I just kept reading it because I've always loved every other book she's written. This plot was so far-fetched and it just kept getting farther.... The characters were so forgettable and impossible to relate to. There wasn't a sentimental one in the bunch. Too bad our talented Amy Tan spent so much time writting such a dud."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre at best","review":"I picked up this book in an airport while waiting for a delayed flight because I enjoyed other Amy Tan books, but I was very disappointed with this one. Find another book if you're looking for a good story with engaging characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Total Surprise!","review":"Amy Tan has definitely strayed from her usual style with this humorous satire. I often found myself both horrified and amused at the same time while reading the book. Though there are a lot of characters making the book somewhat hard to follow for the first hundred pages or so, the reader quickly become engaged in the characters lives and back stories. Tan gives a glimpse into not only the character's current state, but also their background and the reasons they are in Burma to begin with. Tan entertains the reader while giving geographic lessons mixed in with politics and social relationships. This book is excellent for a reader that is interested in straying from his or her normal reading genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment from Amy.","review":"I bought this book because I have read and LOVED all of Amy Tans other books. This one was NOT the page turner the others were. A few parts were alright...but I couldn't wait to finish and move on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing!","review":"I love Amy Tan, but this was excruciating to get through. I kept reading in hopes it would get better and it just never did. I found it boring and disjointed. I didn't care about the characters at all! It's just not worth the effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Saving fish from drowning","review":"I'm disappointed. I bought the book because I've enjoyed Tan's earlier works. I didn't finish reading this Saving Fish... The part where one of male tourists urinates into a basin shaped like a woman's private part, etc., is in poor taste. Most of readers don't enjoy such low-grade humor. I wasted my money on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"SAVING A FISH","review":"I TYPICALLY READ 2 BOOKS PER WEEK, TOM WOLFE, ETC. I HAD TO MAKE MYSELF FINSH THIS AND IT TOOK ME A MONTH."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where did Amy Tan go?","review":"As an AVID Amy Tan fan, I eagerly awaited this book, and was highly dissapointed. I pre-ordered Saving Fish from Drowing from amazon and read it about six months ago. I can't remember anthing about it, so what does that tell you?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Author, Terrible Book","review":"Amy Tan is by far one of the most repetetive and trite authors published today. Other than this piece of trite literature, her other books are impossible to tell one from the other. Not only does she use the same themes and names in each book, but the one theme she uses is an overworked one that she never allows to evolve. This book is no better, despite the fact that it FINALLY departs from her ordinary blueprint for a terrible novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spoiler.......","review":"Ok, this is more of a comment than a review. I wish the 11 tourists that were 'kidnapped' would have died. I think that would've made for a better read. And all the parts about Harry and his fido-files were getting annoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Waste of Time","review":"I wish I had read the reviews before I wasted so much time reading it. This over-hyped, boring melodrama doesn't live up to the author's reputation or skill. It is full of over-developed characters that I never developed any empathy for and, therefore, never cared what happened to them. The writing is terribly simplistic and there is no compelling story, or even a plot, until half way through the 474 pages. In fact, the first half of the book was a death-march through a China/Burma travelog. The second half was a sad attempt to use fiction to educate but it just felt obvious and preachy. In short, this highly disappointing effort by the author requires masochistic plodding by the reader to finish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Saving Fish From Drowning","review":"I was to say the least very disappointed in Amy Tan's latest novel. It was so boring I couldn't read the last two chapters and put it out for Goodwill Pickup. Amy should stick to what she does best...stories of China and family. I will certainly read reviews for this author before I buy another of her books. Sadly disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"One star is too high... don't waste your time","review":"Unless you enjoy endless toilet room descriptions of various products of intestinal problems and scenes of tortured livestock and dying puppies (I'm NOT kidding) this is NOT the book for you. This is one of two books I have thrown in the trash in my lifetime. (I'd have thrown it in the sewer, but I couldn't find one fast enough.) I kept thinking that surely the latest description of the look and smell of bathroom deposits would be the last, but every few pages there was another! The last one I read was followed by a description of a dying puppy. All this occured within the first 50 pages! What a waste of paper! I will never pick up another book by this author and I may think twice about the publisher. Whatever redeeming qualities might be here were covered up completely by the constant fixation on toilet issues."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book gives stupidity a new meaning.","review":"AWFUL! Do not buy! I can't believe the publishers went for this. It is pure stupidity. Words cannot describe how stupid this book is. I am pained to even bring up its name again. It sounds like a suspense novel, but I'll boil it down for you: a bunch of egotistical American tourists are kidnapped unknowingly by a bunch of dumbass/kindergarten level natives who are so stupid they think Jesus is named Bocheesus. Spare yourself. Please. This is borderline ridiculous. Actually it's not even borderline. I'm getting infuriated even having to think about it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I have always loved Amy Tan's writing. I have cried through many a story, or turned the last page of her books in absolute awe at how she brought the story together. Not this time! I thought there were too many characters for development, leaving them as caricatures. Half the time, I couldn't even keep them straight. The story was slooooow to develop. The deeper meaning, usually so strong in Tan's work, is practically absent here. This book felt longer than it was, and it took me nearly 2 weeks to slog through it.****WARNING...POSSIBLE SPOILER AHEAD******And when they returned to the U.S., what was the point of the groping scene between Esme and Rupert? I mean, really."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stilted and laborious","review":"Oh, Ms. Tan, what happened? I'm such a fan, have read everything you've published. Usually, I'm delighted in your turn of phrase and every word you choose. This was such a disappointment. The whole book sounded so forced. I'm sure it's something you \\"had to do\\" for \\"growth\\" but it lacks the emotional depth so central to your work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can this be Amy Tan?","review":"I have read every book written by Amy Tan. I finished this book only because I kept hoping she would redeem herself by the end. This book was a big disappointment! What was she thinking? I hope that Ms. Tan goes back to her former excellence in her next novel!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Really disappointed!","review":"Like many I can't stand to stop reading a book before I finish, but this was getting tortuous. I am about half way through and I couldn't match the characters to their names if I tried! Pretty much every character is indistinguishable from the next: they are all bland, self-centered, immature, and not content. There are no distinguishable voices! Also, Ms. Tan must have decided they are all very educated because each one uses two-dollar words a little too frequently to be natural.That, on top of a really slowly developing plot and even the constant \\"something bad is about to happen!!\\" foreshadowing isn't enough to keep me going. Sadly, I really like other works by Tan, but this was almost amateur."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not her finest work, not by a long shot","review":"I am a fan of Amy Tan's, and would really encourage readers to check out her other work. This one just didn't do it for me. It started out seeming like it would be a really fun story, and about midway through I found myself totally confused as to where she was going with this. About 100 pages from the end, I cared less to less to know, and by the last 50 pages felt like it was torture to finish. I couldn't wait for it to end, and no longer cared how what happened, as long as I got to close the book for good. (You know now that I think about it, I skimmed the last 25 pages, it was that bad) Two stars for effort & reputation, not for entertainment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete disappointment","review":"Amy Tan has written many wonderful books. This is not one of them. I wanted to like this book because I've enjoyed all her previous ones. After spending a week trying to get to the good part, I finally decided I was wasting my time and stopped bothering. I hope her next book returns to the format she's used in the past; well written, humorous, and insightful. All of that is completely missing from Saving Fish From Drowning.I'm sorry I wasted the money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I love Amy Tan. The Bonesetters Daughter is one of my all time favorite books. And of course the Joy Luck Club is a classic. I guess she was trying something different here but it didn't work for me as I was looking for her creative insight into relationships. Maybe it comes later in the book. But after drudging though almost 100 pages-I quit. Couldn't finish as I was still totally bored and not connecting to the characters at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"decepcionante","review":"Me encantan los libros de Amy Tan y los he leido con mucho gusto y muy rapido, por lo interesantes.

Very disappointing.","review":"We read this for our book club selection. It had been recommended by someone who listened to it as a book on tape -with Amy Tan reading. That must have been it's saving grace. It literally took me 3 months to finish (I kept thinking this HAS to get better - but it never did, and everything started to look better than continuing this book). Actually most people never showed up at book club to even discuss the book - they disliked it so much. It was not the worst book I have ever read - there is evidence that she is not a bad writer per se. It's just that this book should have been half it's length. Too much detail about things that never really matter - and hard to follow when it puts you to sleep night after night. And the perspective from the spirit world did not work as I believe she intended. At times it told you too much before it unfolded, at other times I wish she would just get to the point and get on with whatever the story was supposed to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"I couldn't finish this one","review":"Perhaps it's unfair of me to write a review since I chose not to finish the book, but the fact that I didn't finish it must say something. As many of the other reviewers, I am a big Amy Tan fan. I love her stories of intergenerational and intercultural tensions and this is what we have come to expect from this author. I have no problem with authors writing in a new genre, but this book contains wooden characters, uninteresting dialogue and a plot that plods. Read it if you must, but be forewarned that it is NOT a typical Amy Tan book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoroughly entertaining reading experience","review":"Add me to the OTHER half of Amazon reviewers who found \\"Saving Fish From Drowning\\" to be a utterly genuine treasure. For awhile, I was dissuaded from reading it by the negative critiques here, as well as from some professional critics. I'm very glad I eventually decided to pay no attention to their negative assessments.I, too, am a fan of Amy's works, and yes, it is true that this novel is not like her others. It is also a more challenging effort to concentrate on, because there are so many characters in so many different situations. Is that a bad thing? Is the prime pleasure out of reading a novel require that it be simple and similar to other works? B-o-r-i-n-g!If you're up for an original, engaging, humdinger of an adventure, that doesn't cater to an 8th grade reading level, do yourself a favor and dive into this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amy Tan is not a Reader","review":"She does write well, and I very much enjoyed previous works. [[ASIN:034546401X Saving Fish from Drowning: A Novel (Ballantine Reader's Circle)] This review pertains to the audio version of Saving Fish from Drowning. As a long-time listener to audio books, I have a lot with which to compare this performance. Seldom have I had to quit listening because of the low quality of the presentation. This is a case in which I simply could not continue because of the distracting nature of her poor diction, monotonous reading style, and inability to bring the written page alive. Writing is a different art from reading aloud.

Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Glad I didn't read the negative reviews before I read the book","review":"I found this book highly engaging and readable, the characters clearly defined. There was a great deal of humor, much of it black, and a great deal of heart. This book was a page turner with a message. Each character is a recognizable tourist type, and most of them would be horrified if they were saddled with the \\"Ugly American\\" label. But then, they really aren't \\"ugly\\" at all, but well meaning if clueless. On the other hand, the natives are not all innocents, and there is a lot of humor in the misdirections and misunderstandings that ensue. As I say in my title, I am glad I didn't read all these negative reviews first because I probably wouldn't have picked the book up at all and would have missed a nice reading experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to Amy Tan?","review":"Amy Tan one, if not, my all time favorite author dropped the ball with this novel. I love all her novels and have read each of them over and over, especially \\"The Bone Setters Daughter.\\" In \\"Saving Fish From Drowning\\" I had alarm bells going off in my head at chapter 1. If that happens with any other book I will set it down, but this was Amy Tan! I was sure if I kept on it I'd love it. Well, I was sadly mistaken. I skipped ahead just to see if I could pick up her style, or \\"some good parts\\" but I found nothing! Too many characters, none of them developed to the point that I'd care about them. The narration from the murdered Bibi Chen, was almost to the point of cattiness. Sorry Amy but I'd tell any fan to steer clear of this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"'Lovely Bones' & 'Desperate Housewives' take a cruise?","review":"It's a new low when I see a writer like Amy Tan come up with this turkey of an idea! (Publishers: Try to give us a big hit?) Okay--so we had the LOVELY BONES where a ghost tracks down her killer-- as she tells her story--then we have the ever-popular DESPERATE HOUSEWIVES TV series--somehow the two must merge (?)--and Amy ( I can imagine the powers that be saying this)--\\"you got yourself a hit \\"! But this clearly is a stretched idea and it comes off this way: strained and contrived. I am so sorry to see this very good writer (I loved JOY LUCK and I also enjoyed BONESETTER'S DAUGHTER) But this? Amy! What are you doing? Oh my...I suggest passing on this one and try: NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN, EMPIRE FALLS."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jack of all stylees","review":"I got a few 12inch samplers of this from fingerlickin records and they've been going down a storm in my sets.'Dubhead' is proper chunky progressive house. 'Obssetional Rhythm' with Andy from the Plump's is a corker, too.It's funny how a guy who uses really old acid house 303's and samples can also be one of the most innovative cats on the breaks/house music scene.It's not quite as ground breaking as 'Future Sound Of Retro,' but then I'm still getting into a lot of the sound.

I often hear a track or two on Pandora, try to purchase it on iTunes but end up having to purchase the entire CD just to get the 1 track. More often than not, its the only track on the entire CD that I like. This CD on the other hand has 1 or 2 tracks that are not my favorites but the rest are great! I was very pleasantly surprised and find myself listening to it frequently. It is also going into my Burning Man play list so if you're a Burner out on the playa and you see an art car that looks like a giant gold Buddha chances are you'll hear a few of these tracks come thumping at you.Good CD. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad voice quality, and ringer stopped working","review":"Only buy this phone if you want both your voice and the person you're talking to sound like robots (not the cool robot voices, the annoying grating ones). You can't turn up the volume too loud to make the voices clearer because the sound gets high pitched and hurts your ears.Also the ringer mysteriously stopped working after I moved to my new apartment. This phone sucks. I only bought it because I needed something with a built-in answering machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like having a conversation under water","review":"We returned the phone after using it for only one day, due to the atrocious voice quality. Callers on the other end of the line could only be heard properly if the volume was turned all the way up, but at full volume you hear your own voice magnified. The range of the phone was also poor, on every channel. To top it off, our answering machine message sounded like we were speaking with our hands over our mouths while we recorded it. Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"AVOID","review":"I gave this phone a 5 star rating after I first got it. 2 months later, it went hay-wire. It was almost like it was possessed, then died.

You're plugging along at 3.5mph in manual mode and for some reason the speed slows down but the machine is still registering at 3.5 mph. I expect this while in one of the programs as the machine is designed to due but not in manual mode.2. You cannot scroll to see your progress like the models at the gym; you just wait patiently until it comes around on the display.3. You cannot get an accurate heart rate while walking/running by grabbing the hand rails. You must step on the side bars to measure accurately while wasting a minute or so of your workout.Overall it's a good machine; comfortable, just big enough, and effective, but it's hard getting used to if you've grown accustomed to the models at the gym."},{"rating":"2","title":"T","review":"Hi.

An Ewok hang glider, a speeder bike, and a catapult would be, I think, worth more than [the cost], not to say I'd like them to raise the price. There are four mini figures in this set and half of them are one-of-a-kind. (Wicket and Paploo the Ewoks) The hang glider is very cool. I think it's the first and last lego set to come with fishing poles. Wicket is the pilot. The speeder bike is different and a bit more beefy, but other than that it isn't a big surprise. The catapult is cool because it has those authentic propeller things and really fires. I have nothing bad to say about this set, aside from the fact that they could have made Wicket's hood red like in the movie. The storm trooper is cool and kind of uncommon and has a cool helmet. To sum this set up I have just four words: BUY THIS SET NOW!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ewok Attack","review":"The Ewok Attack LEGO set is real cool and fun to play with. I got it for my brother but I like to play with it too. It has four mini figs(two ewoks, one biker scout, one stormtrooper), one speeder bike, one cool catapult, and an ewok glider. The catapult throws LEGO rocks really far and the speeder is new and sleek. I like the way the glider looks but its wings fall off pretty easy but its real fun to make it crash and then you can rebuild it."},{"rating":"2","title":"been brilliant for years","review":"Have desperately sought this CD for years, since my taped version of the BBC Live in Concert is disintegrating, and the original was deleted by Windsong.

Acoustics incredible.\\"Live at the Green Banana, down in the Coconut Rooms...\\"still incredible."},{"rating":"1","title":"For the purist","review":"This book was by far not my favorite work on one of everyone's favorite band. It gave you some interesting points of view on the band, its members and some of the struggles they endured. But the book would probably be more appropriately titled, 2 chapters on GNR the band and the rest on why Axl Rose is a whack job. If you were ever brave or curious enough to explore the inner workings of the mind of one of rocks most notorious front man, then maybe this is for you. Too much Axl, not enough everyone else. If your more a veteran on GNR lit. go ahead. if this is your first GNR book, I would strongly suggest SLASH or Watch You Bleed, first."},{"rating":"1","title":"How did this get published?","review":"I can't believe anyone even published this piece of garbage. The book read like the writer simply scribbled down thoughts as they occurred to him, used the wrong words, repeated himself and had a school-boy crush on Axl. It seems like a lot of poorly written filler, but the author never really gets into the genius of Slash - it's all Axl. Clearly this was written by a 7th grader. It pains me to think this retard got paid for this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good thing it was cheap","review":"I am a huge fan of Guns n Roses and Velvet Revolver and thought this would make a great read. But right at the beginning I could tell that the author has no writing skills whatsoever. He really needed to fire his editor because there were quite a few mispellings and grammatical errors, but that wasn't the biggest flaw with the book. Most of the information is taken from magazine interviews and the rest seems to be complete hearsay. It would have been nice for the author to actually talk to the bandmembers in length before devoting a whole book to them. I feel that it was unfair, mostly to Slash, Izzy, Steve and Duff.He made Axl out to be some god, which he is far from being. It was the other guys who had the drug problem, not Axl. YEAH RIGHT!Either way, the book is poorly written so try to buy it used or borrow someone else's if you really want to read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Book I Can't Forget","review":"Paul Stenning has as much business writing about Guns N' Roses as I do singing for them.First and foremost, this book is not accurate and isn't presented in any particular order. If you want more information, and to save a penny, visit GN'R message boards @ heretodaygonetohell.com or mygnr.com, both of which contain more info in 1 topic than is captured in this entire book.Secondly, would it have killed Paul Stenning to SpellCheck this mess? Puncuation and spelling errors are in abundance.Lastly, as a huge \\"Axl\\" fan, I was disappointed w/ the fellow Gunners being used only as a referance for all things \\"Axl\\".Overall, this is a poorly written Axl tribute. I can't imagine the text before it was revised, but save your cash. You remember more than this gentlman knows."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"What a horrible book, and this is coming from a HUGE GNR fan. I could go on for pages as to why this book sucks, but I will keep it short. There is no firsthand info from band members, only people who supposedly knew the band. Most of the text of this abortion comes from newspapers and magazines, and the opinion of the author.It should be called \\"Why I Love Axl Rose\\" by Paul Stenning. I don't know who the geniuses are who greenlit this project, but they should be fired.The author is terrible. It reads like a 3rd grade book report. I think I should stop now, as I think I have sufficiently vented my anger over this affront to literature. You would be better served reading the GNR page on Wikipedia."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was midly interesting","review":"It was okay but I definately don't reccomend anyone to buy it. Its totally inaccurate (At some parts) and it seems to want to focus on Axl a lot of the time more than the band. If you want to read about Guns I'd suggest looking elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but not great","review":"Kissin is probably THE piano virtuoso of our day and he definitely shows off his awesome talent here in abundance. The Philharmonia Orchestra (in my mind one of the top five orchestras in the world today) are caught very well and Levine has conducted these works before on cd (most notably with Alfred Brendel and the Chicago Symphony on Philips). While the playing cannot be faulted and everything goes well, there isn't too much to distinguish the interpretations of either concerto from the literally dozens of versions out there. Hence it doesn't merit five stars. In my opinion it doesn't rank with the truly legendary recordings of these works, namely Kempff on DG, any of Brendel's three sets on Vox or Philips, Perahia on Sony, or Ashkenazy on Decca. Still, if you are a Kissin fan you are sure to be delighted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not spend your money","review":"Sometimes Mozart, sometimes Wagner, but never Beethoven.

You can hear the connection between bandmates as their influences push and pull one another to create a sound that is solid, catchy and creative. Soulfound is a powerhouse band from guitars, to vocals, to grooves and melodies. You can hear a classic rock influence in the 'Allman Brothers meets Iron Maiden' guitar harmonies of \\"Don't Go\\" and Hendrix-y licks of \\"First Time\\" and \\"Full of It\\". The music grooves heavier on the progressive track \\"Now is Yours\\" and 'emoesque-power pop' songs \\"Day to Day\\", \\"So Long Pretender\\", and \\"Full of It\\". I encourage one and all to buy this record and see the band live. They are expanding their market and will keep on as they continue to craft their infectious art--truly a great band who will not be overshadowed for long and WILL make it BIG. SOULFOUND.

Behind the public statements of the administration lie the deeper motives of the operation: control of dwindling resources, intimidation with a display of military strength, and a neoconservative philosophy promoting an explicit imperialism. Exploiting the anxieties of the 9/11 catastrophe is the crux of the propaganda game. The text includes interviews with Tariq Ali, Chomsky, Benjamin Barber, Chalmers Johnson, and Shadia Drury who provides an interesting commentary on the hidden Straussianism of the neoconservative clique."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chilling Look at the NeoCon Agenda","review":"You might consider buying this one and giving it to everyone you can think of. It's preaching to the choir of course: most of us who see it understand that the NeoCon group's approach to foreign policy is horrifyingly similar to that of Gary Cooper in HIGH NOON (the quintessential go-it-alone guy.) It's amazing to watch this film and realize how long the propaganda has been coming at us, manipulating us through our fears. If you're worried about the Wolfowitz/Rumsfeld/Bush triumverate and their quest for empire, this will only make you worry more. It's a very unsettling movie. At times, you might find yourself wishing you could turn off the background music, which is a bit melodramatic. But all told, this is an urgently important film - I only wish we could figure out how to get the Bush supporters to watch it.

Outside of Elvis Costello's beautiful rendition of \\"Lost in the Stars\\" and songs sung by Lottle Lenya, the CD is an insult to Weill. For example, \\"September Song\\" is spoken with a rock accompaniment that doesn't include a single note of Weill's lovely music. And in many other songs, the words have been rewritten."},{"rating":"2","title":"IN THE SPIRIT OF CABARET...","review":"Plenty of Lenya,some Brecht, some Weil...I expected to love those cuts. I was surprised by how effective the Teresa Stratas pieces were. And I was KNOCKED OUT by the Alabama Song, far preferable to me than Morrison's take, which was so unusual for the time that it commanded far more attention than it deserved. The whole album deserves to be listened to front to back as a unified composition. It's far closer to the spirit of the original than any other tributes or prettified performances of Weil/Brecht I've heard elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool and Camp","review":"This is a very biased review- I originally had much of Weill's work on cassette tape- way back in the olden days- before CD's- so I am already very partial to many of the tracks on this CD- I would recommend it not only to Kurt Weill fans, and the fans of the various artists featured, but I would also strongly recommend this to anyone who likes artsy, camp, fun burlesque, Bohemian European stuff. The record, even though performed by contemporary artists still retains much of it's zeitgeist, it evokes the era in which Weill was writing and it rounds out any great eclectic record collection. It's a great musical discovery for fans of all sorts of genres, and EVERYONE should own at least one recorded arrangement of \\"Mack The Knife\\".

I assumed from the title and the concept of sex, gender, social change and 'revolution' that I would find something useful regarding the varied issues surrounding gender in the 21st century. BOY, was I mistaken! Gender and sex in this text refer to male/female binary and the old discourse of patriarchy.

You work several different factions, or countries, like the Russian Mafia, China, Allies, South Korea and North Korea. You work each one against the other, without getting yourself killed in the middle. in the meanwhile, you are working on a \\"Deck Of 52\\" cards, 52 of the most wanted dictators and drug cartel.

Buy it, steal it, hijack it, or blow it up! As a Mercenary you are hired by several countries combating the North Korean military, but each country has their own intentions. Using the support by those countries, and the Russian Mafia you complete the missions given to you. Unlike GTA where you only have guns, and other objects to use, in Mercenaries you can call for an air strike, artillery bombardment, or supply drops to resupply you. While conducting these missions, you are also contracted to capture, or kill (you decide) 52 North Korean personnel (Deck of 52 cards). Plus, you have a whole bunch of side missions like seeing how far can you displace a barrel with explosives, how fast can you drive from one point to another, etc. If you get bored (which I don't think you will) you can just go anywhere and blow anything up!

The book is enlightening and thought provoking by taking one's understanding of religion to a new level. Wentz deconstructs religion to its elements and examines how fanaticism and wrong doing in the name of religion have developed. The book explains how all humans are in some way religious and how people allow that religiousness to be imprisoned within walls of their own mind's making. This creates a sense of close-mindedness which ultimately leads to the violence which is all too common in the world today. Wentz draws from doctrines and diciples from around the world and throughout history which emphasize the universality of his message. Richard Wentz has imparted to the rest of the world an amazing book which gives us a map to follow on the way to becoming better persons and true diciples of the human spirit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely unintuitive interface, useless documentation","review":"I do actually own this software for my Mac, and I can confirm that it's pretty awful and can only be recommended for those willing to spend the weeks learning its embarrassingly unintuitive interface.

You don't need to be a senior citizen to recognize that these songs document an era when love was a respectable commodity. It also proves, elegaically, that they really DON'T write 'em the way they used to. An encyclopedia and indispensable collection you'll return to again and again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and Affected","review":"I found this book boring and meandering, and the author Jane Rylands' usage of certain literary devices really put me off of enjoying the piece. Too many juxtapositions between scenes and scenery descriptions, over-flowery language (as though using such language would then in turn make the Venetian angle more 'flowery'), and the interspersion of Italian phrases and words throughout was too pronounced and played out. As someone else had said in a review - the affectation was a bit much.Not recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrifying!","review":"I tossed the book down just four pages into The Postman, the first story. Never in my life have I been asked by an author to wade through such stultefying prose. I thought perhaps it was just me but was vindicated in finding other reviews that mention the same grimly irritating problem. These aren't 'stories'. These are esoteric exercises for the author alone. Don't waste your time....there are too many good books out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine as terrazzo","review":"I loved this book as I love any well constructed window into a foreign land, and the real venice, the living Venice--that of postmen, gondoliers and socialites is truly foreign. Ms. Rylands captures the details of refinery, squalor, and deceit at play in the most beautiful mudflats, contrasting the decadence of the nobles with the base charm of the lower classes, and weaves a rich and varied story of stories. Having lived in Venice for over a year and a half, I am familiar with many of the quirky bellies of Venetian life which Ms. Rylands depicts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bad for a collection of short stories...","review":"I enjoyed almost all 12 stories in this book, and I liked how much of them interlock in some way or another. The descriptions of Venice made it come alive, and the different viewpoints encompassed a wide variety of people from a visitor to the city to the mayor. You could really tell that the author wanted you to see that the city's upper-class life was fading in most of the stories. However, I had some problems as well. About three of the stories I didn't really \\"get\\". They just seemed to make no sense whatsoever. I also found it odd she only wrote about four women, I had wished for more a balance there. Lastly, I often felt like the author was being condescending to the reader, which was a bit of a turnoff. Alright, but nothing great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I purchased this book prior to visiting Venice this summer in hopes that it would provide valuable insights about local culture. From that perspective it was a poor investment. The book offers minimal information about local customs, food, folklore or virtually any other aspect of Venetian life. What it did make overwhelmingly clear was that there is a well established party circuit for the rich and famous, but if you fit in those categories you probably already knew that.What sets the book apart is not so much the focus of the city, but that the writer has an old fashioned writing style that is both refreshing and frustrating at the same time.Venice is a uniquely beautifully and fascinating city. It's unfortunate that this book provides such a quirky perspective that is of little value to developing a better understanding and appreciation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great alternative to the cube!","review":"The UFO is a challenge. So far I've had it for 3 days and it seems my trying to solve it mixes it up even more. Sometimes the disc halves are hard to turn but after wear and tear it gets easier.

The text reads like a medical thesis. Each chapter is chock-full of redundancy. The author has painstakingly gone over each and every paragraph with a thesaurus to remove any flow of thought in order to come across as overly-educated. Not a single thought process is easily defined by the reader, nor can any information be disseminated from this text to correlate with exams or class discussion. The text is also full of spelling errors and missing pages. I completely recommend a rethinking of course material for future students.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"how did this get approve??","review":"How and why this book was chosen for my course is unimaginable. There are missing pages and the print is slanted on many other pages. The worst is the content it is very hard to keep up with the author, who is biased and consistently throws their own opinion around in the book. The book primarily contains philosophy and theory which can range from practical to the almost comical.

At first, I read this book hoping that his snobbery was done in jest. As it was made clear that the author was completely serious and his ignorant view of this town was incorrect and offensive, the book lost its charm, if, of course, it ever had any. I was surprised that such a small-minded story was to follow in this book since the author presents himself in the first chapter to be world-traveled. Clearly, world-traveled does not mean you travel well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rising above","review":"The typically tedious arrogance of East Coast intelligentsia must be overlooked while reading this book. It's just too funny to be dissuaded by Korda's sophomoric attitude. My husband and I kept reading lines to each other and laughing. We've taken the same road and we couldn't have said it better. It's a must-read for anyone who is planning a similar path...before you sign on the country dotted line.

I am a working slob who will always be a working slob, so maybe I am biased--but I don't have time to waste on books like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"A rich man's self-absorbing babble","review":"This book gives you a good picture of life in the country (country here meaning two hours away from Manhattan), if you have a British blonde model as a 2nd wife whose passion is foxhunting and horseback riding, four horses in the barn, two stable hands, a Hungarian mother and daughter team to cook your dinners for you, an interior decorator to dress your house in imported fabric from Italy, and a full-time help who mows your grass and takes care of all your country needs.In sum, the pleasure of moving to the country for Mr. Korda: looking at the forty acres and thinking: \\"it's all mine.\\" And the tribulation: being snubbed by even richer friends because his estate is not as grand as the next person's.Do not even make the mistake of opening this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"And I thought I was the only one...","review":"...who finished this book thinking that Korda was a pompus twit with more money than good manners. His condesending observations of his neighbors left me irritated time and time again, as well as the name dropping and implied superiority of himself vs. the \\"lowly\\" country folk.If you discounted the snide comments, the first part of the book was pretty interesting. However, the last 4 chapters became rambling and could have been condensed into one chapter.It was great reading the reviews from the Hewitts on this forum.

His every extravagant expenditure is detailed in order for you to be sure of his status in the community. The other things he thinks will interest you are his showbiz friends, his English ancestry, his horsey activities, etc. In fact as I read the book I found myself betting when the next boastful statement would pop up. However, I would say it's a good read if only for those reasons.The author can be happy now in the knowledge that all of neighbors now what a grand person they have in their midst."},{"rating":"1","title":"Country Matters","review":"My name is Kathy Hewlett, wife of a family member who use to live on \\"the old Hewlett farm\\".

Course what could be weirder than a zombie book? A dumb one? Maybe I'm expecting too much. The zombies, oh I'm sorry Xombies turn blue and its spread by women, unless they aren't getting their monthlies. The ending was hard to understand and didn't make much since and what I mean by that is, is it was pretty disjointed and seemed as though the author wanted to think up some surprise ending that would maybe shock the reader and leave us dismayed, but it really didn't. It was more of a dispointing ending. Hard to understand, didn't enjoy, trying to be too fresh, while just ended up being a bad deal all around.I've only read one other zombie book other than this, and it wasn't any better, so maybe I'll just stick to the movies. Shaun of the Dead is good, go check that out."},{"rating":"1","title":"The plot in this book hits a wall, figuratively and literally","review":"I admit the very beginning was good when the girl was with her mother and went to investigate a neighbors house. But, that's where it stops at. The girl (heroine) gets rescued by her step-dad then they travel on the highway and get invaded, but they hit a wall where the doors open up within somewhere around the highway. It turns out to be some old secret military\\\\submarine base where they let kids skateboard and party in a wharehouse. And the cheesiness of this story is only beginning. After that, I stopped reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"not really zombies, ending fizzled","review":"These Xombies aren't really zombies. They could be said to have zombie-like qualities, as a chimp has human-like qualities, but they don't eat living humans so much as they spread their virus voraciously. The story was entertaining enough until the end when the \\"mystery\\" was explained, then it became ridiculous and I skimmed the last 50 pages merely to get the gist of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like zombies . . . read something else","review":"This book was millions of miles away from Dawn of the Dead, 28 Days Later, or Lord of the Flies, or any of the other things it's been compared to. I found it very promising to begin with, with some very interesting twists on the usual \\"zombie\\" story. After it starts off as a somewhat original zombie story, it hops and jumps all over the place. It just got worse and worse, even crossing the line into \\"silly.\\" The whole submarine thing got tired very quickly, and once they got to the \\"base\\" it got completely ridiculous. Nonsensical plot twists and \\"gotcha\\" non-endings were problems as well. It turned into a bad 70s sci fi feature. Two specific things that don't give away the story: a xombie-killing baboon and a Beatles tribute band made up of Pakistanis. Anyway, I don't recommend this book to anyone who is a fan of zombie books and movies. Skip this and re-read Keene's The Rising."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alice in Zombieland","review":"Right from the initial reference to Sleeping Beauty you learn this book is going to be a kind of fairytale, and it is - a fairytale not with knights and dragons, but with contemporary elements like submariners and zombies, and with the sly sense of humor to carry it off.

The beginning was great, but the middle with the submarine and what was waiting for them at their distination was soooo extremely slow that i stopped reading for a few days.It was a good, different idea for a book but needed not to be so long and complicated which made it a drag--in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Started out good but quickly fizzled out","review":"Well, I gave this book the old 100 page try and gave up then. I have way too many books vying for my attention to force myself to finish a book that is boring me witless.Xombies started out well with a young girl named Lulu waking up one day to discover the world has gone mad and it seems that all women have turned into raging blue-faced Xombies due to some sort of disease. Lulu escapes this fate because she has a health condition that prevents her from maturing. After watching her mother turn blue, she escapes with an older male neighbor and they're on the run.This book started out with a lot of promise but soon became one big chase scene with lots of male posturing thrown in.

Styron is considered one of the most distinguished of the Post-War novelists, an heir to Faulkner in presenting a vision of the tormented American South. But he also wrote on another topics including his own Depression, and a novel on the 'Holocaust'. Rose as always is understanding and works to bring out the best in his subject. His capacity for appreciating people from so many different walks of life , for honoring their work and memory is highly commendable."},{"rating":"1","title":"resident and student review","review":"The only reason that I own this book is beause I received it for free.

Our 2 year old has almost outgrown the back as her head is higher than the back support. Also with in 6 months we had two different stollers because both has issues with the rain shield,and peek a boo window cracking, also the black out line seam came apart from the red fabric. The kickers was when we pick up our stroller from from the airport in Mexico and the latch mechanism gave away when my two kids were in it. It cloapsed because the locking system melted..... oops, I guess someone forgot to check that on part of the test!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tried to like it...","review":"But after ordering it twice from Amazon, and having both arrive either defective or damaged, I give up on this stroller. First one arrived and it turned out after assembly that the front fork was funky - one side longer than the other - therefore making it impossible for the wheel to sit correctly. So we returned it to Amazon and were sent a new one. It arrived in a horribly damaged box but we put it together anyway...put my almost 3 year old and 2 month old in it and tried it. Veered to the right, and after close inspection, once again we noticed that the front fork was messed up, probably during shipping. Also my 2 1/2 year old's head was brushing the top of the canopy and this stroller is VERY heavy and hard to turn. (yes I knew the front wheel would be fixed and had anticipated having to lift it to turn, etc.)Too bad, I really wanted to like this stroller, but I just don't have much faith in the company anymore."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT!","review":"When you are a mother of twins (or two small children for that matter) you become accustomed to lugging around huge pieces of baby equipment - it's part of the job. With that being said, this jogger, by far, is the easiest to cart around - not too heavy, not too many parts and it is nice and sturdy (not to mention that my 6 mo old boys love it!). It's great for moms like myself to have - no more excuses on why I can't run any more! Handles great - it's no different than other joggers so steering can be cumbersome but it's a nice smooth ride and as long as you don't need to make a series of sharp turns - you'll love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I highly recommend this stroller","review":"I walk an hour a day using my Double Trouble stroller and my toddler and newborn seem to look forward to the walks as much as I do. I also have a single jogger by Baby Jogger, but I find myself using my double stroller even when I'm just pushing one.The Tike Tech Double Stroller stands taller than most jogging strollers which is easier to push for those of us who are tall, especially if you're on roller blades. However, the bar is adjustable for those who don't need the extra height.Another nice feature is the adjustable seat safety bar which I haven't seen on other strollers. My toddler loves holding onto it.My personal favorite features are the multiple storage compartments and the smooth ride. This stroller is wonderful for jogging, walking, exercising, and trips to the beach or zoo. However, as others have said, it isn't ideal for trips to the mall. If you intend to purchase a stroller for outdoor recreational use, I highly recommend this stroller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely disappointed","review":"We were swayed by the positive Amazon reviews but have been extremely disappointed in this poorly made stroller. Of the many design flaws, I'll specifically name 4:(1) The sun/rain hood has nothing to keep it down, any bit of wind causes it to flap backwards on itself(2) Turning requires significant downward force on the handle bar to lift the front wheel. Unfortunately, the \\"adjustable\\" handle bar clicks out of position every time you push down on it to turn. Very annoying.(3) The steering was out of alignment from day 1. On inspection, it looks like the frame was constructed wrong is or misaligned.(4) The foot brake fell off after a week.Do yourself a favor-try before you buy, and look at other options. This stroller is not worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality","review":"I never even got to use this stroller. The first one I receviedwas damaged and mising parts.

The reception was good, the base is solid. We love the walkie-talkie feature. But as many reviewers said the phonebook is annoying, no search function at all. That's not the worst, both handsets lost function of quite some buttons. One is impossible to use other than taking a call. I am not sure if Motorola is bad at this or what. I own a simple Motorola cell phone, which also has two keys lost function. In addition, the handsets had very short battery life, talking maximum 20 min. The phone including the base will not ring sometimes, I am not sure it's the problem of the phone or the phone service company (Vonage). Now we are looking to just change the handsets, not sure if other brands' handsets will work with this phone base."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst phone ever","review":"This is absolutely the worst phone we've ever owned.

No matter how close you got to the base you could hear static and you got that feedback where you can hear yourself talking. Other than the reception the phone was perfect, but since a phone is more about how it works than what it has I have to give this one only one star.

Very tight rhythm section, with special emphasis in the mix on the B-3 on a couple of tunes. Good mix of different tempos, feels, sounds.

Buddy Guy's blues legacy is going the way Grant Green's did in jazz --into the commercial tank. Green's 50's and early 60's material is stunning and he is just now getting the respect he deserves. There is a reason B.B. King is the \\"King of the Blues\\" and Buddy Guy is touring with rock n rollers. King is playing his art from the heart and Buddy Guy is playing for the money. No big deal, I understand, it's just tough to swallow. Buddy, after you make your money off the rock crowd, please, please, please, make one last real blues album for the few of us real blues lovers. We would consider it a gift. We'll wait."},{"rating":"1","title":"if you liked \\"Stone Crazy\\" this album isn't for you","review":"Buddy really laid back for this album, unfortunately too far back. The groove was there, nice and swampy but buddy wasn't. It's a shame too, after \\"Slippin In\\" and \\"Damn Right I've Got the Blues\\", I expected much more. Hopefully this is just a transition album. The only saving grace on this album was \\"Had a Bad Night\\", and \\"Midnight Train\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoroughly modern blues from a master of the blues","review":"Yes, even in Australia Buddy Guy is acknowledged as a legend of the blues. His new album \\" Heavy Love \\" is modern enough to be on the Pop charts (even though it probably won't get there!)but so shot through with the blues that it would please even the most narrow minded blues purist.On \\"Saturday Night Fish Fry\\" Buddy summonses up the ghost of Louis Jordan and then turns around and does a great version of ZZ Top's \\"I Need You Tonight\\". Yet it all sounds unmistakeably like Buddy Guy music.Don't just read this review-go out and get the album! Look, I grew up with CD's so I can still call them albums can't I?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not from Buddy","review":"You could say this is a good Cd if you did not know what Buddy Guy is capable of.

It sounds really good for a live album. This CD captures what an amazing live performer Neko Case is, and the unique covers make this release worth buying if you already have her studio albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's short, but she's still amazing","review":"I would agree that this isn't her best album, and I think it's mainly because it's just not as cohesive as her studio efforts. Still, there are some lovely songs (I particularly like \\"If You Knew\\" and \\"Hex\\"), and there's no getting around the fact that even Neko's lesser efforts are better than 95% of the other singers recording these days. Nonetheless, if you're looking to buy your first Neko Case album, I would actually start with Furnace Room Lullaby; and even though I think this album is a good representation of her live presence, it shouldn't be a substitute for a ticket to one of her shows. Seriously, her voice is absolutely phenomenal, and can't be done justice by something as small as a compact disc!"},{"rating":"1","title":"800 watt inverter","review":"This inverter sort of meets it's specifications.

I sometimes wonder if I AM just lazy, or \\"not trying hard enough\\".This book helped me so much to understand and validate my experiences---the sometimes vague---sometimes acute pain that lasts for months in one part of my body, then suddenly moves to another area.I shared it with my caregiver, who is close to me, and it helped her to understand that which she did not understand before.This is a wonderful book that every sufferer of \\"fibro\\" should own, and every caring family member or friend should read.

Even so, I was appalled by the fact that this book contains so little, while its author claims to explain so much. The kind of advice I found in the book is really just what a person with no knowledge on the subject but with good sense could tell me. I went to the sections that interested me most and could not find anything of interest there. The questions I had were unanswered. One example: I wanted to know about foods that can trigger fibromyalgia, and what the book says is that coffee and chocolate may be bad for you (no wonder, once coffee and chocolate are considered bad for almost all conditions), and that there are foods that can trigger fibromyalgia (but what foods? THAT was the information I wanted!) It may be a good book if you have never heard of fibromyalgia before.

The majority of the book is taken up by stories, boring!!! If the cover implies, \\"Cat Collectibles\\", that's what I expect. Not so much here, the prices are out of date and listed in the back of the book.

They are much more sophisticated than the American television shows/series which require a laugh with every word, or every sentence spoken. English comedy is much more subtle and doesn't distract you with a constant laugh track to let you know when to smile or laugh. No, I'm not English, but I find their intelligent presentation of humor to be more full of pathos combined with laughter than their American cousins.

It covers the fall of Singapore, the building of the Burma Railroad and being a POW in a Japanese WWII camp. But it's more than that, it's a life story of a man who comes to grips with his torture and finally his torturer. It's a moving story and you won't be able to put it down.I also readShip of Ghosts: The Story of the USS Houston, FDR's Legendary Lost Cruiser, and the Epic Saga of her Survivorswhich focuses more on the guys who laid the rails. Eric being an officer and skilled labor was spared that task, but it also was his downfall as a POW.The thing that struck me was that his take was that for every meter of track someone died. Either conscripted native labor or a POW. And that now that track is only 60 miles long and deadends with minimal usage. What a waste.Oh, and waterboarding, it's not just for the prisoners in Gitmo, Eric got the full treatment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really torture","review":"Mr. Lomax seems to be a nice gentleman that suffered through WW2, but torture, not really. From his book, he never spent even one day working on the Burma Railroad. Every time he was moved from camp to camp, it was by truck. He was fed and had medical attention after he was beaten for having a forbidden radio and map.I really found the book not worth reading, unless you want to read about a WW2 radio operator, not a combat soldier, talk about suffering, somewhat, through the war."},{"rating":"2","title":"the real River Kwai","review":"I first heard about Mr. Lomax in the \\"Guidepost\\" magazine, and was eleven when I read this \\"the Railway Man\\". And I must say, it's a painful read. After reading an eye-witness account of the treatment of the prisonners, \\"Bridge to the River Kwai\\" seems so...tame. This is the real stuff.It's graphic, like when he drescribes the brutal treatment at the hands of the captors, the endless interrogations, being swarmed over by red ants when they were put in cages, and about the man who tortured him all those years.Then he talks about going back to England, marrying, and then the jolt of his former torturer being alive. And that they met up again, and how he forgave.I'm surprised it's out of print, and I still think it should be more widely read. The story may be gut-wrenching (in more ways than one), but when he survived it all, one can't help but wonder how, when so many have died along the way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent , thank you","review":"We care books was wonderful in making sure I recieved my book after the post office had made a mistake during the holiday season."},{"rating":"2","title":"Profoundly moving","review":"I read this many years ago and it has stayed in my mind ever since as one of the most moving books I've ever read.Eric Lomax was a prisoner of war, captured in Singapore in 1942.He was sent to work on the \`death railway' - on the River Kwai in Thailand. He tells of his terrible ordeal of torture and punishment with a quiet dignity.And along the way, he manages to find a way to forgive his past.I don't know why I picked up this book as war memoria are not usually in my reading repertoire. But I'm so glad I did.So shocking, so moving, I cried many tears. His fortitude and acceptance, a sense of distance, with great quietness, is what touched me most.Eric died recently and sadly will not live to see the film currently being made of his words.An amazing story and a great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"The full course of emotions from hate to forgiveness","review":"This was a great book by a survivor of the Burma-Thailand Railway, and takes the reader through the author's eyes through his early life and induction into the military trough his experiences in the war and then his struggle to return to his life and to find peace. The early part is sort of detailed, but it sets the background well for what happens to this soldier in his time and confinement in the prisons of the Japanese. The best part of the book is the final portion where he finds peace and journeys back to Thailand to face his past and a Japanese who he held with much anger. Certainly a different aspect of the Death Railway story, and thought provoking about our human relationships."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I guess I didn't realize how much the \\"railroad\\" would come into play for such a long time at the start of the book.

But this is an act of hate. This book is the most horrible compilation of the most awful blasphemies and lies one could ever utter against the Prophet, peace be on him, and on Allah, blessed be His name. This book is a curse of Satan to those who read it, much worse than Rusdi's book. As soon as I realized what this book is cursed (and Helmat is cursed also), I tear it apart and have burned the pieces. I need purification from this curse and the blessing of Allah. That such a book and others come from America really show that this nation is the most cursed, evil and satanic country in the world, the Big Satan, truly. If you live in this cursed place like me, pray Allah, blessed be His name, that you may not come across such cursed satanic books as this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very biased perspective that perverts the facts.","review":"Ms. Hekmat has clearly embarked on interpreting every aspect of the Islamic religion in the negative. Since the Quran forms the basis of the Islamic belief system, Hekmats book is a gross misrepresentation of this belief system. Indeed his arguments may carry water for any scholar who is ignorant of Islamic history, law and practices, yet for an accurate depiction and understanding of Islam and the Prophet Mohammed (P.B.U.H) I recommend that readers avoid this one in place of something with an unbiased evaluation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not accurate at all","review":"I am a graduate student doing research on the veil/hijab. This book is an awful treatment of Muslim traditions and is based on the authors opinions rather then on historical facts.

In order to be intellectually honest, one should provide references to historical events, present analyses of these events as found in classical texts, and then provide his or her own analysis and concluding remarks. Instead, _The Status of Women in Islam_ takes quotations and events out of context, sprinkles them with distortions and inaccuracies, ignores classical commentary, and then draws distorted conclusions.This book is not a scholarly critique of the role of women in Islam. Rather, it is a sustained polemic. It is hate literature. I am shocked that Amazon sells it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A work of biased research, and incomplete information","review":"If you are looking for a true understanding about women's rights in Islam, do NOT read this book. It is equitable to saying that to read a true account of Western society, read the history of the Nazi's. The experiences of one person, from one perspective, are never enough to give anyone a full understanding of what an entire system works. Islam is a complete way of life, and it's laws regarding the rights, responsibilities and relations between men and women come from a clear wisdom of dealing with real social problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Listen up!","review":"To comment on the last person's comment's, I would like to say that Muslim women are individuals of their own in Islamic Law. They have the right to an education, to own and sell property of their own, consent at marriage, right to divorce, child custody, etc. Would these rights be given to someone who can't (or considered) to not think on their own? One can see that easily in Islamic hadeeths (tradition of the prophet). Women had their own opinions and voiced them publicly. They were in the front lines of battle, they were even the teachers of men (the wives of the prophet). In fact, a huge chunk of the Islamic hadeeths were transmitted by women and none were questioned by the early Islamic scholars. I am truly disapointed that society still thinks Muslim women are considered inferior and this book is a good indicator of that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book on Strategic Management","review":"This book is very excellent for being comprehensive and well organized. It is also written in very lucid language but professional, which made it easy for the reader to go through the book and understand the ideas of the authors.

It covers many aspects of strategic management like finance, marketing, purchasing, and planning organization, human resources and non-business strategic management.The authors support their ideas by case studies. In fact they incorporated 19 case studies in the text that make it very practical and unique."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should women be dominated by men??!!","review":"This book teaches women to be submissive to their husbands, and not to pursue any self-fulfillment outside of the home. If you are a woman who dares to be anything other than a fully submissive housewife, then this book is not for you. Women have every right to pursue the same goals and ambitions as men. You don't need any man (or in this case, a dominated woman) to tell you otherwise. This book is a waste of your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Demereye quality that I expect","review":"I received this today and knew within a minute of opening it that I would be returning it. The handle seems too lightweight and flimsy. The handles may be welded but they are riveted as well and you can see the rivet impressions on the inside of the pain. I hate that. In addition, there's a small crack where the handles meet the sides of the pan. Food and liquid can very easily get in to this space.

He later discovers that he and Piper share the same city and work near each other, so this leads to a few dates for them both. Piper is running from her past and a mistake she can't forgive herself for, and Mitch's growing attraction to her causes her to feel threatened.I liked Mitch as a character, but Piper behaved, for the most part, like an idiot. There's feeling guilty for what you did, and then there's 'I don't deserve to live' level drama. Piper's behavior is grossly unrealistic and downright silly at times. There are some decent supporting characters, including a married couple who befriend Piper. However, Piper's family includes kids named \\"Thai\\" and \\"Asia\\" (really?). It's not a truly bad book, but it's a mediocre romance at best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst game ever!!!!","review":"I wanted to start this off with a \\"do NOT buy this game\\". It is extremely boring and it looks like someone just designed it on their computer and just made a thousand copies of it to sell. Very bad production. This was a complete waste of my $12.99. I wouldn't even have purchased it if it was $1. That's how bad it is. There are different categories like wedding, Christmas, etc. And each category had about 8 different games in it. There's hardly any music and the multiple choice questions flash by on the screen. The questions are uninteresting. If you want an exciting game, try the Shout About Movies DVD games. I really like all the Shout About DVD game series."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great Ars Magica adventure","review":"I ran chapter 1 about 6 months ago. It was subtly challenging.

There are a variety of striking photos, although several I thought seemed familiar to me. The photos are what \\"makes\\" the book. Much of the text is basically like a stream of consciousness poem listing out words or phrases associated with the colour on the page. It's not intriguing, it's unhelpful. The \\"colour quiz\\" consists of a couple of pages of words. You are supposed to figure out the words you want to colour your room/house with, and then there's a key that tells you the colour. I didn't find that too helpful. If you already know absolutely basics, for instance that blue is meant to be soothing, red is energizing, purple is mystical or sensual, then this isn't the book for you. The information is very limited."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good decorating resource!","review":"McCauley has crafted a great resource for those of us whose decorating sense is not a natural gift. He outlines his argument for color as a shorthand for our society. We tell people who we are by the colors we choose for our clothes and the colors we choose for our homes.He starts off with color associations: red/pink, yellow/gold/orange, as well as blue/purple/turquoise and showcases big and bold photographs to highlight these associations.He then moves on to the function of color. Instead of looking for a color, readers can consult this guide when looking for a statement or a mood. Looking for serenity or clarity? Start at pages 50 and 94, respectively. Not sure what you are looking for? You could always take the Color Choice Quiz at the back of the book.I liked the overall presentation and readability of this book.

Her beautiful talent is wonderfully portrayed on \\"Surfacing,\\" her latest LP. Her past albums are also very good and have a deep, meaningful, passionate realm to them that sets a hypnotic pulse. It's always relaxing to listen to her beautiful voice and her poetic lines of lyrics.

The writing was very well done. Levin does an excellent job of developing the characters, however I didn't like the two main characters (Max and Zach.) I found them very unsympathetic and was highly annoyed by their personalities and how they went about their jobs. Can we really expect police officers to act as judge and jury, despite the breakdowns in the \\"system\\"?One of the themes throughout the book is an officer bringing in a blatant criminal, only to see them set free due to a technicality or some other legal maneuvering.

Aside from giving North American viewers a rare and fascinating glimpse of a country (Uruguay) that has for so long languished in the shadow of bigger neighbors Argentina and Brazil, Whisky delivers an antidote to the photogenic violence and exoticized romance that in recent decades have tended to dominate both international distribution of Latin American cinema and (perhaps as a consequence) the North's perception of the region. At the same time, this impeccably acted and directed film offers a timely but low-key critique of the effects of the global economy on the kind of marginally poor--but not destitute or violent--people that comprise the majority of Latin America's inhabitants. The film does so without caving in to the demands of the market, which explains its slow pace and also its failure get nominated for an Oscar--a nomination it most certainly deserved."},{"rating":"1","title":"A fantastic sleep aid","review":"This wasn't a class I looked forward to taking and this book didn't help.

I guess every author is entitled to a bomb in their career and I think this is Ms. Thornton's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Humorless, boring","review":"I didn't realize until I was done that this was a reprint. From the beginning, I found the writing almost reporter-like, lacking empathy. The purported emotions didn't seem to ring true, although there was enough situational drama that it ought to have rung the heartstrings. Instead it was quite flat. Several times the story line went into past tense, which was less engaging, and sometimes put-offing. It almost seemed that Ms. Thornton couldn't figure out how to describe the scene real time. Adam had the kind of scarred past that I usually find appealing, and Claire was in theory a strong woman (who seemed to go to pieces rather frequently).

Sure the turmoil taking place in France & America was very real, and this author didn't come close to relaying it realistically - one example: a woman frets because she thinks Alexander Hamilton and Aaron Burr might show up at the same party but noooo, someone says, the Hamiltons were specifically not invited because Burr was; according to history, things like that did not happen, and these two men, were in fact, cordial to one another in public, (I hate to defend Burr, but it's true).

He's a gifted story teller -- and this is a carefully-crafted book, and before your done you've had the best Irish history and culture lesson one could ever have.There's even mystery and intrigue, as Tommy is stalked across the world by an obsessed woman who tries to kill him.

Those are some adjectives, this album brings them to my mind.There are a few tracks that I really like, mostly the ones where it's just Phil and his guitar (though some of those ones conjur up the same adjective-list for me), but overall I hate this album.

Don't get me wrong, we're not talking derivitive stuff here, Heather's got her own style, her lyrics are thoughtful, in-your-face and the music/production is first-rate. I know I'll be playing this one in the car for a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Check out I'm the girl!","review":"I love this CD. Heather definately needs to get some publicity! It's a crime against humanity that such a great artist is going virtually unrecognized. My favorite song would have to be \\"I'm the Gril\\" Which is a fast past theroretical song, which I think may be about past lives. \\"Paper Cup\\" Also has great lyrics. My only complaint is that toward the end, a few tracks begin to sound alike."},{"rating":"1","title":"All those reviews drive me to a mistake","review":"When a read different gorgeous things about this album I thought: ok, let's buy it. I heard twice and now I regret about it. I mean: is not a bad album, but: c'mon, is just another one, similar to anothers records."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lingers in the past","review":"This is possibly the most well-known CD from Heather Nova...her music has become familiar on the sountracks of many of the teen dramas that saturate the TV. That captures the essence of her music, teen angst...though better written then most. The music is beautiful, the use of cello is a bonus, but the CD is uneven and all over. Heather Nova is much better when seen live, avoid the studio produced CDs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heather - Nothing heals me like you do","review":"The 90's seems to have brought on a rush of female vocalists and on this her 2nd(official) album I don't think I have any doubt Heather stands \\"Heart and Shoulder\\" above the rest.Why Heather is still not the \\"next big thing\\", I just don't know. Alanis' new album does not touch \\"SIREN\\" on any count. From the jangly guitars of \\"London Rain\\" to the sheer poetry and violin of probably the most underrated song of the album \\"Winterblue\\" the effect is spellbinding. What an apt title, I think if I was a sailor I would also be drawn in for life by this siren.What more can I say? BUY IT!!!! Actually, buy a copy for all your friends as well just to be on the safe side!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorites!","review":"Heather Nova is one of the most under-rated singer-songwriters of today, with her haunting voice and evocative lyrics. I bought both Siren and Oyster after hearing ''London Rain'' and ''Walk this World'' on the radio, and was (as so often happens!) at first disappointed that the other tracks on the CDs were so different in style from these two. However, it wasn't long before the other songs hooked me as well, and now one or the other of these CDs seem to always be in my car CD-changer.My favorite songs on Siren are ''London Rain'', ''I'm the Girl'', ''Winterblue'', and ''Widescreen'', but every one on the CD is great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Talented Artist","review":"Siren is a truly great album. It is rich with variety and powerful lyrics, and contains a number of wonderful songs. If you like Tori Amos or K's Choice, I think you'll like Heather Nova too. I discovered Heather Nova when a couple of her songs were played on \\"Dawson's Creek.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Unbelievably good","review":"I just discovered Heather Nova on the web. And today, at a used book store, I found \\"Siren\\" for $2. Probably the best $2 I ever spent. Every track is good. Not too many albums I can say that about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hits like a super nova, then disappears","review":"Excellent, moody CD that is both surreal and uneven in spots. Not for everybody, but for those who like the neo-chicklit rockers, you might just have a love affair with this collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Please Heather--there's more to the world than SexSexSex....","review":"OYSTER was a great album and so I was naturally excited about SIREN when I walked into Blockbuster and THERE IT WAS.SIREN is a good album, but the lyrics are kind of repititious. Someone needs to tell this girl that there is more to life than, ah, fiddling around.If this'll be your first Heather Nova album, go for OYSTER. You can't regret it. It's impossible. Really."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sensuality: the subject of her new album","review":"The CD is full of sensuality. It is also full of controversy. Listen to the song 'Island'. A song about a brutal relationship. Heather Nova is not only talented for music, she has also a very interesting story to tell."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work for me...","review":"Didn't work for me... I still wonder: where is the romance? The hero is a jerk...and he obviously still loves his first wife. The heroine seems like a poor replacement.

He even calls his first wife's name while poor heroine is delivering his baby..."},{"rating":"1","title":"The theory of theory (verbiage)","review":"This book raises one interesting theoretical question: does poetry have an obligation to be amusing, enjoyable, understandable, or is it OK to be boring, unintelligible, and \\"theoretically\\" correct? Like they say, I wanted to like this book. I really did. But, man, is it dull."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short Life -- not worth it.","review":"Similar to others, I purchased these to replace the factory OEM bulbs when one burned out and they last only 9 months. One burned out and within a month the other burned out. After the 2nd one burned out, I checked the specs and was amazed that these were only rated for 125 hours. For the $40 I paid for the set, I definitely won't be purchasing these or any other SilverStar branded bulbs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good lighting... while it lasts!","review":"I enjoyed the satisfactory output of these bulbs, but within five months, one bulb burned out. The other burned out two months later. These bulbs do a great job of lighting the road ahead, but within a few months, they'll only do a great job of lighting half of the road -- either the left half or the right! These days, police aggressively patrol for suspected DUI offenders by stopping cars with burned-out lights. As a professional musician who is often on the road at 2-3AM on Friday and Saturday nights, I don't need the hassle. I need reliable headlights, and these Sylvanias just aren't it."},{"rating":"1","title":"H7 ST Bulb Dead after 3 months","review":"Bought 2 H7ST lowbeam bulbs 3 months ago and 1 has burnt out already. I honestly did not notice a difference between them and my stock lowbeams except that the stock bulbs lasted 6 years rather than 3 months :-/."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother.","review":"I installed two brand new Sylvania SilverStar High Performance bulbs in my 2004 MINI Cooper in December 2008 and now have to replace them less than a year later.

However this is the 2nd set I have purchased for my SAAB 95 in the last 10 months. So one might consider their limited longevity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Happy","review":"I bought this product thinking it would provide more light then my standard factory bulbs from 2008. Maybe the lights need to be re-calibrated to point higher, otherwise the distance is poor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy this only if you own stock in Sylvania!","review":"This brand has got to be one of the worst ever. Unluckily for us, it's the only one carried by our local auto parts store. The bulbs last maybe a month then need to be replaced again, and we've used Sylvania's headlight, brake light, and taillight replacement bulbs, replacing 5 in the past 2 months alone. This is ridiculous! Have now decided to buy replacements of a different brand online to avoid wasting more money on Sylvania bulbs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the upgrade I had hoped and they didn't last long","review":"Several years ago when I replaced the headlights in my 2008 Chevy Impala with these bulbs it made a 100% difference and I was impressed. When I recently replaced the factory bulbs of my 2010 Mazda CX-7 with these bulbs, the difference was only marginally noticeable. It may be that the factory bulbs of the CX-7 were better than those of my Impala or it may be that my expectations were higher this time around. Either way, the difference was not really worth the cost of upgrade and to top it off, both bulbs died w/in a week of each other only 5 months after installation. The improvement was barely noticeable and probably not worth the price of the \\"upgrade\\" but the fact that they only lasted 5 months makes me wish I had not made this purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"They don't last","review":"They don't last at all. Got less than 2 months out of the set I just put in. Certainly not worth the money. I won't buy these again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"I purchased these as replacement headlamps for my Pacifica and they worked great until the other day one had already burned out again! They only lasted 10 months! I'm used to other brands which were also cheaper lasting 4-6 years. Very disappointed and I will buy a different brand next time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Giving it a try","review":"Update: One of the two bulbs blew after 1 year and 5 days! I won't be able to exchange for warranty. However, the bulbs work great and I do quite a bit of night driving, so perhaps I have used 2-3 years worth in one year compared to normal use.I've read the reviews that this bulb has been blowing out in less than a year - I've noticed the 12 month satisfaction guarantee on the package and I hope that it will not be necessary to return the product. However, the instructions clearly state to wear a glove and \\"do not\\" touch the bulb with bare hands. Having worked with halogens in the past, by touching the bulb with your hands, it Will shorten the life of the bulb due to the natural oils in our hands.It's now winter and I should get a good feel for the bulbs and I'll be back to report my findings.Four stars for now because I'm sure it is going to work, it's a bulb. Hopefully I will give it the last star in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"short life, still yellowish","review":"this headlight bulb is not pure white, it only less yellowish than the stock bulbs. It is difficult to tell if you are using silverstar or stock bulb because the color is very close. you only can tell when you have it side by side to compare. don't waste money on silverstar bulbs if you are looking for white headlight bulbs. In addition, the life of silverstar bulbs are very short. 6 months is max... maybe..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short Life Span","review":"I bought these at the end of February this year. Here it is, halfway through September, and they already are burned out. Seven months for a bulb? No thanks. Not when my OEM bulbs lasted 18 months."},{"rating":"1","title":"These fail too soon!","review":"After using the H7 Silverstar in two cars over the last few years, I have given up on them. As noted in some of the other reviews, the light is pretty good, but they have a very short life. I was lucky if I got 6 months out of a lamp, and that gets very expensive quickly. If you are looking for longer life from the \\"Ultra\\" Silverstar bulbs, forget about it! Same problem - burn out after a few months, and you are facing the replacement expense (let alone the hassle of changing bulbs, and the increased risk of getting ticketed for headlamp out!)."},{"rating":"1","title":"One star is too many.","review":"I cannot recall another product that so consistently lowers my expectations. I have been through 6 of these bulbs in a Mazda5 in less than 2 years with fairly limited night driving. They were installed correctly, were not exposed to water, and failed on both sides. I took to carrying a spare in the glove box in case I got stopped by the police who noted the burnt bulb before I did. I have seen nothing but similar complaints at other consumer sites.I have replaced these with a Phillips model that seems more durable thus far.Stay away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing scenes - find a better DVD","review":"This DVD is really low quality. The sound is very low, and the movie is even missing scenes... what the heck?I'm not expecting Criterion treatment here, but skip this version in particular. The movie is worth a few bucks for the five or six truly funny scenes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bill Murray Lite","review":"This is a series of sketch comedy. Some work, some don't, but none of them are laugh out loud funny. I bought this for the Bill Murray piece. Unfortunately, I've seen better (and worse) pieces by him on Saturday Night Live. I should have bought that. The Woody Allen take off is okay. To be fair, I made the purchase fully expecting tripe. I was just hoping for a better Bill Murray character. I would have rated it one star, but there is just enough going for it, to keep me from throwing it out after I watched once. This is one you'll have to buy, if you want to see it, because I highly doubt that it's on any rental or library shelves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless Web Related Book","review":"Note the subtitle: award winning web site DESIGNERS, not designs. This is a compilation of graphics from a short list of web site design firms. No actual web site is presented in its entirety. The fact that these graphics originate from web pages is irrelevant in this book. The book strives to be artsy in itself, splattering a hodge-podge of non-sequitor images across each section prefaced by meaningless musings from a web designer.

Better ideas are available on the Internet for free."},{"rating":"1","title":"Artistic But Not Usable","review":"Like most of the websites described in the book, this book isn't very usable because it's trying so hard to be \\"artistic.\\" The screen shots are blurry and the text and graphics are combined in such a way that it makes it difficult to read.I could forgive the author if content was good, but it's not.

We have had it for a year and I am still finding new ways in which all the pictures are interconnected with each reading. I never tire of reading it to my son and we read it a lot!

The characters are a hoot, with young nun Rosetta Christopher, who is 16, energetic, and slightly destructive in her enthusiasm, the more cautious (devil) Chrono, and Azmaria, the timid soprano who is a holy instrument of God. Along with Father Remington (handsome and good natured), the mysterious Joshua (Rosetta's sick younger brother, now involved with devils!), and another equally mysterious Gem Witch, the story and the characters will draw you along. Certainly a fascinating watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good anime, bad ending","review":"I enjoyed watching this anime a lot. I especially liked Chrono's and Rosette's relationship. The thing is that I hated the ending. I mean, it was so tragic for my taste and it was a bit confusing even. I have to give it a credit for being one of the memorable endings, though. I admit that I cried at the end but it wasn't the ending I was looking for.

The sound editing was some of the worst that I have ever heard. The acting was B-movie grade at best. It was visually sloppy and awkward. We could not finish the film, and we have sat through some poor films. There also seemed to be a very strong Christian agenda to this production. We rented it from Blockbuster and expected a secular approach to the storytelling. Instead, it was as if we spent $5 to go to a church that we didn't want to go to. It seems as though, form other sources, this person's life story provides a compelling topic but you would never know from this film. Get the PBS documentary instead. I wish that we did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amateur!","review":"We watched the video last night, and we were majorly disappointed. The sound seemed as if the dialogue had been recorded inside a tin can. There were also times when it was almost impossible to understand.

If it were possible, I'd like to even get a refund. I know that PBS made a documentary about Aimee Semple McPherson's life.

Simplistic, mundane, aesthetically unpleasant, and a waste of good film describes this movie's strengths. Too bad, too - Aimee Semple McPherson is such a compelling character of the early 20th century, and good biographies, both documentary and dramatization, are needed to tell this compelling story. This, especially because from this story come many of the principled debates of today - religion, celebrity, public scandal and political power."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for my mentoring program as conversations starters!","review":"This is very handy for groups activities for short periods of time.

A better storyline would have justified the naked boys on the beach and running around.

So as one who is curious about it, I'll probably never get to make up my own mind about it. I'm too scared to order it.

Varney was good; I don't know if I was disappointed or not that he didn't do his bizarre Earnest-esque schtick (hey, I like juvenile humor!) Bader did a great Jethrine.

Somebody's A-Greenin' Ya, Jethro!","review":"You don't need no sixth-grade education to see that there is more of tragedy than of comedy about this project. As with most films based on classic sitcoms, this one falls flat. Although there are some very talented actors in the cast, they are completely wasted by being saddled with a poor script and even poorer direction. The remainder of the cast is simply inept. Director Spheeris is apparently unable to effectively stage even the simplest gag, a serious handicap when attempting to film a supposed comedy. The viewer is left with a series of unfunny, uninteresting, unconvincing, and contrived scenes, none of which is even mildly entertaining. Discerning viewers will find this to be a complete waste of time. The original series was far from highbrow, but it was downright distinguished in comparison to this mess. Stick with the reruns of the original series, and skip this little disaster. Cousin Bessie could have done better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good","review":"This is not a good movie.

This feature version, however, lacks all those elements. There are a few talented actors in the cast, but their talents are completely wasted; the rest of the cast is simply devoid of talent. The script is atrocious, and director(?)Penelope Spheeris once again demonstrates that she possesses no comedic instincts whatsoever. In fact, Spheeris could almost be labeled the Ed Wood of the 90's, except for the fact that Wood could occasionally be funny, whereas Spheeris is never funny, simply pathetic.

The characters in the TV series were backwoods and nieve, however very loveable, funny, and a pleasure to watch. The characters in the movie cannot be connected to the TV series in any way. The real Jed Clampett would not have been taken in by some floozy bimbo to the point that Miss Jane had to save his fortune. There's no way the real Granny would have been kidnapped and held in a rest home against her will. Jethro was so silly until he wasn't funny at all and Ellie Mae didn't have her critters that she loved so much in the TV series. The real Mr. Drysdale guarded the Clampett's forturne with his life and wouldn't let anyone come near it. This movie was a huge disappointment.

However, there is one bright spot: Lily Tomlin as Jane Hathaway, she captures the character perfectly, the way Nancy Kulp did in the classic TV show. But, the all-time worst performance is,without a doubt, Diedrich Bader (Oswald from \\"The Drew Carey show\\") as Jethro.Don't waste money on this movie!!! Instead buy the DVDs from MPI.

Spend your money on the original show, especially the first couple seasons, which were pure genius. Every actor in this debacle has great talent, they just aren't allowed to show it here, in this very stiff, very calculated, very poor copy of a great premise. It's like the fifteenth generation of a bad copy, totally distorted and unrecognizable. How Buddy Ebsen agreed to appear in this is beyond me. He must have really needed a payday.

The best way to describe it is entirely through adjectives- beautiful, exciting, calming and moving all at once. As a gen-xer, I never thought I'd like music that features a harp- but I never knew a harp could be so moving! My favorite track is the fifth track- solo/running/line. This is one of the movements of the Primal Mix and features congas, gradually filling out and abruptly switching to an oboe and flute, continuing to fill out and concluding with a much slower pace, seamlessly transitioning into the next movement.

This recording cannot be listened to actively. It can't be done. Futhermore, in the background, it is annoyance more than anything else.

Unfortunately, there are two different Santa Fe wiring schemes in the 2005 model - one that includes a factory-installed amplifier and one that doesn't. I have the model that includes the amp, and this wiring adapter does not work with that wiring set-up. I have no idea if there is something in the owner's manual that identifies which set-up your Santa Fe might have or how you would distinguish between the wiring harness adapter for a non-amp vehicle and an amped vehicle. All I know is, that this one doesn't work with my 2005 Santa Fe."},{"rating":"1","title":"a weaker schaum's outline","review":"Pitched to a weakish high school math background. Scant treatment of continuous random variables is one of several reasons this fails to achieve the comprehensiveness of other schaum's outlines. There may be courses where this is a good study aid (e.g. probability for poets), but it's a poor reference to basic probability for someone with a stronger math background.Like other schaum's it is riddled with typographical errors and there is no errata. Eg. Appearing twice:Correlation(X,Y) = Cov(X,Y) / E(X)E(Y).Even at their worst, I still find the schaum's guides (this one included) better than a typical textbook with the same scope.

In examples, \\"a class contains n boys and r girls\\" nearly always had n>r. One problem describes a college where 25% of the boys and only 10% of the girls take math classes. For a book used in a mathematics course, I consider this irresponsible because it reinforces the feelings of isolation that many young women studying math already experience. Another problem is about a woman who has eleven friends and is trying to plan a dinner party. Problems about men are usually about the cards they are dealt or the problems on a test they are taking. In short, the default is that the character in a problem is male, unless the problem has been phrased in a way that emphasizes activities that society stereotypes as feminine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Gift","review":"This pen looks much nicer in person than it does on the web.

In fact, it almost seems as if Zakk is deliberately trying to distance himself from his heartland roots in an effort to \\"redeem\\" himself as the wild powerchord crunching axeman of Ozzy Osbourne. The result is a group of over the top songs that offer little substance or melody. Unfortunately, \\"Sonic Brew\\" gives the impression that the melodic \\"Book of Shadows\\" CD was nothing more than a stretch beyond his stylistic confines. That's shame. As for \\"Sonic Brew,\\" it is an overly aggressive, underproduced collection of songs that offer its listeners nothing more than a reason to bang their heads. Typical from you'd expect from an 80's guitar god."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing album from a guy musician","review":"while i love Zakk Wylde and his musical integrity and passion, i've even grown to resent those that carry a chip on their shoulder because of things out of their control. there's no question of his talent as anyone knows, but this album isn't half as musical as Pride and Glory or Book of Shadows. P&G showed his amazing jamming aspect on top of good songs. But, BLS song structures are lacking---if not \\"sonically\\"(no pun intended on Sonic Brew) Bored to Tears is a decent tune, but from there it's just pissy music. I believe his live shows suffered(why does he have another guitarist with him? ) not only from the negativity of the album and his character on stage, but the high volume caused it to be lacking musically all the more. I love Zakk Wylde, but i hope his next step actually spells \\"MUSIC\\" I want another P&G or something that suits Zakks strong points."},{"rating":"1","title":"A major disappointment","review":"I bought this CD back in December when it was an import, and was eagerly awaiting its arrival, as Zakk is one of my favorite guitarists. However, this is not a good album at all, in fact, I think it's pretty close to terrible. The songwriting is horrible, and while the guitar playing is good, the guitar tone on most songs is awful. The biggest disappointment is that there are few true rock albums released anymore, and I had hoped that this would be one of the best. Oh well, if you want great rock albums, check out Mourning Widows and/or Gov't Mule.

The album starts off at a nice pace, but falters in the middle, and dies off slowly at the end. \\"Bored To Tears\\" is a great song with excellent lyrics, but this is not the case with the other songs. \\"Taz\\" is a great solo on the acoustic guitar, but this scarcely makes up for a weak structure throughout the rest of the album. I urge fans of metal not to buy this CD, and I strongly advise fans of his days with Ozzy not to be suckered in by this one like I was.

This CD sounds like a record being played with a dirty needle, the recording is so overdriven and fuzzy sounding it just sounds like they recorded it with the sound level full in the red. A wall of fuzz with awful whinning vocals, this guy definetly should not be singing, very similar sounding to Glenn Tipton on his solo CD, guys, stick to guitaring. The last song No More Tears sums up the CD, a great Ozzy song completely destroyed and turned into wall of thick fuzzy muck, it is not even heavy, just noise.

I don't care for reviews that summarize the plot but let me just say it's about a rogue who's looking to marry a fortune and an aunt who's out to protect her niece from just such a rogue. Great characterization of two mature (in their 30s!) individuals who are not what they seem. Wonderful dialogue. And not a contrived plot device to be seen.

The book doesn't assume you know too much, which is perfect for new parents who really don't. I found it to be very comprehensive and very helpful.

The characters are largely flat and unlikable, and the story doesn't really go anywhere. There are some flashes of wit, but the novel mostly consists of cliches and situations you would find in any soap opera.If you're mature enough to handle the adult themes in this novel, why not graduate directly to novelists like Nora Roberts, Sandra Brown, or Jackie Collins?

And I was wrong it was EVEN GREATER than I thought. I loved the characters. Whether u live in NY or not u will totally relate to this book. I SUGGEST U ORDER A COPY NOW! And while ur @ it pre-order the sequel You Know You Love Me. Ull love this book if u love Angus, Thongs and Full Frontal Snogging by Louise Rennison, The Princess Diaries by Meg Cabot and others like that. While i read Gossip Girl I couldn't wait til i finished it, but @ the same time I wanted it to go on forever because the characters are so intriguing and the writing is just SO GOOD.

One of the lead male characters is nate i just about fell inlove with him if only he was real! and Blair and Serena the lead female characters r incredible!Blair hating that serena came back so now she is the underdog and again, but serena doesn't have a pleasnt welcome and thats were all the gossip starts! i say a must read i couldn't put it down!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's reasonable..........","review":"This book is basically the 90210 of the East. The main characters are Blair and Serena along with their friends and associates katy, Isabel, Jenny, Dan, Chuck etc.. This is the first in a series of books that focus on the young and rich of the upper east side and the other teens that envy them. To me the book could have had more substance but if you are looking for a little laugh and curiosity of how the other half lives this is the book for you. Their saga follows in six other books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow, shallow, shallow...","review":"Just finished reading this book and I thought it was pathetic. Why? Because it's extremely shallow and the characters are pathetic. Like somebody else on here said, these teens are snobby stuck up rich kids who waste their lives getting stoned, drunk, and drugged. They do nothing but party, gossip, and stab each other in the back. If you like books like that, then by all means, waste your money on it.I just thought this book was over all boring and really, really stupid and beneath me. And I'm seventeen. Well guess what? We're not all this dumb and immature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous book, and a waste of time!","review":"This book is completely unrealistic. The teenagers live reckless, irresponsible lifestyles that are without consequence. The author is redundant and cliche. These books are often labled as \\"guilty pleasure novels\\", but I found no enjoyment in these bland books whatsoever. Reading it was a waste of my time. I enjoyed reading a 500some-page book on the United Nations and international politics TEN times more than this book. And I'm fourteen years old. That should tell you something."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely Awful!","review":"A friend of mine told me this book would be great so I dashed out to Borders and bought a copy. I read it in a few days and was absolutely disgusted by the end.The characters in this book are horrible role models and examples for our youth. These kids seem to believe the law is beneath them (underage drinking, sex and drug use) and their parents don't seem to mind either.This series may be a bestseller, but it has terribly graphic language that is just too inappropriate for teens. Books should encourage positives and teach morals, not shed light on the ups of being bad.The Gossip Girl books are nothing but trash; it's worthless to invest any time or money into the stupid series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review by a Kid Book-Lover","review":"I'm in middle school and I'm just starting the third Gossip Girl book. Of course, these books are NOT well-written at all and aren't even that good. Then why are they so addicting? I cannot put these books down. I'm also a fan of the Clique books by Lisi Harrison, so you can see that I like somewhat unrealistic books. The characters in the Gossip Girl, not their lifestyles but their problems and personalities are easy to relate to, even if you aren't the type of person that enjoys drinking, partying, smoking, and doing drugs. PARENTS: The girls in Gossip Girl are definately not my role models. When I'm in high school I definately don't want to be like them at all (except maybe the clothes- jk). However, these are fun, quick reads that are hard to put down and good for vacation."},{"rating":"1","title":"unrealistic book that sads bad examples - but still fun","review":"I read this book with high hopes of a bridget jones for a slightly younger audience, but once I started reading the book, i was apalled by the nonchalant attitude about drinking, smoking and sex. I was raised in NYC and am born from a wealthy family. I didn't do any of this, nor know anyone who did. Just because these shallow characters are supposedly from NYC doesn't mean that they have to be alchololics, chainsmokers, bulemics, and sluts. The majority of urban children have higher, more concenmtrated class, rather than ignorance and a good body. This book apalled me...but I must admit it held my attention."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time, read a better book","review":"I read this book in honor of ALA Banned Book Week, and while I don't believe any book should be banned, I don't think this book should ever have been published. It was filled with typos and out-and-out grammatical errors that made me cringe every time I came across a new one.The characters were ALL flat, and while I felt a marginal amount of pity for the main character, I couldn't put myself in her shoes and feel any kind of sympathy for her. The book was just poorly written. It was like watching a bad teen movie but takes more of a time commitment.Instead, pick up a book worth your time likeThe Princess Diaries Box Set, Volumes I-III (Princess Diaries)by Meg Cabot, or if you really need to read about a poor little rich girl, you can't beatGingerbread,ShrimpandCupcakeby Rachel Cohn. I mean, evenBlue BloodsandMasqueradeby Melissa De La Cruz are better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seriously...","review":"The worst book I have ever read. who really cares about rich brats and their \\"tragic lives.\\" This probably only appeals to rich white kids. Which i am not."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT","review":"I thought this book was a really good book. It relates to the REAL world of a 14 - 18 year olds. Me myself being 14 and my sister being a 17 year old, i think this book is an accurate piece of work. The characters seemed real and lively, (when they felt like it) and i think i was an all-round GREAT book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome book if you like short and fun beach reads","review":"I hate when you hear that the Gossip Girl books and others like it are a waste of paper. That is an opinion and it is up to the reader. The Gossip Girl books are short fun reads. They are a great read for the summer beach and for a weekend read. If you like those kinds of books great this is a series for you!!! If you don't thats fine but don't go trashing them just because you don't like them.Now if you do like this style of books here is my summary: It is about rich New York friends who are in their senior year. They have their problems and friendships.Give it a try before you put it down, is all that I am asking!!Its also very cool that I have the same last name as Serina!"},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME","review":"The first Gossip Girl book was incredibly addicting. It was also very funny and entertaining. Blair Waldorf, one of the most popular and wealthy girls at her school in New York, is a character that people love to read about. Yeah, she's very bitchy, but it just makes the book a lot more addicting and hilarious. This first book in the series is about Blair's best(ditzy) friend Serena coming back to NY after a year at boarding school (of which she was kicked out). Blair, who is mad at her, decides to take revenge on her former best friend. Awesome light read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put it down!","review":"This book took me 3 nights to read! I'd start at around 10 and kept going untill 2 in the morning every time.I was always so intrigued by the lives of the characters, and what they could get away with. The freedom they are given presents so many opportunities for nasty fun! Although some may find it just another story of crazy stuck up teenagers...well what can I tell you? It is!However, if you are a big fan of racy teen fun, and want to see how it is layed down for a bunch of stereotypical partying teens this is definitely for you!I'd like to point out my favorite parts, but really it's more fun to just find them out for yourself!"},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the best books I've read in a while","review":"This book explored so many subjects, including love, sex, popularity,and so many more. I couln't put it down; I literally read it in 1 day. This book is so different because it's not like others I've read. It's entertaining because there are so many unanswered questions. Will S and N hook up again? Will B and N break up? Will D express his love to S? If you're looking for something to occupy a free Friday or Saturday night,Cecily von Ziegesar's Gossip Girl is a winner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gossip Girl is a Great Book!","review":"The book Gossip Girl really shows you what a teenager's life is like. Many people think that teenagers are innocent, and I'm sure some are, but the teenagers in this are far from innocent. This book is good for a great laugh, and a hard cry. By reading this book, you can become a rich, privilaged, and somewhat spoiled teenager like Blair Waldorf, Serena Van Der Woodsen, or Nate Archibald."},{"rating":"2","title":"If You Are A Gossip and Love to Hate You'll Love This!","review":"I loved this book. It's a refreshing perspective on somewhat realistic teans. Anyone who says the characters are air-heads or that the book is too full of superficial-ness needs to get over it! This book is fun. A taste of excitement. Like a great escape. It makes you want to drink, have promiscuous sex, and be extravagant with everything! Of course sane people won't go out trying to be just like the characters. I wouldn't mind being a little like them (gorgeous, popular, smart, ambitious). XOXOXO"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as Good as it Sounds","review":"i just had to pick up this book after hearing so many people talk about it, it sounded interesting and fun to read, but its really not worth anyone spending \\"money\\" on, maybe if you wanna read it for fun just read it, but i really did not enjoy this book at all, i didn't like it =("},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me...","review":"I just didn't like this at all. I found the book basically boring and pointless. Blair is jealous of her long time friend, Selena, who has been away at boarding school. When Selena returns, Blair fuels the fire of the gossip circle to backstab her former best friend. Nobody in the book seemed very memorable or worth the time it took to read this book, more about a lot of over-privileged teens sampling all types of mischief... gossip, drugs, heavy and constant alcohol consumption, and worse."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is Manhattan, 2008: New York was never so scandalous","review":"Better than the tv series, but that's just me. Gossip Girl is one blog you don't want to miss out on. From the beginning to the end, it keeps you interested, relating things you go through, only on a much--wealthier-level. A must read for all those who are looking for a good book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good, but too mature for kids under 14","review":"This book was very good, but i found it too have too much sexual content and the languge...Don't even get me started on what they say! There is alot of drug use, cigarettes,cigars,pot,and a drug called S. I strongly warn parents to not buy their children this book. Parents you can read it though;)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read!","review":"If you are looking for a book that is fun and easy to read (along with racy, scandilous, and a guilty pleasure) Gossip Girl is for you! All about rich friends living in New York City, Gossip Girl is something to take your mind off of your world and excape into theirs."},{"rating":"1","title":"PARENTS BEWARE!!!!","review":"Parents BEWARE!!! The author has written these books to appeal to young adults and teens. But, what she doesn't tell us parents is that her \\"novels\\" are soft, soft porn plain and simple. She splashes the pages with profanity and not just any profanity...but she uses the \\"f\\" word quite frequently. I have forbid my 8 children from ever reading junk like this and have had this authors books (Gossip Girls and The IT Girl) removed from our schools library and our local public library. Check it out for yourself at any local bookstore, flip through the pages and you will be amazed at what she has written and keep in mind...most are letting their teens read this junk. It isn't right. Where are our morals and values at?"},{"rating":"1","title":"a waste of both time and brain cells","review":"I could actually feel my IQ declining as I read this. I think I've recovered now, but I wanted to warn others, lest this become an epidemic! This book was beyond shallow -- it purports to criticize the upper crust of NY society, but instead it finds new and boring ways to glorify it. There are so many good books on the shelves right now -- do yourself a favor and pass this one by."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly stupid","review":"I dont know about the rest of you but thid book is pretty pitiful. These people in these book are incredibly sad and dumb. They put on shows for everyone else and never show true feelings. Yeah they're all rich and well-off but its absolutely ridiculous. The gossip is the dumbest thing i've ever heard. And thats mostly what they do: gossip. The parents the kids, everybody. If this was reccommended to you from sisterhood DO NOT READ IT. Its crap and a waste of time trust me. Read Sloppy Firsts or The Black Book: The Diary Of a Teenage Stud"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time...","review":"The reason why I gave this book one star was not because there was too much sex, drugs, or lack of morals; it was because it was just plain boring. It was extremely poorly written and doesn't make you care about any of the characters, even the pathetic ones who are there only for that purpose, like Danny. I checked the first three of these things out at the library and was really looking forward to reading them, thinking they'd be like The Angus Thongs books, but it turned out to be much more like a Babysitters Club book, only with richer, skankier characters.I recommend this book to: anyone who likes Dawson's Creek"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book I've read in a long time!","review":"This book was fantastic! It truly gives the feel of snobby little rich kids in a comic in an interesting way.This book is about Blair, a girl scared that she'll lose her boyfriend to her once-was best friend. To get back at her ex-BFF, she does everything in her power not to include her in anything, therefore unfolding into a slightly amusing tale of the girl gets the guy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gossip Girl","review":"To those of you that think this book is a bad representation of teenagers, here's a message: if we're not like this, we're thinking about being like this.What is so unrealistic about it? I don't get it, seriously. It was a fun light read and I can't say it was the best book ever, and I will for sure read the sequels. But for those of you who overanalyze and think that books are for picking out every single paragraph and finding some deeper meaning then this is definitely not for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"there are better books than this.","review":"Lots of girls at my school reads the gossip girl series.So, I decided to read the first book. Yet.. it was so menial compared to other books that I've read. I understand why it has other people my age who normally don't read for fun, reading it. That's a good thing. But it's like a tv show like the O.C. or something on paper. It has no lasting meaning behind it.The plot is basically :A bunch of rich people going to parties, being nasty to each, wearing expensive clothes and (what do you know..) gossiping.Mildly entertaining. But if I wanted that I could just as easily watch TV or see a movie, a bad movie.This is a good book for people who don't like to read as it isn't challenging in the least or if you just like this kind of story.But if you're looking for a book that you'll really enjoy and remember, this isn't it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Honestly one of the worst books I have read","review":"This is by far one the worst books I've ever read, it was a waste of about four hours of my life. The characterization is decent, but with the differences between them, it's hard to believe that they are friends in the first place. Also, the idea of the bulimic girl who is best friends and best enemies with this spoiled b*tch is just ludicrous. If I were you, and I had a second chance, I would avoid this book at all costs. Read The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but the drinking and drugs are a bit over-done","review":"The author has intrigued many in her 'Gossip Girl' series, and I must admit that they were so good that I couldn't put them down. However, the drinking, drugs and sex are a bit overdone, and the lifestyles that these kids live are hard to believe are true (and I doubt many people can relate to them either). But the rest of the feelings and happenings (crushes, rejections, etc.) are very common to teenage life and the author has hit the nail right on the head with these emotions.Overall, a fantastic and gripping read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gossip is Good for the soul","review":"The Gossip Girl Series, at least the ones I have read so far, are a evil treat that I have indulged in every night for the past few months.Set in New York City where the better people thrive, are the stories of a few teens; some outrageously rich living mainly on the Upper East Side, the others living in Brooklyn. They all have one thing in common, they go to the same schools, and they all want something they can't have, whether it's to be someone else, sex, or wining the heart of someone so completely out of their leauge. Along with the stories is the acutal Gossip Girl, who remains anonymous and answers the questions and responds to the comments and sightings of gossip hungry teens throughout the city.Full of drinking, an eating disorder, teen language, and drug use{only pot}, this book was wonderfully written. It has the same exact affect of real life gossip. You won't be able to put this book down!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny , Devilish , #1 vice","review":"This is an outstanding novel it is so delicious and yet elegant, it is funny laugh out loud. this is a easy summer or pick me up read with it all revolving around the popular rich crowd of teens in upstate new york it follows there love interest their drinking problems and there all over hilarious website. this is a story of love, hate, betrayal and heartbreaking secrets. this whole series is addictive like chocolate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not risque at all.","review":"I really didn't like this book. I thought there was no real plot whatsoever, I didn't care about the characters and gossip girl whoever she is, has no life since she spends all her time spreading stupid gossip I don't care about. It's not scandalous or mature or even risque. it's just not anything at all. It sucks. I think my brain's IQ started to drop after reading this piece of all too well marketed \\"book.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Not All That I Expected","review":"In this novel by Cecily von Ziegesar, her characters live in a world full of rich, shallow people. I didn't like the message that this book is sending out to teen readers. I think everyone should know that there is a lot more to teen life than parties, shopping, and impressing everyone with your wealth. None of these girls have real friends or relationships. All interactions are based on looks and not on personality. These people are not well-rounded and they have no goals in life. I thought the message this sent out to people is that when you look good, it doesn't matter wheather you're smart, kind, or have good character because people will like you no matter what. This is not true in the real world, and girls should not be misled by this. This book has no real plot, and therefore it seems to drone on page by page. I kept waiting for something meaningful to happen, but it never did."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are better books out of there for teens","review":"I've read quite a few teenage books and none of them were this garbage. This book was very poorly written, no real storyline or plot. I was halfway through the book and it was going nowhere. Just a bunch pointless episodes of drug use, alcohol and sex. The episodes were not clearly tied in with the storyline and were all over the place. The content isn't strong (unless it is too strong for you) but the author didn't know what to do with it. Many teenage books have much stronger content but are much more interesting books. There was zero character development and as others have said the characters were rather two dimensional. It was written in third person, omniscient narrator as I understand, but the characters' feelings and personalities were not at all portrayed. I didn't expect a great work of literature to begin with, but I did expect at least some substance. I thought it would be an insightful work of fiction for young adults - I was wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gossip Girl...","review":"Though many people like Gossip Girl, I was not one of them. When I read the summary of the book, I thought I'd love it. Also, people seem to like the show alot, so I figured the book had to be good. I was very wrong. The storyline would actually be really good if it wasn't for the swearing every other word, flat and shallow characters, and bad writing. The only real description the book gives are about all the designer clothes the teenagers wear. All the characters are almost exactly the same. The only thing to tell them apart are the names and the fact that we are constantly reminded that Serena is beautiful. I am not a person who buys a book and then stops reading it, but this book was so awful, I just couldn't bring myself to read anymore of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just a fun, light hearted read","review":"I almost hate that I like these books. Most of the characters are shallow as heck, the storylines are ridiculous, and if Nate were a real person I'd kick him in the groin. Nevertheless, I own the entire collection and I'm on my second time reading through it. It's addictive in a weird way. You can't take these books too seriously. For me, it's just a light, entertaining read to pass the time. I'm super girly and can admit I do find some \\"gossip\\" entertaining so I like these books. I read all sorts of different types of books when I'm in the mood for something fun and carefree I pick these up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gossip Girl","review":"So Serena van der Woodsen came back from boarding school. Blair Waldorf's not so sure that everything can go back to normal, like it used to be. Serena is just trying to be friends again, but nasty rumors have ruined her perfect reputation. Gossip girl is a story of love, hate, betrayal, and most of all, drama.Blair, and her boyfriend Nate were really getting serious about their relationship, right in time for Serena to come back and nearly sweep him off his feet. Before Serena went to boarding school, she and Blair were best friends. But after she returned, things just weren't the same between them. And all Serena wants is for everything to just go back to normal, but Blair's not making it easy.I really liked Gossip Girl. There are many more books in the series, and I can't wait to read them. I liked it because it related to problems that are realistic to the reader; friendship, love, etc. I would recommend it for girls 13 & up."},{"rating":"2","title":"snobby, hot, and sexy!!!","review":"Those are the only words i can say about this incredible book!!

These kids provide all of the good gossip that makes up the book, and it's well worth it. This is a very good book, full of gossip so good it seems real. Their exciting relationships and \\"all about me\\" attitudes really spice things up, making this an excellent book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shouldn't even be considered literature.","review":"I can't believe I used to like these books. That was when I was twelve and ignorant to the world. These girls disgust me. There is no plot line to follow. And if you enjoy reading them, well, you shouldn't bother reading at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE","review":"Insipid garbage. I've read picture books that are more intelligent- curious george for example. Had Cecily von Ziegesar written curious george, btw, she would have included an eight page description of the man's designer label yellow hat. God help us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"Gossip Girl was clearly meant to be some kind of teenage Sex and the City. In my opinion, it failed. It had no storyline to speak of, just a constant chain of pointless, meaningless and sometimes downright ludicrous events. And Gossip Girl herself, an anonymous internet scandal-monger, seemed to me to be an irritating and pointless gimmick, adding nothing to the book. The characters were shallow, bitchy, stupid and not even remotely likeable. I refuse to believe that people like this exist, in America or anywhere else. In short, it was vacuous drivel."},{"rating":"2","title":"guilty pleasure","review":"This book is unbelievably addicting. Once you read the first one, you won't be able to stop. I myself got the book today, and am 17 pages from finishing it after reading it for a few hours. This book probably is wildly unrealistic, but I really don't care. These kind of books (excluding that whole \\"Clique\\" series, which is ridiculously unrealistic) are my kind of guilty pleasure. So if you're looking for a quick and fun read, pick up the GossipGirl series. It's fun to see the world that isn't yours."},{"rating":"1","title":"ok story","review":"Although this story is entertaining, it failed to really grasp my attention. It's not original at all, and there is no real plot. It's just something that will sit on your Kindle; something read on a rainy day wen you're bored. Blair, Chuck, Serena and all the others are only described fleetingly. Characters are mentioned and then disappear.Honestly, I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fantastic Novel","review":"Look into the world of rich, glamourous teenagers as they live their everyday lives.

After many of my friends recommended this book to me, I decided to read it, but I was very close to putting it down. I could hardly keep reading the book. I would've thrown it away if it weren't my friend's book.There isn't much of a plot line, and the characters are two-dimensional. I never really learned much about the characters, or cared if anything bad happened to them. This is partly from the author's writing style. I probably would've liked this book better if she made me care more about the characters or even wrote better, but she failed largely in that department.All I want to say is, when you see this book, RUN AWAY!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No Morals, No Plot, No Brains in the characters","review":"Basically, this book is trash, when it isn't glorifying the offensive and trashy acts that it talks about, it is cussing up a storm. It focuses on drinking, drugs, and sex. There is no plot in the book. Something like a soap opera that you wish would end. I do not recommend this book to anyone. It was extremely trashy and offensive to anybody with any kind of morals"},{"rating":"1","title":"HATED IT-IT DOESN\\"T DESERVE ANYTHING","review":"1st of all, the stuff they talk about in this book is like stuff no one should be readin about, especially teens....they are always cussing and drinking(i shouldn't have to go on).....and its like ment to seem like its \\"cool\\"...2nd of all, it makes no sense, there's no plot or ne thing.i picked it up in the KIDS/teens section at an airport, read about 10 pages and was like forget this.

There was no true story line to it. The lifestyle of these teens seems very unrealistic.

Even though it was a novel, I could not believe how immature and irresponsible some teenagers, or people for that matter can be. I hated the way the girls acted toward each other and how they treated their bodies. For that matter, I was stunned at how they misused alchohol and drugs and am not even considering picking up another one of Cecily Von Ziegesar's Gossip Girl novels. She was basically showing how if you take drugs and smoke and so forth, that you will be cool in your school, have lots of friends, money and be able to do whatever you want. That is so very wrong; I despised the views in this book and hope that people who read it will not act as the characters did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stereotypical and trashy","review":"If you're looking for any sort of intelligent or thought provoking, this is definately not the book for you. The girls were stereotypical teenagers... getting drunk, having sex, and \\"suffering\\" from bulimia. This book is not about real girls, but rather the teenagers that some adults tend to believe exist. There were so many times while reading that I had to stop just because I was so angry at the characters. It was not only poorly written, but it was offensively written.Definately NOT recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book wasn't for me","review":"There are so many girls who read these books at my school, and I have no clue how they can actually like it. The writing was on a fourth grade level and the content was on a tenth grade level. The mature content didn't bother me so much, but how the author tried to make it seem like it was soooo outrageous when it wasn't that bad, now that irked me. I tried to find a character I liked, but it was too hard and so I gave up. The characters were too shallow to identify with, even the ones that would be considered the deep outsiders. The plot was too dry and to me it was also very predictable. The only thing that I liked about this book was the idea of an anonymous GossipGirl devulging details. I may have lost brain cells in the process of reading this book. Caution: Read at your own risk, people!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good.","review":"This book is very good for electric engineers who want to learn the basic of circuit design. I would expect that the book will be accompaniment by CD that will include more exercise and real demo.

I hope that this will be improved in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult Text","review":"If you are beginning CMOS analog design,please dont use this.There is very brief theory to supplement and equally insufficient physical explanations;maybe for an experienced industry professional this sort of approach suffices,but certainly this is not the text to follow.It has obvious advantages since a website with solutions is devoted to the text but that in no way compensates for the poor quality of material-it is very difficult to develop physical understanding out of this book.Maybe using Alan Gerbene's text (Bipolar and MOS Analog Design)alongside this book will help,actually it worked fine for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Callan's Proposition","review":"Cute,funny story about a man who will do anything to keep an efficient secretary.

Bernstein is a genius. Bernstein was definitely intuitively in step with interpreting Copland's compositions. This is the best. I never could understand why Bernstein had faction detractors. They should listen to this recording."},{"rating":"2","title":"A slightly dissenting voice","review":"I do not agree with what seems to be the mainstream view that these are the definitive performances of Copland's great masterpieces. I much prefer the composer's own recordings, which bring out the spaciousness and grandeur of the work better. For my taste Bernstein, while undoubtedly eliciting great virtuoso performances, takes the music much too fast, particularly in the Hoedown of Rodeo and in Fanfare."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"If you love Copland, purchases this for your Kindle Fire and play it while you read a good book.

This is very disappointing and a horrible thing to do to such a beautiful piece of music. I don't know if this is only an issue with the mp3 version or not, but I suspect it is since no other reviewers that I've read so far have mentioned it. Cutting off the end really wrecked the mood for me.

It seems strange to rate it 5 stars, meaning I love it, when it is on such a sad subject. But it is very well done and really makes a person stop and think. I recommend documentaries like this to everyone. Painful though it is to watch, it is part of history and should not be forgotten. It was interesting to me that a statistic was flashed across the screen stating that something like 75% of the population of Japan was born after 1945. They did a \\"man-on-the-street\\" sort of interview and none of the young people knew what had happened right there in their own country in August of 1945. That is a crime!!! All citizens of this planet should know about this and realize just how devastating such an event can be!"},{"rating":"2","title":"No Words","review":"This is the most moving documentary I have ever seen. We see the destruction of Nagasaki and Hiroshima from the eyes of its survivors, and what you see will no doubt leave you haunted. It's not often that people will put themselves into another's shoes and (almost) understand what they have experienced. Hiroshima may have been a \\"triumph\\" for the US in the war, but it was most certainly a living nightmare to the innocent people that were caught in the destruction. I could not make it through the documentary without crying and most people tell me I am callous when it comes to expressing emotions. What truly amazes me is the complete lack of empathy, to this day, from some of the men who dropped the bomb. I understand that they were just doing their job (I also have a husband in the military) but at one point one of them even boasts that he has never had a nightmare or regret about dropping the bomb: \\"I've never had a nightmare!\\", he laughs. Definitely a documentary that makes you think."},{"rating":"2","title":"INTENSE !","review":"White Light/Black Rain is a very important film about the effects of war, even though it's very hard to watch due to the horrific scenes of death and destruction caused by the U.S.A in their use of atomic bombs on civilian targets. It should be required viewing for high school students and young people thinking about enlisting in the military.The Idea that the current U.S. Administration has revised a policy that advocates the use of first strike nuclear weapons should be very alarming to all U.S. and World citizens.

It keeps bringing you back to here and now, and keeps demolishing all your ideas about how things \\"should\\" be. As it says on the back cover, this is a book about discovering perfection in imperfection and the extraordinary in the ordinary. I found it truly liberating and refreshingly unpretentious.

It has been amazing - it kept my badly insulated room very warm (had to turn it down eventually) all throughout last winter. My heating bill dropped to $100-150 a month but my electric bill went up by only ~$30 - it's super efficient. I'm in the process of buying one for my living room - I'm hoping to use these two heaters exclusively for this winter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bionaire BH3950-U Silent Micathermic Heater","review":"I am extremely disappointed in this heater. Maybe it would be good for a small bathroom but I got it to heat one room and it is very inadequate for that purpose. I was talked out of buying an infrared heater for this one and now I am sorry I spent the money. Yes, it cost less than the infrared but in the end I got what I paid for."},{"rating":"2","title":"quiet room heater","review":"One room in our house is always colder than the rest, despite the central heating system. It is our baby's nursery, and we began using this heater to compensate for the poor heating performance of our central heater in this room. What I like best about this heater is that it is completely silent. Also, I believe it is safer than other heaters, because the sides do not get hot. They get warm, but it seems the sides are used to take in air, and the heat comes out from the top.The thermostat is not calibrated with numbers, but we found a setting we are comfortable with (approximately dot number two), and just leave it there all winter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of the mica space heaters","review":"I've bought several space heaters in the past there years, beginning with the vornado, which is good for quick heat in a small room, like a bathroom, to oil filled radiators, which I think are pretty good but give off a chemical smell for a long time, to mica panel heaters, which are odorless but rather weak, with the exception of the Bionnaire under review. It is easily twice as efficient as the Delongi and Soleus models. The mica panels are staggered to offer more surface and something about the design really makes convection work. Its almost as though it has a fan. At any rate, it's quiet and heats well. Minor quibbles are the clunky wheels and no remote."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great - For About 2 Months","review":"I purchased one of these and absolutely loved it. It heated very well without any fan noise.However, after about 2 months I noticed it stopped heating effectively so I took a closer look. It seems that 2 of the 3 vertical heat elements have stopped working, reducing its ability to heat my room.I called their customer support and based on my serial number they agreed to replace it. However they said they were out stock and to call back in about a week. So I waited two weeks to call back only to find out they will be out of stock until fall, and that I need to call back in the fall in order to get a replacement.It seems they have had a high failure rate with this model and have been unable to keep up with demand for replacements.I will call again in the fall. We'll see if they still honor the warranty as promised."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shopper 101","review":"Great product!!! The only suggestion to manufacturer is about the knob.

Thankfully I caught it in time."},{"rating":"1","title":"not a happy camper","review":"This product sounded so good on the web. However I would never reccommend this heater to anyone.

Granted our home is small but we do have 3 bedrooms and two baths, kitchen, living room and dining room. Our basement stays around 60 degrees and the rest of the house maintains about 75 degrees. We simply placed a box fan behind each heater on low and bam,, mega heat. The power bill jumped about $40 a month so far but gas heat was running over $200.00 a month. We have kids and pets and these things are cool enough to the touch that we have no worries. The temp outside right now is about 20 degrees F and it is a toasty 75 in here. One of the heaters came DOA out of the box but Amazon sent one next day to replace it. No problems since.Thanks"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth The Price of Admission!!!!","review":"This heater heats up very quickly.....about a minute and a half. It outputs more heat than my oil filled heater ever did and the handles stay cool to the touch and it's light weight. Just remember to do a burn-in for 2 hours or so to burn off residual residue from the manufacturing process. You will see a little smoke rising from the unit when turned on for the first time. Place it near an open window or door during burn-in. It has a relatively high price tag but it's worth it in my opinion. The thermostat works flawlessly. Highly recommended!!!!-Paul"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bionaire Micathermic Heater","review":"I have been using two Bionaire BH3950-U Micathermic Heaters with Adjustable Thermastats for about two months. I love these heaters. They really heat my home. My home is 14 x 70 and during these really cold days I have had them set on high all day and night. I love the fact that they keep the heat at floor level (where it is needed) instead of on the ceiling. The only thing that has been a disappointment is they have not saved me money on my electric bill. It seems to be about the same price as when I used my 39000 BTU Furnace (which I leave turned off). Oh, yes, I seem to have alot less dust in my home when I use these heaters too. I really like that. I highly recommend this product. If I should ever need another heater in the future, this would be the one that I would choose."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good heater for small room","review":"I was hoping this heater would allow me to do without central heating in my open plan living room/dining room/kitchen downstairs area, but after waiting huddled under a blanket for 2 hours (It was probably in the 40's outside), I gave up and put the central heat on. I moved the heater upstairs, and now use it to heat the bedroom as I'm going to sleep, and with the doors closed, it gets very toasty and I am able to do without the central heating upstairs, at least. It is lightweight and very quiet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"After having read the majority of the reviews for this heater I really had fairly high expectations for it. I wanted to replace the Lasco 75800 Cyclonic heater we use to heat the bedroom because of the length of time it took for the heater to warm the room. The room is about 11' X 15'with an 8 foot ceiling. Unfortunately the heater doesn't work as well as the Lasco which I will continue to use. We'll use this heater in a smaller room. I was very surprised that it didn't work better since it puts out warm air on both sides and through the top of the heater. In any event I don't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rip Off","review":"I'm a big fan of Beverly Lynne but this video is a rip off and I wish she hadn't allowed this. Tanya X was not a series.

This by far is 4AD's best release in 2002--the album also ranks in my year's best. If you are looking for experimental/ambient music--with an occasional dance tune--well, this is the cd for you. Nonument is a combination of electronic music, trumpet, cello guitars and ethereal vocals. My favorite tracks are The Fourth Day and Three Sided. My only complaint is that the excellent single, Scene of the Crime, is not included in this cd. Oh yeah, the design includes some really interesting photography."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great as a pizza stone too","review":"I own 12 pieces of Demeyere cookware and love every piece.

Wonderful stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Profound and Exciting Recording!!","review":"By no means will I say that this recording is perfect. The sound has much to be desired and the Orchestra is not in its top shape. Despite all these flaws it is an undeniably exciting performance. The pacing is simply perfect and one can sense the NY Philharmonic's deep devotion to its maestro and the composer. I own several recordings of Mahler's 5th with Solti, Abbado and Mehta. Yes, all of these performers will give you a more rehearsed, perfect sound yet there seems to be no spontaneous excitement that comes close to this recording.If you seek an academic reading of this symphony, please seek somewhere else. As we know, Maetro Bernstein was known for being spontaneous in performances. This reading is exciting, heroic and very refreshing! Disregard the academians and simply enjoy this historic recording as it was meant to be!

The product is like vaseline with some concealer suspended in it. When I tried using it I applied it with Jane Iredale's foundation brush as recommended and it didn't blend at all, it seemed like grease with a little color with a very splotchy application. I am not sure if this was a fluke and I got a bad batch but from some of the reviews I have read I am assuming this is normal. I will not purchase this product again.

After using this foundation and the powder my face was shiny, and only got worse as the day progressed. It wasn't oily, just shiny, skin was dry to the touch and it felt normal. However as the day went on, my face got worse and worse. My Dad, 8 year old niece and my fiancee all asked me \\"why is your face so shiny!\\"...so I knew this wasn't the makeup for my wedding. However, I will say it DOES stay on forever, I went swimming with it, underwater and all, and all the makeup was intact."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"First let me say that Jane Iredale should distribute her products to Sephora so that people can see/try the colors as her colors are way off...both in the liquid and powder minerals and many people have complained about it. She only distributes to spas etc....which I find very exclusive, in a bad way. At any rate, I do like the consistancy of her powder foundation, but again the color is an issue. The liquid is a whole other story...there is a whole learning curve to figure out how to mix and apply it. Her instructions are \\"word free\\"....which makes them somewhat vague. Once I learned how to apply the foundation I learned that it was a very light cover...not a medium coverage as it states. If you want medium cover you would need to apply it twice...and I wouldn't do that at nearly $50 a pop. Sorry Jane...this gets a thumbs down...."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE","review":"Her make up is pricey but its great!

Personally, I'm glad she didn't go into her grief and expound upon it. That's not what this book was about. The fact that she had connections allowed us to read about things we wouldn't have knowledge of otherwise.This is a light breezy read---just the thing to read when you are sick, down about life yourself, or just needing a laugh. I thoroughly enjoyed it---AND passed it on to a friend going through the life changing experience of a divorce after a long marriage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly Terrible","review":"I think the single most difficult thing to stomach about this book is the absolutely stunning superficiality of this author's shallowness. And actually - in one respect it makes this book profoundly ironic in that she is the living embodiment of everything \\"the French\\" despise in Americans. Or a certain genre of \\"Americans\\".I stopped at page 100 - and that was 75 pages too many. If Sarah Palin was forced to spend a year living alone in Paris - THIS is the book she'd write.I mean - this is a woman who brags about bringing Skippy peanut-butter back from the good 'ole USA so that she'll have something good to eat - IN PARIS!!!Trust me - everything she says and does (in the first hundred pages) will leave you with the exact same impression as that gem.This is one to skip.If you're looking for a good \\"screw the world - I'm moving to Paris\\" book - read Almost French by Sarah Turnbull."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not A Memoir","review":"I bought this book with the anticipation that it would be a woman's personal and emotional journey in the city I have always adored. Instead, the author has a rather cold demeanor throughout and this book reads far more like a how-to for moving to Paris than an actual experience. This is not SO bad, but collective shopping trips and apartment hunting antecedotes do NOT a memoir make!I also found the author's reflection on her loss to be very callous and detached. I understand that everyone copes in their own way but the book was described in a very different light than it actually read. Definitely not worth buying or reading unless you want to move to Paris and need a game plan.

The author name drops, sounds completely selfish, doesn't get the charm of Paris of the people, just that of her rich and well placed friends. It was simply this friend blah, that friend blah, my son boo-hoo, this market blah, my rented apt blah. She also complains about money a lot, but always seems to afford the finer things in life.

They are based on a case study with transactions only on _one_ database. In real life this would mean that you could avoid distributed transactions and OTS completely. The code would be subject to buffer overflow attacks of the most simple sort by the use of 'sprintf' instead of 'snprintf'. In addition it never becomes clear if the code is using a standard Corba or one of the special features of the transaction libraries used.More advanced topics like programming own 'Resources' and the use of CCS are only mentioned (even saying 'touched' would be to much).

I liked the way Todd plays each solo fast, slow, and then discusses playing technics for each one. This may not be of benefit if you are a Twang Tele expert already.

Nobody in this world would really think this is funny. Good try guys, but he's the worst I've ever seen. The brain cannot comprehend that anyone on earth would broadcast this, let alone put it out on DVD. Did they watch it before they released it. I don't think so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth Your Time or Money","review":"This movie is not worth your time or money, there isn't a decent joke in this entire movie, only lame attempts at shocking you with naughty words I learned in the 4th grade. If Bob Saget wants to defeat the image of being a good natured dad on TV then he should try a different path than acting like a stupid, selfish, naughty little 4th grader who just learned every naughty word in the book. That is not comedy, that is just a way to fool you out of your money due to our incessant need to be amused. If you want true comedy with worth look higher on the list to Bill Maher's DVDs."},{"rating":"1","title":"LAME IS MY MIDDLE NAME!","review":"I have never been a fan of Bob Saget and I thought Full House was one of the lamest shows ever put on TV. So, why? you may ask, did I watch this special? I have no idea! I had heard about this HBO special and I decided I would give this guy a shot. Well.......It was kind of funny to hear a \\"bad word\\" come out of \\"Mr. Goodie Two Shoes\\" mouth right out of the shoot, but it became tiresome within seconds as this bland white bread bore had nothing funny to say and fumbled through an hour set rambling on like a mama's boy geek with Tourette's experimenting with LSD for the first time! Yeah! he's trippin' alright???!!! One of the worst stand-up shows ever! Don't waste your money or your time! This show is about as much fun as putting rubbing alcohol on jock itch! I hope I have made myself clear and this will keep others from serious pain!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like train wrecks ...","review":"I saw this show on HBO and watched it solely to see if Saget was as unfunny as I thought he'd be. He not only met my expectations, but he exceeded them. It's so bad that is is difficult to watch, even though I intended to watch it for its \\"train wreck\\" value (I could not finish it). Essentially, the whole sketch is a string of unwarranted and unorganized expletives (more of that than anything else) without any comedy in the mix. I felt like I was watching a unfunny, foul mouth 14 year old imitating Richard Pryor or Chris Rock. Horrible. Charging people for this should be criminal and Saget should be forbidden from the stage. I did learn one thing -- Saget did write all his content for Funnies Home Videos."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"Disclaimer: I had never heard any of Saget's prior stand up acts to this one, but I had \\"heard it through the grapevine\\" that his stand up was dirty and hilarious.I do not understand why Saget cannot see how horrible this stand up act is. Granted, I didn't see it through to the end, but that was because the first 5 to 10 minutes were soooo bad. My wife and I looked at each other and couldn't believe what we were hearing. Not that it was too dirty...it just wasn't funny. I mean, to me, he was bombing from the get go. I agree with one of the earlier reviews that it all seemed forced.Again, why would someone want to put out a production of a night where they bombed? Don't get me wrong, I couldn't do any better. I am glad I didn't buy the DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad. Really bad.","review":"I could not even make it through 5 minutes.

So, you're not the nice guy from \\"Full House.\\" WE GET IT. This special is career-endingly bad. Saget is still trying to ride the wave from his \\"Half Baked\\" appearance and needs to sit down and write some actual material. His friendship with HBO prez Chris Albrecht is the only reason this made it to television. And now it's on DVD?"},{"rating":"1","title":"I agree with previous review...","review":"I have seen Bob Saget perform stand-up prior to the whole Full House/AFV phenomenon, and he was off-color, but really funny. To me, in this special, however, it seemed as though he was just trying to shake the image by using every expletive, and anti-\\"Full House\\" reference he could come up with. I think it was overkill, personally. Felt a little forced if you ask me. Not that anyone's asking me, mind you...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Booooooo!","review":"I was kind of looking forward to this after his shockingly funny turn in the Aristocrats. My husband and I turned it off after 10 minutes. One of the most unfunny things I've ever seen. We were both amazed it made it on to HBO which usually has much higher standards. He uses the F word so much that it loses any and all shock value. I kept thinking that he was that nerdy kid in highschool who decides to \\"become cool\\" and practices cursing and posing in front of a mirror. PAINFUL to watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow Down!","review":"Danny Tanner! Calmly step away from the methlab and (or) stop doing blow with the Olsen twins.

And for anyone giving it more than one star saying it was funny you know nothing about comedy. Saget obviously going for shock value by cursing every other word totally misses that cursing doesnt make ANY comedian funny. Telling actual jokes makes them funny. He proved that he didn't work the clubs AT ALL and all his material sounded like it was made up on the spot. It was incredibly painful to watch and i felt amlost sorry for him that he really isn't funny at all and sorry for HBO that they paid him for that hour of garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"pointless and unfunny","review":"I got this mainly to see what the roasters at theComedy Central Roast of Bob Saget: Uncensoredwere talking about. I'm not offended by raunchy humor; the late Robert Schimmel is one of my favorite comedians. Saget's DVD can be summed up in two of the quotes from the roast:\\"Bob had an HBO special called 'That Ain't Right.' It should have been called 'That Ain't Watchable.'\\"--John Stamos\\"Bob, you're not an insult comic, but I am insulted when people call you a comic.\\"--Jeff Ross"},{"rating":"1","title":"Diver's Watch NOT WATER-RESISTANT???","review":"Purchased a Diver's Watch.

The basket it came with is well made, and both the scoop and trivet are also a pretty wood (bamboo, I think) and well made. The spout of the teapot is hard to clean without some sort of tool or pipe cleaner. It's a little too small to get a sponge in there, so I've already got a bit of leftover tea buildup just inside the spout. I use this teapot every day at work, and it's held up well. My only complaint besides the hard to clean part is that it's not insulated, so the tea gets cold relatively quickly. This is a wonderful teapot for about 3 full cups of tea, and it shows off blooming tea very well."},{"rating":"2","title":"this is one awesome teapot","review":"This is one awesome teapot!

Cathy is a very well created character who is easy to relate to and you quickly find yourself connecting with, which makes for a wonderful witnessing this story unfold through her eyes. Likewise, the character of Dr. Maxwell is written tremendously so that you love him and hate him at the same time. Very much the same way the protagonist does, you find yourself annoyed by him in the beginning and then increasingly drawn to him as the novel progresses. I won't spoil anything else, but you'll stay up long past your bedtime reading this book to see how it all comes together. Great stuff!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Story fine, transcription very bad","review":"The story line was fine. The transcription of this book to eFormat was terrible.

The most convenient aspect of it that is hard to tell from the illustration is the light toggle switch it covers is accessible from the side with your finger. There is nothing to remove to activate the switch. It's mostly to prevent accidental tripping of a light or toggle type switch. It's really practical over a garbage disposal switch that is in the open. It makes you think before you throw the switch (to check for utensils in the drain or if someone else is using the sink or clearing out the disposal drain).

These 1960's recordings are simply definitive, made before Bernstein's decline in the late 1970's. A good rule of thumb with Lenny: always choose the earlier performances. (This is especially true with his Copland recordings, but pretty much applies to his whole discography, I think.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely Definitive","review":"Virtually all the previous reviews say just about the same things about this disc over and over, and though I haven't counted out an actual number, the word \\"definitive\\" is repeated from one reviewer to the next. So let me join in the monotony. This is a definitive Bernstein collection. The fact that Bernstein is conducting his own music would seem to justify that word almost by, well, definition, but even if you didn't know who was conducting you'd still call it definitive. Except you would know who was conducting. Maybe. The fact is that as I write this, there are just no other comparable performances of these pieces, in my view, except for a few other recordings of the Candide Overture here and there.

While the writing is fast paced, and the author has a keen interest in history, I cannot stop finding mistakes that make me question the writer's committment to research: Fatty Arbuckle, for instance, was involved in a scandal at the St. Francis Hotel, not the Palace Hotel in San Francisco as reported here (and EVERY biography of Arbuckle mentions the St. Francis). The Alhambra (in the Valentino part) is in Granada, not Seville, Spain. Most historians believe William Desmond Taylor was gay, not \\"romancing both Mabel Normand and Mary Miles Mintner at the same time\\". Not to mention numerous typos that any self-respecting editor would have caught. This turns me off."},{"rating":"1","title":"you've heard this one before","review":"I hate to be cranky, but this is a rehash of creaky gossip in an attractive package. No original research going on here at all. If nobody's ever told you what 'Rosebud' really refers to, or that Valentino's grave was visited by a \\"mysterious lady in black\\" (gosh), this might be a good intro for you. Otherwise, if you'd rather not skate on the surface, may I point you elsewhere? Would that be okay? For LA architectural history, try Charles Moore's brilliant & reprinted \\"City Observed\\". For the sleaze, go with the font, Kenneth Anger. For an in-depth look at H'wood in the teens and 20's, I'd try Kevin Brownlow's \\"Parade's Gone By.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Riddled with inaccuracies","review":"I opened this book with high hopes, reaching the photograph opposite Chapter 1. It purported to be taken in 1917 of Mack Sennett, directing Zasu Pitts in \\"The Little Princess.\\" Well, no. It is Mack, I will grant you, but he never directed Mary Pickford's \\"The Little Princess\\", and the lady in the photograph is unmistakably Mabel Normand. (The film, by the way, is \\"The Extra Girl\\" and no, it was not filmed in 1917!) Of course, everyone can make a mistake, so I turned to another page. There was the Alvarado duplex where William Desmond Taylor met his death: alas, identified as the Brentwood house where Sharon Tate was killed. Ye Gods, did the book not have an editor? Did the editor not have a pulse? A tired rehash of unsubstantiated gossip, this book has some wonderful (but misidentified) photos, and nothing to suggest that we should trust the author. Read Brownlow, find the Kobal collection, but by all means, steer clear of this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"My interest diminished","review":"Yes, this book does have a few good stories to tell, but I was truly upset by the book's summary as it was usurped from the Museum of Neon Art's neon tours of Los Angeles.

This fact has diminished the value and integrity of the book and I cannot recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A NECESSARY VOLUME FOR EVERY HOLLYWOOD LIBRARY","review":"David Wallace's Lost Hollywood is a necessity for any Hollywood or motion picture library. From the Garden of Alla and Schwab's Drugstore, to Ciro's, Romanoff's, and Perino's, Wallace has found lost Hollywood, and he has served it up in dozens of tasty tales. Not only has he found lost Hollywood treasures, he has also put to rest some legendary Hollywood mysteries: what were the true circumstances of director Thomas Ince's sudden death, following a cruise on Hearst's yacht? Was Lana Turner truly \\"discovered\\" sipping a soda at Schwab's Drugstore? What was really going behind closed doors at the legendary Hotel Hollywood?This volume could have coined the expression \\"a real page turner\\".

The photos' captions are frequently inaccurate. That isn't Zazu Pitts, it's Mabel Normand, by the way. Don't go by anything really that the text may tell you. It reads like it was hastily cobbled together after a few afternoons googling Wikipedia entries. This is a little book full of the same old, same old.

I'm by no means a professional historian. But even I know that DW Griffith did not direct Greed and that Elvis Presley did not write Heartbreak Hotel himself. As has been already commented on, William Desmond Taylor was almost certainly gay, definitely not having an affair with Mary Miles Minter and at best casually dating Mabel Normand.This book tries hard to be like the superior Hollywood Babylon (HB also has a lot of errors but it was written in the 50's when fact-checking would have been more difficult.

My only assumption is this text is written with the understanding that you own the larger more detailed book.

This author focuses on practices done by corrupt muslims who do not even read their own book. The Quran numerously talks about Homosexuality, Condeming it over and over. First it warns the men not to leave their wives and go for other men. Another verse states How God dealt a destructive Force (severe storms) on the People of \\"Lot\\" that instantly killed all their inhabitants as punishment for such a sinful act. Then there are the VAST testimonies of Homosexual muslim who choose not to engage in Homosexual acts and lead a Heterosexual life in order not to Sin in the name of God. I could go on, this is so pathetic that it's not even worth my time reviewing this.

Unlike so many other star wars games, this is a first person shooter, which is a great touch to the star wars universe. I found the gameplay to be very well done with the healing stations on the battlefield and your squad always with you to revive you if you fall in battle. The coolest thing of all is that instead of carrying multiple weapons, you have attachments to one gun. The attachments are sniper, and rocket launcher. The single player campaign is outstanding, though the multiplayer is so-so. This game is simply a terrific Star Wars title."},{"rating":"1","title":"scratched really bad","review":"come on. why would you sale this game if its so scratched that you cant play it real think !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Star Wars the way it should be.","review":"I loved this game.

Nope. I think Mercenaries is decidedly superior. But is it the most fun game so far in 2005? You betcha!No classy cutscenes or lengthy narration. You're just thrown into battle from the get-go, learning the rules the hard way as you obliterate every enemy in sight. You get a lovely selection of weapons to choose from. And you get the best squad AI I've yet seen in a game. You really can order your boys into position, then lay for the enemy and give 'em a taste of hell.The battles are ferocious and sometimes seem unwinnable till you learn how to use your squaddies properly. It gets so that properly deploying your team is as much fun as wasting Trandoshan mercenaries.I like this game. A lot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Game Ever!!!!!!","review":"The coolest thing about this game is that it is exactly like HALO,in my opinion. The graphics are cool, especially when you shoot a bug and it explodes. The multiplayer, online or splitscreen, is unbelievable. Capture the flag is fun, but deathmatches are awesome.

So I flipped it around and put the curved end between my legs, but it was annoying to have that big end sticking out and made it harder to flip over. The curved shape made it a pain to put the pillowcase on. Also, it was not as firm as I would have liked. It was better than nothing while I was pregnant, but I am sure I could have found something better. My massage therapist had one I liked that she bought on Amazon for less money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too big","review":"This pillow was too big for me and for our bed- I felt like I was trying to scale a mountain. It was far too thick as well, and I couldn't get my head to lie comfortably at the top the way the woman in the photo does. The thing was huge, and is now a bolster. Honestly, I don't know who would actually be a good fit for this, but that's just me (I'm 5' 4\\" if that makes a difference?)

We stayed in a hotel and the next night my husband complained he had slept horribly and had a sore back, but I felt great!

Before I bought it, I was using so many pillows I looked like a boat in dry dock. Now that I have the Snoozer I get a longer night's sleep than without. There is also the added bonus of having more room in bed for my husband and I. I particularly like being able to put the pillow between my legs for my back while supporting my tummy at the same time. You won't regret buying this pillow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Back pain gone!","review":"I was having terrible back pain at around 20 weeks pregnant. I purchased this pillow and use it every night, and now the back pain is gone. Simple as that.This pillow may not be the best if you are on the taller side, though. I am 5'4\\" and I can just get the end of the pillow between my knees if I also have my head on the other end.There are 2 minor things that do annoy me with this pillow:1. The case slips off the end and is really, really hard to put back on.2. As other reviewers have said, it does flatten and does not spring back. My solution is to use the end of the snoozer pillow on top of my regular pillow and I am perfectly comfortable. Pillows flatten. We shouldn't expect magic.Overall, worth the expense if you are hurting."},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty good, not disappointed, it is what I expected","review":"pretty good, I am not disappointed, it is what I expected.

I am 22 weeks pregnant and was incredibly hopeful that this pillow would help ease some of my sleeping discomfort. On the contrary, I slept worse--much worse. The fluffiness of the pillow exacerbated my hip pain and the fluffiness also caused problems with my arms falling asleep (for both just note position on the illustration and you can understand why). Apparently many people found the pillow comfortable but I am not one."},{"rating":"2","title":"I left my husband for this pillow.","review":"When I first got this pillow, my marriage was a little shaky.

Having the pillow to prop up against supports my knees, back and legs! I keep loop of the \\"J\\" near my feet, so I can prop my feet up - helps with circulation!

It took her only 5 minutes to snap one end of the rod. She enjoys the treats, but it's just not worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea, but doesn't work like it should.","review":"I originally purchased the triple crown treats without the locking piece. That's how they come with the ball or toy. The first one worked okay and I thought I would have a great long lasting treat toy for my rottie. Well, he got the first treat out of the toy in about one hour. The second one was out in about three minutes. Reading the package instructions I saw that they offered the locking piece. Thinking this would be great, I purchase three packages of two treats and the locking piece (six treats and three locking pieces). When I received them, it took me all three packages to get the pieces to fit together without breaking the locking piece. Still, didn't work for my rottie. So, if you have a little dog without much spunk, this might be a good treat toy, but if you've got a big dog that won't stop until he gets what he wants, don't bother with this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not live up to claims","review":"I was very disappointed with this product after using the Everlasting Treat Ball inserts and really liking the Everlasting Ball.The initial problem was screwing the two ends onto the rod. I'm not sure if there is some special trick to this or what because I spent a longer time trying to figure out how to screw it all together than it took for my dog to chew through it. The pieces don't seem to fit well together and the first time I tried to muscle the whole thing in place the end pieces cracked.One of my dogs who is admittedly a strong chewer was able to get through the ends and rod in under 15 minutes. She can pretty easily bite the rod down to the end cap and has figured out that if she licks the ends enough the two end pieces will easily pop out because they don't fit in as snuggly as the everlasting treat ends do for some reason.I would recommend skipping this and just using the Everlasting Treat Ball inserts if your dog is not a really aggressive chewer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good treat","review":"My pup enjoys everlasting treats in or out of an everlasting treat ball. I decided to try the everlocking treat as something different, but it wasn't significantly different when used in the treat ball, and she ate the ends off the stick immediately. Overall they are treats she enjoys, but I will likely stick to the regular everlasting treats in the future (esp since she enjoys the various flavors)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dog treats","review":"NOT recommended!!!

So I guess it got the canine two paws up for taste, but I'll stick to bully sticks and other treats that last a little longer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent but for CD presentation","review":"Frederica von Stade's voice and the balance of the orchestral accompaniment are first class. However, I enjoy knowing something of the composer's efforts, the origins of the songs, and the performer's relationship to the music, and was dismayed that the CD includes nothing - not even the composer's birth and death years! Further, as Amazon indicates, there are 21 songs included, but there are 23 tracks indicated because some idiot included the group labels, \\"Chants D'auvergne, Vol. 1\\" and \\"Chants D'auvergne, Vol II\\" as track numbers 1 and 16. You can figure out which song is playing by appropriate subtraction, e.g. the first song, Bailero, is listed as track 2 but is actually track 1, etc. Where are the standards?? Five stars but for this poor presentation of material."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting. . .","review":"If you are a Michael Bolton fan, by all means, get this CD. Also, if you are open to hearing these traditional opera arias interpreted in, shall we say, a \\"different\\" manner, this may be the CD for you.HOWEVER, if you are expecting a Pavarotti-like or Domingo-like performance, DO NOT get this.I thought that I was openminded, but just couldn't get into this album. . .hence the 2 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Encore !","review":"I remember I almost die of laugh when I heard Bolton singing Schubert's \\"Ave Maria\\" in a Vienna concert with Domingo: I bought the CD immediatly. Even if this one is half-funny, I want it !!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Simple reason among many to pass this one up","review":"I have read the first few reviews, and while I would agree that all artists must stretch themselves, Michael Bolton has stretched more than he can bear, and certainly more than we can bear. Yes, his voice is raspy; yes, he scoops up to the high notes with R&B sentimentality; but no, he cannot sing the arias. Most of these are Italian arias, and the Italian language has so many nuances that give each aria a different flavor. Bolton's flavor? Fried Chicken. These words must be spoken with some semblance of an Italian accent. If you're not up to the challenge, you should not sing it. The text is the focus of the music in opera. If the text is neglected, and the pronunciation is neglected, then the endeavour is fruitless. Shame on Michael Bolton for recording these without at least consulting the proper authorities--that is, a diction coach."},{"rating":"1","title":"wow.....ive never heard something so bad....","review":"This this...oh wow words dont describe it...its just horrible he makes Bocelli look like a real opera singer..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well... I suppose it could be worse.","review":"Good playing on the part of the Philharmonia. Bolton's instrument (voice) is simply not geared for opera.He hits the notes (mostly), but there's a hell of a lot more to this music than just hitting the notes. Bolton is certainly passionate enough, and I believe the title of the album is genuinely the way he feels about this music, but this performance is just too unrefined, it isn't well-coached or wrought in any way. It's raspy, badly mic'd, and unclear: a blunt-force-trauma approach to operatic singing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Give this one a try","review":"I have never been an opera fan at all and I'm not a huge Michael Bolton fan; but my wife likes his pop albums and I've gone to a concert or two with her so I was curious when I saw this one. I think a previous reviewer suggested that this album might convince people who would have no interest in opera to give it a try and that's basically what it did for me. Bolton holds his own surprisingly well on some difficult arias (at least they sounded difficult to me) but what really sold me was the liner notes. Each piece has the background leading up to it and the english translation. I know opera snots say you don't need to know the translation but it helped me to appreciate the songs a bit more. That coupled with Bolton's surprisingly good vocals made this CD a worthwhile purchase and my favorite Michael Bolton CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for a laugh","review":"All I have to say is that Michael's \\"secret passion\\" should have STAYED secret. It is hard enough on one's ears to hear him warble pop ballads....but arias ?!?!?!?! Avoid this CD like the plague."},{"rating":"2","title":"Be more open-minded!","review":"If you start comparing this album with any operatic singers, you will definitely be disappointed. That's it. No more hassle. Likewise, if you start comparing operatic singers singing broadway songs with broadway artist, you will be disappointed. The point is that you have to be more open-minded. I am an opera lover, and I can tell you that I pray that the day when Michael will perform in Met will not come. But I definitely welcome his well-thought album. This album, I am sure, will be able to introduce a lot of people to serious opera; and with that, he has done his job well and the CD is well worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The horror","review":"A WAY-TOO-overhyped, scratchy-voiced cover \\"singer\\" who should be screeching tunes in a cheap, smoky lounge for dollar tips, tries to tackle the music genre of Caruso.

But you know the ol' saying: Those who can -DO - Those who can't - CRITISIZE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"OY VEY!","review":"Over thirty years ago, I thought that Enzo Stuarti was the begin-and-end all of \\"bad\\" tenors: now I hear a singer, who though he has an upper range (Che gelida) has NO BUSINESS SINGING THIS MUSIC!!! Ya know...Enzo sounds like Caruso next to this guy.....thanks for the humor...maybe next time he'll try lieder to really scare music lovers away...or Otello, or Tristan...I think I'll stock up on the earplugs now."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am speechless... I am without speech...","review":"I am speechless. I am without speech. I only wish that Michael Bolton had been also, BEFORE recording this CD. It would have spared all of us a lot of grief and disbelief. A \\"one-star\\" rating for the singing on this CD is much too generous. I have enjoyed his other music, and can only hope that he sticks to what he does best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs to spend more time studying voice","review":"Although Mr. Bolton has potential to become a decent tenor in the operatic style, I believe he needs a few years of studying voice to do these arias justice. They were written for singers with a highly trained voice and that is what is required to sing them correctly and bring out the beauty that lies in each of them. He sounds like a tenor with a very sore throat."},{"rating":"1","title":"SURE IT'S HORRIBLE . . . BUT","review":"I'm going to be nice here, despite the fact that I listened to a couple of tracks of this and had to turn it off. MB should have taken a cue from Nana Mouskouri, the popular Greek singer who also recorded an album of \\"classics\\". (ASIN: B000001FPM) She wisely decided to sing either classical melodies with new words, or traditional opera arias in comfortable keys, and in arrangements that did not distract or distort the original. Not an easy task, but Nana produced something that didn't offend classical listeners as she wasn't trying to \\"be\\" an opera singer as she knew it wouldn't work. MB's undoing is that he does try - and fails."},{"rating":"1","title":"He better keep his day job--cheesy pop music","review":"Michael Bolton must have recorded this album out of sheer desperation since all his other music started sounding the same. Well, he shouldn't have. An average singer with no opera experience has no business attempting these beautiful arias. He must be the laughing stock of the tenor world. His coarse voice cannot begin to carry these notes. Frankly, he often sounds like a dog in heat as he tries to belt these out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Shoot Thyself In The Foot Already!!!","review":"I make no bones about my feelings towards one Michael Bolton, the boy can't sing a note, so he resorts to bellowing and bludgeoning a tune to death. And now where he massacred timeless soul music classics, he applies the same battle-axe treatment to opera arias. Does this egocentric loser know no shame?This gets 1 star for its hideousness, and FIVE stars for being a sure-fire career killer. Let's hope we'll NEVER hear the pregnant elephant-like bellowing of Michael Bolton ever again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, Michael......Andrea Bocelli RULES!","review":"I first heard this album in a bookstore and thought that Michael Bolton had changed an awful lot. However, his \\"new\\" tenor voice just couldn't draw me into it. Yeah, it sounds interesting. But it ain't great comapred to the likes of Enrico Caruso, Franco Corelli, and Richard Tucker, all of who have equally powerful voices. Nor is this side of MB enjoyable comapred to Carreras, Domingo, or Pavarotti, not to mention sexy and worth being drawn to for life like my favorite singer, Andrea Bocelli.Sorry if I offended you, Mr. Bolton, but what in the world happened to the Michael Bolton everyone knew?"},{"rating":"1","title":"The soul of Florence Foster Jenkins lives on.","review":"You know, had Meat Loaf tried to do this, it would have come off better.As it is, it's Florence Foster Jenkins all over again:The Glory (????) of the Human Voice"},{"rating":"2","title":"That's more like it.","review":"Who else can jump from hard rock to soul ballads to Christmas carols to OPERA?Thought so.This album is a refreshing new sound by Bolton. \\"Nessun Dorma\\" to me was the best song on the album. \\"Ave Maria\\" was great, too.

About what its says about overrated method acting giant Marlon Brando having the ability to speak clearly when his son was on trial and Marlon the witness stand the latter mumbled his speech as he did in most films. Maybe it took many outtakes to get MB to speak clearly for Julius Caesar as this book claimed he spoke clearly for that film.

Though not a terrible record it is not what your average Ottmar fan has come to expect. The orchestral arrangements are clumsy or forgettable at best - inappropriate and dischordant at worst. Ottmar's guitar work is mostly relegated to plinking along - sometimes in a slightly dissonant fashion - on top of the orchestral arrangements. None of it is horrible, and a few cuts are even interesting, but my guess is that the typical Ottmat Leibert fan won't be listening to this CD more than once or twice. There are FAR better choices for anyone who likes Ottmar's work. Stick with his more popular stuff and save having to trade this in for somethign else (as I will be doing)."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT A 16 MONTH CALENDAR","review":"The extra four months in this calendar (Sep-Dec) are all on one page.

You obviously have some kind of axe to grind and apparently the grinding noise is interfering with your ability to hear properly.

In these technocratic, totalitarian times, Zerzan's profound critique of industrialism, capitalism, work and the machine itself is utterly life-changing and urgent. It will inspire you to quit your job, turn off the tv and run naked through the woods. This book will help you learn to measure your life not in minutes, but in moments, moments of deep connection, sensuality and adventure. (Time, after all, was invented by capitalists as an instrument of socal control.) So tear up your time card and jump into the river. Fall into the arms of lovers or dance with the birds and wind.

Cheers."},{"rating":"2","title":"The perfect Civil War companion","review":"I simply cannot think of a better book to keep at hand when studying the Civil War. Books that treat individual battles often are deficient in maps and seldom can give the sweep of a campaign. This book allows you to quickly review an entire battle and the campaign that preceeded, and followed, it in a clear and easily digested format. It then becomes much easier to understand the descriptions in those other books.By the way, Vol. 2 is out and covers World War I and is just as good. However the large size of the battles limits coverage somewhat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting maps with text to be used very carefully","review":"The atlas has good maps for much, but not all, of its intended purpose.

They were graceful and beautiful but I've always felt the work required a far greater sense of drama than they could provide. And so I went to my local record library and listened to as many Mahler 2nds as they had. This one gripped from the first measure. I can't imagine a more exciting and larger than life performance. It must have been performances such as this that catapulted Bernstein into the staure he has today. Do not hesitate to invest in this CD, and certainly pick this recording over the horrendous version Bernstein recorded with the LSO (also on Sony)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Music at it's best","review":"This is the best recording of Mahler's second symphony that I have ever heard. Being a trombone player who likes composers that use my instrument to it's fullest, I know Mahler's music very in-depth. Bernstein is such a wonderful musician, pouring himself into every composer that he performs. He is simply amazing. The quality of this recording is superb. The New York Phil sounds great, with a live and full sound. The whole Bernstein Century series is wonderful and full of desirable recordings of all of the standard repertoire.

Ron runs away to the border between the real world and the fairy realms to live with a bunch of punk kids who are a mixed group of humans, elves, and half elves. In a matter of days he becomes deeply attached to them and is devastated when tragedy strikes. Even though this action takes up most of the book, it's not the main thrust of the plot - find that yourself if you can weed through the overwritten prose and unexceptional characterization to finally get to the story that's buried under this poser's depiction of punk.In general, I feel like this story and this setting could have been handled better in different hands. It had potential and instead it tanks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Go Elsewhere to find a book","review":"Elsewhere is just as the title exclaims...GO elsewhere to find a book...I hated this book so...the characters were so fake.

Shatterly made a pretty cool kid here, tough big mouth, little body...I did occasionaly get the feeling that the whole angry teenager(grr) thing was a bit over the top but there wasn't much that stuck out sorely (besides -some- character interactions)The end was little problematic. Be warned, the ending seems to have been written with the sequel Never Never in mind. I ended to book with the feeling that there was never a plot, just this place called the Bordertown and this kid called Ron who's learning about it as I am.That was good enough for me though. The world and the people were fantastic enough that I ignored the disregard for linear tale. Overall, it's just a fun read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you a Baseball Junkie?","review":"I received this set as a gift.

The groups' plan is to alter history by attacking Nazi death camps and freeing the inmates. Although the brutal contrast of life in Auchwitz retains an intensity far beyond the high-tech milieu of the pursuing time police, it's to the writer's credit that the book's most vivid elements are based in history"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stuck in a rut","review":"This book covers no new ground in science fiction and beyond that, presents us with a mess of characters that are difficult to follow.

It was a disaster and useless when it rains if you want to stay dry. Cheaply made as are all of these pop-up deals over 10x10. I also got a 10x15 tent that collapsed in a rain storm because the water collected on the roof and never drained off.

Also, although the writer is not a doctor, she presents her \\"theory\\" that obese people have duodenums that do not function properly and this is what causes their obesity.

She must be in denial. Everyone I know that is morbidly obese (including myself) lives to eat."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Ultimate in Weight Loss Surgery Information!","review":"A heartfelt thank you to Michelle Boasten for the time and effort in putting this book together. With so much information floating around about weight loss surgeries, her book gives you the information in a thought-provoking manner while letting the reader decide if this life saving surgery is for them. I especially enjoyed Chapter 5, \\"Are you a Candidate for Surgery\\", with the comprehensive checklist. Chapter 7, \\"Dealing with your Insurer\\" gives excellent information to get through this hurdle. The illustrations, the medical terms are all spelled out in layman's term making the book an easy read. Thanks again Michelle and much success to those seeking Weight Loss Surgery. Larice White"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent resource of Information","review":"Excellent resource of Information which includes first hand knowledge Michelle Boasten takes the reader on a step by step journey into weight loss surgery (WLS). This book is for any person or members of their family considering or embarking on the WLS journey. Michelle writes in a very open and informative manner. This informative writing style I'm sure comes from her first hand knowledge of WLS. The book is well written, informative direct and honest. There were confirmations of my thoughts (which I thought no one else understood) and suggestions for things that I had never thought about. This book has been a constant resource of information as I embark on my own weight loss journey. The book is written for the lay person. BRAVO to Michelle for breaking the mystery of WLS."},{"rating":"2","title":"Information the brain and the soul!! Just a wonderful book","review":"I already had a surgery date when I received the book , but I still wanted to find out about post op experiences.I read this book cover to cover the first day. I wish I had discovered it in the beginning of my journey becasue it would have made everything in the process much easier, but the book is about so much more than just dry research found in other books. The author shares so much of her feelings about her weight experience, I felt like I knew her personally. I could relate to so much of her story, I felt she was writing about me. I have never felt so understood. I would reccomend this book for everyone.

Makes the temperature of the pool perfect. I am very glad that I bought this - not sure why I didn't get it last year.

It warmed our pool nicely, the first few inches or so. The problem happened this year (purchased last summer)-I started noticing the little blue things all in the pool as soon as I covered it this year and didn't think too much of it. A month or so later it just disintegrated. I was putting it on the pool and it ripped every time I tried to roll it onto the over the pool in multiple places. I am very disappointed.

It is basically blue bubble wrap. It seemed to work well the first summer, but has fallen to pieces this summer and we finally threw it out because of all the small blue back sides of the bubbles that are constantly falling into the pool and clogging up the skimmer basket. I'd recommend purchasing one from a pool shop if you want it to last."},{"rating":"1","title":"doesn't last","review":"We've had this solar cover for about a month and a half...all of the little solar bubbles are completely deflated and serves no purpose now.

Bubble Wrap","review":"First off, this is just an expensive piece of blue bubble wrap cut in a 12 foot circle. That's it!!In the photo it appears that the cover wraps around the edges of the pool. Nope. The cover which is exactly the shape of the inside diameter of the pool just floats on the surface of the water. No wrapping, no protecting, nada. We even found that it didn't work well with keeping leaves and stuff out of the pool because it wasn't easy to remove without dumping the leaves into the pool.Lastly, do not assume that this cover provides any sort of safety protection. It does not. Overall, I think this product is a waste of monty for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh.","review":"We had a hard time getting our pool into a perfect circle so this cover does not cover our whole pool. I can't \\"tuck\\" it like the directions tell us to. The picture is very deceiving also, I thought it wrapped around the inflated part of the pool. Oh well.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well...almost too well!","review":"I got this cover for our Intex 12x33 metal frame pool because I wanted the water to be a little warmer. Well I got what I wanted - the first time we tried our pool after having this cover on, the water was a toasty 87 degrees (on a 73 degree day in California). That was a little too warm for me. I found that by leaving a small section of water uncovered in one area, that leaves that water cold and when mixed in with the rest, the pool becomes a comfortable temperature.The cover (when completely spread out) also helps in keeping bugs and debris out of the pool. Keep in mind though that if you have a metal frame pool, the cover will not quite cover all the way to the edges so you can still get some debris in the water.Overall, I do recommend this cover, but you may have to finagle with it if it gets your water too warm. And on really hot days, I would recommend leaving it off your pool altogether unless you want your pool to be like a hot tub."},{"rating":"1","title":"Intex","review":"Well, it is for only one season, but it does the trick.

However, this cover is only good at covering the water surface from the sun.

For this reason and the price, I can only rate it 2 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Basic pool cover","review":"I needed a pool cover for the 12 ft. Intex pool and got this one.

I must of read the description wrong because this is not a cover that wraps around the frame of the pool this is just a cover that floats on top. But this was my mistake. One thing tho we have a 12 foot pool and this leaves a gap of about 3-4 inches from the wall either i bought a pool that is slighty bigger that what was listed on the box :p or this is a bit small but hey no one is perfect.

We live in an area of the United States that is very, very warm during summer days, but never more than the top part of the water gets warm. That said, the cover does manage to maintain that warmth into the morning hours after overnight lows in the 50 F range."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just a big piece of bubblewrap","review":"This is just a big piece of bubblewrap cut into a circle. No more, no less. For 20 bucks. Bubblewrap. It only extends to the inner walls of the pool, it does not fasten to the pool perimeter at all.

This book helped me stop, think and then decide what course of action to take instead of jumping to 'time-outs'. I re-read it often."},{"rating":"2","title":"Something has been missed","review":"Many of the other reviews have covered much ground, but all seem to have missed one thing: the point of McGrath's argument. It is really quite simple: Science cannot proove the existance of God, but neither can it proove the non-existance of God. Either way, you are excepting your position on faith, but faith isn't always a bad thing. Consider the proposition: it is always, everywhere, and at all times wrong to believe something not based on proof. Correct? No, there is no proof for that statement, and thus it is self-referentially incoherent. McGrath talks about this in 'The Twilight of Atheism'.If you accept that statement as true, you cannot prove either the existance, or the non-existance of God. If you recognise the incoherance of it, you must realize that the only way to know anything at all is by faith.It is quite a simple argument really. McGrath isn't trying to prove the existance of God, he is trying to show the fallacy involved in Dawkin's polemic against God."},{"rating":"1","title":"Full of fallacy","review":"Read the book if you wish.

I'm sure the author has great faith and he should stick with that and keep his nose out of science."},{"rating":"1","title":"Exclusive","review":"I have deep faith. My belief in G-d and His love is strong. So you would have thought that I would feel comfortable with Professor McGrath's line of arguing against Dawkins' strident anti-religion rhetoric. But the truth is, it left me angry and alienated. Why? Because McGrath consistently equates faith and belief in the Divine with Christianity. I am a Jew - a member of that people who have suffered from centuries of persecution from people such as McGrath who believe that Christianity has the sole preserve in this area. Muslims have adopted a similar mindset. The truth is that all three religions believe in the same G-d. Of the three, only Judaism is happy to accept that this (along with the other six Noachide laws) is enough. The position of exclusivity inherent in McGrath's writing is grist to the Dawkin's mill that equates religious faith with all that's wrong with the world. A plague on both their houses."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defending the undefensible","review":"McGrath in all his books is desperately trying to defend the Judeo-Christian God that has caused so much misery in the Western World. The three Abrahamic religions have the same ambivakent monster as a God. Anyone that looks at History and the atrocities due to monotheism extremists in Judaism,Christianity and Islam, understands why many thinkers, from Voltaire and Paine to Dawkins rebuke magic thinking and the idea of an Eastern Tyrant as a God. McGrath, is neither a scientist nor can he (or anyone else) make a truly rational defense of the Judeo-Christian despot. If there is anything beyond Nature, whatever that could be, we should hope is is a benevolent, freedom-loving entity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Theistic Apologetics","review":"McGrath gives us yet another dry meaningles attempt to justify blind faith. Why blind, because McGrath and other simply fail to understand that the argument that, there is no credible evidence that a supernatural being exists in some supernatural domain. No reputable Christian thinker has ever provided a viable case why such a being is anything more than human wish fullfilment.

I snapped off four half-inch pieces of hacksaw blade and stuck them with thick grease to four of the flats inside the tool reducing it from a 75 mm tool to 73 mm on four flats, near enough.

It is structured around the liturgy of the Roman Catholic Mass, featuring a celebrant leading a congregation in a Mass. But things take a different road, as the congregation starts taking on a life of its own, complaining about problems of faith and doctrine. The celebrant tries to hold it together, but ultimately suffers a crisis of faith himself. There's classical church music, and blues, and jazz and rock all mixed together; the result is ultimately very moving and beautiful. I was priviledged to see a performance of the Mass at Tanglewood, at which Bernstein himself was in the audience. I consider this Bernstein's finest work, a fitting memorial for one of our age's greatest conductors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great music, stupid narrative","review":"There is some great music here - some of the most melodic pieces Bernstein has done since \\"West side story\\". The narrative, however, is so-o-o-o sixties - in a bad way. Eventually, the priest in this one throws the Eucahrist to the ground as he loses faith. How daring (not!). How promethean (not). How brilliant (not). Too bad Bernstein couldn't just stick to writing a straight liturgy without the trendy nonsense. It would have been so much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lenny's ecumenical cheezfest","review":"Nik Cohn once described a Beatles tune called TOMORROW NEVER KNOWS as being \\"musically brilliant and lyrically bullsh*t\\". Which is pretty much how I feel about Lenny's MASS. Remember when Lenny embarrassed the crap out of everyone by having his west-side punks snap their fingers like Sammy Davis Jr.? MASS ups the obnoxiousness factor by about 37 billion gigawatts. This is indeed The Apotheosis Of The Hipster-Doofus.Lenny's best moment is a spooky low-key track which I refer to as SILENT, LIKE A COMING STORM. Those are the first words sung by Titus. The string accompaniment is a brilliant piece of brilliance. The lyric was later rewritten so that Father Titus sings it as a lullaby to the broken chalice. (Which, needless to say, is an embarrassment of the highest order. It's right up there with Titus singing kaddish for Titus's own self-respect.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bernstein's Anti-Catholic Mess","review":"\\"How I wept, deeply moved by your hymns, songs, and the voices that echoed through your Church! What emotion I experienced in them! Those sounds flowed into my ears, distilling the truth in my heart.\\" Those words of St. Augustine could summarize the beauty of choral music from Palestrina's Missa Papae Marcelli to Beethoven's Missa Solemnis, but they could never be applied to this recording. This \\"Mass\\" isn't beautiful, uplifting, and inspiring. It's trash, and I am very disappointed in Bernstein for composing something as bad as this.

I put it in my computer CD player and the information on my monitor listed the performers as conductor Kent Nagano, tenor Jerry Hadley and others.

The mysteries are still good, but when the characters annoy you the book is simply not as enjoyable. The recipes are still amazing, though. A decent fluff read if you've read everything else that's good, but there are much better books of this genre out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delicious Read!","review":"This was my first time around with Joanne Fluke's mystery books. I innocently picked it up thinking it was a recipe book and was hooked before I got out of the store. I really loved reading the story and enjoyed having the recipes so readily available. Since this book I have backed up and am starting with the first one of the series, Chocolate Chip Cookie Murder and then on to number two, three and four. I'm just beginning to love and understand the characters and their relationships. I believe this is like a grown-up's version of Nancy Drew!

I enjoyed the book. The recipes is a sweet addition."},{"rating":"2","title":"decent","review":"the fact that Fluke felt like she needed to explain simple words was annoying, but not as much as some people are saying. I personally enjoyed the book so much I couldn't put it down until I'd finished. There are plot twists which I didn't fully see coming. It's a nice enjoyable read that you don't have to think about other than what the plot is. If you're reading a mystery title \\"Cherry Cheesecake Murder\\" for an intellectual feel...then you're reading the wrong series. This series (which I highly reccommend) is meant for easy reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cherry Cheesecake flops","review":"I have read every one of Ms. Fluke's cookie shop mysteries and enjoyed them until this one. Hannah's relationship with Mike AND Norman is too unrealistic and strange. Obviously, she doesn't REALLY love either one of them or she would make a decision. I can't imagine any man who would wait around while Hannah is so wishy-washy. Also, the murder occurs too far into the story. There is too little action and too much unrealistic behavior. Sorry, but I cannot recommend this volume."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST ONE EVER","review":"Ms. Fluke has done it again. Another GREAT Hannah Swensen mystery. I love this whole series. Super storylines and it's fun being reunited with the regular characters in Lake Eden. I really liked the Hollywood movie set background in this one. And what about Ross? Hmmm, hope he appears in a future story. Mike, Norman and Ross. To me, the more the merrier. As in all of the Hannah mysteries, the plot has wonderful twists turns and surprises. And the yummy recipes that are sprinkled through the book are a terrific bonus. If you're a new reader, grab this one. You'll love it and want to read all of the others. Hannah's a \\"keeper.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Great recipes, lame story","review":"I started reading cozies a few years ago and started with Diane Mott Davidson's Goldie stories. I loved the idea of recipes and murder! I picked up the Hannah Swenson books a couple of years ago and got hooked; Hannah was charming, the recipes were delicious, and Lake Eden seemed idyllic.Unfortunately, the books have become almost a parody of themselves. Everything is simply too... precious. The naivete of the denizens of Lake Eden baffles me- no one seems to do anything vaguely carnal, except indulge in Hannah's baked goods and occasionally murder the random person. Hannah's relationships with Mike and Norman are beyond silly, without a shred of realism. The only saving grace is Moishe!I'm going to stick with \\"real\\" heroines, I think- crime and love triangles are so much more fun with Stephanie Plum than with Hannah Swenson!"},{"rating":"1","title":"SLOW setting cheesecake","review":"I have been reading all the books and loved them thus far, but this one is just too slow moving.

To the people who complain about the story, what are you really looking for in a book about a baker who solves murders?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hannah at it again","review":"This is the 8th book in the series and this one was a little slow for me in some parts. It was nice to see a new man come into Hannah's life even for a brief time. Norman and Mike needed some jealous time on their hands. Hannah does it again and solves the murder of a womanizing director that every one seems to hate. Her old college friends Ross and Lynne come to town who involved in the movie that is being made in Lake Eden. Things start to go wrong and Hannah is there to pick up the pieces. Of course there are some great recipes as always in the book that seem to be great to try. Like I said earlier there are some slow parts and would have given it a 3.5 star rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eventually, there's a murder.","review":"As others have mentioned, the murder happens eventually, but not before many, many pages of set-up. The was the worst and weakest book of the series.The Hanna/Mike/Norm triangle is getting tiresome. For two casual and chaste relationships to suddenly blossom into marriage proposals is just not interesting. A reader can only suspend belief so far.Then, there's Hannah's mother... This character is ruining the series for me. All three daughters are complete doormats when this shrew makes demands. She treats them like children and the 3 grown daughters ACT like children. Mother Swenson doesn't add anything to the plots but annoyance and her character has not grown or changed. It's difficult to believe that Hannah can stare down someone with a gun pointed at her but can't talk back to her Mommy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love cozy Lake Eden, not so much Hollywood !","review":"I love love Hannah and all the people of small town Lake Eden. All her books so far are 5 stars except this one :( To be honest, I turn to Hannah to take me far way from my crazy LA Hollywood life :D So I was not a big fan when Hollywood came to Lake Eden. I have to say the author did a great job portraying the true lifestyle and schedule and movie talk of the industry, but I like cozy Lake Eden and its people, and this book made me think of work and stress :(I want to move to Lake Eden !

Worth a few bucks for a few hours of enjoyment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too sweet...","review":"Joanne Fluke's \\"Cherry cheesecake Murder\\" is really sickeningly sweet, even for for those with a taste for 'cozy' mysteries, such as I. Even the recipes interspersed throughout go heavy on the sugar and the endorsements for Ghiradelli Chocolates and Hershey Kisses. Then there are all the 'beau's' who are hugging Hannah throughout, though she plays coy and only 'tingles' at their touch. You get the message....and the mystery plot itself is only secondary to the rest of this airy, spun-sugar concoction."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Mystery is... Where does it start?","review":"I'm a fan of the series, and look forward to reading the books. After reading the Sugar Cookie Murder, with everyone in one building for the whole story, I was looking forward to the adventure of Cherry Cheesecake Murder. It opened exciting... right away getting into the murder... only to go into \\"two weeks earlier\\" and proceed for well over 200 pages of no mystery at all, just baking and some boring details about the movie where everyone in Lake Eden turns out to be a movie star.For a 363 page mystery to end up with roughly 130 pages of actual mystery ... if we're lucky, because there is still a lot of dating and more movie making in those 130 pages after the mystery finally starts, is sad. I like the side stories and small town feeling to these books, but this one just started 200 pages too slow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beyond out-dated!","review":"I always enjoy a simple cozy mystery but this was beyond ridiculous. No one talks like these people do, even in the 1940's people were not this naive.

Oh come on! Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst!","review":"Words can barely describe how bad this book is. From the characters to the dialogue to the storyline - from start to finish this is just horrible. Mysteries are supposed to be fun, entertaining, an escape. You don't need to be a rocket scientist to read them, yet the author doesn't have to assume you're too stupid to know the meanings of basic words and phrases. I'd really like to hear from this author why she feels the need to explain everything to the reader. This was a total distraction from the mediocre plot. The murder took place in the last half of the book, and by that point you don't care about it. Hannah is ridiculous, Tracy the niece is not credible, the boyfriends are completely unbelievable, the dialogue is phony, the whole thing is a mess. There are plenty of intelligent, credible mysteries out there that are worth your time. Skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah, boring, trite","review":"Title says it all.

That's what reading this book is like. The author relates how he was once slighted by Al Gore at a meeting of Ohio Democratic Party county chairmen. After reading into this book a bit, you can hardly fault Gore for wanting to get the heck away from this guy. So Angel became for a time the ineffectual chair of the Democratic party in an county where Democrats are as scarce as hen's teeth. So what? Who cares?Another one of those books by an academic, and published by an academic press, that is essentially pointless and, from a stylistic point of view, unreadable.

If I had known it was made in China before I bought it, I wouldn't have bought it. I have yet to find a good quality product from there. I found a good deal on this guitar and bought it on an impulse (I wouldn't give $20 for it now that I've tried it). I was very dissapointed upon receiving it. Workmanship was very poor. A couple of tuners were loose because the holes drilled for them were too big. Finish flaws all over the guitar. This thing sounds like it's made from cardboard. It is all laminate and poor quality. While tuning to standard pitch, you can actually see the neck flexing alot from the tension. When tuned, the strings at the 12th fret were 5/16\\" from the frets. Too much flex in the neck. Electronics are garbage on it too. Needless to say, it was packaged up and ready to return a half hour after I got it. Don't waste your money on it!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"NOT \\"Made in China Firewood\\"","review":"Yeah... I read the other reviews. Obviously a lot of people have a bug up their arse about things that aren't made in America. I have 3 Dean acoustics (ALL are well made and this guitar is the sturdiest of the 3). Very well put together and once I got it tuned right, it sounds incredible. It is a little hard to tune (had my bottom G string tuned to G sharp... messed up the entire sound...was driving me nuts) but if you can't get it a guitar shop will be happy to help. I don't know if I got lucky, but the strings are actually in great shape. I'm sure new, better strings will make it sound even better.

While Howard Mansfield's thoughts seem to flash from one event to another, it gives the reader time to pause and reflect on their own historical experiences in perhaps a small town they once lived or at least wished they had lived. This book reminds us how sweet life was before the words tract (home), fast (food) and drive-thru (service) became a prefix of our vocabulary. Don't think for a moment it's a dull book--its far from! Appropriately, Mansfield manages to interject his humor which at times had this reader in stitches!

For a vegetarian cookbook, it also has surprisingly few vegetable-based recipes, mostly with ingredients that might not be fresh at a local supermarket (eggplant, okra, \\"drumsticks\\"). At the same time way too much space is allocated to desserts (didn't care for any of them), snacks like \\"spicy popcorn\\" (do we really need a cookbook for this?) and chutneys.

It does have good music, great game play and average graphics. The thing I don't like about this game is the ad is a fraud. It says all vehicles can be hijacked, but you can actually hijack all but one of the helicopters.

The formula is \\"kill/apprehend this guy, do it again.\\" Shooting is extremely basic, with main controls being shoot and jump. Its cool that the game is big and open, with lots of vehicles, but it just seems like a lesser version of the popular Grand Theft Auto series. There really isn't anything fun to do inside the vehicles, except drive around. The game gets stale pretty quickly because its so repetitive and seemingly purposeless.The graphics are average at best. It has that trademark bland, jagged PS2 look with low resolution and low framerate. The colors aren't vibrant at all, but rather dull and muddy. Also, animations look artificial, like they belong in the N64 era. Music is great, but recording quality is pretty bad, resulting in a muffled kind of sound.Overall, this is a definite rental game.

Keep in mind this was released back when LONG suites of thematically-related songs were all the rage. You're not going to find any short, poppy, radio-friendly songs here. The title track takes up the entire 1st side of the original vinyl release, and it has overtures, fugues, thematic restatements and many different movements in the space of 15 or so minutes. They were working out of the same musical school as Emerson Lake & Palmer and Yes and (maybe Tangerine Dream) but Triumvirat's keyboard/bass/drum blasts were definitely their own creation. This is what we were listening to in 1972 on the headphones when our parents thought we were doing drugs in the bedroom."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good debut album from a respectable Prog band","review":"I give Mediterranean Tales (Across The Waters) four stars and a half because,despite the small lack of production quality (compared to later albums) it is still very beautiful and inventive in its rawness.

It often shows them at their most original, most creative and most un-commercial.Here, however, Triumvirat show that not all long compositions are good ones. It's alright to make long progressive music but who wants to listen to a 10 - mintue organ solo? The Progressive tracks just aren't built up enough to hold the interest for such a long time.There are a few moments, particularly the two new tracks 'sing me a song' and 'ride in the night' that are ok but not enough good material to make it an enjoyable listen from start to end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dime amor que bebes","review":"Jesùs Enrique \\"Divine\\" is a wonderful singer....He has a wonderful voice......and he knows to dance...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great collection...","review":"Chick Webb was one of the fathers of this style of swing drumming.

Advertised as normally ships within 2-3 business days. I ordered on the second and it supposedly was not picked up until the tenth according to the tracking. On-line tracking showed the pick up on the 10th with no updates until arrived in Austin. Actual paper work at delivery indicated that it was not even picked up until sixteenth.

The author manages to get hard cases like Mike Ditka to speak openly about their faith; not an easy task as Catholic athletes (unlike their born-again christain cousins) seem reluctant to share such intimate stories. Or perhaps no one besides this author has bothered to ask. I keep thinking that these athletes and coaches would be great models to Catholic kids, if only they knew the stories.I particularly liked the Lenny Wilkens interview, the rare combination of Catholic-African-American athlete.Only one question: where is the Bill Bradley interview? I learned during the recent presidential campaign that Bradley is a Catholic convert.

Ditka is a boyhood hero since my dad got him to speak to our parish Holy Name Society in about 1963. Lou Holtz is a blast.When I was a boy, reading the stories of sports heroes was inspiring to me.

The sports stars are interesting and the faith spoken by most of them is clear and powerful but the \\"too live\\" interview style weakened the message for me. I was hoping to get some intense Catholic sound bites from great sports heroes but I came away feeling that it could have been stronger and easier to read.It does feature quite a few Chicago area sports people so it gets my Chicago thumbs up.

The line-up (keyboardist Jürgen Fritz, drummer/lyricist Hans Bathelt and bassist/guitarist/vocalist Helmut Köllen) is simply perfect, and the music really shines from the first to the last second.

He is retired Professor Emeritus of Theology from Claremont College. He has no ulterior motive to risk his reputation. If you read anything about 9/11 let it be this book.He takes each event, as analyzed by the governmental commission and presents the facts surrounding it. He allows you to make up your own mind.His books have not been reviewed like authors of his stature usually receive. What is the reason? I am proud to be able to write this little review."},{"rating":"1","title":"The 8/11 Commission Report: Omissions and Distortions","review":"I bought several copies of Griffin's The New Pearl Harbor earlier. I think this 9/11 book, which I bought used through an Amazon seller, would have been great. But while reading it, I found that chapter 2 only had 1 page, there was no Chapter 3, 4 or 5 and Chapters 6, 7 and 8 were printed twice. I am contacting the seller for a refund/replacement, and will try again. I expect it to be as great as New Pearl Harbor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eerie Echoes","review":"Perhaps Vice President Lyndon Johnson really did orchestrate the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. He probably did so in order to advance the American Empire. The logical bases of the foregoing arguments are identical to those underlying Professor Griffin's book. Followers of these theories likewise share the political viewpoint that so characterizes the role of hegemonic nations in the world. In both cases, including the cult that Professor Griffin is rallying, happen to be self-haters of their own country, the United States. This is a common feature of citizens living in hegemonic states throughout history. We should all be sympathetic to their anxiety, but recognize the deep strain of implausible conspiracy fantasizing that necessarily accompanies such desperation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Griffin is another Chomsky! (This is NOT a compliment.)","review":"\\"FDR planned Pearl Harbor.\\" \\"Bush planned 9/11.\\" Both conspiracy theories are based on the illogical premise that he who benefits the most politically from an event must have caused that event. This is the same warped thinking behind the conspiracy theory - most popular among some Muslims and Europeans - that Israel and \\"the Jews\\" were responsible for 9/11 because that attack eventually led the US to invade Iraq, an enemy of Israel. It is also the rationale for the ridiculous belief that the US somehow engineered the recent tsunami. Didn't the US benefit politically by helping the devastated Muslim victims of the tsunami? Therefore the US must have caused the tsunami! David Ray Griffin is another Noam Chomsky. The one is a theologian, the other a linguist. But they are prime examples of experts who should never venture outside their own fields of expertise. The results are laughable. Those who are not laughing don't get the joke."},{"rating":"1","title":"Alleged Distortions","review":"Griffin's book is an unusual collection of paranoid allegations. The book is, itself, a twisted and somewhat thin conspiracy theory. Even the convoluted presentation of facts lead to his preconceived focus.He has no quams or even moral embarassmett when he offers this book in support of those that deny the reality of terrorism as some would deny the Holocaust."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shame on David","review":"As a big fan of Griffin's \\"Founders of Constructive Post-Modern Philosophy\\" I was astonished and saddened by this foray into politics. Since the former book was a collection of other's writings I guess the wool was pulled over my eyes.I expected this to be a serious and scholarly look at the 9/11 Commission report but it is, as it has been dismissed as, ludicrous conspiracy theory written to prop up the waning anti-war crowd. What a shame. Now that Iraq is exercising self determination what will these people latch on to? There isn't anything left.If you want to read Griffin at his best read the book where he only contributed a forwarding essay mentioned above."},{"rating":"2","title":"A first step towards truth","review":"This is a must read book for anyone who is concerned to know the truth of 9-11. The book makes clear that the 911 Commission was a complete whitewash and their report nothing but a pack of lies. Every American should read this book and then demand a real investigation. All we have had to date is a fiction, a pretend investigation conducted by the very people who are must suspect."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Compelling Read","review":"This is a sober, straight forward attempt to review the original testimony to the 9/11 Commission and compare it to the text of the ultimate report, highlighting discrepancies and addressing unanswered contradictions. It has weathered well, and unfortunately the questions remain unanswered...in any case, it deserves reading for it's sober approach, honest inquiry, and lack of hyperbole. No conspiracy theories or finger pointing, just an open questioning in search of truth."},{"rating":"1","title":"The 9/11 Commission","review":"I gave this book a #1 rating, and here is why. Also, Please remember that this is MY opinion and mine alone.As this book is written, I find it to be an easy read that catches you from the beginning and keeps you wanting to read more.

Reversed, it is the ugliest thing I have seen in a long time, it looks like someone skinned a muppet and is wearing it as a jacket.

I thought they were just two shades of tan from the picture. Even though it isn't what we expected we really love the quality and look. It's a little on the masculine side and the size of the chairs are a bit intimidating. (At 5\\"5\\" when my back is to the back of the chair my feet don't touch the floor.)

Here are 3 things obviously wrong with this:1) Does not stick: The suction cup does not work. It somewhat works on glass/mirror, but falls off after a short while. It does not stick on any other surface for even a few seconds.2) Hard to read: Let's say you manage to stick this up on the windshield. You won't be able to read anything. The compass will be upside down when you stick it on the windshield, and that makes the markings almost impossible to read as they are hidden.3) Size: the compass is way too small, and this makes it difficult to see, especially when driving.I'd give it 0 or negative stars if I could."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book isn't for learning VisualLISP/AutoLISP","review":"If the CD doesn't accompany the book, the book is worthless. The majority of this book is simply a guide to the API included on the CD. To make matters worse, I don't believe the CD contains the source code for the API, which basically makes it a black box. The author also puts some fairly strict restrictions on how the files on the CD or programs written with the book's API can be distributed.This book isn't for someone who wants to learn VisualLISP or AutoLISP.

Having not read this book, I suppose that I shouldn't be writing this, but I hope you read it anyway. To rewrite such a marvelous book as Hitty is simply scandalous. There is absolutely no point in destroying a masterpiece. The oringinal book is so rich with character. Why should we need to \\"update\\" a book about a doll that was already old-fasioned from the original publishing date?On principle, I would never read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Butchers The Original","review":"I just want to simply say that Rosemary Wells butchered a classic when she published this \\"abridged\\" version. The story and illustrations do not reflect the personality and charm of the original Hitty. I am one who encourages reading the original version by Rachel Field to children of all ages because it shows so many positive things that a young child should learn today. It opens up the world in little minds in a way that not many authors can do. This version is just another dumbed down book created to dumb down the minds of our little ones. There's a reason the original version won the Newbery Award, which I can guarantee this version will never win."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do classics have to be PC?","review":"This version of the classic children's book covers roughly the same ground as the original, but the text has been revised and shortened (in spite of the \\"new adventures\\"), and lavish color pictures replace the original black-and-white illustrations. The damage to the text's interest is quite substantial. Although the original Hitty definitely reflected an upper middle class WASP world view, she was a genial doll inclined to think well of those who treated her well, and there is no need to censor her or to strip her and her adventures of their character. The original Hitty is still in print and at a lower price, and I recommend it to all. The only reason to consider this alternative is the illustrations which, although well-done, do not have the charm of Dorothy Lathrop's original drawings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fiasco","review":"What butchery of the original story! I have loved \\"Hitty: Her First Hundred Years\\" for 35 years, since I first discovered the book. This is terrible. This book robs today's kids of a very lovely story. If they have the misfortune to read this new book without reference to the original, they'll have had something priceless stolen from them.As for updating the text--what, are we going to update all the old classics now?If these two writers had written this story and used another doll, one that they invented on their own, it may have been an entertaining book. But they completely destroyed the calm, placid, friendly tone of the original Hitty.What a shame! I recommend NEVER reading this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hitty: Her First Hundred Years","review":"This book has beautiful illustrations, always a plus for me when purchasing a book. However; I did not realize the book is an adaptation of the original; when I found that out, it went right back to the store where I exchanged the book for the original book by Rachel Field. It is sad that Rosemary Wells felt it necessary to depart from the original charming story of Hitty. I do not recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another dumbed down version","review":"It was bad enough when they made Nancy Drew stupid, why was it necessary to dumb down Hitty also?! I was stunned to discover this new version of one of my favorite childhood books and more stunned to discover it had been dumbed down considerably. Avoid this one and buy the original instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"If the author knew Hitty...","review":"If the author really understood the character of Hitty, a real doll for whom Rachael Field wrote imaginary adventures, perhaps she would have written her book with more respect for the original story. The changes she made: (adding an elephant (?) to Phoebe and Hitty's coral beads, making the antique shop where the story ended into a pawn shop, etc. did not make the story easier to understand or more relevant. Any child who can read the adaptation could read the original. The illustrator certainly had never seen the real Hitty, as her doll bent in ways the real Hitty could not. It boils down, in my opinion, to frivolous changes to a story and pictures that need no changes. I would not have objected to a real picture book, with few words, if pictures and words had been faithful to the original and made the book appealing to pre-reading children."},{"rating":"2","title":"An exellent shortened version, well illustrated.","review":"This children's book should bring even more new fans to Hitty. It is beautifully illustrated and easy reading. I just wish the illustrator had done a bit more research about how Hitty is put together. She show the ends of the pegs inserted through the shoulder and hips, but in the picture of the doll under construction, she has the pegs coming out of the ends of the limbs. A silly mistake!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A poor representation of religious life","review":"I was very disapointed in this novel. I live in MN, in an area populated by many members of the religious order. Their way of life, believes, and actions are extremely dissimilar from the way the author portrays them. I am afraid that readers will think this is the way that convent life is, when it is not. The women in the book felt very closed in; they did not have many (or any) options. It was not a feel good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't judge by today's standards","review":"I am also from MN and have known many religious, from the early 60s through today. During the time represented by this book, those in religious life did not have many options and they were required to give up their life's passion to learn self discipline and \\"empty\\" themselves. I remember a young woman, a concert pianist, who was required to give up her music for a time. I saw her come into a darkened room and lay her hands on the keyboard cover for a few moments, then quietly leave. You could sense her dispare. These are not the things that those in the religious life speak of to friends and relatives. I believe the book is a beautiful and couragous look at the toll that was taken in some of the young women who gave their lives to God in this way over the centuries.

For anybody who had a childhood, good or bad, this play will excite you. Judith Thompson has created incredibly real characters who's life experiences can be paralleled with our own. A touching tale, a chilling secret, a spectacular and enthralling play. for both men and womenRead it again and again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Character Study From the 70's","review":"\\"The King of Marvin Gardens\\" is an example of why the seventies was such a golden period in American filmmaking in that studios as well as stars would take a chance on offbeat material regardless of it's box office potential. Director Bob Rafelson creates a haunting story of disparate souls who cling to hopes that are as faded as the Atlantic City facade they inhabit. Jack Nicholson effectively plays against type as a radio personality who joins up with his brother(Bruce Dern) to partake in his latest get-rich-quick scheme that has all the earmarks of going up in flames. They are joined by Ellen Burstyn as a faded beauty queen who's along for the ride in the futile hope of attaining a dream. This film is not easy to watch at times but the more ambitious viewer can appreciate filmmaking that dares to challenge it's audience. Gorgeous cinematography of the Atlantic City landscape before the casinos were erected."},{"rating":"2","title":"Please see this film.

Another top-twenty pick from the weird, bossy lady hangin' in the video store."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who says Hollywood doesn't make foreign films?","review":"This plays like a European art film, with slow action, moody sets, depressive topics and thoughtful acting. This 1972 Jack Nicholson movie came out when he was getting hot after \\"Easy Rider\\" and \\"Five Easy Pieces.\\" The director, Bob Rafaelson, was one leader of a new American cinema movement. I doubt this was much of a hit, but it remains a gem in the filmographies of all concerned. The Atlantic City shot here is gone now, replaced by casinos. The deserted boardwalk, empty grand old hotels and junky stores are captured for eternity. The plot is a family drama. You are never sure who is the craziest one here. It could be any or all of them. Very slow moving story line, but it raises questions and makes you think more than the average Hollywood movie, then and now."},{"rating":"2","title":"most under rateds film of all time.","review":"Superb performances from Nicholson, Burstyn and Dern in particular (all oscar worthy in my opinion). Haunting DP work by the Late, great Lazlo Kovakz, a thoughtful, subtle script and Bob Rafelsons steady,silent directorial touches combine to make this perhaps the the best film of the 1970's (Godfather II and Armacord are possible contenders asewell). Think I'm over exaggerating? well I'm fully aware of the size of that statement and i stand by it. Thier is no film from that era that just gets that much better with each viewing, the newances of each performance and the depth of the brothers relationship (nicholson and Dern) growing more and more complex. i wrote a paper on this film for school thats how much i loved it. I reccomend it highly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Early '70s pretentious slop for the most part","review":"Nicholson is a depressive, retrospective bore with a slick brother living in Atlantic City.The movie starts off with a little promise, but ambles along like a bad rash, never reallygoing anywhere.

I'm not adverse to modernized (or in this case heavily postmodernized) stagings, but this production has to take the cake as the worst example of the genre I've seen in the last 30 years (do not be fooled, as I was, by the somewhat traditional look of the cover to this DVD). Harnoncourt has been something of a hero to me owing to his pioneer work using period instruments and due to the brilliance of his musical interpretations, and the work is well-played. But there is no excuse I can see for this production, and while I try to write only positive reviews, this DVD needs a warning label: NOT FOR THOSE WHO LIKE PURCELL."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brandy Obligatory","review":"The music is sublime.

I've tried to watch it twice and couldn't get beyond Act I either time. That the libretto is in German is not as bad as the fact that the so-called singers scream their lines at each other across minimalist stage settings wearing costumes salvaged from Willie Wonka & The Longest Day. Now I know the Salzburg Opera is no fan of National Socialism but the way this production comes out it more resembles an air on the \\"Horst Wessel Lied\\" than anything written by Henry Purcell. Were Purcell alive and witness to this farce he'd draw his rapier and go after the whole crowd responsible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Concentrated awfulness","review":"Do yourself a favor and read the other one star reviews of this work - these people are right: this is a terrible, terrible staging. Utter crap with a Eurotrash aesthetic. A way, way over the top, excessively creative and dumbed-down production. Worst staging of an opera I've ever seen.This production is like arranging, say, Bach's St. Matthew's Passion for a harmonica and a yodeller. Sure you could do it, but WHY do it?At one point Merlin comes out and \\"interrupts\\" the performance and rants on about how people are likely to cry foul over the way the classics are treated.

No Christian Death record since, whether Rozz or Valor, comes close to the masterpiece that is Ashes. Valor's guitar in 'When I was Bed' is arguably his best recorded work ever. Rozz's vocals and lyrics are haunting and mysterious - poetry to read, ecstacy to listen to. If you want to hear a classic example of Christian Death, don't pass up on this record. Iron Mask?

Always searching, and paying top dollar to find the concealer of my dreams.I am a bit over 40 and have hereditary dark rings under my eyes, in addition to some wrinkles.LM's secret concealer has a dense, dry consistency. It is not easy to apply. I have to scoop a bit out and warm it in the palm of my hand. This helps it glide on.But it still does not cover to the degree I need. It also tends to get cakey and settle into wrinkles -- something a concealer should never do.And the color selection is too narrow. I suppose if you really like the concealer, you could by two or three and blend them to suit your complexion.But for me, this product did not work on all accounts.

Thankfully, one container lasts me about a year so I don't mind spending the extra money. When applying the concealer I use a concealer brush to save as much product as possible. It is thicker than other brands I have previously tried, but the coverage is amazing. I inherited my father's dark under eye circles and Laura Mercier is a miracle worker! I have not had any trouble with creasing or breakouts with this concealer, but I also have pretty normal skin (not oily or dry).

There is a big difference in applying it by the brush vs. applying it by your fingers!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunately, not an improvement","review":"A previous reviewer said that what this re-mix of Protection lacks is the original's beauty. I would agree with that, and add that it also lacks its harmony. In fact, No Protection is a rather discordant piece of work; more often than not, the Mad Professor's overlaid dubs don't match the underlying music's tempo, creating a rather uncomfortable listening experience. What Mad Professor failed to do here was take the languid, fragile harmonies running through Protection and build on them. Instead, he bulldozes them over with random blips, beats, and vocal snippets, leaving us nothing but rubble to enjoy. Save yourself a headache and don't buy this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"A butchering of the original Protection","review":"I had high hopes when I bought _No Protection_, having read a review of _Protection_ that claimed that Mad Professor's effort was a massive improvement of the original album, but listening to the album proved just the opposite. Mad Professor turns the involving, grim songs of _Protection_ into unoriginal dub-scapes. As a result, almost every song sounds the same, and very boring. I'm happy Mad Professor left out \\"Eurochild,\\" which was my favourite track of the original, as hearing him butcher that one would be too much to bear."},{"rating":"1","title":"wasted effort","review":"The original of this album was 'Protection' and was excellent, though perhaps not as good as their brilliant first album 'Blue lines' or their 3rd 'Mezzanine'. However this remix by Mad Professor blurs the vocals, particularly the wonderful title track Protection sung by Tracy Thorn (of Everything but the Girl) and adds little to Massive Attacks clear sound and clear social commentary.

Why didn't they ask Jack Dangers to do it?"},{"rating":"1","title":"No Connection","review":"\\"Protection\\" was Massive Attack\`s worst record, but this remix album is even worse, destroying the few interesting moments that the band\`s second effort had. Remixer Mad Professor deconstructs the songs and gives them a dub/ reggae-oriented sound, something that\`s decent enough during the first two/ three tracks but soon becomes terribly uninspired, repetitive, boring and formulaic.There are no variations or contrasts in this remixes, the process is always the same and the album seems endless, almost impossible to listen through in one sitting while managing to remain awake. Seriously, this is a major disappointment, and certainly one of the most monotonous, one-dimensional and flat records around.For fans and completists only."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why, WHY do this to Massive Attack","review":"As a strong Massive Attack fan, I came towards listening to this with a very positive approach. I can't even describe my disappointment. It was terrible. TERRIBLE. Apparently the Mad Professor undertook a project to destroy everything beautiful in Massive Attack's masterpiece. Each track got me more and more angry. Save yourself. Don't even try to listen to this. Dissatisfaction guaranteed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dub not = dubstep","review":"I much prefer the original versions of these songs. I was expecting a more dubstep sound, and this is dub. The fault for my negative reaction lies in my musical ignorance of the distinction between those genres. However, I still only gave this two stars because I really didn't like it, and if people only rate things they like then the ratings end up inflated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only if you are a big fan of dub","review":"All of the remixes on this CD are done the same way. Mad Professor seems to do the exact same thing to every song. Don't bother with remxing if you aren't going to bring anything new to the recording. The take on Protection is interesting, but it does take from the strengths of that song. Beautiful love song vocals over a heavy hip hop beat. Professor strips the vocals to minimum.Can't recommend it, unless you really like dub."},{"rating":"1","title":"D-U-L-L","review":"I really enjoy dub, from the old-school Trojan stuff up through Burning Spear, LKJ, etc., and I have a couple Mad Professor CDs. While sometimes overly busy, both have some fun, interesting stuff. I'd heard that \\"No Protection\\" bears little resemblance to \\"Protection.\\" No problem, I thought, it'll be fun to check out what the Mad Professor brings to the project. Inexplicably, he abandons his usual kitchen-sink approach, and what we get here is dishwater-dull. The first few tracks are enjoyable, melllll-ow ear candy. The rest is aural wallpaper. (The last song is an absolute waste of time, but you'll likely be asleep by then.) Buy this only if you're looking for something to crash to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Captivating, but incredibly disappointing","review":"Well, I couldn't put the book down.

Most of the reviewers on this site are either on narcotics or on Baldacci's payroll. What could have been an amazing book, beginning to end, turned into one of the great clunkers of all time.

It was impossible to follow, you think?Then Sean King and Michelle Maxwell appear in the horizon as 2 former Secret Service agents and a new series is created that is almost if not as good as the previous one, is as good.Highly entertaining, fast paced and most of all, Logical. There is no rush through the end as some other books that take 250 pages to develop the story and the with 5 short, crazy pages the book is finished and leaves you hanging like an unfulfilled dream.Take a read and enjoy these books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip This One","review":"This is by far the stupidest, most ridiculous plot \\"reveal\\" I've ever read. And getting there was no picnic either. The characters are cliches from a romance novel, the plot developments are so senseless and disconnected that they're just boring, and the author's \\"suspenseful\\" device of having his characters figure out critical facts but not revealing it to the reader until much later is just plain annoying. By the time I was halfway through the book, I really wanted to stop. But I guess I have OCD about finishing books I start, because I forced my way through to the bitter end -- and bitter it was. Baldacci's a popular writer, and I enjoyed Absolute Power, so he's probably written many worthwhile novels. But in my reasonably humble opinion, this isn't one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total waste if time","review":"If an author has to reach this far to try to keep his publisher happy then he should just go fishing. Unbelievable is the word that best describes this waste if paper. Reading this review gives the book too much attention."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable and marginally entertaining","review":"The plot had potential but the writing was so stilted and awkward, especially dialogue. The characters were very one dimensional despite efforts by the author to fill in with background information. I love this genre and had heard great things about Balducci's writing but there are so many better series and options out there. I do plan to read one more Balducci novel from a different series to see if this was typical or the standard for his work."},{"rating":"2","title":"4 stars","review":"This is actually a surprise as I initially picked it up for a trashy (in a good way) holiday read and found myself unable to put it down. Great characters, well linked across the differing times of the story threads and although a few clues and some guesses on my part was mainly left open right until the end and with an end that made sense without having to be explained in great detail.Fast action, great characters... read it. Far more readable than your usual crime thriller."},{"rating":"2","title":"Baldacci bags another win!","review":"Secret service agent Sean King will never forget the day a presidential candidate he was guarding is gunned down. Eight years later another agent, Michelle Maxwell find herself in the same hot water when the candidate in her charge disappears. She seeks out King to help her unravel the mystery. The narrative that follows is filled with unexpected danger as it becomes unclear as to who is tracking whom. As usual with Baldacci's plots it is hard to figure out who is the pursued and who is the pursuer. Another hit for this talented author.Beverly J Scott author of Righteous Revenge, Ruth Fever and Jena's Choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was very disappointed with theis book. I read the cover and inside & thought it sounded like it would keep my interest. I couldn't wait to finish only to get it over with because it was boring. Those that thought it was so good should read books by Harlan Cohen. He is an author and you can't put his books down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Baldacci needs a break","review":"Too many novels in too short a time span , this Balducci novel is not worth it at all. Too far fetched , too unreal. It seems as though the author was painstakingly trying to end the story , when in fact it ended before the 100th page. Take a pass on Baldacci for awhile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Thriller","review":"I have read four of David Baldacci's books with mixed reviews. Split Second is by far my favorite book. The plot has everything I look for in an exciting book: Good characterization, a plot that ties into the past, short chapters, and a fast moving story line with lots of twists! I highly recommend this book as one that you cannot put down!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Hat and no Cattle","review":"A page turner all right, but when done with the book, I wished I had my time back. Ending was contrived and grossly artificial. Made Da Vinci Code look even better by comparison. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Convoluted and confusing","review":"I, too, have been a big Baldacci fan. But, this book left me cold!!! The first half of the book was compelling reading. But, there were so many characters after awhile, that it took great concentration to keep them straight. For that reason, it became rather slow reading. The ending was very unbelievable, ridiculous, and confusing. I struggled to finish because I just didn't care anymore. I'm sorry I actually purchased the book instead of using the library. I have greatly enjoyed his other books, so I know he can do better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Baldacci book!","review":"I really enjoyed this book! Compared to other Baldacci novels, this is the most like \\"Last Man Standing\\", which I alse thoroughly enjoyed. I wish this book were a little bit longer page-wise, because I didn't want it to end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thanks","review":"Just a thank you note to the reviewers: you have saved me from wasting my money on this book. Many thanks for your honest and insightful comments."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time and money","review":"Having read and liked Absolute Power, Saving Faith, and other of Baldacci's books, and some of the reviews on the Internet, I was really disappointed. This one is a total waste of money and time.Baldacci lets the characters talk too much about obvious conclusions and then neglects to drop any real hints. The mystery of the villain's identity was a laughable cliché. The main shallow characters, the unconvincing dialogue, the investigators' far-fetched deductions that just happens to be true are all together insulting to the readers' intelligence.This smells of a way for the author to make a quick buck and I don't think I'll buy another Baldacci book again. It is one of the lousiest books I've read in a long time and I read two to three books a week in this very genre. It went straight into the waste paper basket after I finished it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Writng so bad I shuddered","review":"I have a fairly high tolerance for pain when reading commercial fiction. But this book is so bad I couldn't go on and put it aside early on. Consider every element that makes a thriller good --- compelling characters, interesting plot, at least competent writing --- and this novel fails the test miserably.Don't buy the book. Don't borrow it. And most advisedly don't read it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good book but torn in shipment","review":"This is a very good book! I was disappointed with Amazon as the cover was torn when I received. I purchased this as a new book..."},{"rating":"1","title":"An insult","review":"David Baldacci used to be a GREAT author, one whose work I would patiently look forward to. After reading his last two books before this one (The Christmas Train and Last Man Standing) I promised myself I would forever skip over any future books from him. I caved in. I gave him one another chance. A stupid move. Very stupid. About as stupid as this book. This book is so incredibly contrived and far-fetched, that I'm insulted that he would think we would buy into it even for a few evening's readings. Save yourself your time. Save yourself your money. But more importantly, save yourself the anger you'll experience after reading this book and realizing you were taken for an idiot. There are far better books out there to spend your time on. Oh, and David: \\"Never again!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Man, What a Stinker!","review":"This book holds your attention for a little longer than a split second; say 5 minutes. That's time enough for what could have been a promising political thriller to devolve into a thuddingly dull revenge caper/laughable romance tale. And the ending! Straight out of the \\"Mad? I'm not mad! It's the world that's mad! Muwahahah!\\" school of TV-movie villany. As with most later Baldacci novels, the dialogue and character interaction are painfully forced and cliched to boot. Skip this one unless you're truly addicted to the author's work, and even then you may be tempted to enter a 12-step program afterwards."},{"rating":"1","title":"illogical","review":"The premise for this book is totally stupid. I finished it because I kept hoping it would improve. It didn't.SPOILERAn example of how dumb: Two high level secret service agents find a weapon put it in the glove compartment of their car. Do not lock the glove box, don't lock the car. It gets stolen while their in the house. Is this dumb or what?"},{"rating":"1","title":"What an ending!","review":"Most of the reviews I've read here by other customers seem like they only read the first half of the book. I'm a big Baldacci fan, a big mystery/suspense fan and I really enjoyed the first half of this book...maybe even the first three quarters of it. But the ending and plot unveiling is just so ludicrous, so insipid and so filled with \\"who gives a damn\\" moments that this book went from a 5 to a 2 in about 20 pages. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utterly Preposterous","review":"Virtually every plot element and twist in this book is just not believable, on any level. Characters behave in ways unlike any person you've ever met. Investigators jump instantly to completely unlikely, off-the-wall conclusions--that just happen to be correct. Secret Service agents act like total idiots. Convenient coincidences appear by the dozen. This book is an utter mess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Baldacci Wrote Half a Good Book","review":"But the second half is pure bad. We have a good idea here, but David Baldacci couldn't figger out how to carry off the one critical ingredient of a good thriller... making it believable. You will need a large notebook just to write down all the inconsistencies and dumb ideas that he uses to piece this book together. Finally you will become irritated by all the little stupidities his hero and heroine continue committing. Still, you can move to the last chapter or two to discover how it ended without missing any of the previous 250 pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written disappointment","review":"I am a big fan of Baldacci's other books. Not this one. Split Second combines horrible dialogue, a ridiculously improbable story line, and an absurdly laughable ending. I would not recommend it to anyone. I finished it only because my wife said I had to read the ending because I would not believe it made it into a book. If you have to read a Baldacci right now, re-read Absolute Power."},{"rating":"2","title":"It has its moments","review":"This book definitely has some strong moments in it. The idea is that a secret service agent fails and a presidential candidate is killed. Years later, the mastermind behind the killing is back and wants to kill the agent, who is now retired and trying to get on with his life. Another agent loses her candidate altogether, and now we have the beginnings of the story. There are some tangled moments here, but overall this is a good story. The only thing I didn't really care for was the ending. It seemed a little too comic-bookish. Why does the character stand in one spot rather than do the smart thing and move around to protect himself and his charge? Still, I enjoyed the book and would read the sequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not David's best","review":"An OK book, but I found myself lost several times and had to flip back and forth to refresh my memory on certain people. And also, what's with the psycho running circles over and over again around two highly trained Secret Service agents? I just had a hard time buying into that one.I'm not sure what David was goign for in this book. \\"Last Man Standing\\" kept me rivited, one of the best books I've ever read, but he really seems fall a bit flat on character development in this book. I would like to have seen an extra 100 pages to bring more personality to the novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not usual Baldacci","review":"I'm a big fan of Baldacci's and to say he writes real page-turners is an understatement. He's one of the very best. Great characters, great stories. He obviously does extensive research for his novels. Unfortunately, however, Split Second does not live up to his prior good works. Actually, everything is okay until you near the end when it gets quite improbable and the ending itself is just ridiculously goofy - almost laughable, in fact."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Bitter Disappointment","review":"This was certainly not Baldacci's best work. Being a huge fan of his, I had high hopes for his newest thriller, but it was a let down from the first page. I had to force myself through the whole book, only to find out that the ending was supremely canned. The story line did not grab me despite this being my favorite genere. In fact, I read the whole book feeling as if I had read it before - there was nothing original or interesting about the plot or characters and it left me wishing I had picked up something else instead. I can only hope that this is his only low point in his writing, because ordinarily his books are real page turners."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor","review":"I read nearly the entire book, but just could not get myself to finish. I loved his previous books, but this one was a bust."},{"rating":"1","title":"Certainly not up to par","review":"Not the quality of writing that Baldacci has exhibited in his earlier books. This read like one long very confusing and unbelievable conversation. As another reviewer said, when spread out over multiple sittings, the plot became more tangled in your mind. In the end, we are supposed to believe that all of the events that happened were for the purpose of fulfilling one man's fantasy. All in all, the book just didn't read right. I don't think David Baldacci can honestly say this was his best effort. Don't waste your money; if you must read it, get it from the library or the used books section. It's selling there for 33 cents; that's about what it's worth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't believe it!!","review":"I am such a huge fan of David Baldacci that I don't even bother to read the synopsis on the book jacket, I just buy the book. Not any more! I slogged my way through this poorly written, unbelievable plot. By the time I got to the last chapters I was speed reading just to say I finished it. My daughter asked me if I liked it. I told her it was as if he wrote it in college and no one would publish it so he waited until he was a bestselling author and dug it out of the closet, dusted it off and his editor jumped on it. Next book he writes I'll check it out of the library just in case he's got more junk in that closet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother With This Book","review":"Split Second is by far David Baldacci's worst book. When he is right on, he is one of the best. But this book is so full of trite, overwrought dialogue and cheesy situations, that I almost couldn't pick it up. This book reads like a contract filler--he had to write a book, didn't care about anything but the money, and cranked out a tepid, hackneyed piece of tripe.Believe it or not, I am a Baldacci fan when he is focused. His \\"Wish You Well\\" is a beautifully crafted bit of heartfelt fiction. The writing is clean and precise, and the dialogue flows beautifully. Split Second is not. It reads like a second- rate first attempt by a mediocre writer. It is sorely disappointing.My only hope is that he has made enough money from the sales of this turkey that he can spend the time to write to the level he has already demonstrated that he can achieve."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Total Waste of Time And Money!","review":"I have been a big fan of most of David Baldacci's books and loved his first, Absolute Power. However, his newest book, Split Second, is one of the worst books I've read in quite awhile, and I feel so cheated by Baldacci that I'm uncertain if I'll take a chance on future books by him. While Split Second started off like it was going to be an enjoyable book, it deteriorated at warp-speed. The following lists just some of the problems with this stinker -- the plot is unbelievably far-fetched , the dialogue is so amateurish it seems like it was written by a child, the characters are not credible and cartoon-like in their development, the intended suspense is (for the most part) ho-hummish, and the ending -- oh, that ending -- is ridiculous!While I try to find point out good aspects in books that are not so good overall, I cannot do so for this book. The only mystery associated with Split Second for me was why I bothered to finish this very poorly written book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Baldacci said, \\"Let there be a Split Second\\", and ...","review":"... apparently his magic wand was malfunctioning.To Baldacci's credit his writing style is his only asset when it comes to keeping readers interested and wanting them to find out who did what and why. That's why I gave two stars. But all throughout the book I constantly felt that I was reading yet another \\"blockbuster\\" garbage. The book did not add any meaning, I did not care for the characters at all, and Baldacci did a great job ruining the ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Beginnings of King and Maxwell","review":"I have read later books about King and Maxwell and was alw3ays curious about how their story started.

Sorry. The best part of the book was getting an \\"inside\\" look at how the Secret Service works. I'm not sure how much of this was made up by Mr. Baldacci, but if you're interested in getting a (fictional) account of the Service, you will enjoy Split Second."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid read.....great for traveling","review":"Solid read.....not an absolute page turner....but close.

Plus, almost everybody gets bumped off or kidnapped as soon as they are introduced. The great mystery of the \\"elevator distraction\\" was a big plot flop and I found it to be annoying. I couldn't understand why we had the reason for that fatal distraction withheld until so late in the book.The only reason the main character (an ex-secret service agent) is a lawyer is because that's what Balducci writes about.This book is a who dunnit, but I never cared who dunnit.

I can only assume that they were written by the publisher's employees or friends of Baldacci. I have read and enjoyed every book he's written, but this one was awful. It was loaded with characters and possible suspects. It had a convoluted, confusing, shallow plot, and it alternated telling the story between the main characters. One of the main characters got kidnapped and the others acted like it was no big deal. Very little mention of her fate, no drama, no concern. Very strange. After reading this book, I would have to recommend that Baldacci stick to \\"lawyer\\" books."},{"rating":"1","title":"BALDERDASH","review":"An overwritten crime story. Cardboard characters.

Appalling."},{"rating":"1","title":"THUD!","review":"Ouch, I've always enjoyed Baldacci but this book has some of the most stilted dialogue I've ever read. The book starts out great then coasts into a haze that it never recovers from. I re-read some of the dialogue about halfway through the book and couldn't believe what I was reading - like bad high school creative writing.

I'll give Baldacci another chance if he'll write a complete book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing...","review":"After having read Baldacci's \\"Camel Club\\" this one came as an utter disapointment.... the book starts off describing the assasination of a US senator and how the lead secret service agent in charge of his protection ended up out of the service and discredited for having lost his charge.... sounds like an interseting way to start the book; the main problem is Baldacci never takes the time to introduce any of the characters.... after a while i couldnt keep reading the book because i felt i didnt care for the characters enough... i didnt really care to know what happened next to them since i didnt really \\"know\\" any of them... it was like reading a newspaper article.... a way too long newspaper article..."},{"rating":"2","title":"It Is What It Is &#65533; and Its Entertaining Besides","review":"I admit it. I am surprised by the hostile nature of so many of this book's reviews.

The story charges ahead, making the book difficult to put down. What more can you ask for from a novel written to entertain?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just a crank job","review":"I am a great fan of Baldacci, but this book was just cranked out probably because the publishers wanted another book from him.

This one is too over the top - the characters are too stiff and wornout, and it has the most ridiculous and over-the-top unbelievable plot I've ever read - it reminded me of a Scooby-Doo plot line, it was that ridiculous. David, next time don't just punch the clock and mail it in - your fans don't appreciate it."},{"rating":"2","title":"wow","review":"I picked up this book and a discount book store. It is the first time i have read one of his books. I loved it. As i was perusing some of the other reviews, I noticed how harsh people were being of this book. I am not a writer, but i read an average of a book per week, and i couldn't find anything wrong with this story. I plan to seek out his other 2 books and see what it is I have been missing. His characters were beautifully developed, which is a huge selling factor for me. If i don't feel some type of emotion towards the players in the story, i don't want to waste my time reading the book. I didn't know whether to love or hate Joan. Sean reminded me of Sean Connery's version of James Bond. Michelle is an empowered yet soft female. The story moved along at breakneck speed, and i was at the end before i knew it. It was a hard book to put down."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was a serious waste of my time!","review":"I love Baldacci's books, but this one really turned me off. There were times I wanted to just throw it and even more so at the end. What scares me, is he is talking about writing a sequel with these characters, which the characters are fine, but will the next story improve. I sure hope so and I am afraid to give it a chance as this one was so frustrating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"As a fan of David Baldacci, I looked forward to this book after ordering it from Amazon. The premise was fine, but there was no real character development, there was at least one embarrassing lapse in logic (spoiler warning: when the agents suspected Jorst had hidden the gun, they never thought it through with regard to the two women who were killed), and the end was way, way too far-fetched. Like another reviewer said, the villain was an impossible cartoon, and worse, his motivation for doing all that he did was just lame. I won't even be lending this book to anybody."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"You can hear the plot machinery creaking from miles away. The conclusion of this book is so bizarre and so contrived that it lacks only the direct intervention of bug-eyed monsters from outer space.

Shame on me."},{"rating":"1","title":"In a word: AWFUL!","review":"The perfect example of a writer whose success has gone to his head and who thinks he doesn't have to keep working at his craft. This is not a thriller. It is not a whodunit. It's a mish-mosh. And in order to keep the plot moving, he switches points of view to show us the villain's reactions. But since it's a whodunit, he can't tell us who the villain is, and so calls him the \\"Buick guy\\". Please, please, don't waste your money buying this book. If you have to read it, get it from the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"laughable","review":"I do not expect mysteries to be great literature necessarily, but I do expect the ultimate denouement to be at least somewhat comprehensible and credible. This one was neither. The denoument of this plot was utterly contrived. It was absurd, and lacked any and all credibility. It was actually laughable. I feel cheated, having wasted my time reading this whole book only to be met with such a cheap ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Option for Zero Stars?","review":"I am a Balducci fan. I have read half I dozen of his books and enjoyed them all. Until now. No, this is not the worst book I have ever read. But it is close.Plot is important. Great characters and story telling will not keep a poor story afloat.The story started with a bang and just kept building through the first half of the book. Then I started to wonder how Balducci was going to pull it all together in the end. Not well it turns out. The crazy guy did it. Peoples lives ruined over a period of thirty years and presidential candidates falling left and right and the reason is.....unrequited love. I wish I was kidding.The bad taste this book has left me may keep me from ever trying Balducci again. It was that bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"after a good start, this fades fast","review":"The start of this book grabbed me right away. Two secret service agents who failed to protect their political candidates are brought together with a chance to right their past wrongs. Good concept! This mystery-thriller was filled with twists and turns, and with each one, the book became more and more far fetched. I'm more than happy to suspend belief in a page-turning thriller, but this book went so far over the edge, the ending was truly laughable. One of my all time favorite thrillers is Baldacci's Absolute Power. Nothing else I've read of his comes close to that. This is by far the worst. If you enjoyed Absolute Power and want more Baldacci, my advice is to get the audiobook of Absolute Power. It's fun to listen to as well. Regarding Split Second, it is ironically named. The story really dragged. I think I'm done with this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it right up to the end","review":"The main characters are well drawn, the mystery held my attention, it was exciting and fast paced, but the ending was not plausible. It was bizarre and, to my way of thinking, implausible. The villain was crafty, evil, and with no redeeming qualities. In fact the villain seemed to be right out of a Batman movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible","review":"Baldacci, is a bad writer, all his production except the very first one (Absolute Power, which was average) was well below average, but this one is truly beyond the pale. The character presentation is so naive, that one would suspect that the author is still struggling through the high school."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst Baldacci book I've read","review":"I am a big fan of Baldacci but I just finished this one today & must say i was disappointed. I found myself skimming the last 1/3 of the book just so I could finish it.The beginning was good & I couldn't put it down!

She joins forces with the unlikely Sean King who has a similar problem - and the two delve into a world of secrets and deadly coincidences. Both are high-powered thrillers."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very cool book to read","review":"This was my first book by David Baldacci; I enjoyed reading this book, and would recommend it, The main characters were interesting & well-developed. The focus on Secret Service agents on presidential candidate protection details is a nice touch. However, the plot was a little too complicated & implausible, and there are too many vaguely-defined peripheral characters to make this book a hands down winner.

There are huge hunks of expository dialogue where characters recap everything that's happened so far and what it all might mean. This reads like a book written by committee from a plot outline by Rube Goldberg.It did want me to buy Sean King's house, though. ;)"},{"rating":"1","title":"what a bore","review":"i knew it be a matter of time before the grishman/baldacci style of writing junk for the masses would get to me. well, it has.

But the conclusion of this story is totally implausible. Far too many lose ends --plotlines that took chapters to build-- get wrapped up in one or two paragraphs. And all of the \\"evil\\" characters are totally ridiculous.

To me, so many albums like this, which never were widely released and were soon forgotten, embody the real creativity of the early 80's.This could accurately be called \\"intelligent dance music\\", long before the term was ever coined. It uses sequenced, rhythmic electronics combined with a live drum set -- perfectly syncronized. It is relentless without being monotonous. Every track is unique. Raw rhythmic energy with intricate, shifting layers of accents..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothing like them before or since!","review":"When HEAR THE LIGHT came out on litte, Canada Tunesmith records, it was all about the punk/new wave cover. Was it just an act or did the music match the cover?It did and it does -- nothing like Barnabas! Really, an amazing debut recorded with \\"stolen hours\\" from the studio. Monte Cooley is one flashy guitar player, twisting and squealing the strings like nobody's business! Keith on drums, Gary on bass, and Nancy Jo on vocals push the whole thing way, way, WAY over the edge!FIND YOUR HEART A HOME is a weak follow-up -- poorly produced, lyrics over-written, and the cover graphics are tame and poorly thought out. The best track is SOUTHERN WOMEN.This could be a 5 star review but 4 stars are for LIGHT -- one star for HOME. After this, they went on the receive the much more popular and better produced LIGHT SPEED, FIRE and FOXES, but never again would they hit the passion and hard core musical \\"truth\\" of HEAR THE LIGHT."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blind Guardian's Best ( my opinion )","review":"Many people say that \\"Nightfall in Middle-Earth\\" is Blind Guardian's masterpiece, and that it is their greatest album.

This also is just a great metal album in general, and by far one of my personal favorite metal albums of all time.I suggest that if you are new to BG you purchase this album first, becuase if you don't like this one, then you probably won't like the others very much.

They're one of the most underrated metal bands of all time and they should get more attention. Vocalist/bassist Hansi Kursh is an amazing singer and sounds a lot like the great Bruce Dickinson! The guitars are the real strong point of this band with epic solos and great duel play with Marcus Siepen and Andre Olbrich.

Good for James Lavelle for branching out, but I'm surprised he put this under the same \\"Unkle\\" name as this is a very rough rawk feel, almost like a Queens of the Stone Age remix album (the production influence is quite apparent).Two stars feels harsh, but after a few listens there's no memorable songs. I also made the mistake of buying the pricier 2-disc box set with the instrumental versions and art. If you want an interesting upbeat rock album with guest artists, this may be more your style, but if you're looking for more spacey/electronic (\\"I need something Stronger\\", \\"Inside\\", \\"Rabbit in the Headlights\\") or the big beat tracks (\\"Reign\\", \\"Eye for an Eye\\"), you should stick with the first two albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh","review":"Really disappointed.

I was blown away by the new sound. Although the tone hasn't changed - the music is still dark, atmospheric, and dense - replacing the trip-hop with rock instruments has completely reinvigorated the sound.Aside from this stylistic change, what I love about the album is that, despite its dark tone, most of the songs seem to be about spiritual yearning. On \\"Hold My Hand\\" James Lavelle asks \\"Do you search for meaning?\\" while on the following track, \\"Restless\\", Josh Homme vows to \\"follow the light to the love.\\" Later, Ian Astbury describes his desire to \\"burn my shadow away\\". \\"War Stories\\" captures desperate yearning for redemption and connection in a troubled world."},{"rating":"2","title":"very very nice","review":"it is nothing like the last cd, that is still a good thing. these guys really have not ever made a bad cd. this one is great because they went (again) in a different direction. the locals are great, and about three of the songs have been on csi n.y. i give it 5 stars, and cant wait to hear a remix lp...... killerblack hit me up"},{"rating":"2","title":"UNKLE AWESOME!","review":"This without a doubt one of the stand out albums of this year and possibly one of the decades best. If you thought Never Never Land with its healthy dose of THX1138 was good then this is something else. The first 7 tracks just leave you breathless and the album as a whole gets better every time you hear it. Its this ability to infiltrate the psyche that makes it a near classic. This certainly fills the gap and builds the bridge between organic rock and electronica in a fresh infectios manner. Pity about the clip for Hold My Hand though, it really works against the pace of the track and detracts from the music rather than enhances. This is the stand out track on the album though and will resonate for years! I'm usually not one to rave but this is quite simply... inspirational! Well done Mr Lavelle!"},{"rating":"2","title":"As good, maybe better, than I remembered","review":"I had several Triumvirat LPs as a kid, and started to wonder if I would still like this music, especially since my tastes have evolved significantly in the past thirty years.

Now I have to get a couple more Triumvirat albums!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Old Loves Review","review":"This is a hit and miss album - If you get the theme of the album the songs can hit home.

This album ranks with Joan Sutherland's \\"Art of the Prima Donna.\\" The engineering is superb, and Bidu Sayao is in magnificent voice on all of it. It would be worth the price if only for the \\"O mio babbino caro\\" and Musetta's waltz, which I have never heard done better, but all of the album is beautiful.

But, just as his Mahler 6th of the early sixties offered a truly symphonic and comprehensible picture of that dark and tragic work, so this Shostakovich 15th brings us profundity mixed with tenderness viewed through sanity. And its that very sanity, which some critics (e.g. the authors of the Good CD Guide) deride, which makes the ethereal ending of the 15th so moving and yet so understandable, so human and universal in a way which more obviously edgy performances can't do. The sound is equally analytical and clear, both involving and yet also distancing in exactly the way the symphony is. There is a place for white-hot Shostakovitch interpretations, especially in the 15th, but there is also a place for this pensive and profoundly human one."},{"rating":"2","title":"anchovettefan","review":"this fish based spread is both unusual and delicious...used to eat it growing up in south africa.....TRY IT! the taste is unusual and goes well on rye toast with sliced tomattoes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mind Blowing music !!","review":"This CD is Absolutely Terrific, the piano works, played by pianist Eliran Avni are really the music that one wants to hear. the works have not a bit, but A LOT of everything, many styles, colors and techniques which are fascinating and communicating to so many different tastes, Pianist Eliran Avni is a great virtuoso, his colors and emotional depth bring these piano works to the peek and it catches your attention every second it is played!

I even installed one at a boyfriend's house because prolonged visits resulted in diminished manageability of my hair. Same for long vacations.This really speaks to how damaging chlorine is to hair. It's also nice to not be breathing in chlorine fumes during a shower!!Highly recommend for people with chemical sensitives or naturally curly hair! You just won't believe the difference--even my hairdresser could tell!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome product!","review":"Awesome product! I immediately noticed the difference upon installing it, as did my husband who commented on it and he isn't even into these type of products or particularly health-conscious. The water feels and smells clean and softer. My hair is noticeably fuller and my skin is a lot less dry. Living in Florida and coming from Europe, the water quality here was a shock, as where I am from you can drink from the tap and I remember the first instance of brushing my teeth and I could taste the chlorine and spit it out in disgust. Then over the years, I've stopped tasting the chlorine in the water, but know its definitely still there. I would highly recommend this shower filter to anyone and now cannot imagine not having one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good enough","review":"This is a pretty descent shower head for those of us that have sensitive or dry skin. I been using for two months now and the results are noticeable but minor. Also, the shower head is a 'messaging' one- definitely a bonus.Overall, if you have sensitive or dry skin ( in which case you don't have this shower head is a good choice), I somewhat reluctantly recommend it. For everyone else who is looking for a messaging shower head, look somewhere else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not working for tap water in Rosarito, MX","review":"I'm currently living in Rosarito, MX now and the tap water here is super hard and chlorinated. After using this product for 2 months now, the water is only a little less hard and my skin still has painful irritation bumps. I was in Vegas for 4 days and my skin cleared up from the hotel shower but when I got back, in 2 days the bumps came back and my hair is like straw again. I will try another shower filter. Perhaps I have no hope since the tap water here is the hardest I've seen. I am now using bottled water to wash my face. I hope the bumps go away soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Shower Head","review":"I just moved to an apartment where the water had a lot of chlorine in it.

Super fast delivery too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Strong and Well Made","review":"Also, easy to install. Purchased this for the filter and because the connector is metal.

No more chlorine smell and water flow is excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Awesome","review":"I've had my Rainshow'r shower filter for about 6 months now. The softness in my skin and hair has improved remarkably. Also, I have no more stinging and itching from dry skin caused by chlorinated water. If you use this shower filter combined with shampoos and soaps which contain no sodium lauryl/laureth sulfates the difference will be unbelievable. Your skin will thank you. Get this shower filter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the shower head so much I bought a second one!","review":"I liked this so much after I put one in my daughter's shower that I ended up buying a second one for MY shower. I am not sure if it really filters out all the chlorine or not, but my daughter's hair HAS seemed healthier since we put this filtered shower head on. It is hard to say if it has made a huge difference or not.....however, we have kind of low water pressure in our home and I have to say I really like the flow on this one, it seems like it is delivering more pressure than our old one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Quack on the loose!","review":"Kirsch's account of King David's life is highly questionable to say the least. The book is full of conjecture. The flaws in the author's reasoning are apparent on the face of every page. His perception of King David's relationship with God and country is severely unschooled and a danger to follow. Anyone interested in appreciating the true story of \\"The man after God's heart\\" would be better off reading the Biblical accounts. Don't waste your money on this quack historian who seems committed to justifying base persuits with the flaws of the great men and women of Biblical antiquity."},{"rating":"1","title":"A misleading buy","review":"On the back cover this book promises to include biblical archaeology with the traditional stories from the bible - but it does not.I read the first 60 pages and then dipped into some later sections in utter frustration. All this book does is weave together a story based almost wholely on the bible stories. You find out very little that a read of the bible would not provide.I consider the book a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"How NOT to write a biography","review":"It is very evident that the motive of the author was to debunk the Old Testamentin general, and the biblical David in particular. In doing so, he appears to reference all his material with notated references to the index. Howefver, if you examine these references, many are stated as factual material. In reality, they were previously written by another individual,and their validity is highly suspect. He uses other versions of the Bible to support his position, and roughly 150 books which he eviscerated passages to support his positions. A fairytale!"},{"rating":"1","title":"An awful album","review":"This is by far the worst thing Triumvirat has ever made. \\"A La Carte\\", the former album, was a solid pop-rock effort. But this album has nothing to offer to a Triumvirat fan. The band was only keyboard wizard Jürgen Fritz and lead singer Arno Steffen. All other instruments were played by session men (including members of Toto). Nothing wrong with the instrumental, but the vocals are terrible, and all songs are uninspired. Buy it only if you are a completist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong Track-list","review":"The list of tracks in this section is from the \\"A La Carte\\" album.

Roxy10. Russian RouletteIt's an interesting album (I have the vinyl copy), but it's definitely not the Triumvirat that I love listening to. I have the 'essential' Triumvirat CD's - Illusions, Spartacus, Old Loves Die Hard, and Pompeii. It seems that they have gone in a totally different direction on this album. That's why I only gave it two stars. It's still worth a listen, though.I hope they release Helmut Koellen's solo \\"You Won't See Me\\" on CD as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Triumvirat: Not An ELP Clone","review":"Triumvirat came roaring out of Germany in the 1970s as Capitol's answer to Emerson Lake & Palmer. The similar instrumentation lineup- organ, drums, bass/vocals- did seem somewhat derivative of ELP, but Triumvirat took the format and made their own unique brand of art rock over four albums. They fell into the trap so many 70s prog-rock bands got caught up in: excellent musicianship, wonderful talent but not much in the way of sales. But with \\"A La Carte\\" Triumvirat attempted to diverge into a more radio-friendly pop sound. This album is miles away from \\"Spartacus\\" or \\"Pompeii\\", but that's not necessarily a bad thing. Their cover of Brian Wilson's \\"Darlin'\\" on this album should have gotten some airplay, but didn't. This is an interesting illustration of what happens when a band deliberately departs from their original established style specifically to pick up some radio action. Such strategies hardly ever work, but \\"A La Carte\\" is a noble experiment towards that end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor....","review":"The model in the picture must be a very petite lady (or she is wearing an XXL size costume)!

The ring at the end is a great place for a nice lanyard so as to facilitate the ease of simply jerking the knife out of the sheath, which is a simple friction fit style sheath, no lock. Doesn't need one.The knife was obviously hung by the hole during painting since it has some rust there.It's also balanced just behind the indent closest to the blade, which means it could feasibly be thrown well.Out of box, the edges are slightly dull and rough. It could cut paper easily but didn't have a smooth cut on some parts of the blade. A quick swipe on a sharpener smoothed the burrs and made the knife extremely sharp and smooth.I'm sure this knife could be thrown into a building as it was being demolished and would probably come out sharper.

Small, light, sharp. The solid single piece construction is ideal for a boot knife like this. The handle is a little small for my hand (i wear size large gloves). Best to take that in consideration. When I got this knife it was not sharp at all, but the steel took a nice sharp edge fairly quickly. It does not hold the edge though, even through use for just 30 mins or so. But the idea of a boot knife isnt to dig trenches or batong firewood. Its to keep a last ditch knife on your person so when you are in the situation that you need it, its there and sharp and ready. The sting is great for that. The included sheath lends itself to a large variety of wear options."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"One of the more interesting pieces of outdoor equipment that I have bought.

The craftsmanship is glorious and solid. The sheathe is durable and easy to draw and retain.

It is very solid and sharp. The straps are comfortable and the knife is held very securely. That last part I never would have expected but it will not fall out unless maybe you have it strapped on upside down and and were flailing around, and even then that seems unlikely. The only problem is that it is not the most comfortable knife to hold. It just feels a little odd, but it is a small price to pay for such a securely sheathed, and well built knife."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for large hands.","review":"Nice steel, nice edge and design.

I thought the ending was really weak as well...There was no admitting to love, and I do NOT believe the preacher should have even been thinking about marriage yet His spiritual life was stable and strong.

And even after 3 straight months of wear, they are in good enough condition to be passed down to her younger cousin. They were great for the pool where she used them as water shoes to keep her feet from getting burned by the scorching concrete and go straight into the water. The little Croc charms also fit into the larger holes on these shoes if you want to decorate them.

It was just the topic I had been looking for.She shares her teachings on the holy spirit in a simple way. As she normally does in her writings, she shares what she has learned, how it has affected her life and the progress it has brought in her spiritual life. I like the fact that she doesen't pretend to be perfect and even admits mistakes she made in past. She encourages us to grow in the holy spirit and explains how to provide a good home for the spirit to dwell in.Joyce discusses the topics of baptism in the Holy Spirit with evidence of speaking in tongues, as well as, gifts of the spirit.There is much to learn from this book.

It's pointless to resist, so if all we can do is play music, we'll pour our frustration, disgust, and anger into one long piece and hope someone gets the message.\\" Has anyone else thought about the piece this way?The title \\"Grosses Wasser\\" in german means \\"Great Water\\", so maybe they're thinking of the former free world as being innundated with a \\"Great Water\\" of oppressive governments...They WERE in communist East Germany when they wrote and recorded the work...I don't know.

The rest of it, especially in the Chorale Preludes is very pedantic.While the interpretations of Jean Guillou are not the most historically correct (neither are Vigil Fox's for that matter), the music still comes alive. However, that does not happen in this Leonhardt recording. They seem dead. It is a pity. I've heard other of his recordings and quite liked them.

The fine print on this box explains Maxtor defines 1GB as 1,000,000,000 bytes, which consequently shows up as 93 GB in Windows.

It also sounds terrific, despite a couple of minor flaws. The enormous first movement builds tremendous tension while maintaining its funereal pace. The two fast movements are terrifyingly intense. The bleak Largo continues the moving death march, and the final movement is as sadly ironic as can be, as it haltingly dances toward the questioning peace of the ending. Along the way, the phrasing always hits the mark, and the playing of the orchestra veers madly and sonorously between the required extremes, without losing momentum or derailing itself. A recording to live with. And think about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strong, meditative, the heart of the flawless Master.","review":"This is CD recording whose clarity and intensity will give goose bumps to anyone who is not dead ... I'm not certain about dead people. Maybe. Set on auto-replay, the music will intrude into your thoughts during the day and give you the joy of Bach and Yo Yo Ma's mastery. With such precise joy filling the air, one ends the day with the upbeat conclusion that humans can be great and wonderful. Powerful recording. 5 star.Jim Adams"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply the best!","review":"The Bach suites have been done by hundreds of artists, in hundreds of interpretations.

However, I am a big fan of Bach and especially these unaccompanied cello suites. I do not care for this recording. In my opinion, the tempo, phrasing and general nuance of these suites are not enjoyable because he takes many of them entirely too fast. I realize many players do this for various reasons (including demonstration of virtuosity) but I think the interpretation leaves much of the exquisite nuance un-communicated. Having said that, my wife likes this recording so she listens to the set in her vehicle and I stick to my recording made by Jacqueline du Pré."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Recording","review":"Ma's musical interpretation is so heart melting. Sometimes a little too expressive but still an amazing experience for listening. Everyone should have a copy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Probably the greatest cello recording ever made!","review":"Many have attempted this difficult work in the past (Ma included), but none have been quite this magical. Even Jacqueline Du Pre's beloved rendering doesn't measure up to this recording. Ma makes Rostropovich sound mannered and is clearly better than even the masterly version offered by Janos Starker. Casals is not very well recorded, nor as well played, although the new Naxos remastering is a giant step in the right direction. This is Ma as a really mature master in full control of his instrument ( the same cello Du Pre used, I believe) and with state of the art Sony sound. A really unbeatable combination. If you already have a version of this music, buy this one too. No one need give you permission to acquire that which you love. It is nearly pure joy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Ma's Best!","review":"This recording seems to feature two different performers: Suites 1-3 played in mainstream acceptable tempos and suites 4-6 played so slowly that the sense of pulse seems to be completely missing. It seems that the cellist sees suites 4-6 as being more profound than the first three suites. To these ears, he equates reverential with slow. The prelude to the fourth suite is taken so slowly, I had to fight off the urge to doze. Contrast these performances to Yo Yo Ma's first go at them. The latter were full of life and to this day remain the best available along with the lilting Jean-Guihen Queyras performances.These works were written by Bach as dance suites. As played by Yo Yo Ma, suites 4-6 are only suitable to be danced by elephants.If these suites are to be released as single discs, I would recommend suites 1-3, although Yo Yo Ma's first recording betters these."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cello at it's best","review":"I admit I am partial to the Cello. In my opinion, it is the greatest emotional instrument ever produced, and Yo-YO Ma is on of the best to ever wield it. This cd brings together 2 greats, Yo-Yo Ma and Bach. It truly does not get any better than that. The best way to enjoy this album is to cut the lights off, close your eyes, increase the bass, and feel the music belt out it's power. Bach was a genius, and Yo-Yo Ma is your amazing translator on this tour into the mind that defined Baroque music. A great addition to a classical collection, and a must have for Cello lovers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Una de las mejores obras que he escuchado","review":"Siempre me han gustado las obras de J.S.

There are many wonderful quartets out there performing these quartets, but this recording by the Juilliard Quartet just doesn't rank up there. I swear by the Emerson Quartet's rendition on Deutsche Grammophon which has wonderful recording quality and an amazing performance. I've heard the Takacs Quartet live and they indeed have their own wonderful way of interpreting the music that's different from the Emerson Quartet. I'd recommend either quartet's work heartily over the Juilliard's version, which is thin, lifeless, and simply unsatisfying.

It is fun to watch them reacting to each other.So far, my favorite scenes are when Melvyn shows up at Myrna's house as her long lost husband and also the scene where Myrna puts on a Brooklyn tough girl accent much to the surprise of Melvyn and the visitors from Ohio. Hilarious!Fans of comedies of the 30's and 40's(such as the William Powell/Myrna Loy comedies and Cary Grant comedies) will love this one as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cluster & Eno","review":"A bit of a 'greatest' or 'best of' type of release with regards to work done between Brian Eno & Cluster.

After listening over and over to the samples of the piano versions, I finally took a chance on this Placido Domingo rendering and I love it. His operatic style actually works quite well with these pieces, if occasionally a bit much (as on Andalucia). My favorite orchestral Lecuona recordings are on my old Echoes of Spain stereo album by Carmen Dragon and the Hollywood Bowl, which I can no longer play (no turntable) and does not appear to be yet available on CD.On this album, my favorites so far are Siboney, Noche Azul, Andalucia, Maria la O (which I had never heard before), Juventud, Malaguena, Damisela Encantadora, and La Comparsa."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor excuse for tetris","review":"this game was pretty lame. it comes off as a tetris wanna be, but very poorly. go for something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fell apart after three uses.","review":"I purchased the StarMark Clicker at Petsmart.

I would click it before feeding her, as I put her bowl down, and then 1-2 more times while she ate. I did it for a few weeks, then I clicked it while she was inside to call her for her dinner.Now if I'm calling her from outside and she doesn't come, I'll grab the clicker and she comes running right to me. I feed her as soon as she comes home and click it again while she eats.It went through the washer/dryer once, and is still working fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does what it is","review":"This is the first clicker I have owned. After looking at the clickers available at the \\"big box\\" pet stores and reading the reviews on this one I decided to buy it. I'm glad I did. It seems better quality than the ones I saw in the store and it is louder. That is important for me since I am using it in a loud environment, the local humane society. Some people said it was too loud for their dog and scared it. To them I say you shouldn't be using a clicker if your dog is that sensitive to noises. If you are looking for a good clicker I would recommend this one. The opening at one end allows you to attach a clip and then you can attach it to your belt loop."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great clicker!","review":"It's exactly what I need.

It's sturdy and others have said it is loud. Loud worked for me because I have 6 dogs and when 6 dogs start barking most clickers just won't do. However; One day, while fiddling with a Snapple cap, it clicked. My dogs reacted to the clicking sound just as they did to the clicker. The Snapple cap is less expensive, fits in your pocket, you get the benefit of the drink itself, if you lose the cap you have lost no money and as previously stated; it is just as effective as the clicker sold here. Save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Okay- could be better","review":"This is a better clicker than the traditional square ones found in retail, but is smaller than I imagined. It is about the size of a car remote. It is louder than most and seems to be well constructed. I do like the color as it is easy to spot. The device could benefit from a wrist or neck attachment. I have used it for a week and it has served well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Used it with our black lab puppy","review":"I never thought clicker training would be as effective as it is. We got our lab at 10 weeks old and began training him immediately. We started without the clicker, but got it as a free add-on with another product. We started using it, and after he understood that the clicker meant he was doing something good (and would get a reward) he responded so much quicker. The trick is to use it frequently when first learning a behavior. After your dog consistently responds to the command, stop using the clicker as much, and then eventually you can remove the clicker. Then slowly do the same thing with the reward."},{"rating":"2","title":"Working with Aetertek AT216","review":"We are using these in conjunction with Aetertek AT216S-350S (see my review) on a very hard headed Doberman. This will be our system that lets us wean him off of the Aetertek collar. They are working well and are loud enough to be heard by the dog at what we would estimate is 150 Feet+. They are very loud and the dogs learn quickly that they are a warning on the collar. We hope to get to drop the collar and go to just the clicker with a collar refresher if needed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Clicker, Be Diligent","review":"The clicker is good, the packaging comes with an informative guide for using it in training. I did not have as much luck with the clicker because it's hard to keep the thing on you all of the time.

But so far within the two weeks of us having our husky puppy it has definately got her attention. For only being 8 weeks old we can get her to sit, lay down, and give paw 75% of the time. And it has definately drawn her attention to look at our faces. Love it so far and we have only had it for about a week. I decided on this one after reading someone's review stating it was too loud. I was not real fond of the ones I found at local pet stores because I didn't feel they were loud enough to get her attention."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Durability, but VERY Loud.","review":"I'm a whole-hearted believer in clicker trainer and this clicker is very durable -- it can keep up with training sessions for as long as you and your dog can! However, it's extremely loud, even to the point of hurting MY ears after a while. Imagine how a dog must feel after hearing it 10 or so times. To fix this, I shoved some wads of paper towel down in the three gaps in the blue plastic surrounding the orange button. It still clicks every time I press it, but the sound is more muffled and less harsh. It's easier on my ears, so it must be easier on any dog's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple product at a good price","review":"Professional training aid at internet pricing. I believe there is a small manual in with the clicker that outlines how to use this. If your dog is in training or puppy classes this is good to have for reinforcement at home.

It's just the right volume, and is very consistent - it isn't affected if you are wearing gloves, or have fat or skinny fingers. I ordered 3 of them, and all of them sound the same, too. Well worth the extra dollar or two over the el-cheapo clickers."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Attention Aide","review":"The StarMark Clicker is exactly as described. Push a button and it gives out a loud clicking sound.I no longer have a dog, but, in the spirit of Jerry Saperstein and his creative review, I found several ways to make this device useful.First, I am disabled and walk at a lesser pace than most folks. Often I discover that when I am out shopping with my wife or children, we usually become separated. To find them I have had to search the store and the effort becomes very tiring. The effort leads to my becoming fatigued.Since getting the \\"StarMark Clicker\\" I tell whomever I am with that I will click when I need their attention. Now I just click this clicker and my companion knows that I am looking for themThis product is very useful for me.

I am producer, director, writer, cameraman, performer - everything.I needed a way to distinguish the beginning points of scenes on the video.Normally, in a professional production environment, a clapboard would be used. You know, one of those things with the name of the director and stuff written on it and a hinged wooden clapper at the top. In a one-person production environment, that is more trouble than it is worth.So I use the StarMark Clicker Dog Training System.It produces a loud, distinct double-click that is clearly distinguishable on the video soundtrack.Great little gadget: inexpensive and creates a loud, distinctive pair of clicks.

Since the thing that makes most dogs pull is a human on the other end of the leash who goes with them when they do pull, the idea of then making that the dog's fault and punishing him for it is reprehensible to me. So, despite the fact that this is a nice clicker, I opted for another brand. Hint: clicker train your dog not to pull!

I have a chihuahua, and he's definitely not the nervous type. However, when I first clicked this thing, it was so loud that he shot out of the room. I couldn't even get near him with the clicker in my hand because it freaked him out. I tried holding it a different way, as some of the reviews suggest, to soften the sound with my palm, but it was still too loud for him. I think maybe for a bigger dog, it might not be that big of a deal, but if you have a small dog, I do not recommend this clicker.

Well he hates when we click this product. He now stays in the back of the truck and all i have to do now is show it to him. As for the barking...

Plus it fits nicely in the palm of my hand, though I did add a wrist strap to make it even more user friendly.Aside from not coming with a wrist strap (and hey, at that price I wouldn't really complain) the only problem is it occasionally gets stuck in the pressed-in position and won't out-click. This problem is solved easily enough by pressing through the opening under the button to de-press the clicker. To do this you need some sort of slender, pointy object like a screwdriver or a knife. After that it works like a charm again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!

The remastering is so good you'd never believe they were originally analog recordings.This ADD release is wonderful. The sound quality is fantastic, and the performances outstanding. I like the way C.P.E. Bach's concerto has been placed on the same disc with this father's; you can compare the two, and see where the father influenced the son (as well as hear how C.P.E. was influenced by Mozart, Hadyn, etc.).Harpsichord and orchestra blend together in each concerto to form a cohesive whole.

Instead, it was published to praise General Giap and portray him to the Vietnamese people as a hero of the Communist Party who outwitted and defeated the foreign invaders, thus placing Giap in a class with other heroes of Vietnamese history such as Le Loi and the 2 Trung Sisters.

Visions of taming the frontier quickly fade one summer's drought until a series of miraculous events rekindles the pioneers hopes. Running time: 106 minutes.

There are numerous misspellings and incorrect information. For instance, part of the book defines a JPEG as a \\"glossy compression format\\". If I hadn't read numerous other books about JPEG files, I might not have noticed this. The author should have defined a JPEG as a \\"lossy\\" format.. not \\"glossy\\". I can handle a few errors and misspellings. However, the biggest issue I have with this book is the \\"companion\\" website. As many readers of training or technical books know, companion websites are important when learning. This book requests that the reader download samples files from it's companion website. Unfortunately, the website is defunct. This is a fairly new book and should be more current than it is. This book had potential, but just didn't meet my basic accuracy requirements.

I found that the portrait of the man, both as an individual and as a king, highlighting either his private or public life, or both, and the man's impact on history, with the whole coherently and cogently presented in a clear prose, was sorely missing. In sum, I found the book to be unfocused, uninformative, rambling and at times boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Louis XIV","review":"While I own and have enjoyed reading many of Ian Dunlop's books, I found this one disappointingly ponderous and exhausting.

I could never match that delicious tea flavor I remembered and liked so much.Then I bought some Typhoo tea (at Big Lots -- cheap, but who knows when they'll have it again?).

However, if you already have most of his albums (or seen these videos before) this compilation would not be of interest. One reason is that many of the videos are hard to watch because of irrelevant content quickly cut together into a blur of images having little to do with the song. My biggest problem is that the picture quality leaves much to be desired: it's dark and fuzzy with faded colors. The sound is OK, but all of these should have been remastered for such an ambitious collection. An example of this is the 'Eleanor Rigby' segment from \\"Give My Regards to Broadstreet\\" movie. It looks and sounds much better on the original movie DVD, if you already have it.

Everyone knows that Paul wrote over 30 great songs during the 60's. The fact is he's written another 30 great songs since then. Fortunately a lot of those songs are among these excellent videos. While its true that these videos are in artificial widescreen at a cost to their video quality, everyone would have zoomed in the picture to fill their widescreens anyway so the end result is about the same. Sure everyone would have liked more live material, especially the stuff made in 76 and 91 (before attention deficit, quick cutting live video had become fashionable.)

It's a description of the events that the symphony depicts and it is a tribute to Haitink and his orchestra that the experience of listening to the CD was horrifying. I played this symphony about a year ago, and it was a tough play, very long, but very fun. However, fun is not a word I would use to describe this piece. It contains some of the loudest passages in symphonic music and the orchestra under Haitink is technically excellent. He misses slightly on the 4th movement, could be slightly darker in the cor anglais solo towards the end. The 2nd movement produces the most stunning playing and the 1st movement intensity is quite remarkable, so cold and flat that it reflects the atmostphere of January 1905. Top notch performance."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent Rendition","review":"For me, this recording is one of the high points of Haitink's Shostakovich cycle on London/Decca. Everyone seems to have their favorite alternate to recommend, from Stokowski to DePriest to more than one Russian conductor. My own previous top choice was in fact DePriest and the Helsinki Philharmonic on Delos -- and, in fact, it may still be, for I've had trouble making up my mind between that recording and this one by Haitink and the Concertgebouw. At the end of the day, I think Haitink wins with a better management of the work's shifting tones, with those transitions seeming to me to be smoother and more natural. And, to my untrained ear, the Concertgebouw just sounds like the better orchestra of the two. Though I don't think you can go wrong with either choice, I'd still give the nod to Haitink here."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Haitink recording just arrived","review":"had to see if these high praised comments were close to the truth.Haitink and the Concertgebouw have indeed made a fine recording. I know well this sym from both Rozh/USSR and Kondrashin/Moscow, and now I'm convinced the Haitink does hold up to those 2 standard recordings.The sound is better in the Haitink.I still advise you to seek out the Kondrashin and the rare Rozhdestvensky, as both still remain my 2 first choices, with Haitink 3rd..Hope that helps."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good basic guide","review":"This book was really helpful to me in identifying multiple species of wildflower.

Do to the noise it was making going down the road, I removed it immediately. Not very pleased with my purchase. May fit well for others though. I do have to say that with the way that these are made, they probably don't have the durability to last through very many rotations. I just have doubts that even if you had a good set that they would be likely to stand up to handling very often. They seem to be made of very thin and flimsy material, like tin.

When the action \\"shifts gear\\" into a more thrillerish line, the book becomes merely dull: chases and abductions are inadequate compensation for an absence of detective interest and the irrelevance of Appleby. At the end, a rather surprising villain is revealed, surprising only because the book relies, as it should never do, on a single clue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rivals the Movie","review":"I enjoyed the movie, \\"The Tango Lesson\\". (If you have not seen it, rush to the video store NOW!!!) Somehow, the soundtrack seems to surpass the movie. Perhaps it's music sans dialogue. The tango collection presented here is NOT the lush classical arrangements currently popular and popularized. They are quirky, many include voice (the idea of a voiceless Tango is relatively new), some incorporate the \\"dance\\" sounds of the movie, some are classics - all are outstanding works of art. Additionally, the CD notes are outstanding - almost a novel. This is a real winner!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a great movie","review":"This is a great movie, but totally ruined by being dubbed.

His use of vibrato is also quite annoying. He doesn't showcase the horn, the works or Mozart!Also, the digital recording totally lacks body and brilliance these pieces need. The horn is as loud as the orchestra, and the orchestra instruments are equalized on the same level...nothing jumps out at you!

Most of the singers rock, (except Queen) who is a little more operetic than this musical needs. The funk sounds of the early 80's give an authentic sounding feel to the story. The Jazz elements are sure to delight any Jazz/Funk fan. You will not be disappointed with Queen's best friend (in the show) who also appears in the Disney movie HERCULES as one of the MUSES. Check them both out. She is what this musical deserves the most accolade for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cy Colemans worst","review":"There was only one reason to see The Life, that was for the great Lillias White, who desevedly won a Tony. Other than White, the rest is a dismall bomb. Mr. Coleman was clearly at the end of his long and distinguished career. Hard to beleive this drek is from the composer of Sweet Charity, Barnum, Little Me, City of Angels and Seesaw (to name a few).Also hard to believe this score was even nominated for a Tony, along side Titanic and Steel Pier (which in my opinion has an amazing score and deserved a far longer run than it had). It was a bad year for musicals. Stay away from this waste."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent commentary","review":"I would have to say that this book has excellent commentary about the financial situation in the 20's and 30's which I have not found anywhere else. There are also some short biographies of which the best was about Henry Kaiser. I enjoyed reading it and liken it to the book Market Wizards only this is about money wizards. Matthew Josephson is a great writer and I believe that anyone who enjoy's learning about the financial markets and what makes the economics of a nation tick will enjoy this book and also learn a few things in the process. I must note though that I found myself skimming parts of the book which were maybe too detailed. Overall it still rates very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great music","review":"Mozart's Concerto for Clarinet is my favorite and Karl Leister is obviously a fine clarinetist.

This text is an absolute trash, considering its superficially laid out; excessively numerical end-chapter exercises. Nothing spells H-O-R-R-E-N-D-O-U-S better than this garbage.Reading Atkins's is equivalent to a vicarious torture of Nazi magnitude.While the slapshod mathematical treatment might be curiously amusing; the lack of precision and rigor is deeply offending.

There is a brutal, compelling yet strangely compassionate voice at work here. In an age when poetry is often either safely bucolic or full of naval gazing indulgences or the like this fiercely honest work will open up parts of your head, heart and soul that may perhaps have become a little woolly. The musical backing works well for the most part, only occasionally falling into 'beat' cliches. Will you play it regularly? Perhaps not. Will you play it often? Yes. Every now and then your brain will call out for that sardonic voice and the pictures it places in your head and you'll give it a spin and perhaps think 'There but for...' whilst simultaneously thanking whatever you have to thank for SJB going there and recording it for you. Life, warts and all."},{"rating":"2","title":"An important but forgotten artist","review":"Quite simply put, Steven Jay Bernstein (his real name) was one of the most fascinating and talented poets in the last half century. That his career was so short is a real tragedy. I have listened to Prison thousands of times since its debut and I have never stopped being disturbed, moved, and awed. To most, his voice alone is offsetting. I used to put this on at the record store I worked at to clear everyone out at closing. Get past his sort of droning monotone, however, and you'll appreciate Bernstein for what he was -- the inheritor of the Beats and an important but forgotten artist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get ready for Bernstien.","review":"The change is about to come. Prison will not only spin in your CD player, it will make you're heart go in circles. Starting with the Jazzy initial track \\"No No Man\\", you get a sence of love and molestation. After that quick introduction you will delve into an atmousphere of termoil, hate, loss, and purity. Then Bernstien brings you back again. Enjoy, and believe... because Jesse lives on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Steven Jesse Bernstein Prison","review":"Ive been a fan of Steven Jesse Bernstein for years and had this C.D. in High school.

A lot of questions cannot be found from this book. For example, select 1/0.The questions on each chapter is useful. However you will not find any one in your examination.

That's why I like them; I can beat a pair to death, and replace them without worrying.These are not the same trousers I've come to expect. The fit is totally different: Baggier, with a higher waist and lower rise. The legs are also three inches longer than they used to be (and yes, I'm sure I bought my usual size. The material is also considerably thinner than it should be.Finally, they are olive instead of olive drab. That was my fault for not noticing, but the description is so sparse, I thought perhaps the seller was too lazy to notice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"I can't guess how the other reviewers got GOOD pants from Propper, but the Propper BDU pants I have are absolute junk. The color faded after a couple of washings, so they are now an not-so-interesting blend of gray and olive drab. But that didn't really matter as the fabric ripped in several places within a few wearings. Wearings in which I was decidedly NOT dangling from a helicopter in a monsoon. I can't even use these as work pants, since I risk indecent exposure with one wrong move.Good luck to you if you purchase anyway!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Propper Olive BDU Pants","review":"I bought these to go with the Propper shirt. The only reservation I have is that they try to cover a four inch waist variation in each size. If you are on the low end of the scale like me, you have a lot of excess waist. I made pleats in mine and now they fit fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"College Management assistance","review":"I felt that this book provided pretty general common knowledge information.

I think it's a good idea for him to shoot for an Ivy or sister school and this book is far too negative about them. It seems misleading at best to imply that the Harvard class of 1958 is destitute, and to say that Ivy schools are running scams at the undergraduate level. It may outline a good safety plan or path for specific circumstances, but I think it's dishing out bad advice in regards to the benefits and real experience of the Ivies. Such a shame as it would have been a nice book had the author stuck to providing additional options for consideration while holding his Ivy bashing tounge a bit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissatisfied with the result","review":"As a college student who read this book and now study at the first college to which Pope attends, I can say I dislike my school very much.

To be sure, the author tends to write fondly about the colleges she reviews. With a son desiring to attend one of the schools in CTCL, a neice attending another, and a friend as a graduate of still another, this was a chance to see what the talk has been about. CTCL is a much different kind of college review book than the large, telephone-directory typical books and merits a read if your student has any interest in those sorts of schools."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book changed my son's life.","review":"What a refreshing change from all those other college guides! This book neither gushes over the ultra-Ivies, nor chuckles at the party-hearty habits of the big universities; instead, it offers hope to the average student, the learning disabled, and the late-blooming adolescent. It focuses on pointing readers in the direction of colleges that make a difference in the lives of young men and women, and in the community at large. A chapter in the beginning, entitled \\"Today's Learning Disabled Will Be Tomorrow's Gifted\\", while perhaps slightly over-optimistic, nevertheless opened my eyes to so many possibilities for my son. If you are a hopeful idealist, looking to do something that matters in your life, or looking to guide your underacheiving or learning challenged child, and you're looking for a college that cares about its students and truly wants to admit the students who apply, do as I did and buy or borrow this book today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Colleges That Change Lives...book review","review":"I have not finished the book but it promises to give some very informative information and was recommended to me by a college professor in NC.

And no violinist is more suited to do do justice to these masterpieces than Henryk Szeryng. Szeryng -- although not as famous as some others -- was one of the greatest violinists of the 20th century. Although he excelled in a wide range of repertoire -- from Vivaldi through Sibelius -- Szeryng's beautiful sweet tone and elegant performance style were especially effective in the performance of Mozart. No other violinist I've heard excels him in this repertoire. He was the consummate Mozart violinist, as these recordings attest.

It starts well enough with a great opening paragraph and a good hook early on with a brutal beating for an unknown reason. But then it slows down with family squabbles, legality, and business concerns. The introduction of a rather oddball but highly competent private detective adds a little spark, but lacks interest until the final chapters, If you're a fan of the author, as I am, you will read this, but if you haven't read any previous Francis books, I recommend starting with one of his earlier ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"How sad!

It's a quick read and nobody at a university is going to assign it as fine literature. Yet, Francis deftly involves issues of personal character in the presence of money and titles, not unlike Shakespeare's greatest hits.Continually underscoring the two human races: the decent and the indecent (good and evil are too pure of terms for true-to-life characters), the author always emphasizes through his first-person account the stiff-upper-lip culture and maturity of England's ideal man.Inventing tasteful ways to present sex and gore both, Dick Francis shows off good writing skills for even a jaded modern audience.This tale combines all of the above and spices it with Scottish landscape, royal jewels, treachery, jealousy, castles, a National Trust busy-body, and of course...horses."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a page turner!","review":"I absolutely loved this book! The best thing about it is the end, when it is so tense that you feel like screaming or something.

Then the scene switches to a family putting up a Christmas tree. It's hard to decide which family member is the worst actor, possibly Dad. The family then entertains us with still more bad singing in fake jolly voices.As another reviewer mentioned the diversity came off as so calculated, one black child, one Asian child, one child in a wheelchair, etc. You could just see the casting director with a check list when choosing actors. The whole production comes off as uninspired and white bread.I usually like sentimental Christmas projects, even kind of hokey sentimental Christmas stories, but this one was just bad.I don't see this appealing to the High School Musical, Hannah Montana crowd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ponderous reading!","review":"This is one extremely ponderous book to read.

The book always uses perfect examples, things like the indefinete integral of 3x^2 and provides far more difficult problems in their homework sections. Although this seems trivial it becomes a much more substantial problem when it comes to 'u' substition and the problems that can arise from during it and the practice needed to master such things. Talking to my fellow classmates this is a very common complaint that the examples that the books give are far too simple.

Never the less, I did ordered it and I just received the bat and it is not wood, it is plastic, but is really steady and hard to \\"swing away\\".

I must admit I played baseball and do not recall the wiffle ball stage of life, but I was expecting something a bit wider in diameter along the lines of a baseball bat which is closer in width to the 3\\" diameter baseball and 9\\" wiffle balls which I ordered with it.The 9\\" wiffle ball is only 3\\" in diameter--why they call it a 9\\" ball is something I did not get either. The previous bat and ball I was using with my 3 yr old boy and six year old girl were wider closer to 4\\" diameter for both, which so far I feel works better at that age. Perhaps with time I will feel differently, but if you are not that wiffle ball knowledgeable, this review might help you understand what you are buying a bit better.

The tried-and-true Ravel instrumentation will never be replaced, but this is a \\"Pictures\\" from a distinctly different corner of the hall, and a welcome departure. Serebrier and Bournemouth perform with exemplary precision and freshness, digging in where Stokowski's excesses can withstand some enthusiastic wrangling.

One can get far more accurate and practical information for free from several mailing lists and web sites dedicated to finding, courting, and (hopefully) marrying a woman from the FSU. Turns out that this is more of a sketchy and disjointed (this guy is obviously not a writer) travelogue of resturants, casinos and nightclubs, conquests (ick), and the occasional rant about how great Russian women are compared to American women. This book doesn't even make it as a document of one man's personal quest; by the end of the book, the reader doesn't even know whether the author decided to persue marriage with anyone at all.

OK, I know we shouldn't judge books by covers, but this one is tops, and reflects the book's personality perfectly. Katrine and Trey - one romance writer, one journo who hates romance. A meeting made in hell - or rather, cooked up by their respective editors! I won't give away the plot, but I will say it plays back and forth like a tennis match, tit for tat, as two strong characters fight it out in the arena. OK, they're fighting one another, but they're also up against themselves and their own pasts. Sounds like weighty stuff, but it's fun, fun, fun all the way. Washday will never be the same and the concept of s*fe s*x is presented in - shall we say - a highly memorable fashion?I'm smiling as I write, and I'd happily recommend this one to any readers with a taste for a dash of fun to spice up their romances."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining!","review":"This book made me laugh from almost page one to the end!

It's stunning, especially considering that they come from Atlanta, Georgia. Nobody would expect a band with this kind of futuristic sound coming from the heart of the deep south, but this band is full of surprises. Blending catchy guitar riffs with unintrusive synths and hi-hats, the vocals seem to float a few feet above the music...complex, yet a perfect complement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Impressed by Floraline","review":"Floraline has clearly demonstrated a grasp of what POP is all about. Their music is fun, danceable, and picks-up on all the best sounds of Disco, New Wave and Techno. Don't let the Indy label fool ya. The Cardigans started with Minty Fresh. My bet is that Floraline will definately succeed. I'm already looking forward to their next CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"monotonous & sterile","review":"Technically accurate, I suppose, but lacking emotion and expression. I feel the performer is attempting a new land-speed record. For comparision, \\"Pour les Arpeges Composes\\" is also on \\"Debussy Dreams\\" performed by Aldo Ciccolini (EMI Classics). Ciccolini's performance is truly enjoyable, while Uchida's is uninteresting.I am unable to let this CD play all the way through - it actually becomes irritating. A surprising result for the works of Debussy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whirlwind performance but lacking poetry","review":"From the start the playing was incisive but I soon longed for something that brought me France rather than a robot. I've heard MU's Beethoven and been utterly astonished - but these intriguing Etudes (often for me as moody and interesting as the Preludes if not more so) seem hammered out and drained of their inner secrets. Disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Water on the bottom side of a bowl...","review":"Uchida's performance resembles water poured on the bottom side of a bowl: instead of the music coalescing into coherent sound, it is rapidly driven to ridiculous extremes. The performance is frenetic, almost vulgar, in its unrestrained variation in tempo and dynamics---I hear none of the carefully weighted precision, poetic restraint, and sensitivity which defines Debussy's music. It sounds as though the music is being used as a showcase to display Uchida's overbearing virtuosity and fiery bravura. This makes listening to this CD more like a trip to the circus than an authentic musical experience. Perhaps her talents would be suited to a more theatrical and romantic composer, for instance Listz. I wish I could recommend this CD, as the Etudes are extremely beautiful and quite under appreciated. However, I came away from it feeling as though Uchida was more in love with the impressive movement of her fingers than with the sound of the music itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty thin to be considered \\"tough\\"","review":"These bags fit my garbage cans great but they are thin!

Instead of a hands-in-the-air anthem, the duo deliver a more introspective track, with Tracey Thorn's inspired lyrics, that will still get the place hopping. Club 69 transposes the track to a minor key, with the typical hard house beats that Mr. Rauhofer is known for in gay clubs throughout the land.

I then was re-introduced to the Reverend on \\"Guitar Hero 2\\", which featured \\"Psychobilly Freakout\\", which was exactly that. I don't see how anyone could play a guitar that fast, but he did. And based on the strength of that one song, I bought this CD, and I'm glad I did. I like every single song on this CD, and that is exceptionally rare for me. All of the songs are good, there are only ones which I like better than others (\\"Big Dwarf Rodeo\\" and \\"Eat Steak\\" come to mind).

Having big assets is absolutely nothing compared to other superficial things that create emotional problems and low self-confidence. Like being overweight, too shy, a stutter, acne, or some other facial or skin problem. Those are the things that cause self-consciousness. Not \\"big assets!\\" My God! If people really think that's a problem, they have no idea what it's like to truly feel ugly.This being said, along with the fact that this book really WAS written like a teenager's diary, as another reviewer pointed out, this book was not worth reading.

I was disappointed with the lack of plot... the entire story revolved around a young woman's struggle with self-image. The hero, Brian, was depicted as a wonderful, warm, caring man looking for love and not thrills. So the message that ran through this book -- a man who looked beyond skin deep to see the \\"real\\" person inside had potential. However, the development of their relationship was focused on sexual encounter rather than furthering the discovery of their personalities. Brian's charm begins to crack towards the end... A man who truly loves his girl won't push her into sex (as Brian was doing) when she has made it clear how important commitment (marriage) is to her. After being together for only 15 days, Brian angrily demands unconditional trust from Theresa and cannot understand why she is hesitant to give it???"},{"rating":"1","title":"not a spencer book a real let down","review":"Mrs Spencer is my favorite author.

It had no compelling storyline and the love story was very boring. It starts with a big breasted lady named Theresa meeting her brother's handsome friend Brian. While there are some cute 80's references in their that you don't get out of too many sappy books, it was hard to stay awake long enough to remember the story. She goes through a breast reduction surgery and he gets peeved. The book blurb says he gets totally upset about it and the book only showed him mildly upset. There's never in any part of the book any \\"real\\" emotions from eithier of the main characters. The only \\"real\\" person in the story is the mother. And she's portrayed as the \\"bad\\" guy because she is so bossy and runs the family."},{"rating":"2","title":"A quick, pleasant read...","review":"\\"Sweet Memories\\"...I cant say that this was my favorite book of Spencers, but it was still a good book. Theresa and Brian were so good together. Brian ...ooooh, Brian...I could just imagine him all lean hipped in his faded Levis with his blazing green eyes....~sigh~...Yes, he was a major draw for me in this book. I am usually more drawn to Spencers heroines. While I did enjoy Theresa, sometimes she was just too childish for my taste. I did feel for her though and I was so happy when she began to heal and allow herself to open to Brians love. My main problem with this book would have to be the overly syrupy sweetness of the writing that at times made me cringe. I have read a lot of Spencers work and I most definitely prefer her historicals, but even with its flaws, \\"Sweet Memories\\" was still a worthwhile read."},{"rating":"2","title":"This a truly great album of a best band","review":"Every single song on this cd is worth listening to. The problem is that the Go-Betweens also have many other great songs that did not make it. Whether you have heard of the Go-Betweens or not this is a good place to begin your obsession. Although many fans and critics consider the Go-Betweens a pop band, their influences are clearly Dylan, The Velvet Underground, Jonathan Richman, Television and The Only Ones. Well if you can imagine those groups with the pop sensibility of the Monkees maybe you have magic and imagination of the Go-Betweens."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yeah!","review":"I recall A schoolboy coming home through doors of screen and opening a box that was brown not green.

Save track 5, what I found however was a real horror story of a let down- an atypical sterile eighties sound barely redeemed by the intermittently thought provoking lyrics. A poor mans Smiths, I consider this group to be the most over rated 'under rated' band of the eighties and regard said album as personal insult to a purhaser who spent three hours flipping burgers in a hot sweltering kitchen to pay for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre collection by a mediocre band","review":"The Go-Between are a really overrated band. Their songs are often just dull soundscapes with weak melodies and whiny singing. They never had commercial success because they sat between the chairs of underground rock and guitar pop. Some songs are well done, especially the intros, but they cut no ice and don't manage to hold the listener's interest till the end. I wouldn't buy this disappointing CD again. If you really want to hear a great collection of '80s guitar pop songs, check out \\"Louder than bombs\\" by The Smiths, \\"Absolute classic masterpieces\\" by Felt, \\"1984-89\\" by Lloyd Cole, and \\"Chaps\\" by The Monochrome Set."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap 'n Cheerful","review":"The frames fit well but the lenses do not appear to fit the frames properly, you can see gaps around the lenses in places and the lenses just pop out when you are trying to clean them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"Never again will I go through Northern Tools.

Had my 2500 sq. ft. home and shed exterior painted with 2 coats in 6 hours. Easy to follow instructions. Easy to carry/well balanced even when full of paint. Accurate spray line. As noted in other reviews I bought a straight swivel connector and can't imagine using the sprayer w/out it.

It worked for the first 2 gallons of paint, and then inexplicably refused to spray. The motor was running all the time as if it was having to constantly build the air pressure, but then the paint would just not come out. Oh, it worked fine with water, if I wanted to \\"paint\\" my walls with H2O.Never mind telling me it was an issue with the paint because I was spraying from the same 5 gal bucket. My contractor did tell me that the problem was common with that model, and that Wagner had fixed it in a subsequent model.Thinking back, perhaps that's why it was re-conditioned. Someone had returned it after experiencing the same problems like I did.Anyway, it's now part of the landfill."},{"rating":"1","title":"Service, what service","review":"I hope to get the chance to re-write this review, but I purchased a Reconditioned unit about 4 months ago. The first time I used it, it bled paint down my arm - bad seal in the trigger mechanism. But I liked the spraying that I was able to do. So I drove it down to the Wagner service center - - and here I sit, six weeks later, still with no gun. Guess I shouldn't have done all of that sanding on the patio (still raw wood). I've been told that they are going to replace my gun with another reconditioned unit, and I should have it in a week or two. So if you do purchase one of these, I hope you never have to have it serviced."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't last","review":"After only four times using this sprayer the gun is shot (leaks).

The sprayer, once you get it going, is very good at distributing paint evenly and quickly. The organization of the Owner's Manual, however, is another matter. The Owner's Manual is hard to follow. The cleanup procedure, as described in the manual, is tedious but necessary if you want the sprayer to work next time you need it. Make sure you follow all the cleanup steps including the oil in the Inlet/Outlet Valves. After a couple of iterations you get the hang of the process and everything goes much more smoothly.

At their suggestion, I disassembled and cleaned the machine twice (which takes a lot of effort).

I also see a new Paint Crew Jr. for 20 bucks more, and I am kicking myself for not ordering that instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay for thin paint.","review":"The manufacturer's info says you don't need to thin the paint. If you don't it clogs and dumps a hopper full (up to two gallons) on the ground. Big money and time waster. If you buy a viscosity cup, and are VERY careful, it works. I recommend spending a little more and getting a Draco or SprayTech, low end pro model, for $200 (refurb) - $400.If you are doing a few small jobs such as s fence or a couple of rooms, a Wagner that sells new for $50 t0 $100 works 99% as well.

Finally I got my Behr exterior paint from Home Depot and was ready to get to work. I poured the paint into the tray, turned it on, but nothing. I went away while a couple of guys doing some work for me got it going. Apparently it was as simple as having the lid on?! I can't say for sure, but this sprayer rocked!!! It was really quick. There was a little \\"dust\\" from the spray but was overall very controllable and manageable. My recommendation, duh, would be to spray the body of your project before the trim. A fantastic and fast sprayer. Very pleased. But, like other reviews mention, cleanup is a major pain. Though much worth it considering the time you save in painting. You can expect cleanup to take about half an hour to forty five minutes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked for 45 minutes","review":"I received the Wagner Paint Crew Sprayer and carefully put it togther. It worked beautifully for about 45 minutes. The sray was the best I had seen and rivaled anything I had seen professional painters use.

Thankfully, Amazon returned all my money and I painted the garage with a roller and brush."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked well, died quickly","review":"Purchased the refurbished Wagner Paint Crew sprayer from Amazon 8 months ago and just got a task to use it on. Sprayer worked well and did a great job at increasing the speed and quality of my home-improvement painting. Unfortunately I had 2 problems with the sprayer: 1) During the first cleaning I discovered that during refurbishing they did not replace the gun filter and it was completely clogged from the previous owner, 2) The unit died after the 3rd use. The pressure activated microswitch burned out. Cannot comment on performance of new units but based on my experience I would not recommend getting a refurbished one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than I expected","review":"I bought this reconditioned sprayer and it worked better than I expected. The paint was very thick 1-coat trim paint that's about as thick as runny grits: it sprayed just fine. We painted the underside of an exposed roof (porch). Rafters, sheething, nails, and all. Would have taken forever with a brush, took maybe 15 minutes with the sprayer. Did take a while to clean. The lack of a swivel connection on the hose is why 4 stars instead of 5.

Believe me that happiness will go right out the window every time you try to use it. It had more clogs than the 100 year old drains in my house. The sprayer clogs, the primer clogs and the hose is too stiff. It takes as long to clean the thing as it does to do the painting. So be prepared to stop your painting and start cleaning 2 hours before you get tired. I returned mine to Amazon-they are great about taking things back that don't work.

Item worked okay when I recieved it. Other than having no control over the flow of paint and constant problems with priming the pump, it worked fine. I purchased this sprayer so I could paint my kitchen cabinets and get a factory smooth finish. Well since you can't adjust the flow what I got was runs and I used 3 gallons of paint to paint about 25ln/ft of cabinets. I purchased and used the cleaner and followed the manufacture's storage directions, and the next time I used the painter the pump would not prime. Luckily I bought the warranty and they were able to refund my purchase amount (minus $20 of shipping).Heed the warnings of the masses, and avoid this sprayer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works well before it quits","review":"I have been succored into buying 2 of these machines. The first worked well in Florida using Latex Paint. It completed ceiling and wall painting brilliantly for 80% of our 1600 sq. ft. home until it stopped spraying and no amount of cleaning flushing, kicking or swearing has made it work again. We also bought one in the UK but that produced truly awful results (streaking mainly) before it too stopped. Probably great for lighter paints but under-performs with anything with guts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wagner Sprayer","review":"OK to use but it takes a long time cleaning it up and also it leaves about 1/2 gallon of paint in the hopper.

The very bottom \\"O\\" ring comes off easily and lodges between the seat and stem preventing the pump from building pressure. All paint must then be dumped, everything washed out with soapy water. What's worse is that you have no way to purge the paint from the hose without pump pressure. A garden hose doesn't cut it unless you have an adapter for a garden hose thread to a 3/8\\" NPT. Holding the hose nozzle up to the paint hose won't work due to the thickness of paint... too much resistance in the hose... I got 2 hours of use to my 8 hours of dicking around with the unit...very unhappy..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most paint on unintended targets.","review":"We purchased this reconditioned sprayer to paint the ceiling in our family room. Unfortunately paint flowed from where the handle and hose connect. Then we purchased a brand new unit from a local store and the paint dripped excessively from the end of the gun.

I have painted my entire inside-out of my newly remodeled home, and I'm starting to paint the outside of my sister's house. It is well build. The only thing that bothers me is that the hose is perhaps too rigid and it gets to my nerves that it is hard to handle. Other than that, highly recommended!One more note, when you let it sit for long, the diaphragm that is right underneath the plastic sieve may get \\"stuck\\". Only reach in with your finger (with the thing turned off), and push gently down so that the diaphragm or valve or however you want to call it gets released. If you do not do this, it may eventually go down with the weight of the liquid (paint), however if you are using small amounts of paint, you may still need to use your finger.Oh and yes, the sprayer gets cleaned thoroughly each time and all water residue cleared to avoid this, still, it may still happen every once in a while."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Buy!","review":"We have two of these and they are the best you can get for the price.

Now, back to constructing actual melodies and harmonies, OK?"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you say you like Bleach, you're lying","review":"Boring, dull, and without any personality to speak of, Nirvana's debut is not worth owning. Every song has drifts unnoticeably into the background. It's basically white noise. The vocals are dull, and there is nothing even remotely off-kilter or creative to be found. No interesting song topics, no insightful revelations, no personal spin on the lyrics. Nothing on Bleach will make you think. Nirvana is not a \\"thinking man's band\\" like many wish they were (unless the lyrics \\"cross says floss/smell the smell\\" are too high-brow for you).A melange of records to buy instead of a Nirvana album:Beck: \\"Mellow Gold\\"REM: \\"Document\\"Smashing Pumpkins: \\"Mellon Colliie\\"Spin Doctors: \\"You've Got to Believe in Something\\"The Offspring: S/T, \\"Ignition, and \\"Smash\\"Oasis \\"What's the Story\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for","review":"I hate this album. Everybody says its raw, but that does NOT mean it is good. Any album with a \\"raw\\" sound is pathetic, because \\"raw\\" is just a euphimism for a half @ssed job. Come on, Kurt Cobain spent only $600 to make this record. The sound quality on this recording is absolutely terrible, it sounds like Kurt and the gang were playing their songs over the telephone. The instruments are completely muffled out by the cheap, tinny production. It doesn't even sound like music, it sounds more like Kurt Cobain screaming into the telephone while somebody in the background plays a bunch of distorted, muddy, incoherent guitar noise. I bet even YOU could acheive higher fidelity at home. Just pick up your guitar, and turn on a cheap tape recorder. Then play it back. See? I told you! Even home made recordings sound better than Nirvana!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a pungent pile of stinking excrement!","review":"I truly dispise this album. One star is far more than it deserves. If negative stars were an option I would have give it six hundred and sixty six of them.I got it in a bag of tapes that I bought off a guy at school.At the time Nirvana were really popular and grunge was in fashion so I decided to listen to it.My first impression on listening to it in it's entirety was that it was that it was the worst album I ever heard. I didn't WANT to hate this band or this album so I thought 'I'll give it a second chance'. I still could not find even a shred of good music on this album, so I sold it.This was one of the albums that made me hate grunge with the passion I do today!Now go and buy something good, please, just anything but grunge."},{"rating":"2","title":"The beggining or nirvana","review":"Well, this cd shows the begining of nirvana, in the seattle days. Its PURE, totaly uncomercial, expresive, drastic, and loud. It can realy take you, i mean, nirvana is a music in which you realy get involved, kurdt wasnt pretending anything he said, he wrote his songs and sang with his soul, and in this cd you can notice this. The problem of this cd is that nirvana wasnt very.. shaped, and its kinda repetitive sometimes. But anyway, its one of the best cds"},{"rating":"2","title":"Real \\"Grunge\\"","review":"This album emphasizes the whole grunge sound. Three main reasons being, (1)The label putting out this album, Sub-Pop, was Seattle's biggest distributor of grunge and punk bands. (2)The producer, Jack Endino, was the main producer for most Seattle bands on the label. This album only costed $600 anyway. (3) Nirvana's biggest influences were hard rock and punk music. Mixed together you get grunge. While Never mind was a good album, In Utero and this album were a better example of the band. I even refuse to review Nevermind because it's too mainstream. The best songs on this cd are Blew, Floyd the Barber, About a Girl, Negative Creep, and Downer. RIP Kurt."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dabblers Beware","review":"ITs kind of ironic to think that all those shameless grunge imitators out there (Fuel,Puddle of Mudd,Nickelback) probably never heard Bleach, the searing 1988 debut from Nirvana. The brilliance of Bleach is that its so raw, uncromposing and angry, sure Cobain obviously had some woodshed time ahead of him in terms of lyrics(Blew sounds way too simple) riffs (a lot of the songs sound the same) and songwriting. The intensity overcomes such nitpicking though, Cobain roars through screeches of feedback, calls himself a Negative Creep and says hes stoned, and on the sarcastic \\"Scoff\\" screams, \\"In my room/youre not older/In youre eyes, im not worth it\\". Its all a blast to listen to even if Nirvana dabblers won't find it too inviting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Borderline brilliance","review":"It's no wonder Bleach wasn't quite as succesful as Nevermind, but this not to say that what we have here is a brilliant rock album and a msut have for any grunge/alt.rock fans. There is no \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" here, but most of the songs display enough melody to keep taunting you after trhe lsitening experience. For some alt.rock fans Bleach might actaully be more entertaining to listen to compared to Nevermind, since this is not quite as clean-cut or radio-friendly produced as Nevermind."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best album I've ever heard...","review":"This is my favourite album ever. It's also the most raw, powerful sounding thing I've ever heard. Jack Endino's work recording this record is pure genius. Without a doubt, this is the best thing Nirvana ever did, and (unlike their next album, \\"Nevermind\\") I never get tired of hearing it. It has a huge amount of energy, and it totally rocks! Also, a lot of people have said Chad Channing (the drummer who plays on most of this record) was a bad drummer, but I disagree. Anyway, this record is fantastic. Buy it now, and play it loud."},{"rating":"2","title":"First Effort","review":"Nirvana's pre-Nevermind Sup Pop album shows that Kurt once knew how to have fun exploiting his depression. They rip through his songs with the wild abandon of undiscovered youth, Kurt's vocals just as undecipherable as ever. They got Melvins drummer Dale Crover to play on a few tracks, which shine."},{"rating":"2","title":"the first Nirvana album...I LOVE THIS ALBUM","review":"This, in my opinion, is the best album Nirvana came up with. Yeah the production is bad, but for me that only makes it sound better(cause i like raw sounding music). It's raw, not many(if any) overdubs, it's dirty, and it's slow and pounding. It's got my favorite Nirvana song of all time \\"Blew\\" on it, as well \\"About a Girl\\". I dont think there is a bad song on it. and who needs to be creative to make good music? i dont get these guys who dis it cause \\"it's an imitation\\". even if it was, i wouldnt care. It still sounds good. If you call yourself a Nirvana fan, you MUST have this. If you dont have this album, get it. If i could have one Nirvana album, it would be this one. But thats my opinion. oh well. night"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Album You Never Heard","review":"If there was ever a \\"Pre-Quel\\" in the music industry, this album is it. BLEACH is the album which true Nirvana/grunge fans bought after hearing Nevermind. If the only song you were interested in was Teen Spirit, you probably never heard this record and you missed out. The tracks here are of raw power including \\"Floyd the Barber\\", \\"Mr. Moustache\\", \\"Big Cheese\\", and Kurt's prequel to Teen Spirit \\"Negative Creep\\". In music circles, being a Nirvana fan can liken you to pop music. But, if you've heard this entire album, you know that Nirvana really created the new music sound that EVERYONE listens to today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Underground vs Radio Play","review":"Nirvana was NOT the original band to pull grunge out of the popluations' pockets. Bleach was an underground compilation that was never publicized until later. Alice In Chains, though, hit the radio waves 11 months before Nirvana did, with \\"Facelift\\", which was released on August 28, 1990, while Nirvana's \\"Nevermind\\" was released on September 24, 1991. So who can honestly prove that Nirvana was the origin of grunge???"},{"rating":"1","title":"good music, unfortunately very poor packaging","review":"I bought this since it is one of all time must haves. Unfortunately the lp record is warped due to poor packaging practice. LP was sent in a box loosely packed with bubble pack and not sent properly in a vinyl cardboard sleeve. Unplayable now.

They get along just fine alongside each other on my I-Pod. \\"Welcome to the Jungle\\", \\"Teen Spirit\\", \\"Billie Jean\\", and \\"Material Girl\\" are the ultimate songs of rebellion.

Sure, Kurt and da boyz got the best sound $600.17 could buy, but it still sounds like (...). Does Bleach sound good compared to Soundgarden's first SubPop EP? No. Does it have variety to the sound of the songs? No. Is there any creativity in any of the songs? No... unless you consider shouting \\"Gimme back my babyback ribs... um, I mean 'alcohol'\\" twnty times in one song as being creative. In \\"Aero Zepplin\\", Kurt was right when he said rock stars can \\"(...) upon the stage and they'll be fans\\", because it's so true. Rock stars like Kurt can get away with anything.

This is grunge in all of it's forms. Heavy, raw, angry, and depressed. Although it is not Nirvana's best album it does deserve alot of credict for laying the tracks down for the soon to be legendary Nirvana. It explains the depressed mood of Kurt Cobain. The lyrics are powerful and the sounds of this album is almost as good as Nevermind. It is only missing one thing Dave."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good album, perhaps Nirvana's best of all","review":"So, a review for this product... well, I'd say nothing but the very best of Nirvana so far, case there will be more songs published after Sliver: The best of the box. I love In utero, I like Nevermind, I like Incesticide also, but Bleach is another world for me. I am a musician myself and play guitar and/or sing... if it's me I'd only say Nirvana is: this album. Raw, pure, good music, alternative as much as it could be, new frontiers reached with now more or less familiar songs like: School, Negative Creep, About A Girl and Blew and less known but all worth it buying this product like Big Cheese and Sifting.

It's a great oppurtunity to hear the whole seattle sound and 'grunge' before it becomes a mainstream phenomenon. Bleach may not have taken nirvana a long time or much money to make but it still is a masterpiece of the band's career."},{"rating":"2","title":"Their Best Album","review":"This is one of Nirvana's best works. I found out about Nirvana not to long ago from my Stepdad who burned a cd and put Nirvana's song \\"Smells Like Teen Spirt\\"(from Nevermind), and Ashley started to learn about Nirvana, downloading music, looking at pictures, and even inteviews she was obessed with Nirvana. I then started to like Nirvana.Kurt's voice was a bit raspy, and good at the same time. I was watching a video about how girls loved him for his looks and voices.Thats not the point though. Kurt was stoned most of his time so his lyrics when he was singing was hard to understand but when you read the lyrics their very dark. Nirvana was prob. one of the best Grunge bands ever. This is their best album if you like Nirvana or are just getting into them. This album is a must own."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Beginning","review":"Nirvana has proven to be the most influential rock band of the current rock era. On this CD you can very much hear the hints of something brand new being born, something clearly demonstrated in \\"About A Girl\\" and \\"Scoff\\", but through the rest of the album they seem to be searching for that revolutionary sound. I'm not in any way lowering their status as musicians, but I am saying that this album was a prototype, and just as Beethoven labored endlessly through draft upon draft upon draft to reach his desired sound this too shows that process. \\"Bleach\\" seems, to me, to be more of a draft of a new sound rather than the new sound itself. On more of a side note I almost detected some Metallica influences in this album, particularly in regards to some of the drumming and choppy guitar breaks that are not as prevelant in later Nirvana albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nirvana's first.","review":"This might not be on par with Nevermind or In Utero but it's still a mighty good album. Blew, About a girl, School, Negative Creep, Scoff and Swap meet being the highlights."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bleach rocks like a mutha... and it does it well.","review":"If you're going to get a Nirvana album, definitely start with Bleach. It has an aggressiveness and a in-your-face honesty that Nevermind and In Utero lacked. On Bleach, Kurt and company didn't care about money like they did with the Nevermind and In Utero tours. All they cared about was playing live and taking a giant road trip across the country. And if they were lucky enough to sleep on a few fans' floors and get paid in a case of beer, then they felt all the more rewarded. It's really disappointing to see other people trying to make more out of Bleach than it really is though. This album isn't an artistic statement or a \\"tuneful approximation of what grunge should sound like\\". All Bleach does sets out to do is rock like a mutha... and it does it well.Highlights: \\"Negative Creep\\", \\"Sifting\\", and \\"Paper Cuts\\"May the heaviness be with you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sycophantic fans","review":"of Kurt Cobain will eat up this messy, plodding, mostly uninteresting album.

The counter doesn't allow decimals, but it would be a sin punishable by the Hammurabai penal code to give this a score less than a 4.5.This is possibly one of my favourite Nirvana CDs, it's also their first album, produced by Sub-Pop. I enjoy this CD because it embodies the darker side of Nirvana: the highly cynical, mutually indifferent aspects. Although the lyrics are somewhat difficult to comprehend, it's not difficult to relate to the raw energy that the three-piece rock group radiates. If you are an artist, I guarantee you'll like this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Let's all Drink bleach To Nirvana!","review":"This album-although not many people own it-is very good.

It has all of the facets that made Nirvana such an insanely huge success: It's raw, simple, and catchy. While being somewhat under-produced, unlike \\"Nevermind\\" and \\"In Utero\\", There is an honest charm in it's garage band feel. Certainly a wonderful glimpse into the beginnings of one of the biggest bands ever. Songs like \\"School\\", and \\"Negative Creep\\" showcase the heavier side of the album, while \\"About a girl\\" provides a hint of the pop mastery they were later to revel in. All in all, a classic look into the early workings of one of musics most tortured and brilliant minds."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Nirvana Without Grohl","review":"This is a great first album by Nirvana.....but without Dave Grohl on the drums....it lacks a certain energy that you get with the other Nirvana albums....but otherwise with songs like About A Girl and Blew......this is a primetime example of pure grunge rock....and its awesome."},{"rating":"1","title":"just bad","review":"this album is propably the worst album i've ever heard. there's nothing more to say. unbelievable how horrible every single song sounds!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The only Nirvana album I own","review":"Bleach is a decent enough punk album. But to say that Kurt Cobain is a guitar legend and did more for music than any other musician is blatant lying. He just happened to hit at a time when things were already changing. The truth of the matter is that they didn't hit the mark near as close as early '90s bands such as Pearl Jam and Soundgarden. If you want a truly ground-breaking album from the early '90s, get MetallicA. But don't over praise Cobain."},{"rating":"1","title":"zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ","review":"Nirvana kicks ass, but this cd blows it.

It contains one noteworthy song- About a Girl- which is surrounded by almost a dozen forgettable, two-minute punk rock tracks with childish lyrics. It wouldn't be until 1991 that Nirvana would assemble an album that not only sounded great, but was comprised almost entirely of catchy, memorable songs. Bleach, unfortunately, is the complete opposite."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grunge before it hit mainstream","review":"\\"Bleach\\" shows us a Nirvana before they were on MTV and just a band playing local gigs and messing around with cheap recording devices in their garage. \\"Bleach\\" displays the style that would later be known as \\"grunge\\" before it got polished for the radio and every rock band would try to copy the sound. The songs range from purely angst rockers to almost tuneful single worthy to the complete absurd. It is everything a band that wants nothing more than to play the local clubs and maybe press a few records on a indie label, should sound like. At the same time with songs like \\"About A Girl,\\" you can see that there was something more in this band than silly lyrics and three chords. You could see that this band could be an amazing rock 'n' roll band with a little time. \\"Bleach\\" is not essential but if you have the other Nirvana albums and love them then you'll want to get \\"Bleach.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Listen to this one more than once","review":"The more I listened to this album the more I liked it.

Many people believe that Nevermind was their first album. Woah, they are completky wrong about that one. Bleach is their first full LP. Its a great album too. Recorded for 600.00 bucks (As if that fact hasn't been stated enough) it is not at a very clear hearing level. But that is the beauty of it. It had that gritty, grunge feeling to it. Nevermind was to polished compared to this. Bleach has some real rockers on it, such as \\"Blew\\", \\"Paper Cuts\\" and \\"Scoff\\". Listen to the double floor bass drumming on \\"Scoff\\", its cool. Also, Bleach has its share of pop-ish songs on it. \\"About A Girl\\" is extremely catchy, and radio friendly. As is \\"Love Buzz\\". Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Plod on!","review":"Nirvana's debut has something Nevermind lacked: musical honesty. The rawness and lack of financial assets really made Kurt prove himself to be a guy that could thrash his guitar with the best of 'em. And as for his bandmates... well, they really were just background musicians. Sure, it might sound harsh, but it's the harsh truth for Krist that Kurt wrote over 90% of the band's music. Kurt had to teach Krist and the easily-disposable line of drummers how he wanted their instruments to sound for his songs. Speaking of Mr. Cobain's songs, the songs on Bleach are very good. They do have a sameness to them, but at least they're not as repetitive as the pop overkill on Nevermind. My faves are such plodding masterpieces as \\"Scoff,\\" \\"Sifting,\\" \\"Negative Creep,\\" and \\"Floyd the Barber.\\" Soooo... if you're looking for a record to put on to fit a rainy, dreary day, Bleach will suit it perfectly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strong album, but terrible production","review":"Every song on this album is great, but its really hard to say how good it iis when the production is so bad that you can barely understand it. Kurt and co. only spent just over $600 to pay for the recordings, not a good idea. However as bad as the production may be there are very many redeeming qualities to this album. The song 'About a Girl' is a perfect example of this CDs importance, the riff may be hard to hear but the lyrics are true and the drumming is good. This is overall a great album, so why does it get only 4 stars? Because of how terrible the production is (You've probably figured that out by now). When the box set comes out I hope it has 'Bleach' remastered."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Buy","review":"Being a big fan of Nirvana of course I bought this it is very not many people even know about this and only know of the big commercial sucess Nevermind which is great but we've got ourselves a gem here.It's very underrated.The highlights to me on this album were \\"Blew\\" and \\"About A Girl\\".So all in all it is definetly a good album and great buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality","review":"I used this headset approximately 12 times, over a two year period.

Cartel's sound is uniquely their own, but I would recommend \\"Safety in Numbers\\" for anyone who likes the darkly melodic sounds of Doves, Elbow, and Interpol and for anyone who supports truly independent music.

Comes with a cover to keep it clean. Don't let the low price fool you. This is a great little scale. I recommend this highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"prod review","review":"This scale seamed to be accurate the one time I used it. And right before I used it I dropped it on a hard floor pretty hard, right on the corner. I was sure I broke it. But it works fine and is still accurate as far as I know. easy to use. But I especially like that the instructions are just inside the cover/tray with a smooth label. So you will always remember how to use it if the need arises."},{"rating":"2","title":"pocket scale","review":"Great product, easy to use seemed accurate, I use it all the time for coins and like it a lot"},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage!","review":"This scale is useless and inconsistent. Trying to weigh up bulk supplement powders is impossible. I literally was adding micro sized portions of bulk powder and it would jump from 0.1 to 0.6. Also I was trying to weigh already portioned powders and i would take it off the scale and put it back on and get a dif number each time. Save your money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Price, Great Quality","review":"This scale is perhaps one of the best portable scales I've ever seen. It's incredibly small, at least much smaller than I had expected, but it does a great job and is accurate. This scale wouldn't be my first choice if I needed to make extremely precise measurements but .1 grams is good enough for me! Actually, I showed this device to one of my physics professors and he was absolutely amazed! He couldn't believe how great the device was compared to its price and size!I would definitely recommend this to any backyard tinkerer, or in my case, a mechanical engineer in the making."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ok for measuring grams only","review":"It measures out really well actually. I wouldn't use it that much for things under .5 grams because it gets very fritzy in those areas but for the money it's well worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"good","review":"it's very light and portable, even though I only use it in kitchen, I still find it convenient to store. The only problem is to find the suitable holder of your cook stuff. What I use is a paper cup to contain flour and sugar."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good valued","review":"This is a very good valued scale. It works quite accurate and precise. It's also small so I can carry it out sometimes. Very worth buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"Yes, it is just a tiny plastic scale. But I can't believe just how cheap it is and still works just fine for my needs. I verified its calibration when I got it and then have been using it ever since with no issues. Everything works as described. If you're looking for a cheap small scale you can't go wrong here. I measure primarily in troy ounces and it has been 100%."},{"rating":"2","title":"scale","review":"hey everyone this scale works alright it needs calibrating often so it gets a 4 out of 5wordpeace"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great scale for the money","review":"This is great little scale, shows 2.5g for a penny and for the price you *can't* go wrong. Don't hesitate to buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"love it!","review":"so easy to use and for such a great price. great features like the tare weight ease and how it turns itself off to preserve battery life. very practical and convenient for bring along for your every day weighing needs :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"It really does fit in your pocket and works great. I tested it with a few weights from my Physics class. I do, however, wish that it would come with a 500g weight so you could reset it if needed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good scale for the price and size","review":"This scale performed as expected. I use it to weigh coins and it is good to .1 grams. The only thing to note is it is very small.Overall - a good scale for the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"garbage","review":"had this scale for twenty minutes and it already needed to be calibrated ... then stopped working... spend the extra ten bucks and get a good one."},{"rating":"2","title":"accurate and for 5 bucks !!","review":"Well if you like to smoke you know the price of herb is high(pun intended)consequently the need to ensure you get what you pay for becomes more of a concern. Well this little bugger is accurate as can be! and I was glad to see that so are the scales my friends use as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great size and accuracy.","review":"This scale is perfect for weighing quantities of food at a restaurant or at home. It is extremely portable and accurate. It is a great value for the money. I would recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"alright","review":"I bought this and works well, but it goes through batteries fast. The batteries that came with it new, didn't work. I put new duracell batteries into it then weight things. Decided to weigh things the next day and the batteries were dead. Scale came on and flashed that it was a low battery and then went off. It did this a few times until I decided to just take the batteries out when i'm not using it. works well like that and i've read that other people have the same problem on other websites and even amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect!!! 3.5 errr I mean 5 stars","review":"This product was the right price and works better than expected. The S&H is to much but what can ya do? It is still cheaper than the closest one with free shipping."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it!!","review":"Received the scale, set up was easy. Just pull out the plastic strip from battery and its ready to use. Further when I performed a small test to check the accuracy of the scale, the scale got 1 star rating.Here is what I did.Picked 2 Quarter Dollar coins, weighed the first one 5.7 grams, weighed the second 5.6 grams, when I put both coins together on the scale combined weight was 10.6 grams instead of 11.3 grams. Based on these observation for me this scale was not worth buying in case you are looking for precision as advertised (i.e. 0.1 G) ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get what you pay for","review":"You get what you pay for with this product. Very inaccurate will jump 1-2 grams just from picking up the object your weighing and placing it back on the scale, no weight change, but the scale seems to think there was..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not precise... cheap, of course.","review":"I should know better... cheap scale... doesnt work!! I needed something to weight very light things. This will pick up if I blow into it, but wont weight something less than 10grams! Not 0.1g!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Handy scale","review":"I bought this scale to weigh coins - mostly pennies. It is a GREAT scale. Came already calibrated so don't recalibrate it. Works fine. Does shut off quickly but I am ok with that since it is saving the battery. Arrived QUICKLY from the seller."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"A very reasonablely priced digital scale in a small size. I am very impressed with it's accuracy, and very much in it's abilities."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Perfectly Fine!","review":"Don't listen to any of the lower ratings this works perfectly Fine! To make sure it is accurate weigh a penny, if the penny is after 1983 then it should weigh 2.5 grams :) the scale came out 2.5 grams for me :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Scale","review":"Worked great for what we purchased it for. ( 7th grade science project on water tension) the price was right. Plus the kids have a good time measuring everything they can think of. So it turned out to be a good toy as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product for small measurements!","review":"I use this scale for measuring hops for homebrewing. It has several measurement modes and has a zero reset button so you can zero out the container. The display is backlit so this scale can be used in low light situations. Mine has the tendancy to have an incomplete display on the final number, but as this is 1/100 of an oz. it is not a big problem for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"accurate","review":"this little scale was alot smaller than expected. usually when a product says \\"pocket sized\\" it usually means that it just barley fits in it but this one fits nicely like a cell phone. it also is very accurate from testing"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product","review":"This scale works as it should, and a year later... still works; I am pleased with this product, although it is somewhat small so I use a small container to hold the things that I want to weigh!"},{"rating":"2","title":"So far, very good!","review":"We bought this item to weight artemia cysts for our breeding facilities.We have used it very little, but for the price we think its acurate enough.The item is very small, maybe smaller than the palm of your hand., it seems fragil it comes already with AAA batt. (needs 2 to work. The shipping was very slow (we applied for free shipping)and what was supposed to be one package turned to be 2 thanks to the slow delivery."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great price!","review":"for what it is, its great. However my only problem with it is that it has to be completely level to function properly, and I mean COMPLETELY LEVEL."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent","review":"Does the job. Maybe 0.1-0.2 off but for my purposes that's ok. Given how cheap this was, I can't complain. Happy with the purchase. However, if you need a scale thats 100% accurate and to quickly weigh more than say, 3.5gs, pony up and get yourself a real scale."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great price, exellent product","review":"I've had my Fast Weigh MS-500 for a few days now and have really put it to work! I was initally surprised by the very small size of the scale (at least it's much smaller than I assumed it would be after viewing the product shots. Though it's pretty small, I find that it's still large enough for my purposes. The small size makes the scale super easy to carry around in a pocket if necessary. The display is well lit. The scale seems to measure quickly and very accurately right out of the box without any tweaks or adjustments (at least mine did). I'm thrilled with the performance of the scale ... especially given the price. I'm glad I picked on up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much smaller than looks in pic but works great","review":"Works great. You gonna have to use a cup and tare the scale to use it. Its really small but worth the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Received a used product","review":"This is a very small scale to be used to weigh very small products. I gave it 1 star becuse I ordered a new scale but received a used one with the display scratched. Sent it back and got a bigger one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality - Does not work","review":"We expected this to work out of the box. The reset button was not working and we could not calibrate to zero. When we contacted the vendor, they suggested us buying calibration weights from them to make it work. Do not buy this product. You better donate your money to charity."},{"rating":"1","title":"two broken scales later...","review":"I order one scale, immediatly paid, and waited. It was broken, so I contacted seller, he agreed to send a new one, it was broken. I open the package to find the screen crushed. I will NOT be buying from the seller again. And I do not suggest you do either."},{"rating":"1","title":"thought, cheap","review":"it is cheap. thought i would break it by just looking at it. should have known better. just thought i was getting a deal. and it would have been if it had worked at all. even tried several different batteries. nothing. oh well, amazon returned it and refunded me no problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth buying! i returned it.","review":"As in the title, not worth buying! too small to put on anything on it"},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS SUCKS","review":"This product is deceiving. I was expecting a weight to weigh myself I have no idea what this crap is used for maybe gold."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not sensitive enough","review":"I'm a bit disappointed with this scale. First off, it's a nice scale as long as you're not weighing anything less than 0.1 oz. Anything less than that, forget it. It does not measure 0.01 oz as this listing claims. My scale works perfectly fine, weighed a U.S. quarter and it came out with the correct 20 oz."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ehh","review":"I got this item and it came with batterys.. but THEY ARE DEAD.. so i have no idea if this item works or not.. i have not bought more batterys yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scale Reviewer","review":"This product came in the mail very fast. It is also very simple to use, BUT it will not give you an accurate read every time. I have calibrated it over 20 times and it still gives varying weight. Not much but still different reads. Ranging from 4.5-5.2gs. Would not recommend this product even though the price is very reasonable."},{"rating":"2","title":"good little scale for the money","review":"does what it needs to fits in pocket very nice and seems to be very accurate. this is a great product and a great buy"},{"rating":"1","title":"not accurate","review":"when i first got this scale, it seemed cheaply made. it fits in your pocket, but is rather bulky to be a pocket size. it is also not accurate at all. If you're weighing anything less than 2 grams it wont even register it, and if you're weighing anything more, it will be off. i tried to calibrate it and it didn't help at all. i would definitely not recommend this product to anyone and would return it myself if it was worth the price. In any case, you get what you pay for."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent buy","review":"It easy to use with large readable numbers and weight in oz., lbs., or grams.

The scale is really really small. The seller should have said it was pocket size.The callbriation was difficult to do. Maybe it was me. But it took me a while.

I hope I can trust it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not that good","review":"doesnt calibrate, so really useless. i out something 3.5 ounces. cane to 14.5grams.
