There are also tracks in where the band proves that the old school Genesis from Gabriel and Hacket era still lives, like the great \\"Driving The Last Spike\\", the bluesy \\"Dreaming While You Sleep\\" and the introspective \\"Fading Lights\\", of course, mixing the actual pop style of the band, but really good and with powerfull and nice tunes on it.

But the only reason I have this CD in my collection is the song \\"Driving The Last Spike\\".This song is a very incredible song that moves me evertime I hear it.It is a song that will be lost in an album full of nothing.

Still this manages to be a 2 1/2 star album along with And Then There Were Three putting it slightly over the other 4 albums Genesis made as a Phil Collins led trio. Longer more complex compositions with stronger playing attribute to this. The Last Spike and Fading Lights are classic Prog Rockers while No Son Of Mine and Living Forever are good and I Cant Dance and Jesus He Loves Me are ok. The rest of this album is awfull even at the end of thier stint with Collins Trio Genesis failed to even make a good album."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd prefer that they never released this.","review":"This album is very disappointing. In fact, I'd prefer that they never made it. It sounds half hearted.\\"Jesus he loves me\\", and \\"Driving the Last spike\\" are OK. But after the song \\"we can't dance\\" it goes down hill really badly. There seem to be a lack of ideas, some half baked noodles, a few solos that meander into sounding like 2nd Home by the sea demos. Phil sounds bored singing. It's a mess, and not even an interesting one. My attention was really lagging with each track.With previous albums like Duke, Abacab, Genesis and Invisible Touch they seemed to embrace change and write with vigour. Invisible Touch really is one of their best albums, you can feel the enthusiasm. We Can't Dance does not sound like a band enjoying themselves.

It's like Queen did with 'The show Must Go On' on Innuendo. It is their coda. If only they could have put as much into the rest of the album, it would have been their best post-Gabriel. The first half is tolerable. The second half is saved only by 'Living Forever' and \\"Fading Lights', possibly one of their best collaberative songs. It seems the rest of the songs were left overs from Phils divorce days or they wouldn't fit on his 'But Seriously...' Don't get me wrong. I am a HUUUUGE Genesis fan. The first time I heard 'I Can't Dance', I had never been so excited about a Genesis release. Maybe as time goes by, I will learn to appreciate this album more.

From high energy twangers to slow drinkin' songs, Lawrence covers a wide array of stylings with this album. The title track shines best, but songs like \\"Runnin' Behind\\" and \\"Paris, Tennessee\\" remind the listener that some of the best country tunes are the ones that aren't too terribly serious. \\"Today's Lonely Fool\\" and \\"Somebody Paints The Wall\\" head up the more serious songs on this album, but Lawrence has a tone in his voice letting you know that no matter how bad things are going, there's always a honky-tonk with an open barstool nearby.For good 90's country before it was commercialized to death and turned into pop with a fiddle in it, check out Tracy Lawrence's \\"Sticks and Stones.\\" His other albums are just as good or better also."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast Results!","review":"GREAT workout program!

I'd read enough to be pretty sure the diet was for the birds (too expensive, too closely resembling anorexia), so that was a non-starter. I tried the mat workout, thinking at worst, it wouldn't do anything for me. WRONG. Five days into the first 10-day segment, my hips were killing me. I mean, they hurt to the point that I had trouble sleeping. Hmmm. Not good.I'm going to give myself a few days to recover. I like a few of the mat moves. I'm pretty sure I'll like a few more with some modifications. And I'm pretty sure I'll never like some of them.

After the first ten days I can tell that though it was very difficult (and I mean seriously difficult) for me to do all the reps Tracy suggested at least I was able to do 20 reps and 20' of cardio, jumping on a 2sq.m. carpet, without having any problem to follow her.

However, anyone with a tight schedule will be unable to do the hour pluse that it takes to complete the workout.

The dance/cardio part is hard to follow as she does not give any direction to what is next. tried to follow but just made my own routine with her moves to the count of 8. Now, if you have a chef come cook for you, it's no problem; but if you are on a budget (like me) you cannot find most of the products the recipe calls for; preptime; and servings are unrealistic.

The information in the book is very good, and gives a good background of the workouts that are not often explained in the DVDs. The recipes and meal plans are all fantastic.Now the negative......The book also comes with a workout DVD. The only thing I don't like in the DVD is the poor editing. This is not the first time I have encountered editing problems in Tracy's DVDs (Beginner Dance Cardio for example). It makes it difficult to keep up with the routine when 2 different workout sessions are poorly edited together. I have her original set of DVD's (post pregnancy workout and mat workout DVD's) and this was not an issue.But the music and content on the DVD's are great and it always gives me a burst of energy."},{"rating":"1","title":"New to Tracy's Method?

If you already have some of the Tracy Anderson DVDs, don't waste your money on this book. Even for the DVD. The Dance Cardio on the book DVD is a joke - it is nowhere near as good as her Beginner Dance Cardio DVD for those who are new to cardio dance. Even if you are new to the TA Method, I would recommend that you buy her Beginner Dance Cardio DVD so you can learn some real dance cardio routines. If you have the patience and work ethic, her Dance Cardio II is even better - true dance routines that make you not even realize how hard you are working.

The calorie intake for the amount of mat work and dance cardio you do is totally unhealthy. The menu is extremely time-consuming to make and way too expensive for the average person. The muscular structure work is do-able; I will most likely continue with this section. The dance cardio, however, is dangerous to do in your own home unless you have remodeled one of your spare rooms or basement into a dance studio. Warning: do not do the dance cardio on carpeting and be sure to wear the appropriate shoes (ie., not running shoes). I sprained my ankle the first time I tried the dance cardio workout, and believe me, I am no klutz. Like Miss Anderson's other material, this book and DVD are poorly edited and filled with inconsistencies. This whole 30-day boot camp concept is just not safe, healthy or convenient.

The 'warm up' stage (5 poses) could potentially cause injury only because the body isn't warmed up enough to do it safely (my opinion).Commitment and common sense is the key. This, like every other exercise or healthy routine, can be effective if one has a routine and practical workout schedule.

This claims to be for over age 6, however, the 'tricks' are WAY to easy. Seriously, a four year old could do these with no prob. Also, the quality is terrible. The first time we used the sword in the stone the wood piece that holds the metal piece inside (that releases the sword) came off! Anyway, I wouldn't recommend this at all, too cheap."},{"rating":"2","title":"4 yr old really enjoys!","review":"I bought this since my 4 yr old has really enjoyed magic lately. I couldn't find anything that was for her age group, but I can tell you this Melissa & Doug magic kit is perfect for her. It comes with 4 relatively simple magic tricks that she has been able to play with non-stop for the past few days. It doesn't have many small parts (only 3 small pom pom items) for anyone concerned about younger siblings and choking hazards. This is a nice and simple starter magic kit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mixed feelings","review":"My 6 year old niece was excited to get this. These tricks are very basic. Only one of they took some practice. The graphics are colorful and detailed. Most of the items are made of wood are durable, but the little pieces are cheap. There are 3 fuzzy pom poms to go into the disappearing box. On the color changing string box, the color on the string is longer than the box. Therefore the \\"mystery \\" of the trick is visable. Over all, I thought that this toy was slightly over priced."},{"rating":"2","title":"My 5 year old loves it","review":"My five year old got this for Christmas and she loves it. With a little practice she mastered all the tricks and does them very well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beginner magic set","review":"Bought this for my six year old grandchild and she loved it. Her older sister (11) who has a magic set for older children, was able to help her do her magic. Both felt very accomplished for their actions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty good","review":"My 7 year old son really enjoyed it when he got it; but it has broken apart and he's lost some of the pieces. In general it was fun while it lasted, but once you do the tricks several times they start to get old. Worth it for an introductory to magic and limited time of usefulness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun!!","review":"I bought three of these kits for Christmas gifts for my son's friends - ages 6 & 7. They LOVED it. Normally a kid's magic set is so flimsy and/or complicated that it's trashed within a week of receipt. Not this kit. In true Melissa & Doug fashion it is high quality and easy to use. The boys all are competing to see who can learn the tricks the fastest and amaze the most people. Great bargain as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great magic kit for a 5 year old!","review":"Bought this for my son--actually he bought it with his allowance. He loves it. This is a great beginner kit as it has more gadget illusions rather than tricks that require skills. As such, he was able to do them well with just my cursory tutorial. Afterwards he gave a show to anyone who came into the house. Very easy for a child to learn and satisfying for them. Well built and cute."},{"rating":"2","title":"My daughter loves this","review":"She does the tricks for everyone she can.

It shows that the love for the land, the love for oneself is as important as anything else, but mostly more important than the titles, visas, passports that keep putting obstacles in people's ways. Having a life following the work on the fields is not only hard and unrewarding, but if looked upon the way of a person in touch with themselves it becomes more important than ownership of land, being born on the right side of the line, or more important than all of it. Looking forward to her next novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh","review":"I had to read this book for a class, and not being of Hispanic origin and not being a Spanish speaker; certain phrases, mannerisms ,and language overall were rather difficult to comprehend. The theme and the setting of the book are quite uninteresting for a 20-something year-old white male (or at least me , I'd hate to make an incorrect generalization). The publisher chose an incomprehensible format for dialogue in the text, and along with a lack of an actual story line, the read is quite a chore and not something I'd ever try to read again. I plan on avoiding anything Viramontes wrote in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Five star music ... but there is a caveat","review":"The music on this album is uniformly superb and a joy to hear. No quibbles there. In fact, if you love jazz piano trios, give the sound samples on this page a listen and you'll probably be hooked.Here is the caveat: This is half of an expanded album that was released during the same era as this one:Kenny Drew And His Progressive Piano. To be sure, this album was, indeed, issued with with only the tracks listed in the sound samples. It was also released as The Modernity Of Kenny Drew (Norgran MGN 1002) during the same era.Tracks on this album were recorded in Los Angeles on September 2, 1954 by Kenny Drew on piano, Gene Wright on bass and Lawrence Marable on drums.One final caveat: before making a final purchase decision I recommend that you first check out6 Classic Albums, which is a six album set of Drew's work that includes this album. The price difference is surprisingly modest considering the vast difference in the number of tracks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissappointing","review":"I purchased this with an expectation that Adidas brand stood for quality, but was dissappointed with how unsubstantive the shoe itself was.

That is the overarching strategy of this wondrous book. Multi-faceted Cuba is seen through the eyes of greatly gifted writers and photographers, each with his or her own unique relationship with and idiosyncratic take on the island. The strategy succeeds brilliantly. Paradoxes and trade-offs are subtly explored, for example, between the blessings of free education and health care versus constraints on the ability to pursue dreams. You get not only to understand but also to feel the sensuous physical beauty of the place and the strains of Cuba's love/hate relationship with the U.S.. After spending time with this book, I feel as if I had actually been there and am left with a longing to go."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cayman pet carrier - large","review":"Great!

But when we are treated with a new disc the wait hardly matters. \\"Beatlesque.\\" \\"Rundgrenesque.\\" Forget that...\\"Lloydesque.\\" Witty, literate & catchy as all get out. While this is hardly revolutionary - hence the title \\"Standing on the Shoulders of Giants\\" - maybe putting a strong honest pop record out in 1999 should be considered revolutionary. Lloyd's recorded output - both solo and with Foster & Lloyd - has quietly earned him respect among pop music fans. \\"Standing on the Shoulders...\\" should be welcomed loudly! He deserves it. So do we."},{"rating":"2","title":"Combines all known pop styles with timely, tasteful lyrics","review":"What's not to like about BillLloyd's, Standing on the Shoulders of Giants? Whether you need an infusion of power pop, hard punched up rock, or a throat-lumping ballad, this album does it all. Your first reaction may be, \\"I've heard this before.\\", but you soon realize that Lloyd can not only be inspired by a Who, Beatle, or Tom Petty feel but then musically conspire to add his own dimension and take his piece even higher. From the opening strains of the title song which reminds us from whence creativity comes, to Turn Me On Dead Man, Lloyd uses one pop hook after another to paint pretty pictures of life, love, and occassionally surreal dispair. And if that's not enough, the lineup of musicians on this record is a unique smorgasbord of who's who, and even who will be. This CD will still be in my car player at the end of the year. It's that good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pop lives. Very listenable.","review":"Artfully crafted medium power pop executed flawlessly.

It looked really cute in the picture, but when I actually received the costume, I was surprised to see how cheap it looked. Now, I certainly didn't expect a custom-made gown, but the materials and the way this garment was put together is really sub-standard. The material has little \\"pulls\\" all over both the hat and dress. The dress pattern is just cut, there are no hems and the edges look really ratty. Again, I know this is just a Halloween costume, but I would not order anything again from the company that made this costume."},{"rating":"2","title":"TOO CUTE!","review":"I am really happy with this costume!

The knife is apparently perfect according to these criteria, but something is wrong with the balance of the knife that makes it veer to the left instead of cutting straight. This make it very difficult to produce even cuts, and, more importantly, makes me always fearful of cutting my hand, as the knife is quite sharp.perhaps it's just a manufacturing defect with my knife, but I'm quite disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great!","review":"I like this much better than other stainless polish.

I purchased a FELT DEVIL TAIL separately, which my son promptly tried to pull off. I also added aDevil Costume Pitchfork, and honestly my little one had more fun with this than anything else.

I was surprised that these two could collaborate so well reminiscent of Mary Martin and Ezio Pinza), I have enjoyed repetitive listening of this track. The only downer, in my view, was \\"Over There.\\" Sad to say, Placido does not do justice to George M. Cohan.

My favorite thing about this CD is that they've included a very good Starlight song. But i still don't get WHY there are 2 aspects of love songs and 1 starlight express song! However, I give 5 stars because of the good songs and Michael Crawford."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful, warm, and emotional!!!","review":"I love this CD!!

I have heard others singing the same songs as the ones on this CD, but Michael Crawford not only sings the songs, he acts them. I also find that he is soothing to listen to. I could listen to this every day and be happy. I think it is interesting when men like to sing the songs they could not when they were in a musical including the songs that women had song. This CD starts with a song from JOSEPH AND HIS AMAZING TECHNICOLOR COAT that is excellent and goes on from there. Anyone who likes good music should enjoy this. If you like Michael Crawford, why not try Ron Raines who has two very good CDs?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent... but could be better!","review":"I love 12 songs from all 13. The exception is \\" And The Money Kept Rolling In \\" , I guess it will be much interesting if Michael sings \\" Don't Cry For Me Argentina \\" ... but that's my personal opinion only.Frankly speaking, this is an excellent album, taking into account that this was recorded in early 1990's. But compare with Michael's another recently released album featuring him live in concert, I found that his singing skills and expressions are much better in that album. I don't like the treatment in Tempo of \\" Gethsemane \\" in this album, is sort of too slow in the middle. Also the arrangment of \\" Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again \\" is not good enough.So if you are a real Michael Crawford's fans, buy both of the CD I mentioned above, if not, I recommend you rather have a go with his concert recording."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crawford Can Croon A Tune","review":"On this CD we are given thirteen delightful tracks of Weber's ingenious Broadway music. Visit the theater for Evita, Cats, Phantom of the Opera & others without leaving your comfy spot near the stereo system. Michael Crawford stands your ears to attention with his smooth and flowing timbre.The orchestrations are rich and textural but do not over compensate Crawfords voice.

Teresi's understanding of mathematics and science is, despite apparent credentials, fatally shallow and distorted. His willingness to concoct historically insupportable myths that are pleasing to his political sensibilities is obvious on every page. His eagerness to insinuate himself into the good graces of the supposed educators who incessantly preach the virtues of \\"multiculturalism\\" and the vices of \\"eurocentrism\\" is palpable and pervasive. The book is, in short, a stew of junk science and fake history. But in these peculiar times, it will probably sell very briskly to certain people who mean well but think badly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expectations Unfulfilled","review":"Lost Discoveries : The Ancient Roots of Modern Science--from the Babylonians to the Maya by Dick Teresi is a book that probably shouldn't have been written. I just don't have a lot of good things to say about it. Based on the premise I had high expectations that the book would investigate the technologies of ancient civilizations for things that we, today, don't understand or can't duplicate. I thought I'd get an examination into the pyramids, Mayan building techniques, and perhaps Pacific Island navigation methods. What I got instead was a lot of unsubstantiated speculation and loosely strung hypothesis. Teresi also filled his book with indigenous mythology cribbed right from Joseph Campbell's mythology books. Unfortunately I read Campbell's library and it's much more interesting in the unabridged version.The worst thing I can say about a nonfiction book is that I didn't learn anything new from it. That's the truth of this volume.- CV Rick, May 2008"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost interest","review":"Losing interest is the risk one is running by reading through Dick Teresi's Lost Discoveries.A long review of lost civilizations advances in the field of chemistry, cosmology, physics and other scientific endeavors, mister Teresi has not been able to \\"strorytell\\" these discoveries and make his book a page turner.We end up with a long thread of commonality that are not linked together. I ended up glancing at the last chapter and putting the book away before ending it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost Opportunities","review":"The author had an opportunity to present achievements of non-western civilizations and missed it. The book is full of inaccuracies. For example on page 44 the author confuses Ahmes papyrus (also known as the Rhind Mathematical Papyrus) with the Mathematical Leather Roll. If you do not already know the subject, you may end up with incorrect information. It is best to avoid this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing book that is sure to be a classic","review":"...I ran out and bought this book and couldn't stop reading it. It is amazing, revelatory, important, gracefully written and often extremely witty. After reading this book you'll be able to impress your friends by doing ancient Egyptian math--even if you're not particularly mathematical. Lost Discoveries is one of those rare books: a \\"big\\" book that deserves to be a classic and a part of everyone's liberal education. Teresi is a generous and even-handed writer, never ponderous or dogmatic, and he makes a convincing argument that up until now we've been missing half our intellectual heritage--and a rich one at that. The ancient Greeks did not have a monopoly on intelligent thought; and it is inspiring and deeply moving to learn how much we owe to Sumerian, ancient Egyptian, Chinese, Indian, and mesoAmerican geniuses. Everyone intelligent person should read this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Readers beware","review":"It is difficult to know which is more offensive: Teresi's ego or his obscene ignorance of scientific history. If you share Teresi's mindset (ignore uncomfortable truths if they conflict with your own warped, pseudoscientific agenda) then you will eat up this stuff for lunch. But for anyone with a rational bone in their body the only reasonable advice is to avoid this book like the plague."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really gave it a shot","review":"I really did try to read this entire book. The subject is certainly interesting. But I just couldn't do it. With no expertise in the history of science, I was probably a bit too gullible. That got me through the first 150 pages. But then I got tired of forcing myself to read it, read a few good books, came back, and realized that I really didn't like the author's voice - his opining regarding current views, culture, science, etc. Then I read the reviews here, and that did it. It's hard to know whether Teresi or the folks who have written critical reviews are right, but either way, if you can't trust the accuracy of what Teresi has written (and can't stand the perspective from which he writes), why would you read this book?I wouldn't waste my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Written and Full of Inaccuracies","review":"I bought this book because I liked its premise. However, I was thoroughly disappointed before I could even finish the first chapter. The book is filled with repetitious statements on the one hand and inconsistancies on the other. If you can get over the poor writing style, you will come up against the flagrant factual errors. For example, Teresi denegrates the Greeks for thinking the world is flat. Huh? Most of the greatest Greek philosophers, including Pythagoras and Ptolemy, thought Earth was a sphere. Aristotle even used the evidence that Earth casts a round shadow on the moon during an eclipse to support this idea.This was just one of many factual errors that popped out at me while I tried to read this poorly executed book. As an archaeologist myself, I couldn't agree more that non-Westerners have made great contributions to science.

They are tender and very tasty. The key for me is just how tender they are. I have tried every other brand of canned asparagus and have found that the rest of them all contain at least one stalk that is too tough to eat and has to be tossed, even in the tall cans of Del Monte. These in the 12-oz. can are perfect. I have never had to throw away even one piece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Motivation for Entrepreneurs","review":"Nancy Koehn's Brand New inspires the entrepreneur in us all. Her book gives readers a greater appreciation for the risk and rewards of entrepreneurship, and an admiration for those who made their enthusiasm for a product or idea work to their advantage.The history and environment surrounding the advent of each of the entrepreneurs is especially enlightening, spotlighting how each person was able to see current trends and how they could capitalize upon them.Though sometimes lengthy and repetitive, the book is an overall good read for anyone interested in business, marketing, strategy or history.

Prohibition doesn't work, we should've learned from our history with alcohol, which by the way kills more every year and ruins more lives than all the other drugs put togther.\\"Vices are those acts by which a man harms himself or his property. Crimes are those acts by which one man harms the person and/or property of another. Vices are simply the errors which a man makes in his search after his own happiness. Unlike crimes, they imply no malice toward others, and no interference with their persons or property.... Unless this clear distinction between vices and crimes be made and recognized by the laws, there can be on earth no such thing as individual right, liberty, or property....\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"An unbiased onlooker.","review":"For those of you looking for a documentary in the most common senese of the word, I suggest you look elsewhere This documentary is slanted as pro-Drugs. Watching the first 20 minutes alone should tell you that many times. Please consider for the sake of your time that if we spend money trying to stop people from hurting themselves with drugs its quite possible we don't want to control them, but simply we don't want them to be controlled."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute garbage","review":"Well, this filmmaker states at the beginning that he has a bias. This movie is full of half truths and blatant biases. A summary of the movie \\" the evil white businessmen and the military industrial complex are oppressing the poor minorities and liberals, also can you please legalize pot because alcohol is bad.\\" Anyway, the movie is extremely biased and not very informative."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loser justifies drug use","review":"Ok, maybe this is too blunt, and maybe you'll learn some interesting \\"facts\\", but it's hard to stomach the incessant whining from a pothead who just can't believe his marijuana is illegal. His argument of choice is to rely on that familiar moral relativist crutch by pointing to the ills of legal drugs like alcohol and prescription drugs. Boring. And undermines his credibility when trying to figure out which of the other arguments are factual or not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Informative","review":"The propaganda statements and/or slogans regarding highly volatile issues of great public concern today, such as the war on drugs, are often semantically designed to promote a point of view on the basis of their emotional impact rather than logic. While this is certainly a valuable tool for the attitudinal manipulation of the less enlightened masses, who will eagerly parrot these messages as being representative of authoritative wisdom, they are often, in fact, nothing more than a simplistic panacean smoke screen that serves to obviate a realistic examination of the complex issues involved, by fostering unreasoned opinion. This film is highly recommended to anyone wanting to gain a realistic understanding of the drug war in America."},{"rating":"2","title":"Open your eyes!","review":"This is a eye opener which everyone needs to watch!

You will be amazed by the facts!SPREAD THE WORD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Journalism","review":"I had hoped to find interesting dialog about drugs in America, but what I found was a poorly supported report on how drugs are illegal due to a conspiracy. There are many questionable things about drug policy in America, including why some are legal and some are not. This movie doesn't support any claims it makes and only tries to capitalize on peoples desire to legalize drugs.There are many good reasons to decriminalize or legalize certain (perhaps all?) drugs, but this film fails to bring any credible or supported information forward to help people understand better what is going on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enough","review":"More racist propaganda of how the government is keeping the minority communities well medicated and incarcerated due to illegal substances. I would agree that the criminalization of drug use should be reviewed on a case per case basis. However, the allegations of race completely take the credibility out of the film very early on."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT","review":"I am 24 years old and I knew that there was no coincidence that all my older black male cousins, uncles, father and brothers were all drug dealers in the late 80s, making so much money; I knew it had to be part of a scheme. They generate trillions of dollars and justify this exploitation by deeming them all criminals. You criminalize them all, creating an image of the ultimate evil inside the minds of the \\"ideal American\\".The American Drug War: The Last White Hope, was an excellent documentary that exposed the truth about how drugs and the prison system are used to exploit an entire people.It comes to no surprise that our government is corrupt and could give two f#$%s about the American people. Pure education! Loved it! Thank you for not being afraid to investigate and present us with the truth! Much Respect.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Three solid hours of information.","review":"If there is any logical criticism for this documentary, it won't be for lack of effort or research, lack of relevant individuals interviewed, or narrowness of scope. It'll be because it's quite long, and the amount of information included is daunting, to say the least.The range of views from individuals interviewed is unabashedly wide; they range from a jail warden and a former drug czar, to a former drug kingpin and Tommy Chong. The interviews account for much of the program's length.The information herein is thoroughly indicting of the U.S.' present situation, to say the least, and can ideally aid in a large mentality change as the baby boomers move to old age and their children enter politics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Fantastic!","review":"Loved Kevin Booth and the film! I did'nt realize it was his film until I started to recognize his voice! Way to articulate your talents and continue on the tradition of spreading the truth!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a detailed, informative, and interesting documentary","review":"This movie is a very interesting and thoughtful look at the American drug war. The film maker makes his statement very effectively with a combination of personal stories and interviews. He also incorporates information from books and news archives. The documentary includes interviews with a very wide range of people who have been affected by drugs and the drug war. I bought it thinking it looked interesting but I got much more than I expected. It is the best documentary I have seen in years. Too often there is so much \\"fluff\\" in films I feel that I have wasted my time on them. This movie is almost 2 hours long and I was never bored and only found one very short scene to be unnecessary (Joe Rogan smoking marijuana- didn't take away from it but didn't add anything). I actually wondered how it covered so much in only 2 hours. I will warn potential that there are some controversial opinions expressed and some very graphic and unpleasant scenes."},{"rating":"2","title":"American Drug War","review":"I'm a high school teacher in a low income school district in Southern California and the very Orange County Judge that was featured in the movie is the coordinator of \\"Peer Court\\" at the school I teach. Great movie, extremely poignant, a must see for all Americans."},{"rating":"2","title":"So True!","review":"Very good look at the issues of drug use in our country. I am not condoning drug use, but putting drug addicts in jail is not going to stop drug use. We're putting money into jails instead of treatment centers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Revealing look at relationship between government and drugs","review":"American Drug War shows ways the various ways the government has chosen to hold back the legalization of drugs and the consequences of it. It effectively compares countries who have legalized drugs such as the Netherlands to the U.S. Some of the guests in this documentary were quite credible including CIA agents, a Californian judge, and some other former government officials. This made it so much better because anyone can make up a conspiracy theory, and I actually think a decent amount of filmmakers get following conspiracy theories that only have a grain of truth. American Drug War, however, covers several areas relating drug legislation in the U.S. from a more seemingly unbiased and believable standpoint."},{"rating":"2","title":"One my favs for Years","review":"This albums always delivers when I pop in it - wherever.

He uses harmonic/melodic analysis as one would use in dissecting W.A. Mozart, et al, in theory class. This is an interesting and insightful approach that sometimes gets a bit too clever, given the subject matter. The author demonstrates genuine admiration for the Beatles as composers/poets/performers, but occasionally becomes condescending, perhaps a product of his academic background. On the other hand, he seems to be very precise regarding who played what on which track--that's interesting for a musician at any level. All in all, an engrossing work.

Handle is easy to grip, even for large hands. Does exactly what it is supposed to do at an excellent price. I have pounded many dozens of chicken breasts and steaks with this. Very comfortable and effective.The bad: The weight has two parts, an inner weight surrounded by the outer stainless steel casing. The two do not come apart. When washed upright, then turned over to dry, rusty water drips from the seam between the weight and casing. Obviously, the inner weight is not stainless steel. And also obviously, meat juice can enter this space. Because of this I wash it in the dishwasher then boil it to be sure it is thoroughly clean.Notes: I have used this pounder for about six months. I would buy it again and recommend it. However, I would also strongly recommend the wash and boil routine after every use to be sure it is clean and sanitized."},{"rating":"2","title":"Supper product","review":"This scrubber is worth its weight in gold, I love it.

Firstly, what was this?! It could not rightly be classified as a documentary or a movie. The piece begins with a clip about a woman upset with her ex-husband for being in an interracial relationship. Then it flips to random people on the street to get their opinion of the clip. And that is how the entire piece went; a constant series of fights between the couple, followed by on-the-street commentary. My second problem with the piece was the one-dimensionality of the female character. She was always angry and upset. No one is ever that one dimensional.

Perhaps due to an under-appreciation of a drama-less male or their own negative relationship experiences, some women look for the worse and expect the even less from the men they are interested in. This phenomena is often not discussed in popular culture but it is among men. Fact is, the emotional and psychic toll related to this is a great burden for many men. This film opens the social door, so to speak, for men & women to talk about \\"how\\" we hurt each other intentionally and unintentionally.It's an indie film that's low budget but I respect the filmmaker for trudging through all the hurdles necessary to make this voicing come to fruition.

Chan makes a powerful argument in defense of Chinese MArxism, and in theoretical/general terms, and I for one found his critiques of sinologists very strong.

But the worst part is even with maximum tension applied, if you put a little bit of pressure on the gate, the whole thing slides back and forth.

Plus, its dish washer safe. We really like it!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"You'd better have big cherries","review":"I used this on fabulous-tasting but small (probably 1/2 inch in diameter) cherries picked from a neighbor's cherry tree with dismal results. But, when I used it on larger cherries purchased from the grocery store, it was fabulous. So, if you're buying big cherries, this thing is great. If you're going to use it on small cherries, save your money. I just wish the description made it clear that this was for bigger cherries because it's a dud for the smaller ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"So far, so good","review":"I ordered this to replace an old-fashioned model I inherited from my mom. Dishwasher safe is definitely a plus! I don't need to pit dozens of cherries at a time, so I can't say how it does after several uses in a row. For my needs, though, it works great!I pit cherries for my kids to eat, and this pitter makes it is simple and efficient. I have not found any pits at all in the cherries I have worked with. It's still a little messy, even with the splash guard, but I don't know what else OXO could do to completely eliminate all juice spills. For the price, it's great. I like the compact size and the fact that it is dishwasher safe.The quality is not amazing, but it is definitely good for the money. It might not last a lifetime, but it does the job for our family!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Does the job","review":"I have only used it once, but it did a bang up job. seems pretty well made. would buy again if needed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Darn fine cherry pitter","review":"I bought this so we could give our son cherries without the whole de-pitting process becoming a mess and annoying. It works fabulously. The pit is cleanly pushed out with little mess.

Perhaps 1 out of 10 cherries may not be pitted if you don't place the cherry just so. Otherwise, it punches out a pretty clean pit.9/10/08Had even more success by putting the cherry in place stem side down (with stem intact.Also doubles as an olive pitter!See my youtube video demonstrating the pitter. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huRn9TWcUUU"},{"rating":"2","title":"pitter","review":"Item came quickly, no problem w/seller.

Apesar de constar na embalagem que pode ser utilizado em azeitonas, ele no executa bem o servio. Só consegue extrair o caroo das azeitonas pequenas e mesmo assim na maioria das vezes elas ficam todas esmigalhadas.

I pitted some olives and it took quite a bit of strength to work it. The olives were not all that hard."},{"rating":"1","title":"This thing sucks for olives","review":"I cannot believe people gave it 5 stars.It really is aweful for olives. Since there's no leverage it very hard to press the pit out, and once the pit releases it closes very fast. Pinched my thumb. :(I wish they sold something like this: [...].It's what my parents had when i was a kid and it worked well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work for me","review":"This didn't work for me. After pitting less than 20 cherries, about 40% of the cherry pits didn't get pitted. Also, on the last cherry, the pit got stuck in the hole and no matter what I did, the pit would NOT come out. I had to return it and even they could not get it out (I bought it at a local store). They need to improve the design and make a bigger whole.I got this product after returning the \\"Cherry Chomper\\" which didn't work very well either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"In cherry season this is a great product. It is so simple to use and I do dozens of cherries in a short period of time, for use in pies or as I often do for my juicer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very annoyed","review":"I had this for a while and after trying to modify it to get it to actually work, I gave up and bought the KitchenAid version. This pitter seems nice but works only 50% of the time simply because the shaft is about 1/2 and inch too short. It does not clear the hole for the pit and so half the time the pit is left still connected to the cherry.Very annoying, otherwise it seems like a nice product, but because the shaft is just a bit to sort it does not work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much effort","review":"I can see this working for someone who is pitting cherries to create a dish with. But if you're simply pitting them to pop them in your mouth and chew you're better off just spitting out the pit. It's just too much work and one and a time pitting just isn't worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"semi-pitter","review":"Perhaps, the sour cherries were too small for the pitter, but very few attempts resulted in a clean \\"pitting\\". The pit was usually still attached to the cherry and had to be removed by hand. After placing cherry in pitter, you press the plunger, remove semi-pitted cherry, remove pit, and place pit and cherry in respective containers. The procedure is a bit more compex (and messy) than I envisioned. Next time, I will use a knife for a few pounds to see if the Oxo is worth the trouble. The item is well made and comfortable to use but just didn't work for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works just right","review":"The Good Grips Cherry Pitter works perfectly--exactly as advertised, cherry by cherry.

I was going to get one that does multiple cherries until I read some of the reviews. Since he doesn't pit commercial quantities, this sounded like a much better choice than the others where you have to check after for missed pits. Here you know exactly where you stand--it worked or it didn't. And 98% (I made that number up!) of the time it works."},{"rating":"2","title":"'Works like a charm!","review":"Love the little splash guard. This cherry pitter works great. Never had one before but am very happy with this purchase. Would never had thought of trying to pit enough cherries by hand to make a pie - now, wouldn't think twice about it. Great product! Highly recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work for me either","review":"I bought this pitter with high hopes - it looked like OXO had finally solved the one big gripe i had with all hand held cherry pitters of the past: a splatter shield! Genius.The problem: the pitter itself doesn't work. The shield successfully catches all splatter, but about 60% (!!!) of all pits stayed inside the cherry, while the hole went all the way through the fruit. This is outright dangerous when you're pitting cherries for young children."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this product!","review":"I should say that I love OXO products and I love little kitchen gadgets, even ones that only have one use! I also love fresh cherries in the summer time. I don't mind eating around the pits but my young boys (8 and 6) haven't been able to master that art so they hated eating cherries. This is a great pitter, simple enough for them to use, doesn't make too much of a mess. Yes, your sink will still look like a crime scene -- just put the strainer in the drain and you can rinse it out and get all the pits into the strainer to dump. But your clothes will stay clean and I can do a whole bag of cherries in a relatively short amount of time and the soft handle keeps my hand from ever hurting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"I purchased this after my last pitter broke. I bought it from Pampered Chef, but unfortunately, it didn't even last a year. This one works (and lasts) way better, not to mention that it's not terribly expensive. I find this item easy to clean, which is a plus, considering how sticky cherry juice can be. It also creates less of a mess than my old pitter, due to the plastic shield. I highly recommend!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Works great -- for a while","review":"The Oxo cherry pitter is beautifully designed, but poorly engineered. The hinge is made of plastic and mine broke after a few months of light, occasional use. I bought this to replace a less elegant cast aluminum pitter that couldn't go in the dishwasher. I'm glad I kept the metal model. The Oxo pitter's beauty is only skin deep."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for smaller amounts of cherries","review":"This Cherry pitter works very nice except for the occasional stuck pit that does not get seperated from the cherry. The splash gard works well but you still want to hold it down into the sink. The grip feels very nice in the hand. Easy to wash out. Would definetly buy again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Great!","review":"This thing works great! It's definately worth the money and is reasonably easy to use. Our 4-1/2 year old loves using it and only misses the pit once in a while."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great","review":"This works MUCH better than I was expecting it to work. There's a certain Charles-Bronson-ish sense of executing each cherry. I found that cherries I bought would go bad because I'd get tired of eating around the pit of each cherry. I bought this locally although it was $0.11 more (plus tax)... I wanted semi-instant gratification.Looking forward to baking a cherry tart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pit your cherries without the mess","review":"I ruined a t-shirt last year slicing and then pitting my sour cherries with a knife. The juice sprays all over the place and it stains permanently! With this OXO pitter, the pit comes right out nice and clean, with minimal juice loss. There is still some splattering of the juice, but much less. I recommend this if you have lots of cherries to pit!One note -- after reading another review here by \\"goldfinch\\", you should first try a paper clip to poke down into the stem hole and pull up the seed. It might work well for you, and save you a few bucks. :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the Money","review":"The Oxo Good Grips Cherry Pitter is a very good and handy device. Before I just used by hands and sometimes I lost some of the meaty part of the cherry. With the pitter, there is one hole made, the seed is removed and the cherries look much better, not like they have been squeezed. I enjoyed using my pitter and it is well worth it's money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does EXACTLY What It's Supposed To Do","review":"If all you do is gobble cherries from a bowl, then this might seem like a luxury. But if you bake, can or juice cherries, then this is an essential kitchen tool. It works fast, effortlessly and does exactly what it's supposed to do.You put the cherry in the holder, squeeze the handle and the pit drops out the bottem. Voila!For a few very soft cherries, the pit didn't fall out. Since the cherry was split, it just took a second to pull the pit out - much less time than it would have taken to cut out. This only happened a few times. Absolutely all the normally ripe cherries got pitted without a hitch.Buyng something that does exactly what it's supposed to do. What a novel concept! Wish it happened more often."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very useful tool","review":"This tool is very handy. The cherry juice tends to go everywhere so the little clear plastic tube placed below helps, however, be sure to do this over a trash can. The cherries I bought were enormous and some of the seeds got stick and had to be popped out of the pitter by hand because they were too large to fit through the device. Most worked very well and I think I just had some unusually big cherries."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Kitchen Gadget!","review":"I am so happy I bought this. True, I will only use it for a short time in the summer, but I love it! It works well, and the juice doesnt splatter. The pit does \\"shoot\\" out, so becareful where you aim it :) I love it and I love cherries even more now. I never liked dealing with pits while they are in the cherry. Plus, I didnt want to make a cherry pie because of how long it would take to pit the cherries. I now want to bake a cherry pie just to play with this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic visuals","review":"Darevevils of the sky, as presented by this Nova program, has beautiful and exciting visuals of aerial aerobatics.

She loves crafts and anything that has a cat on it. We decorated it the other night together and it was a very fun project for both of us. Only a couple of issues: the glitter glue in one of the tubes was dried out. She had gotten other crafts with glitter glue so we used some from them, so no big deal. And, the markers were useless. The paint already on the door hanger made the markers runny and smear. We ended up wiping all the marker off and going with extra glitter glue. All in all, not a bad project kit and my daughter loves it, and that is what counts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete garbage.","review":"Doesn't work on the PS2 like they said it would.

A woman who is escaping the French Revolution runs to her wealthy cousin at Nethergate. The cousin, Rosaleen, is jealous of her and due to the information given by her maid Pratt, she marries her off to an abusive returned soldier. The story follows her to an inn, through murder, into the service of a girls school, and back to Nethergate where Pratt now lives as a painful reminder of her past. The story is facinating in the way that Pulp Fiction is. You really don't know where it is going at first but you can't put it down. I would have given it 5 stars, but Norah Lofts always seems to ruin her own books in the last couple of pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best CD ever recorded","review":"This is the best cd I have ever heard.

Nothing compares to this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"What could be said?","review":"I think that this is probably one of the greatest albums to come out of the 90's. In a time of women taking a larger role on the music industry, Tori Amos' Little Earthquakes gives a woman's insights to so many problems in her past. Gritty, powerful, raw...such emotion from such a small body. Buy it. No, really...get off the computer, get to the store, buy the cd. It's that simple, people. Trust me."},{"rating":"2","title":"From thigh-high boots& 10ft hair to a refreshing masterpiece","review":"This is fabulous! A million times better than Y Kant Tori Read! The begginings of Tori's claim to fame, although I don't think Tori is obsessed with fame. I am a long time Tori fan, and this is one of her must have CD's; it's classic! She washes and hangs her dirty laundry in public! She saves my life again & again. Whether you are dealing with social issues, young adulthood, religion, trauma, or you name it, you can identify with Tori. Her strength is magnificent, her voice stunning, and her work tickling the ivories is fanominal. You'll fall in love with this CD, if you have any good sense what so ever. Silent all these years & Winter are two of my personal favorites on the Cd. Check them out on music video as well. This is like a diary. A down to earth, honest, extreme roller-coaster kind of diary."},{"rating":"2","title":"I cry my eyes out","review":"If there ever was a CD that cut to the quick, it has to be this one. I will not critique every song (they're all beautiful and heartbreaking) but one song almost seems written just for me. \\"Winter\\" takes me back to my childhood so quickly and so poignantly I can barely listen to it. I grew up in the midwest with snowy winters, I had a white horse I loved beyond belief, I used to put on my dad's gloves, and I know the pain of growing older as a woman. Every word speaks to everything I feel - all I can say is that every time I listen to that song, I cry my eyes out. A catharsis perhaps that I need. Tori Amos is a true jewel - a poet and a musician. Love her!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Tori Classic.","review":"This is a wonderful CD.Tori Amos did a great job on this CD. She sings and writes beautiful lyrics. This is great from start to end. This is a fantastic debut by a female artist. There is no other words to say how much I love her music.Some of the the stand-out songs are Silent All These Years, Precious Things, Little Earthquakes, Me And A Gun and Winter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Emotional scars and sexual politics","review":"Tori Amos' songs are very lyric-heavy, which tends to overpower the presence of her music. While perhaps cathartic for the artist dealing with a rape, lyrics like \\"I wanna smash the faces of those... Christian boys. So you can make me come--that doesn't make you Jesus\\" make it somewhat overbearing, or at least an isolating experience for fifty percent of her potential audience. While it's admirable to know oneself, her emotional examination constantly flirts with self-pity.This album was released after the rise to underground popularity of Ani DiFranco and the cult of girl power. Amos is heavily influenced by the pseudo-movement but doesn't break any new ground."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whine whine whine.....","review":"I don't understand what all the appeal is about this woman. I don't see any \\"depth\\" to her lyrics except whining about the past. Now, if this woman were to write songs about >overcoming< the past and moving on and becoming a whole person again, I might be a little more impressed, but \\"Little Earthquakes\\" seems to be filled with self-pity and angst. I guess that appeals to other people who like the same. \\"I've been looking for a saviour beneath these dirty sheets\\".... well, duh, did she find one?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment, to say the least","review":"Can we all say \\"no talent Kate-Bush ripoff\\" kiddies?

I thought that Tori's piano playing waz mediocre, and her singing was pretty good but a little too \\"I'm sweet and perfect\\" for me. Overall it wasn't bad, but since I had heard so much about her and how she was such a goddess, it was just completely overhyped for me. Another thing that irritates me is how she puts a nice picture of herself on the cover of every album of hers! She's playing off her physical beauty which just seems a little cheap, not that other ppl dont do that, and not that its wrong. But for a woman who is supposed to be \\"super-cool\\" and a good role model and have so much pain and sorrow to show the world, I think she could come up with something a little more creative. I wonder if she were ... ugly would she still put herself on the cover of all her albums?"},{"rating":"1","title":"This SUX","review":"I bought this album yesterday because of all the good reviews and i must say it is not wat i expected.

I admit she has talent but its just not something that i like or that id recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"An 8 On The Richter Scale!","review":"'Little Earthquakes' is an often powerful, and deeply moving album filled with quirks and eccentric lyrics. \\"Winter\\" is absolutley breathtaking. \\"Crucify\\", \\"Girl\\", and \\"Silent All These Years\\" also justify Amos' ability as a solo-artist. The title-track is impressive; and \\"Me and a Gun\\" is a stand-out! However, \\"Happy Phantom\\" and \\"Leather\\" are really too silly to appreciate. All in all this album is very good; and worth purchasing and listening to. :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Always something new","review":"Often when listening to popular music, after hearing a song more than 25 times, you get sick of it, and uninterested. But with Tori Amos, it's a different story. You can listen to her music over and over again, and always hear something new. One of her popular songs, Silent All These Years, is always greeted with a kind ear, and always listened to. The album is deserving of far more than what can be said of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow...still isn't out of my CD player","review":"Before I got into Tori Amos I remember looking at the back of this CD in the store. The titles of most of the songs didn't seem too facinating. But when I read some lyrics online and when I got the CD-I was amazed. I listen to it everyday and every song on there is truely great. This album is a masterpiece and I do not think it is over rated like someone who has reviewed before me. Her lyrics are sometimes metaphorical(NOTHING bad about that)but always honest and something someone can relate too. I totally recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Precious CD","review":"This album is simply put \\"amazing.\\" It's the first of Tori Amos' fine work that I have heard and I've been an avid listener of her work ever since. The album starts off with one of her first singles \\"Crucify.\\" Beautifully haunting and honest, I think that's one of her finest songs to date. Other highlights on the CD include \\"Silent All These Years,\\" \\"Precious Things,\\" \\"Winter,\\" & \\"Tear In Your Hand.\\" The entire cd is quite good, these are just a few of the songs that I find exceptionally good. The album ends with \\"Me & a Gun,\\" followed by \\"Litte Earthquakes,\\" possibly the strongest emotional songs on the album, I can hear and feel the emotion in Tori's voice. Tori sings \\"Me & a Gun\\" without the accompaniment of her piano, which is allegedly recounting a very scarring and emotional past experience.. Highly recommended for any fans of real music... or lost souls searching for a little light in their music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never, ever gets old...","review":"This album should be put in a box with a copy of \\"Are You There God?

Yes, comrades, a hack. She is simply a talentless Britney Spears knockoff. All of her songs have computerized vocals and lame dance beats, making it blatantly obvious that she is desperate to be on MTV. Sorry hun but you'll NEVER be good enough to make it on MTV.

Lyricially, it taps into emotions in ways that music never has before."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Emotional Rollercoaster","review":"LITTLE EARTHQUAKES is a very compelling album by Tori Amos. The songs deal with real issues such as rape to name one, in such raw emotion its uncovered. This was her debut, and a fan favorite among many. She masterfully uses the piano and her voice to get her message across. \\"Crucify\\" is an excellent song, and one of her best EP's (well there's only one other!), on which there is a cover of the NIRVANA hit \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\". However my favorite song here is \\"Precious Things\\", if you haven't heard her sing this live (or heard her live at all), rush out and buy her 1999 album TO VENUS AND BACK which is a double album, first is a studio and second is a live album. \\"Little Earthquakes\\" is the tragic song about rape, chills to the bone. Overall a must have for anyone who appreciates good, creative, original, music."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST IN ANYONE'S CD COLLECTION!","review":"There are no words ro describe Tori's debut CD. She puts herself in a category all her own, up on a pedestal. \\"Excuse me, Can I be you for awhile?\\" She asks in \\"Silent All These Years.\\" Personally, that is my favorite song on the CD. However, every song is amazing. Tori is a captivating singer. This CD is what I use to wind down and relax. It is amazing, and worth every cent of your money. I warn you, Tori is addictive, and it will be very difficult to own only one of her CDs. I also love \\"Under the Pink.\\" Any CD of hers is wonderful."},{"rating":"2","title":"bittersweet sugar","review":"Tori's this album is so complicated.

She is a gifted and beautiful fairy-spirit walking on this earth amoungst we mere mortals. Are we worthy? No, but to hell with worthiness. Little Earthquakes is the best album ever created. It is the one and only album I own where I love every single song. It was the first album that made me care about the lyrics because they are unlike anything else out there. I cannot stand bubble-gum lyrics. Give me lyrics that move me and disturb me and uplift me. She is so very open and while I know she is human, she seems otherworldly. What a very special, talented and wonderful being she is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still the best Tori Amos","review":"as usual, this tori amos album is chocked full of wonderful songs that are as lyrically beautiful as they are musically. my personal favorites are leather and happy phantom, but i loved all of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Little Earthquakes.","review":"Although not her best in my opinion Little Earthquakes is still a brilliant album by Tori Amos. Lyrically it is beautiful but musically even better. Her piano playing is awesome and the way she performs is even better.

The songs are relatively slower and are not as emotional as on \\"Under the Pink\\". \\"Me and a Gun\\", \\"China\\" and \\"Mother\\" are as emotional as this album gets - and nowhere on this album do you hear the anger and depression through her vocals as you would in songs like \\"Pretty Good Year\\" or \\"The Waitress\\". This album is good, but not her best - \\"Under the Pink\\" is her best - BY FAR. If you like alternative and are expecting it from this album, you'll be disappointed. \\"Under the Pink\\" and \\"From the Choirgirl Hotel\\" are the most emotional out of all of her albums, however, this album would have to be second best, just because it has somewhat powerful lyrics. If you have read this review, you already know which album to buy over this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deeply touching and soulful to the core","review":"Tori Amos is one artist that truely connects with a person on an intimate level.

I highly recommend this CD, Got the emotion,the unexpected outbursts of Tori we love... buy it, you will play it and enjoy it .."},{"rating":"2","title":"powerful lyrics, beautiful music","review":"Although, I have listened to many other Tori songs, \\"Little Earthquakes\\" was the first CD that I purshased from her. This CD is so brilliant and the lyrics are so powerful. My favorite song would have to be \\"Precious Things.\\" Another song on that CD that deserves praise is \\"Leather.\\" It's a fun song that has a catchy tune and lyrics. Even if you have nevr heard Tori before, this CD is somehing you must get. It makes you feel all different emotions. From happy to mad to upset, this CD is a winner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth Every Penny","review":"The songs are beautiful and the DVD is great!

I was really looking forward to this \\"great bargain\\". Just imagine my disappointment when opening the box yielded a plain, poorly made product. There are leather flaws that look like scuff marks over several parts on both shoes. The style is much more pedestrian and old school than the shiny picture suggests. At any price, this was a poor buy. I returned them on the same day without even trying them on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great first LP","review":"This is the first full length recording by Ann Arbor's most original punk band.

In the past we'd gotten lead pad 1 and 2 level books which have been great. She loves the Wizard of Oz so I hoped this would be a good purchase. The story cannot be read to you (like the earlier leap pads) unless you want to go word for word with the pen. My older daughter (age 9) read the story and enjoyed it, but I would have rather just gotten a Wizard of Oz book.

Excellent for a rich, flavorful spread whether savoury or sweet such as a pate or a soft cheese and fruit spread combination. The crackers are also very strong, able to stand up to a good smear of spread with ease, and have a nice crunch when you bite into them for being so thin. iGourmet ships them as shown in the picture, with two sleeves of crackers each in an individual plastic collar to prevent breakage and boxed. They arrived almost entirely intact with only 2 broken crackers which was much less breakage than I expected. I would order the cracked pepper version next time for the additional flavor which I think would compliment a mild cheese better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost Strangers is strangely moving...","review":"I found the movie surprised me. I wasn't sure what to expect really. I've only seen Matthew Macfayden in period dramas thus far. I knew he had done other work, and so this modern film was purchased to better determine his acting scope. I was pleasantly pleased. This is NOT a period film, per se. It's a modern family reunion of a large British family and about learning how similar we really all are...despite distance, breeding, etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reasonable Actors, Disappointing Script and Themes","review":"This was a very slow moving film. The background music gave the impression that something sinister was about to happen in almost every scene. The actors were reasonable, but I don't feel that the script did them any justice. The nudity scene in the first part of the film was completely unexpected and completely unnecessary. I will be returning the DVD set for a complete refund. There should be appropriate warnings when DVDs contain nudity and bad language as this one does. Why is nudity and bad language necessary in a good script. Their presence is an added indication of the poverty of this work."},{"rating":"2","title":"MEET THE FAMILY","review":"THE MOVIE WAS GREAT. WELL DONE BY ALL THE ACTORS & ACTRESSES.

If you aren't, this will very much test you.The actual Donald image goes together quite easily. When you start on the yellowish star is when you begin to realize how long it will take and how much patience you actually have. Why I say this is because each individual picture/scene is repeated constantly, but not in the same arrangement(ie. Pluto with his left ear raised only appears next to Pete once, but the individual image of Pluto w/ ear raised may be repeated 30-50 times. etc.)If you suffer from any type of color blindness deficiency, (mostly is an issue w/ red/green color blindness), then good luck. I have red/green and it is EXTREEEEEEEEEEEEEMELY slow going now that I have start on the star which blends in with A LOT of the reddish tint.It's still a great puzzle.

This story is touching, realistic, and tragic. Jonathan Jackson is superb as the troubled son, JoeBeth Williams as the controlling, choleric mother. Fans of Hayden Christensen may be surprised to discover his small but tangible role in the film. This story deals with drug abuse and it's consequences. How one teenager's innocent attempt to fit in spirals out of control. The scene where Mrs. Hanson (JB Williams) goes to lunch with some of her friends and spots her son Max (Jonathan Jackson) begging for drug money is very poignant. It opens her eyes to the fact that something is indeed wrong, and that parents need to listen to their kids.In all, touching story of a woman who tries to live through her son, destroying his dreams and nearly her entire family in the process."},{"rating":"2","title":"Costume meets the description","review":"The costume was exactly what I expected--true to size and true to the sellers description.

It is somewhat of a departure from what I've grown accustomed to from Galactic , but it still is packed with a lot of funk and soul. I can't possibly imagine how someone could send in a review that says Theryl DeClouet doesn't fit with their sound. Galactic is a modern version of old-school New Orleans funk. Theryl is more reminiscent of that than any other member.

Just imagine: from the front, the costume doesn't look so bad, but once you turn around... it's a pink bathrobe! How awesome, two pieces of clothing in one! The wig is a whole new story - only 1/3 of it actually has hair, the rest is PINK too!I still cannot wrap my head around the fact that this is the official Disney licensed costume...By the way, it looks like the other review was left by the shop that sells this junk.

It gives concise reviews of what kids needs to know, so you can check their readiness. The test taking tips are very useful for first-timers to raise scores. A very helpful warm-up for both parents and kids. Note that such a thin book doesn't do much to improve math or reading. That requires daily learning in school and study in home.

Get an extension cable instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent presentation of \\"statistics for the beginner\\"","review":"Engagingly written, with clear (and usually relevant) anecdotes, the book succeeds in the attempt to present statistics as a subject available to the amateur. I especially enjoyed the examples at the end of the book, where I could check out how well I had grasped the concepts earlier presented. So many experts barrage us with statistics that attempt to influence our viewpoints, actions, activities and votes, that it is important to be able to know whether or not the information is valid and complete. With the analysis tools provided by the author, one can more effectively decide whether or not the facts presented are valid or accurate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality product","review":"My partner bought this ring for me for our 7th anniversary. I LOVED the design of this ring, and loved wearing it because it received so many compliments!HOWEVER, it started to tarnish very quickly and after nine months, the stone had started to loosen. Last week, somewhere between home and work, the prongs bent and the stone fell out. I was very careful not to wear this ring in water, when using household chemicals, or when doing anything that might have caused damage to the ring (like gardening or moving furniture). While I recognize that this isn't exactly the Hope Diamond, I wish that the ring would have lasted longer than (almost) one year.My partner ordered a new ring for me from another company, and made sure that this time the ring was made of sterling silver NOT brass. We shall see."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous!","review":"I purchased this set for my birthday/Christmas present/stay-at-home mom who deserves a little something. It's beautiful!

Well let me tell you, I read this while I was waiting for a flight out of Chicago O'Hare and I would have to say that this novel was roughly as amusing as the random search and pat down I got to go through before boarding the plane. David Garnett is trying to be Terry Pratchett or perhaps Harry Harrison. Unfortunately writing science fiction is hard and writing funny science fiction is even harder. This book is a pointless waste of money. One of the cover blurbs on the book says that \\"A billion monkeys working for a billion years couldn't come up with this one\\" I take that as a testimony to the writing abilities of the lower primates and not as a recommendation for this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not nearly enough bikinis. Could use more planets too.","review":"I admit it. The blurb by Neil Gaiman amused me enough to buy this book. I notice in retrospect that he says nothing about the actual story.Unfortunately, you spend most of this book doubting the veracity of any plot related information you receive. Or, in fact, any world related information you receive. Everybody is an unreliable narrator except, presumably, the two PoV characters. It's annoying in the same way that the conversation with the first year philosophy student is after he's discovered the idea that all evidence comes through your senses, which may be deceived. It doesn't help that nobody keeps the same name for more than two pages.I spent .... probably the middle half of the book waiting to see if it got bad enough that I could justify putting it down. And then, the last quarter of the book, I did actually want to find out what happened so I finished it. So... that's a good thing, I guess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kill whoever wrote this book","review":"We waste so many tax dollars on things. I saw that because I got this at the public library.

DO NOT READ THIS BOOK"},{"rating":"1","title":"More like \\"Wandering Mess\\"","review":"With comparisons to Terry Pratchett and Douglas Adams, and a collection of really amusing testimonials, I was ready to really enjoy this book. I wasn't actually expecting Pratchett, Adams (or Wodehouse, or Verne - all of whom David Garnett is favourably compared to), but I was at least expecting something amusing.I kept waiting for something funny to happen.The only really good part is when Wayne Norton (or John Wayne, or Duke Wayne, or James Bogart, whichever hilarious moniker he is using that chapter) is captured by historians, who question him about ancient earth, and seem to have gotten most of their history from cowboy movies.As far as Bikini Planet, we don't even see the frikken place until about page 230.The endings are all quite disappointing, and don't wrap up half the loose ends, answer any questions, or even have A SINGLE LAUGH IN THEM!!Somehow I did finish the book, though, which is the only reason I'm giving it two stars instead of one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible. And very short on bikinis.","review":"Billing itself as campy fun, this was, instead, pure kaka. And not in a good way.It wasn't cheesy, it was simply bad.

My biggest surprise was that I actually read the thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"NEVER judge a book by its cover","review":"I happened upon this book while looking for something entertaining to send my brother in Iraq. One of the blurbs said it was similiar to Hitchhiker's. They were wrong. The plot meandered (if there was one.) There were multiple endings which just prolonged the pain. Maybe on some level this was entertaining to someone, but whatever level it was, I didn't find it. Needless to say, I didn't send this to my brother. I decided getting mortared daily was torture enough. If you're looking for funny scifi or fantasy, go with anything by Terry Prachett or go back to the original Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD","review":"Best CD I have heard in a long time.

I have to say that I'm delighted that I did. The novel had so much to chew on, yet was so fast-moving that I devoured the entire thing in one night.Some users have complained about the novel's \\"alternative\\" content, but the fact is that drug use, the transvestism, feminism, etc contribute a perfect structure to the novel's themes of transformation, surreality, and maturation. This is Alice for grownups, and I'm utterly smitten."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic book, but falls a bit short on its ending","review":"I'd love to give this book 5 stars, but the ending kills it for me. (no spoilers here, rest assured)The story is beautifully crafted; Habens is so creative with her wordplay. It's rare to find a writer with such a tight grasp on double entendre; her wordplay is as entertaining as her plotline.This might not be the best book for people who are strongly opposed to drug use, alternative lifestyles, and roleplaying parties; it takes an open mind to appreciate this novel. Being a fan of Lewis Carroll's work helps immensely; Habens' take on the classic is clever and amusing.But for me, the ending fell short. It's in keeping with the surreal tone of the story, and it does not ruin the book...but it could've been handled better. Habens did such an incredible job with the entire story, yet the last 5 pages or so feel like a cop-out...I was more than a bit disappointed. All in all, though, a fun read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very charming first novel","review":"A very charming and witty first novel, and I agree with the previous review.

If you read the book cover, it mentions Zen three times and says that the author is a longtime student of Zen. She has never had a guru or teacher and it seems that her only information has come from books she has read and her own hallucinations. I ordered this book solely because I thought it represented a person's experience with Zen Buddhism. Instead, I receive a book about a woman's psychotic break that occurred almost thirty years ago, which she interpreted as enlightenment. You could go into a mental hospital and collect journals of patients who think they are talking to God and you would have this book. If Amazon has a return policy then I shall return this book for misrepresentation."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is useless. There are better books available.","review":"I have read better books regarding the probabilities pertinent to poker. I was searching for these better books when I came across this weak book.

I advise you to look elsewhere for a book about the probabilities pertinent to winning at poker."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit misleading","review":"This book is basically concerned with limit poker and is not the best book for people looking to buff up their no-limit strategy.

Usually, the phrase \\"hold'em\\" only means no-limit, or perhaps both limit and no limit. The word \\"hold'em\\" in a book title does not mean \\"only limit hold'em\\".There is no indication, at the time of this writing, in the editors' description on Amazon that this book only pertains to limit hold'em."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to follow","review":"I bought this book because many others have given it a good rating. But once I started using it, I just kept putting off doing the exercises. I feel that the exercises are hard to follow and that hampers my enthusiasm to do them. He does not explain WHY you are doing something. For example, he'll say hold Shift+Alt and move selection. I don't know why I'm holding down Shift+Alt until later, and even then he doesn't explain things clearly. I have had other software teaching books that are so much better written than this one is; for example the Lynda Weinman, Hands On Training series. Also, who wants to wade through tons of information to get to the point? I want to know what something does and how to do it. Then I take that information and apply it to my own projects.

Sturdy but light-weight and very secure. I have arthritis in my fingers but could open both top and front (with some effort originally). They do loosen up considerably after they're opened and closed a dozen times or so. I couldn't put anything together from a picture, but that's usually the way instructions come these days, and I believe this carrier is an Italian make. Fortunately, my husband is good at that; he thought the handle was actually better put in opposite to the instructions - I couldn't say. Best of all, it saved us from fighting with two of our cats who had both of us bleeding everytime we tried to put them in a cage. We just drop them in the top and close - couldn't be easier. The staff and Vets say they love these carriers -it makes their lives easier too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cat Carrier","review":"Certainly looks good, however it came without assembly instructions and lots of small parts.

They are arranged so that you won't be struggling to find another E or A or whatever letter you need. Smart arrangements over the blocks6.

It's a metaphor for how the writer felt increasingly out of place in the typical Christian setting; it foreshadows the later move away from that world. Listen to it again with this in mind, and you'll catch the brilliance of the lyrics and Bible references. Hope the members of King's X come back to at least some of what they've rejected.Like many other reviewers here have said, this was definitely not my favorite KX release when I first heard it.

These are the sources for the compilation offered here.This CD has earned harsh reviews here for being a compilation, but it's not marketed as anything else. I, too, wish that there was new material.

I noticed later as they got bigger that there was one that looked odd not like a triop, it kinda looked like a shrimp so I looked it up on the internet and it was indeed a shrimp, a fairy shrimp so that night I named them. Yesterday I only had 3 creatures so I named the big triop Tubbie and the other Trixie and the fairy shrimp Poppi. Poppi was my favorite.

There is no information about water temperature, light exposure, etc. that is critical for hatching triops successfully.In the end, only 2 triops hatched from the whole egg packet, which is severely disappointing considering many triops often don't live past the first week.

We have placed them in the window sill as instructed and also near (but not directly under) a fluorescent light. Nothing. I've tried contacting the company with no response. What a rip-off.

It is very easy to push and turns corners well. I can see this being a staple in her imagination/doll play for many years to come.

The lyrics aren't very deep or meaningful. Usually they are ambiguous and don't make much sense at all. The music isn't quite industrial, but it's not normal \\"hard rock\\" either. I suppose if you like horrible bands like Korn you should give this a listen.After all of this griping, however, there is one gem on the album. Well, sort of. The song Release It is pretty good as it has a fast tempo, though the lyrics, again, are simple and ambiguous and without much meaning. Unfortunately, the version on the album is a bit lacking, but their Release It EP contains a version (the Empirion Mix) that anyone who likes fast-paced Cubanate-style industrial should enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"absolutely horrible","review":"this is the most horribly written album I ever heard. It's actually embarresing to listen too. Sure the music itself is good, nothing great, but don't expect to be itellectually stimulated by the lyrics. When I was 10 I saw the first Ninja Turtles movie, I loved it. I just watched it for the second time, a couple of days ago, I can't believed I actually liked that movie. I'd rather get attached by 700 pigmy elephants, than watch it again, I think it actually made me dumber. This was the same feeling I got listening to this Hate Dept album. They use the word \\"cool\\" way too much, it's like reliving the 80's.

Reading this book greatly enhanced my understanding of the Federal Style. \\"Federal Style Patterns\\" is a very well written, beautifully illustrated resource for interior architectural trim and millwork. They even supply all their drawings in CADD so that architects, builders, craftsmen and homeowners can utilize the detailed drawings for their own projects.

Previously recorded albums, Another Day at School and Recess, are both very good but this album, this album shows not only how talented the trio is but also shows just how they can shine individually.

This is a must have album and guaranteed not to leave your CD player!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"The Velmas on their \\"Station\\" cd rip off every late 80's early 90's guitar band.

Be careful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading","review":"The earrings are very attractive but there are a few gray areas regarding what the earrings are composed of.The editorial review states that they are made of 14k and are lightweight. For the size of the earrings, if they were solid gold, they would be heavier so they must be plated, and this is never mentioned. What is the base metal? Also the product spec's state that they are made of 18k gold.So which is it, 18k of 14k, are they solid or plated? $95.00 isn't expensive or cheap but I guess I expected a little more than I should have, I suppose."},{"rating":"2","title":"Basketball 2003 style","review":"This game got me through my summer job. In this game, you can choose to be an old school team or a new generation team.

You can pick what type of basketball court you want to play on according to the city. They even have a section where you can be Nelly or one of the St. Lunatics. I love the way the controller vibrates everytime you make a dunk. When you play this game you really feel like you are playing on a basketball court because you get all into the game and feel very competitive. You sart talking junk to the other players, run around trying to steal the ball from them, and then find yourself jumping up and down when you win your game or make a really nasty shot. The graphics are good on this game also."},{"rating":"2","title":"best basketball game ever!!!!!!!","review":"the game is the best. It got street legends like strech, bonifide, and biggielittle. It also has bill walton, magic Johnson and even Larry Bird.

You can be the oop, you can do off the heezay which means bounce the ball off the oponents head, you can pass the ball off the backboard or off your knee, or foot! There are so many new dunks, and moves you wont be able to ever do them all. If you have the first NBA Street and you thought it was the best... get ready for a big surprise cause thats what I thought and this game was like 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 times better. In this game you can also be Nelly and the St. Lunitics as a team-the people who did the song Air Force Ones-.

The sequel however, is almost like a dropdead gorgeous girl with no brains, great to look at but other than that, a bore...So the game has its good and bad points but overall any fan of the first version might want to consider getting it because of the old skool players like Wilt Chamberlain, and the Bulls Micheal Jordan and it's new game features such as Be A Legend Mode, Pick Up Mode, etc. if you are just trying the genre out for the first time though, get the first one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Above da rim street ball","review":"With all of the NBA basketball games on the market this one will always stand out, not because it gets \\"technical\\" with triangle offense and set plays, but break your ankle fakes, mindblowing alley-oops and nasty in your face dunks.If you want a true street ball game minus the gravity limiting, boring old layups, short jumpers and three pointers NBA Street Vol. 2 is for you.

It's a great game. You can play as any NBA team (NJ Jets for me) or you can create your own team, including adjusting custom attributes, like strength, speed, power, jump, etc.. as well as body, hair, clothing and facial hair types. The best part is that you can play in real life street courts, like the Cage in the village (NYC), Chicago lakeside, Harlem Rec Center, etc... Tons of fun, especially in 2-player mode, but the computer can put up a great challenge, too. My only complaint is with the semi-sluggish control."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"NBA Street Vol. 2 is the best game I've ever played. it is so cool bouncing the ball off your opponents head for an alley oop.

He teaches that God is not concerned about past sins (i.e a just penalty for sins), but Jesus came to deliver us from a sort of symbolic hell caused by our current sinful state and evil heart. I stopped reading after a few of these pages so I'm not sure how he would get around the whole sacrificial system in the Law and also Rom 3:25-26 ...whom God displayed publically as a PROPITIATION in His blood ....to demonstate His RIGHTEOUSNESS...so that He would be JUST. I guess it's not a complete loss however because it drove me to scripture to preach the truth to myself, but I think the his non-biblical view of the atonement and sin is a big deal-breaker.

The two main pockets have plenty of room for folios, folders, notebooks, books, extra clothes, etc., as well as a very secure design for the laptop (closer to the straps than other manufactures, which keeps the weight and the fragile laptop closer to your back instead of in the front).

Too, and most disappointing of all is that the German words come across muffled. Also, since no English translation workbook came with the package, it is very difficult for me to know the meanings of words of which I am unfamiliar. Trying to find these unfamiliar words in the German dictionary is equally problematic because generally the words used in the video are either in the future tense or past tense (i.e., Peter ist verliebt), which the dictiornary in most cases does not recognize. In any case, I'm struggling to find an English translation workbook to help me through the unfamiliar words. How can I learn the language if I don't know what's being said???

This is the most definitive Rick Springfield compilation album I have come across. It has most of his Top 40 pop hits. It dwarfs the Greatest Hits disc that was released in 1989, that one had only 12 tracks. The Best Of Rick Springfield has more to offer, 16 tracks. Songs like Speak To The Sky and Bruce are not present. Of course Speak To The Sky was released on Capitol Records. Bruce was released on Mercury Records. So The Best Of Rick Springfield was released on RCA Records and would include only his RCA hits. The Power Of Love (from Tao) and Honeymoon In Beriut (from Rock Of Life) could have been included as well.Aside from the 2-disc set Written In Rock: The Anthology, The Best of Rick Springfield is the best Rick Springfield compilation that is out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Testament - doing what they do best.","review":"Where the previous album, \\"Souls of Black\\" was a little bit rushed and poorly produced, The Ritual put the band Testament back in form at the level of their previous album.The album also sees the band changing their sound a little bit, slowing the tempo down. Return to Serenity is much like Testament's version of the Clansman (or maybe the other way around as it came first) and is an awesome song with great guitar work, Electric Crown is the band's version of You've Got Another Coming, songs like So Many Lies and The Ritual show the band experiementing with slower but still heavy sounds.Only downside is nothing on this album is as fast as the pace of the previous four albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Rounded","review":"I always wonder what Testament could have accomplished if they had stayed this route, because this was their most well-rounded album. It wasn't their best (Practice What You Preach was), but it had some of their best tunes.This had a real barn-burner with Agony, and a nice stomper in So Many Lies. Yet it it also had one of the very best thrash ballads (if that isn't a contradiction)of the late 80s-early 90's in Return To Serenity. You can really feel the emotion dripping off of Alex's solo.I'd fully recommend this to anyone who wants to take a listen to the potential of Alex Skolnik. If you like thrash with a bit of melody, this is the album to get."},{"rating":"2","title":"Testament is awesome....period!","review":"I know alot of people were not happy with this cd, comparing it to Judas Priest's \\"Turbo\\" album, but IMO it's a very good cd, yes it's mellower than LOW and The Gathering, but it's still an awesome effort, Electric Crown is one of my favorite songs, The Ritual and Return to Serenity are simply awesome, great melodic metal. anyway just give it a listen and if your a fan of Heavy Metal it's worth the investment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hell Awesome","review":"One of the most awesome CDs ever. Checkout another Testament CD \\"The Gathering\\". I can't believe how amazing these guys are. Can't wait to see them live."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Ritual Testament","review":"When this first came out, I couldn't stand this album. Wasn't fast or heavy enough. Now I'm older, rediscovering Testament, this album is really nice to listen to. Alex and Eric are incredible guitarists and Chuck's melodic voice is amazing. He sings a bit softer here than other albums. Can't really call this a Thrash album. Nothing speedy, heaviness is toned down. Choppy rhythems, but not galloping guitars. I think this is a great addition to their playlist. Just don't expect anything fast or too heavy, though it is a chunky, choppy album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Early fan that is not a fan of this release","review":"I was a fan of Testament as soon as 'The Legacy' came out. BIG FAN. While they had already started to slow their thrash down on 'Practice What You Preach' at least it had good songs. I found this release to be too mainstream, slick and just plain boring. Chuck has no intensity or edge to his vocals. The only songs I can still listen to on here are 'Electric Crown' and 'Let Go Of My World'. The best thing I can say about this release is that it is better than the 1-star 'Souls of Black' cd they did. Ugh."},{"rating":"2","title":"Please Re-Master This Album!","review":"This is my fav Testament cd and I would dearly love a fresh re-master of this record.

Testament has stood the test of of time, and in my book is one of the better of the \\"thrash\\" bands of that era. Approaching 20 years since the release of this album, it presents itself as being just as crisp and fresh as the time it was released. Arguably their best, but definitely one of my favorite from this excellent metal act."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ritual Review","review":"I bought this album because I love the song \\"Electric Crown\\". Additionally, I read a review stating that this was Testament's most melodic and non-thrash album of all their studio work. The statement is verifiable upon listening to it and Skolnick's lead work is searing on this one. However, the album lacks something and what that something is I'm not quite sure. Put it this way, I wouldn't replace it if I were to lose my current copy of the album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that good","review":"I bought this album on tape and I didn't like it that much. It's too slow and it just doesn't sound like Testament at all. The New Order is much better than this one. It's not worth buying on CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge Letdown","review":"I cant believe there are so many positive ratings given to this sub-par Testament release.

Only the die-hard Testament fan, or those into commercial metal should pick this up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tired and Weak","review":"Perhaps the most boring Testament album for me. Everything sounds uninspired. As if they were not sure of their own directions musically. Any other album by them is fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"News Flash...Testament deserts their Thrash-Metal roots....","review":"To tell you the truth about this CD,it's an analogy of Metallica's \\"The Black Albumn\\" in that their music really began to stink afterwards.This is where Testament went from an excellent underground thrash-metal to a mainstream hard-rock band.I found the music a drastic contrast to their earlier works...especially when you listen to their albumns such as \\"The Legacy\\" and this one and make the comparison.It doesn't take a rocket scientist to see that they simply became a sell-out to their true thrash-metal fans...like me.And what makes it worst...they went ahead and tried to go death-metal with their later works..."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a letdown from Souls of Black","review":"This album is way slower then anything in their previous work. It comes off sounding un-inspired and dry. Not quite as bad as the albums to follow, which are REAL garbage, but just not an enjoyable album. Souls of Black and the three preceding albums are there best work and what they should be remembered by. Don't buy this or anything made afterwards. True, it is all a matter of opionion. I see reviews on this site of this album saying it is their favorite Testament album. And I've even seen negative reviews for Souls of Black. But hey, this is the Steveman here, would I lie to you? What would I gain in doing that? I'm only trying to save you money and disappointment.Not a good album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Weak???...I Think Not!","review":"Yes, this is an attempt by Testament to get in on the main stream of metal.

This CD somehow exceeded the disapointment of Judas Priest's infamous Turbo. The Ritual is #1 on my list of most-disapointing albums of all time. Testament at the time was my favorite band. I remember buying this CD when it came out, and nearly slashing my wrists. I couldn't believe that such a great thrash band could go pussy-up so spectacularly.

Ciccolini's interpretation is rushed and not as melodic.

The most minor is that it is full of typos and inconsistancies in spelling (such as writing Shabbos in one place and Shabbat in another -- with no explanation why).It's hard to tell who the intended audience for this book is. An educated person will not learn anything new from it and an uneducated person will often find the stories and explanations repetitive, inadequate, ambiguous, and sometimes plain bizarre (at one point the author quotes Erich von Daniken!).But the very worst problem is even though this is a guide to the Talmud and not contemporary Judaism, an uneducated person may not realize the disconnect between the two -- that something talked about in the Talmud is not necessarily what is practiced today -- and will thus get a distorted view of modern practices.This book is Talmud Lite and is only for someone who has a superficial interest in the topic."},{"rating":"1","title":"A lot smaller than expected","review":"I got the size stated as HUGE.

We learn of the machinations in New York to delay her departure, of the dedication of her crew and of the growing (but never total) influence of the Nazis. What shines through is the dedicated professionalism of the BREMEN's crew and of their love for their ship. Their tale is well told with the range of sources used adding variety to the telling.

He's now seen the movie, which he loves, and plays with it constantly shaking or banging it to get it to talk, or \\"rolling\\" (no actual wheels, btw) while making vroom-vroom noises."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smaller than I thought","review":"This toy was a huge disappointment for me. My boys took one look at it and threw it. I thought it was much bigger than what it is. I was also upset that I spent as much as I did and it wasn't even a decent size. My boys are moving to a car themed room and it just wasn't what I envisioned. It also only says one thing which can be quite boring for small children."},{"rating":"1","title":"big disappointment","review":"I bought this toy for my 2 1/2 year old son for Christmas this year, thinking it was the size of a pillow...When I recieved it I was shocked to see how small it was and not as big as it was pictured.

He thoroughly enjoyed throwing it up in the air and listening to the various exclamations as it hit the ground. Unfortunately, the \\"Yack\\" part wore out very quickly with only around thirty hits before it stopped.

How could this summer's only movie worth seeing put out a soundtrack worth vomiting on?! I can't complain enough over how pathetic this soundtrack is.

Skip this worthless jumble of pop trash."},{"rating":"2","title":"you were maybe expecting Prince Charming?","review":"You could've realized the movie wasn't exactly for ALL little kids. It had a PG rating, not G. That's an indicator that maybe you should think twice, or see it for yourself first. There were some minor bad words in the movie, so they allowed the soundtrack to have some too, no? and did listening to the soundtrack make your kids start swearing themselves? Doubt it. So enjoy the music. I thought the music was really fun and well picked out for the movie, and LOVED the movie itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"watch the movie, buy the soundtrack...","review":"The movie, Shrek, came out last night. Several reviewers said that the soundtrack was not family oriented. I agree. The movie itself was not made to be a family movie if your family included children under the age of eleven. The movie itself was rated PG for mild language and some crude humor by the MPAA. I personally think it should have recieved a PG-13, but most of the jokes that relevent that were not totally explained and would be over most youngster's heads. For a soundtrack, I think that it is very well done. It was humorously implemented into the film and the choices were interesting. I give it four stars for pulling away from the traditional fairy tale soundtrack and tackling something more contemporary."},{"rating":"2","title":"FANTASTIC!","review":"The soundtrack is really great! All songs on it are fun to listen to and you can recognize when they played them in the movie. I recommend you to buy this cd and watch the movie.

His vocals are simply gorgeous; low throat tones that croon the melancholy lyrics with a seeming ease and nonchalant manner. His piano playing is also top notch, making this rendition even more poignant.

Come one Dreamworks, bring on the score CD!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's The Score!?","review":"Well, to be honest, Shrek's magnificent score struck me the instant the dreamworks logo hit the screen. This album has one track of score. While it's a good track, there's just so much that could have been done!Sure, the songs are fun. But you could get many of them elsewhere and probably have. The score to this movie was very, very touching and wonderfully done. If they don't release a companion album in the near future, I'm going to be very disappointed and quite possibly outraged.These are fine songs, and there is nothing wrong with them. However as an album for the movie Shrek it doesn't capture the film's musicality in the slightest. A high disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shrek Fan","review":"My Family and I totally love the Movie\\"Shrek\\". My kids dance to all the songs so I thought I would buy the Soundtrack. I was very disappointed to discover that some of the songs weren't perfomned by the same artists that were in the movie!

BUT having bought the album (supposedly of the soundtrack) I find that not all of the tracks are by the artists used in the film.

Boy, was I disappointed when I listened to the CD!!! They have included hardly any of the music as originally orchestrated in the film. The music on this CD sounds nowhere near as good as in the movie. I wanted the music from the movie, dammit!! I feel ripped off!Moreover, the CD is only about 40 minutes long! The producers had plenty of headroom to include parts of the original score. They were so bone-headed!I'll have to resort to listening to the DVD when it becomes available. Maybe I'll try to \\"rip\\" the soundtrack..."},{"rating":"1","title":"A warning about this CD","review":"The beautiful and haunting song \\"Hallelujah\\" is featured prominently in \\"Shrek\\" (which is very good, as you probably know already).The song is performed by John Cale. However, the soundtrack offers a different and wholly inferior version. I can't understand this to save my life. Shame on the record exec. who decided to do it to us.If you would like to own the John Cale version, I believe it is featured in the soundtrack to \\"Basquiat\\" and in a Leonard Cohen tribute album released a few years ago (Cohen wrote \\"Hallelujah\\")."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's John Cale?","review":"I don't get it. This movie is great for adults and kids because of it's mature theme wrapped in the fun of a fairytale. The point of the story that brought all the levels together was the scene accompanied by Leonard Cohen's Hallelujah rendered brilliantly by John Cale. (Hat's off to those making these decisions). How did that get left off the sountrack? Rufus Wainright?? Ok, he's got some credential's as a folk singer, mostly inherited, but it's awful in comparison.Got my money back and bought \\"Fragments of a Rainy Season\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Shrek","review":"I purchased the Shrek CD for the single score track by Harry Gregson-Williams, which is a magical sweeping melodic musical triumph. Unforetunately however, I also had to pay out for the movies collection of inappropriately placed collection of rock songs that spoilt the ambience of the movie. Don't get me wrong, it's not that the some of the songs aren't well, ok! They just have no business being in this movie. These rock tracks simply ruined what was a great piece of fairytale story telling. Hey but don't worry, as long as the majoritory audience accepts them, who cares if the movie is compromised."},{"rating":"2","title":"A \\"must-have\\" soundtrack","review":"Immediately after seeing \\"Shrek\\" in the theatre, I looked at Jeff and said, \\"I want the soundtrack.\\" We went to the local record store that night because I enjoyed the music so much that I couldn't even wait until the next day to make the purchase. My absolute favorite cut is \\"I'm A Believer,\\" in whic Eddie Murphy is backed by SmashMouth on the old Monkees hit. Every cut on the album is absolutely marvelous!"},{"rating":"1","title":"SCORE!","review":"Don't get me wrong, the songs are really okay, but it is just ...

Please remove it from this section and place it where it belongs, perhaps in the soundtrack or the little kid section."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong songs","review":"I did not buy this, because I already have the wonderful John Cale version of Leonard Cohen's Hallelujah (from the equally great I'm Your Fan album, a tribute to LC). I also have Leonard's live and studio versions. It's a great song. Everything else is throw-away pop. Why they replaced the John Cale version I can't imagine, unless they could not get rights or are promoting Rufus. Despite the wording in the review about this song, Rufus did not pen this, Leonard Cohen did. Do your homework please!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Unfair listening","review":"Today my family and I went to see Shrek at the theater. It was a great movie. Soon after we arrived home, my 13 year old son had to have the soundtrack. The purchase was made. He immediately sat there listening to the CD with his headphones on when he noticed that one of the tracks must had been damaged. This was track #7. When I listened to it, it sounded perfectly fine to me. I'm sure it would sound perfectly fine to anyone; anyone, that is, with two good ears. Unfortunately, my son is deaf in one ear. In this particular track, the words are heard on one side of the headphones and the music on the other. It really did not make for good listening to him. Other than that, he was pretty happy with it. He said when he is listening to it with his headphones he will just skip over that track. He wanted me to write or call someone to let them know it was not fair, so I figured this would be my opportunity.Thanks for taking the time to read my message."},{"rating":"1","title":"Has Its Good and Bad, Mostly Bad Though","review":"The overrated animated comedy \\"Shrek\\" has an ok album, the Baha Men song \\"Best Years of Our Lives\\" and \\"My Beloved Monster\\" are great as well as the instrumental \\"True Love's First Kiss\\" but Smash Mouth's annoyingly overrated (like the movie) song \\"All Star\\" appears, as well as an unbelievably bad rendition of \\"I'm a Believer\\" followed by an equally annoying rendition by Eddie Murphy. \\"Bad Reputation\\" was also annoying and an inferior version of \\"Hallelujah\\" is featured. Not very recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only OK.","review":"Sure Smashmouth's \\"I'm A Believer\\" is down with it, but mostly everything else is, \\"ehhh, weird\\".

I'm just glad it was my roommate that made the mistake of buying this CD, and not me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great, except","review":"The whole reason I ordered this CD was for the song Hallelujah.

It is the first thing they request when they get in the car. From \\"All Star\\" to \\"My beloved monster\\", this CD has a wonderful mix of upbeat and ballads. They especially like Eddie Murphy's take on \\"I'm a believer\\". Buy this -- your kids will love you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better Than The Movie!","review":"I think the soundtrack for SHREK is actually better than the movie. I thought SHREK was funny, of course, but the plot and storyline seemed kind of childish. The movie, basically, was for kids rather than the whole family. Anyways, this soundtrack is pretty cool. My favorite tracks are the ones by Smash Mouth and Leslie Carter. I especially like \\"I'm A Believer\\", which is a remake of The Monkees' song. I enjoyed all the other tracks, too. This is great for both kids and adults. If you've seen the movie, then this is a definite must-have. Even if you haven't, you should still consider buying the soundtrack."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely loved this soundtrack.","review":"I saw the movie with my husband and 2 year old son.

I'll give it as many stars as I can."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great music for kids and adults","review":"My children and I really like this CD.

I also wanted to hear the song \\"I'm a Believer\\" from the movie that they've been playing on the radio more and more lately.

There's yet another Carter kid (how many are in that family??) who sings \\"Like Wow!\\" (not a favorite...), there's the sensual Rufus Wainwright who sings \\"Hallelujah\\" (which has the power to make me sob like a child), there's Smashmouth's rendition of \\"I'm A Believer\\" (call me old-fashioned, but I still like the original), and then there's the orchestrated song \\"True Love's First Kiss\\" (by far the best song on the album). The only thing I really disliked about this CD was the fact that they kept all the pop and rock songs in and shoved all the beautiful parts of the score out. The only part they kept in was the ending, which I thoroughly enjoyed, but I just wished for more. But, that and Rufus Wainwright make it a great buy.

Oh no, I'm told, you must read all the fine print before you buy gas... or buy a soundtrack.\\"Soundtrack\\"... what does that mean exactly? Apparently not what I thought. I'm not judging the music on the CD, but I want you to know that it is NOT THE SOUNDTRACK from the movie, nor are the songs performed by the same artists, nor with the same arrangement.

The users that had a problem with hardware either don't know how to use their PC properly or didn't check to see if their PC was compatible. I've burned about 70 CD's so far with no problems unless I interrupted the burning process by bumping the PC. The software also allows you to set a pre-gap before each song, which other software does not. I will definately continue buying sony PC products."},{"rating":"2","title":"You'll love this blanket!","review":"The safari sage blanket is wonderful!

It sounded good, lots of adventure, peril, danger and a likeable sounding main character. Though, as I go to read this book, I find adventure to be walking around in the snow, peril is siting up in a tree, danger was a weird guy stalking the main character, amd the main character so laughably fake and unbeleivable that I knew from the first couple of pages that this book was HORRIBLE. To top it all off, the ending is so bad that I wondered why I even bothered to finish all 367 pages of pure boredom. I actualy fell alsleep reading this!

I'd not read anything by L'amour before, and if this is indicative of his writing talent, I'm glad of it. I think you'd have to have about a 8th grade education to actually think this book is good.

He makes russian soldiers look like the Keystone Cops while the hero is able to shoot down aircraft with one or two arrows,(Only the Goddess Diana can shoot like that); and nobody ever thinks of using dogs to track this guy; the first and cheapest available resource of all manhunters.

If there was ever a book by an author that promoted other books written by him, this was it. Epic understates this book. The hero encounters obstacles insurrmountable, yet he overcomes.

This is a modern day book about an Airforce major pilot who is shot down in the USSR and is taken prisoner. He is not treated well to say the least. The main part of the story is about his escape from the prison and his track across Siberia. An absolute amazing book with breath taking action throughout. Major Joe Mack uses his Indian heritage to survive in the most harsh of climates while being tracked by the Russian Army and in particular the commander of the prison he excaped.

Now I am an avid martial artist who continues to use this book as a reference for improving my techniques as I advance. For example, the chapter on three-step gave me new ideas to add to my three-steps and sparring. The part about sparring showed me how to use all the things I practice in basics and forms in my sparring. The forms chapter made me think beyond the obvious about forms.

He offers a tantalizing glimpse of the Catholicism that could be, and leaves readers wondering where they can find more clergy like him.His logic is straightforward and lucid and flows in a straight line from the Christianity of history, inspired by a clearly deep sense of Catholic faith.The only problem with Brunsman's vision is that real life doesn't always run the way we wish it would. But even in our imperfect world, this book can serve many Catholics as they search their conscience for a way back into the sacramental life of the Church."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth every penny","review":"I saw Eric Hutchinson live last night.

I have attended all these types of churches mentioned and have seen some pro's and con's to each.I think one of the main structures to all these methods should be - to incorporate freedom of the Spirit. Which one will give the Spirit freedom to exercise in Liberty.The New Testament is founded through the Holy Spirit by the very words of Jesus. He that was sent from the Father, The Holy Spirit, we should allow freedom to worship in the Spirit. So, how can one incorporate His good pleasure through the selected polity? If by instruction of the letter? No, it is to be by the Spirit saith the Lord of Hosts as the Prophets foretold and the way Jesus foretold.

On christmas day we went through the letters, animals, and numbers on the block and she loved it. These blocks were high quality, well finished, and best of all made in the great state of Michigan. To get on a soap box, low output toys like these ones require the child to input more into the playing experience; allowing them to mold the situation into what creative possibility they wish and expanding their creative capacity. This is why for young children it is important to have toys that don't require batteries.

She loves the pictures of animals on each block, and will bring blocks over and have us turn them around to all the faces, with us reading each letter or number, and naming each animal, and she is mesmerized.The one small quibble is that the description says that it features carved letters. This is partially true, but only two of the faces on each block have carved letters, the rest are flat and smooth with printed/painted letters or drawings. This isn't terrible, but based on the description I was expecting all the letters to be carved, and they are not.Still, a good set of blocks, and that is a minor quibble."},{"rating":"2","title":"The classics never go out of style!","review":"I got lucky and found a set of these blocks at a thrift shop for $5, and they're definitely a favorite in our household - even my husband can't stop playing with them.They're fun, beautifully made, and educational on many levels, and I expect that we'll be using them for at least a couple of years (right now our 1-year old is content to just knock them over as we stack them up). These durable classics never go out of style!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The very best block set there is!","review":"These ABC blocks by Uncle Goose are the best made blocks you will find anywhere. I looked everywhere to find blocks for my 15 month old. Most are for 3 and up because they are too small and too destructable. Not these blocks! These are 1.75 inches each and have 100% safe paint for babies and up. My 15 month old chews on everything and she was not able to bite the paint off of these blocks, like she was easily able to with most other blocks on the market that I returned! The animal carvings on the blocks are really nice. They have numbers, A - Z and 27 animals for toddlers to look at. My child loves playing with these and stacking them up then knocking them down. I wanted to be sure she had these blocks for her 1st birthday. You can't go wrong with this classic toy. It is excellently made and very fun! A must have for all children ages 1 and up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerous for young kids","review":"I was very excited to get these blocks for my son since they're made of wood and non-toxic paint. However, when we got the blocks, I noticed that many tiny splinters coming off of them. They don't seem sharp enough to be a problem for hands, but for a kid who still puts everything in his mouth, that could be really dangerous! I chewed on one myself to see what would happen, and was able to easily dent/break some of the wood. I contacted the company and they had great customer service. They sent me a second set of blocks right away. Unfortunately, those blocks have the same problem.All in all, they are beautiful blocks and I plan to keep them for when my son is older. I think the wood they are made from is just too soft to be durable to tiny teeth. I bought a set of baby's first blocks from Haba which are perfect for him right now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissappointing; not enough for brighter kids to learn","review":"My son was attracted by the Human Body excerpt pages in the Quantum Pad sampler book which had charismatic descriptions that really helped you learn the organ functions.So we got this book, and were surprised to find that when we turned to the same pages, it did not contain the descriptions, just the body part names. How dissappointing! The sampler book pages (same pictures, added audio) are so much better! I thought they were supposed to be direct excerpts, but they apparently embellished the sampler pages to attract sales from the store demos.I think the money would be better spent on a well-written and illustrated regular anatomy book for this age group. The real shame is that this cartridge could have been so much more, if it truly contained the type of content that the sampler does."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult...","review":"We were not impressed with this Leap Pad book, while we have been happy with all of the others. There wasn't much description on any of the pages, and it can be difficult to get the pointer EXACTLY where you want it to go. If you don't get it in exactly the right place, not a fraction of a millimeter off, you get the answers wrong. I think they tried to cram too much information into too few pages.The Human Body pages are fun to look at, and you can certainly learn from it, but this one is more difficult to maneuver than the others, and my daughter has not played with it nearly as much as her other Leap Pad books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome educational tool","review":"This is an awesome educational program.

But since it is a standard helmet, i can swap out the \\"guts\\" with my other hard hat."},{"rating":"1","title":"SHAT!","review":"Don't plan on having a well-fitting hat if you buy this.

Let me stress this is my opinion, you may see it differently but I would suggest you seek out a copy to review before making the purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a weak work for the purpose.","review":"The examples aren't objectives, and the book doesn't attend what it says in the title."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Many Hard-to-find Ingredients","review":"I bought this book shortly after it came out because there weren't many vegan cookbooks available when I purchased this book. I have been very disappointed with it, and I rarely use it. I bought it primarily because I was looking for vegan dessert ideas, but the desserts have ingredients that I have a difficult time finding because I don't live in a larger city. I would not recommend this book because there are far more accessable vegan books on the market, such as Vegan Cupcakes Take Over the World (or any book by Isa Chandra Moskowitz)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love the restaurant, the cookbook.... not so much","review":"I have to preface this by saying that I absolutely love eating at the candle. So delicious.before we moved from NYC, I thought we HAVE to get this book. We've tried several of the recipies, following them to the letter, and have been really dissapointed everytime - with the exception of the hummus. I think that they must be leaving out some key ingredients in a lot of these recipies, because all of the ones we have attempted have been either completely flavorless, or tasted like salt. Don't even bother with the soups unless you are a gourmet cook and can figure out how to punch them up somehow after following these directions, because they all end up runny and bland. so sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Filled with errors, and no insert with corrections.","review":"I bought this cookbook at the Candle Cafe itself, after eating there several times and enjoying the food. As other reviewers have noted, this book is filled with serious errors that render many of the recipes inedible. For example, the oatmeal date bar recipe calls for 4 cups of oatmeal, 4 cups of oat flour, and only 1/2 cup of dates. The result is a solid slab of oatmeal with a thin streak of brown in the middle. Standard recipes call for 1 cup of dates for 1-1/2 cups of oatmeal.What is especially annoying is that there was no insert with corrections - even at the restaurant itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Recipe error","review":"This is honestly the worst vegetarian/vegan or any sort of cookbook that I have ever owned. Something is very wrong with many of the recipes and the amount of ingredients is totally wrong. eg. the Chocolate Macademia Nut Cookie recipe on p. 191. There is not enough liquid in the recipe and the cookie dough looks like sand. I added soy milk (~1/2-3/4 cup) till it resembled cookie dough, but the cookies came out a bit cakey. There are many other errors as noted by other reviewers. I'm sure the restaurant is great but the cookbook is terrible because you don't know which recipes will turn out right."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I made 3 recipes from this book and then gave up. All of them were mediocre to poor. I cook all the time but I usually sub vegan ingredients for butter, eggs, etc. and everything comes out amazing. This cookbook is also unclear about the instructions. I recommend the Joy of Cooking - always the best recipes and everything can pretty much be made vegan. They even have the most delicious recipe for vegan cakes.This cookbook seems like it was thrown together to make some money. The cupcakes tasted like healthy bran muffins with tofu on top. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total dissapointment","review":"I think the recipes in this cookbook SOUND amazing. But I've made several recipes now, including the Pumpkin Pudding and Paradise Casserole, and they turned out tasting bland and uninteresting. I really expected more from a cookbook that comes from a renowned restaurant. I would not recommend this cookbook -- there are much better ones out there!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Uneven Recipes","review":"I agree with what other reviewers have said. This book has many recipes that just don't come out right. The color photos are great, but the recipes don't hold up. I made one dessert recipe from this book (cookies), and the results were sub par. Baking is a little finicky to begin with, but this recipe needed to be tweaked. Luckily, I'm a professional so in the end the cookies were edible. For the unexperienced baker, these recipes could yield poor results."},{"rating":"1","title":"The book is not acceptable","review":"The book looked interesting and the recipe seemed creative at the first glance. I have tried Oatmeal Chocolate Chip Cookies, Split Pea Soup and Curried Potato-Spinach Soup. The measurements were all wrong in these recipes. I am an experienced cook and I was able to salvage or modify the recipe on my own. The book appears to be put together very quickly without anybody testing the recipes. I am very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best representation of what the Alaskan wilderness is.","review":"John Pezzanti's A Photographic Journey Through the Last Wilderness is undoubtedly the best presentation of what the last wilderness really is, that I have ever seen. His dedication to the art of photography is illustrated on every page start to finish. Not only by his images but by his sincere feelings and experiences through his writing. Any aspiring photographer, myself included, can only learn from John's work. John has taken what God created for all of us and captured it on film and given it to those who may never have the opportunity to go and experience it except in his book. A definite 10! Keep on clicking, John."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing collection of Alaska Wildlife Photos","review":"I met John Pezzenti at Brooks Camp in Alaska this past summer. About 20 of us were standing on a platform with 7 coastal brown bears catching salmon at the waterfall in front of us. John asked a woman with a 35-80mm lens if she would like to take a few shots of the bears through his 600mm lens. Her eyes lit up and her husband later said this was the highlight of their trip to Alaska.Later that evening, John shared some of the proof pages for the book with us while we sat around the fireplace in the Brooks Lodge. He has spent 27 years photographing Alaska and the pictures show it. While the photos have the energy of being taken in the wild, they also have the quality of studio portraits. After having spent the day watching bears in the wild, looking at his photos was like being back outside with them.For anyone interested in Alaska or wildlife, I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great toy with a major Problem","review":"That it's appropriate for toddlers, especially fans of the Disney Animated movie is indisputable but it's battery operated and you can't change the battery!

Denise and Jody are best friends who have everything. Denise has a daughter Ellen who is now all grown up and returns home, only after admitting she was a lesbian. Jody is shocked when she sees Ellen again because the brat kid she once knew was now a very beautiful and sexy woman. Ellen pursues Jody and they end up falling for each other, but their relationship could cause Jody to loose Denise's friendship. Jody and Ellen's relationship later is tested when Ellen becomes it.This was an amazing love story and one of the best I've read to date. I couldn't put it down - I needed to know how the story ended.Would highly recommend to anyone - it's just a wonderful book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A lot of fun but BREAKS way too easy","review":"First we bought the smaller Air Hogs remote helicopter but the small propeller on the tail fin kept breaking (they give you three replacements total), we ran through the replacements in less than a day. So, we bought the Helix because it didn't have the tail fin propeller. BUT, we only got to play with the Helix for a couple of hours because it crashed and the whole tail fin snapped. These helicopters are a great idea and they are a lot of fun but unless you already know how to fly them and you're sure you're not going to ever crash don't get one because they are much to fragile to take the inevitable crashes you'll have learning to fly them."},{"rating":"1","title":"very unstable. Would not recommend","review":"I just received the Air Hogs \\"reflex\\". I've flown a few different RC helis and was fairly optimistic about this one. However, even after I had it trimmed and hovering relatively stable it would drift in a circular motion (like a pendulum) and would soon lose any semblence of stability. On a positive note this heli seems almost indestructible. Trying to trim and modify to just hover has seem it careen at high speed into doors, walls, or even into an unplugged fan with no damage to the heli. The collapsable blades are very efficient at absorbing the shock of a crash.All in all I would not recommend this heli. If you're looking for a cheap heli for a kid or \\"kid at heart\\" the Air Hogs \\"sharpshooter\\" is a lot of fun and extremely stable if a little weak."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Alcazarized\\" Satisfies Me","review":"This, Alcazar's sophomore album improves on their debut album by less relience on R&B/Disco samples and more from original compositions. I was surprised to read in the album liner notes that the members of the Pet Shop Boys wrote the song, \\"Lovelife.\\" It is quite a good song. My favourite songs include \\"I Go Shopping\\" which smartly samples the Chic song \\"What About Me\\", \\"Physical\\", \\"This Is The World We Live In\\" and completely original songs such as \\"I Love The DJ\\", the ABBA-esque Disco/Pop song song \\"Not A Sinner Nor A Saint\\", \\"Last Days Of Disco\\", \\"Celebrate The Night\\", \\"Someday\\", and \\"Singing To Heaven\\" which sounds if it the Donna Summer hit \\"Could It Be Magic\\" was part of the inspiration for the song. Overall, \\"Alcazarized\\" is a more satisfying album than \\"Casino.\\" If you do not mind the fact these songs are not overtly lustful or hedonistic, then you will enjoy \\"Alcazarized\\" too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Columbia, slides","review":"I love my Columbia slides.

Simply Essential!","review":"In the late 1980's I purchased The Gladiator's LP \\"On the Right Track\\". Big mistake. I did not like this album as I thought it was weak and irritating. The result was that for 10+ years I stayed away from The Gladiators all together. Another big mistake. I finally bought \\"Trenchtown Mix Up\\" after reading the review in the Rough Guide, and I have since been kicking myself for ignoring it all this time. Every song is perfect and the musical backing and production by Prince Tony is stunning. A cornerstone reggae album on par with The Congos \\"Heart of the Congos\\", Sylford Walker's \\"Lambsbread\\" and Burning Spear's \\"Marcus Garvey\\". A perfect, hard driving, rootsy mix of the heroic and the spiritual."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album","review":"Great album, my only complaint is that it's a little short.

Being a huge baseball fanatic, he could hardly wait til Spring to put it together and play with it.Within the first few minutes after we put it together, the frame fell apart. The only way it was usable was if you placed it exactly where you needed it, reconnected the frame pieces and tossed the ball gently into the net.

I read part of this book when a friend showed it to me. We both got a good laugh at this guy's constant self promotion. I looked up the author at a Martial Arts event once not to long ago. I found he runs a tiny little school in a tiny backwater town in California. If he was the great sage he claims, why can't he make it in a town with some competition? Why aren't his books actually selling? :oD"},{"rating":"1","title":"A very poor CD","review":"I was very disappointed when I listened to this CD. It was recorded only by two people, so the songs have a very low quality. For example, in the song \\"I Still Believe\\" in which two women sing, the same women sings both parts. The same happens with other songs, for example in \\"The Heat is On Saigon\\", in which there's a small talked conversation it seems a monologue, because the guy that recorded it sings both parts.Don't buy it.

I don't believe that there is any Savoy Brown stuff out there that isn't any good.and thats another thing that Kim always made sure of, and that is the sound.he always had the best of the best behind it.Believe me opinions are what matters and in my opinion this cd is a five star two thumbs up piece of work.*****and thats THE BOTTOM LINE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worn Like An Old Coat","review":"If you like the same stuff you have heard over and over before, buy this one, hopefully from me. The long blues jam by Kim Simmonds on \\"Tell Mama\\" helps this one go down a little easier. Keith Boyce, the drummer du jour, plays well. For a live recording, Ralph Morman unfortunately sang like he couldn't wait to get his paycheck. The rest of the ensemble played their parts like supporting players waiting for Kim to carry them home. Probably the most disappointing part was that Simmonds didn't seem like he knew if they wanted to be a blues band, metal or boogie, so it came out as blootal. When I saw Savoy in the early 80's they were a power trio that weaved various moods of the blues through the set. Kim did the singing and took charge. On this one Ralph took over and Kim played.

It is very much unlike the Disney version of Pooh where the characters learn lessons in every story. Pooh is a brainless bear who does some very funny acts. With beautiful color drawings and a cute fabric book mark, it makes a wonderful gift to anybody.

Very interesting to see where Disney got their ideas from. The artwork is top notch. My copy also has a built in book mark-nice touch. The first few Pooh cartoons came directly from parts of this book. My problem was that I grew up on the cartoons and the book is quite different. Even though it's a children's book it isn't the easiest thing to read. My wife and I find ourselves stumbling through the book as we try to read it out loud to our 2 year old son who quickly gets boored with the long winded stories. Being a fan of Pooh history, I'm glad I bought it and it makes a great conversation piece (among my freinds that also grew up on the Disney version) but as far as my little guy is concerned I think he may need a few more years before he's ready for a book like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"My kids love this book.","review":"I bought this book years ago for my oldest son when he was only 2 years old.

No longer are our best storytellers cowed by Hollywood (no relation) into producing elliptical, bloodless tomes that refuse to compete with more visceral media. Wesley Stace is unafraid to sauce his tale with a tangy dollop of vulgarity. No artless hack, Stace, like Marquez, Rushdie, Grass, and on these shores Irving, is a complete writer. In the library at noon and the whorehouse at midnight. Nabokov said that a writer's job is to enchant. Well, Wesley Stace wears the hat. Surrender yourself to MISFORTUNE and you will be in his spell.

The main character was tiresome at best, an utter blank at worst. Too much energy was expended in forcing rather outdated Freudian notions of gender and sex, and one got the sense, correct or no, that the author was a good sixty years behind on current debates on the subject.Ultimately, I lost so much interest that I was unable to finish the book.

It started well...sexually confused English nobility finds abandoned baby and, although the baby is clearly a boy, he has reasons for raising the child as a girl. As the child ages, his gender becomes more obvious and he becomes more confused. Confused is the optimum word. He likes dresses. He hates suits. He is attracted to girls. It is all very confusing to him. Up to this point, the book was witty and funny.... but suddenly, from sexually ambiguous and unknowing, the author inserts a sequence that throws the narrator from innocent and confused to sexually aggressive and experienced almost instantly. It was then that the book lost me.... and apparently the author. One of the few books ever that I skipped entire chapters and didn't even care about the ending. Blah."},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterful","review":"This debut novel by Wesley Stace fulfills the promise and then some. He has a masterful touch for prose, and the pace of his storytelling keeps the reader absorbed throughout the story, no matter how bizarre it twists and turns.

All of you who spend a half an hour in the kitchen cooking know that the last thing you want to be wearing are heals, but my feet were fine. Definately not sneakers, but not horrible pain either that comes with normal heals. I also love the height they give me! I'm only 5'2\\", so 4 inches is a big deal! They are pretty much what you see in the picture. The straps are soft and comfortable. The material for the straps are sewn together to form a tube, so there is a lot of material to them, which adds to the comfort.

Sex Type Thing, Piece of Pie, Dead and Bloated, and Crackerman are great songs, but too one-dimensional. The rest of the songs are forgettable, even the ones that became radio hits. STP would go on to make at least three more albums better than this one. This is a wobbly start. You can tell the band likes to play heavy metal Kiss-type songs, but that's it.

While all the songs in reality are good, I cannot classify them up in the ranks with Purple or Tiny Music. But then again, that's just my opinion. This was the first STP album I bought, but I still think that the later albums were better. So if you've only heard Purple, or any later albums (and you don't like heavy metal) then I don't recommend this album to you.

The only ones worth listening to are those that have been played on the radio. (\\"creep\\", \\"plush\\", \\"wicked garden\\" and \\"sex type thing\\") Those are all great songs, but the rest of the album is hardly listenable. And those who criticized STP for copying other bands were partially correct. Well, at least with this album. They developed their own sound with their next three, but let's face it \\"creep\\" is a very good Nirvana imitation, and \\"Plush\\" does sound quite a bit like Pearl Jam.

I can still remember hearing 'Plush' for the first time in a record store and instantly feeling awakened to a whole new genre. Core is full of all the raw emotion and power that was prevalent in music at the time. It's heavy, it's aggressive, and it's deep.

They are wrong. \\"Wet My Bed\\" is totally different than \\"Where the River Goes.\\" I can listen to this cd over and over again without getting bored, and that's what I do.

But dont quote me on it.Other stand out tracks are 'Sex Type Thing' 'Whicked Garden' and 'Crackerman.' 'Sex Type Thing' was a big hit for STP and one of their best songs. 'Whicked Garden' is such a killer song, I swear you wil never like Creed after you hear this, cause all of Creeds music sounds like a cheap rip off of 'Whicked Garden'Core was the start of something great in music, its just to bad Scott Wieland is always in jail or maybe their would be more STP albums like this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stone Temple Pilots - 'Core' (Atlantic)","review":"Review number 172.As some of us,including myself might assume that STP had come from Seattle,turns out they're actually from San Diego.Hadn't heard this,the band's first CD in awhile.With tunes like \\"Plush\\",\\"Dead And Bloated\\",\\"Naked Sunday\\" and \\"Sex Type Thing\\",intact,the listener(s) know they're in for some prime heavy-duty early '90's grunge.In fact,this whole disc rocks.Line-up:Weiland-vocals,Dean DeLeo-guitar,Robert DeLeo-bass and Eric Kretz-drummer.I believe I saw these guys open for Megadeth on this very tour.What an experience!Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"This album smells like a rose (that somebody gave me...)","review":"So many classic songs lie within... most you've probably heard and loved but never realized were compiled onto one amazing CD.

I for one am not a huge fan of Pearl Jam, and I seem to like the second album \\"Purple\\" better becasue by that stage in their musician hood they seem to have established their own style of music, rather than sounding like an already existing band.

The album is full of raging guitars and powerful lyrics. Weiland fronts the band with his one-of-a kind style. Unfortunately, this album tends to be eclipsed by the success of the single \\"Creep\\", or even overshadowed in the success of other bands. However, this album remains a truthful testimony to hard rock. Songs such as \\"Sex Type Thing\\" and \\"Crackerman\\" turn up the volume, while songs like \\"No Memory\\" and \\"Where the River Goes\\" slow it down STP style.

In most cases, it will be the mutual fund as most investors lose on individual stocks. On the other hand, if your individual stocks have performed better, then go with individual stocks...BUT...be sure to check your net rate of return.J.W.

These white socks are balled up with dark lint, the material is pealing threads off and they look so bad I won't wear them with shorts. They are just like $2 socks only thicker, harder and ugly. They are absolutely disgusting.

It's patchwork just like any other quilt in my house that has been washed tons of times... but after a dozen washings it is falling apart. The seams are poorly stitched and it does not withstand the washing machine very well. A highchair pad is going to need frequent washings and should be much higher quality.

Anyway I found this one and it is nice for it has the padded sides and it washes well as well as wipes off when you have small spots. I did though make one minor adjustment, the back is elastic and if you have a wooden high chair that has the over the head tray the elastic band to hold it to the back does not stay put so I snipped it and hemmed the sides and then got some commercial grade velcro and voila.. it now stays on the back of the chair! Otherwise this is a great pad with a very pretty pattern."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"For starters, it is SO colorful! It really brightens things up.

They are descriptive and quite unique. To me they sound like no other Vivaldi works.This recording is quite nice but the performance, while being unique, is rather overly done. One example of this lies in the middle movement of the 3rd concerto (a personal favorite of mine with the long soothing harmonies) where the continuo is embellished too much for my liking.

The concept (of dog-handling) was poorly explained or supported. The characters were shallow, they had little depth. Scenes were poorly explained -- sometimes I got the concept because it was so obvious not because the writing made it exciting, interesting, or apparent. i generally recommend avoiding this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I read better stuff in 9th grade creative writing","review":"This is the most inconsistent book I've ever read. One moment the main character, Liv, is a dowdy copy of Janeane Garafolo in 'The truth about cats and dogs', the next she's an unconquerable sex goddess. The references to Sydney are off (there are 8 digits in Australian phone numbers). The only thing consistent about the book is the tired, unbelievable plot and lack of grammar and imagination. I had to wonder if this book was edited at all, obviously never by anyone who's been to Sydney. The book is a sad [copy] of \\"the Girl's Guide to Hunting and Fishing\\", which is much more enjoyable, and professionally done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time!","review":"This book was the worst one I can remember reading in quite some time.

A lot more than you think....I have to admit that it took me about 40 pages to really get into this book, but once I did, I didn't want to put it down. Liv is someone I could totally relate to and Clare Naylor keeps you wanting to know more about Liv, Alex and everyone who pops in and out of their lives. I spent an entire Sunday reading \\"Dog Handling\\" because I just couldn't put it down. While at times it could be a little predictable there was enough to keep you guessing and wanting more.Good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!!","review":"I purchased this book based on the reader reviews and could not believe that it was given such high marks after reading it myself. Of course I was expecting it to be a light read, but this was unbearable. There was no character development, and the story line was a bit unbelievable. I believe that I only kept reading it just to see if it could get any worse. Which it did. I can't believe the author was able to get this published. Not to mention that someone actually admits to EDITING this train wreck.There are so many other good books in this genre, I wouldn't waste your money on this one. Marian Keyes, Jane Green, Sophie Kinsella and Jennifer Weiner are just a few who have produced witty and enjoyable reads that don't make you want to rip it apart, page by page, after you have finished."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love It!","review":"Dog Handling is about getting over a terrible break up, getting confidence back, and finding yourself again. It is absolutely hilarious. The situations that the Liv gets herself into are both hilarious and cringe worthy. I have read this book probably about three or four times. It is definitely a favourite of mine. I wish I could find myself a Ben. There are many laugh out loud moments and some heartbreaking ones as well.

It is a cover/hommage album with a difference: the clarinet (with backing acoustic instruments and synths) provides a more obviously \\"Greek\\" atmosphere to Vangelis' more universal melodies. The album contains many more tracks than are listed here. Saleas has done similar work on his album of Theodorakis' work: \\"Litany\\". If you like this you should also try music by Greek film composer Eleni Karaindrou e.g. Music for films. (Note to Amazon: the track listing for that ECM album is also severely truncated and it is NOT a jazz album. ECM also does classical/film music)"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Rain Forest (Selva Verde)","review":"Here is a great video about the rain forests of Central America.

Very few of these classic episodes of Nature are still available so I was happy to find this on VHS, although I wish that it were available on DVD.

(Also, they need to remake the old man; his ears are too disgusting to look at.)

Even though white is not my favorite color, it was the only color available in my size. I was thrilled when they arrived and the white was more of a grayish white. The only thing I can say against these shoes is...they seem a little long from the toe strap to the front of the shoe.

It also helps that they are very light-weight. I thought the glacier-colored ones were white, but they are actually two-tone which was not that apparent looking at the picture. I am pleased as white shoes here in the desert take a beating. I also bought them in avocado somewhere else and paid twice the price. However, they are worth every penny.

I want to show this to my diabetic friends but am concerned they will be put off by the touchy/feely (\\"corny\\"???) aspects, the brief cameos by people like Anthony Robbins, the stress that shocking dietary changes will be demanded, and the suspicion that maybe it is an infomercial for the \\"camp\\" they attend in Arizona.Again, it's a fabulous message that diabetes can be cured, but I don't think that I can convince any diabetic friend to watch this through. The emotional tone will appeal to some people and repulse others.But do not be put off by this review!

Out of all the new material, DNA is generally the closest in style to the \\"older\\" stuff. Less minimalistic, certainly, but just as sharp and atmospheric. One major difference though: the skewed, disjointed breaks that make up what must be the most amazing percussion programming (in general) I have _ever_ heard.

The album is all instrumental. The songs are a mix between upbeat and melancholy. The opening cut, Aman, is especially exciting, catchy, and moody. Karalis uses a 12 person group in this production. Instruments include: Shyi, Doudoak, Zourna, Tabla, Symbals, Toumberleki, Bendir, Outi, Bouzouki, Lute, Mandolin, Tzoura, Banglama, Acoustic Guitar, Violin, Keyboards, Clarinet, Nei, and Classic Guitar.

What struck me about this particular guide was the author's commitment to the entire process from being out of work to negotiating the final offer. Robert Gardella covers commonsense information such as resumes and interviews, but takes the book one step further by offering crucial tips on negotiating, networking, search firms, and job fairs. After reading this book, I promptly adjusted my list of references to remove the CEO at my old company, because according to Gardella, it can be hard for the reference checker to get a hold of such a senior level person--thus hurting the chance to get the job.

This device is the opposite - it projects light all over the ceiling, with spots of darkness for the star. As you can imagine, that ruins the experience. For just a few cents more, they could have made the sphere dark with pinholes for the stars. At least this way, it would have made a cool nightlight.The hand-held \\"meteor maker\\" is just a flashlight with a couple of filters.

In a square or rectangular room, the projected image is so distorted that it is virtually worthless! To top it off, the light bulb burned out after only a couple of minutes of use. This was the worst gift that I bought all year.If you have an interest in the stars and planets, I would recommend that you spend your money on a trip to a real planetarium.

Reading the other reviews I see that the design is faulty, and truly does not perform to anybody's satisfaction.

As everyone else already said, lots of T & A, terrible writing, acting...etc. Not one redeemable quality to this movie. NOT ONE! I actually lost some respect for the fighters for appearing in this so-called movie. im just gonna tell myself that all proceeds went to some incredibly good charity so that i stop crying myself to sleep for spending money that would have been better spent buying Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles part 2."},{"rating":"1","title":"STOP","review":"don't buy this movie it souds like the perfect movie but its far from it dont waste your time or money just go rent never back down no matter how many times you've seen it it's better than this movie"},{"rating":"1","title":"Possibly the WORST movie ever.","review":"The movie is so unrealistic and the plot is not set up at all. It feels like a bunch of scenes just thrown together and called a movie. No flow at all, just scene, another scene, sex scene, fight scene, sex scene, fight scene, crap, crap, and more crap. The cameo appearances by the MMA fighters are tacky and have little to do with the plot and just added to the movie for no reason.(with the exception of Heath Herring). I don't usually write reviews but this movie stunk it up so bad, I had to warn others. I didn't even pay for this movie (someone else rented it) and I wanted my money back!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My son loves his slide!","review":"We purchased this slide for my 1-year old son. While he's still getting used to it, he loves it! It was easy to assemble; he was able to play on it right away. For now, he needs constant supervision while playing on it, but I think after he gets a little older that will change. The climbing wall is a riot, and the slide isn't too steep. I highly recommend this product for adventerous babies!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good toy for little ones","review":"We bought this for my son for christmas when he was a year and a half. he loved playing on it but was too scared to go down the slide on his own. now that he's two he's always on it and always going down the slide.

It's not something I would have bought myself for him, however, it's kind of hard to take back gifts from his grandparents. So I set it up, which is fast and easy, but this is a very lightweight plastic and my son of course had to stand on top of it and grab onto the sides and rock back and forth on it. Not safe at all. If you do get one of these, you must be standing, holding onto the side in the event your child decides to do the same thing! The slide is very steep and it looks very uncomfortable to slide down. My son didn't have any problems climbing up the \\"rocks\\" or the slide for that matter, but he is quite the monkey, as you can imagine. He doesn't appear to enjoy playing on it as much as other playsets we have been on. So anyway, my point being, save your money for a decent, durable playset and don't spend money on lightweight plastic playsets like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Little Tikes Climb & Slide","review":"This toy was purchased for our 2 year old grandson.

However, I had not idea it was going to be too small! Her feet almost touched the ground when she sat on top of the slide, and I had to help her up almost all the time becasue the 'rocks' are really hard to climb - even though she has been a huge climber since she could crawl! I wish I had spent my money on something bigger and more substaintial. She is two now, and hardly ever plays with it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great size, great fun!","review":"I did a lot of research on slides before buying this one. I'm glad I did because I think I made a good decision. It's a great size for indoors, and while it is light enough for a strong baby to scoot it across the floor, my daughter can still climb and play all over it without it moving (and she doesn't scoot it across the floor even though she could). We bought it for her first birthday, and after about three weeks, she'd mastered the whole thing. The rock wall is a bit tricky, and with socks her feet slip off sometimes, but she can still do it all by herself after teaching her how. She can slide down five foot slides at the park by herself, but still enjoys this little 2 foot slide. So far the durability is great, and she loves it so much she barely plays with anything else in her room now! I would definitely recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very cool indoor toy for 12-24 month olds","review":"My twin boys started climbing all over this thing when we got it for them for their 1st birthday. They quickly leanred to scale the climbing wall and go down the slide. I did wish the slide had more supportive sides and more of a curve, however, but it's still satisfactory. They loved standing on the platform and turning the wheel. They would even stand on the platform and watch their movies. Make sure you tighten the joints as much as possible becuase one of my sons would hold on to the wheel and get the castle rockin', somtimes to the point of almost making it fall over. It was a great way for them to get exercise indoors and it's quite small so it fit inside without taking up too much space. They just turned two and they have out grown it. We have bigge slides and outdoor play equipment and they don't have any interest in this one anymore. But it was worth the money for the time they used it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great 2nd Birthday present","review":"Gave this to my grandson and he loves it.

It reads like it was pasted together.- If the author broke the book into multiple volumes, thebook would benefit. I'd suggest one for digital standards,and one for everything else (interface standards, videobasics, etc.).

Their debut album is excellent if you are looking for a break from everything else you have heard recently. All you need to know is this - the band consists of a stand-up bass, drums, mandolin, electric violin/fiddle, guitar, and wide-ranging vocal stylings (yes slightly reminiscent of Coldplay). The lyrics are understandable and definately relatable and memorable. The songs are catchy, but not quite danceable. They are all great guys and great musicians - and definatly make my \\"hit\\" list."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Addition","review":"This is a great debut effort. I found it very easy to listen to and it is very well produced. This is the perfect addition to anyone's cd portfolio. It is different enough to really fit into a cd compilation for traveling or a party. You can mix this in on any Saturday morning along with your Jack Johnson or Josh Rouse. It has a really Americana feel that is not as far out there as Wilco, but with a gritty feel. It also has a couple of really smooth tracks \\"Stay\\" and \\"Every Ship Must Sail Away\\" that provide a perfect balance. This is a diverse representation of their work without doing something weird or commercial.

I bought this book knowing C/C++ and Unix very well - and expecting to pick up Win32. I was very disappointed. The writing is not clear, it is not well ordered or well presented, it is huge and expensive but somehow doesn't cover many important topics (Personally I think the author bulked it up by putting every single line of code he can in there, even if that line has been repeated in 3 earlier programs). You would be far better off getting Win32 Programming by Rector/Newcomer - I did and have never looked back and now I know Win32 very well. Not only does that book teach Win32, it shows how to do it and keep your code clean. Stay away from Petzold's book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clearly not a reference, perhaps a GUI guide","review":"For a 1,500 page book with a subtitle \\"The definitive guide to Win32 API\\", I found plenty of holes in the API coverage. It's not even the new additions such as DirectX or TAPI, but also what I would expect to be the core features such as file handling and security features (in NT) are simply not mentioned. Most of the book is dedicated to GUI, printing, etc. While it may be an excellent resource in that area (I have not yet ventured in that part of Win32) it is certainly not a complete overview of Win32 API. If nothing else (isn't 1500 pages too wordy for just the graphical part?), the title is misleading.

For anyone starting out with Windows programming, or even people who already know some win32 api stuff, this book is a must-buy! The CD that comes along with the book is extremely useful.

I think the book is not worth $40 because the book is 6 years old, and the material you learn will be outdated soon.

I'm still looking for a book that covers Win32 GUI programming in any significant depth.This book shows you the simplest and most common ways to use the Win32 API but if you want to know more (like, what are the meaning of all of those flags that you can pass to the functions but that this book talks nothing about?), you're best bet is probably the documentation which comes with your win32 compiler (like MSVC++)."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book on the Win32 API, hands-down","review":"This book is by far the best book ever written on the Win32 API. If you are trying to avoid MFC and want to program for Windows the old-fashion way, then look no further.

I really didn't like it. I was learning the Win32 API - perhaps the book is better for experienced Win32 programmers. My primary complaint was that, in the code examples, it presented the material it was trying to illustrate alongside copious amounts of material that had never been discussed. The part you were trying to learn was sandwiched among many unrecognizable things. This fact made the code examples almost worthless to me. In addition, the book leaves out the subject of the Windows Common Controls entirely.There seems to be a shortage of good books on the Win32 API. I don't think the Platform SDK documentation does a good job of helping students learn it either. There is another Win32 API book, Win32 Programming, by Rector and Newcomer, that I liked better than Petzold. I also prefer it to digging through the Platform SDK."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good for C Windows API Programming","review":"This book came to me highly recommended, and I went through the first few chapters very quickly, however I quickly found that much of the book is dedicated to the graphics handlers, which do make up most of the API, however I don't have a lot of use for graphics programming in designing pseudo real time controllers and database type programs.

Just close your eyes, listen to the music, and imagine the epical scenes that Vangelis paint with his composition. Besides the composition, recording is also very fine. After his experimental trials in \\"Direct\\" and \\"The City\\", Vangelis' technique to frame his concept reaches a higher level in this album and \\"Blade Runner\\".

The music almost describes in audible words the action of the film. The movie itself is an excellent and underrated telling of the strengths and flaws of Christopher Columbus.

The initial response to the protagonist is that he is a sensitive, intelligent and together individual. This image begins to evaporate, not when he turns to alternative medicine, but when he has a mad sexual \\"event\\" under the Christmas tree with his practitioner - after a very brief \\"relationship\\" with her. From that point to the end, the author seems determined to prove that this formerly responsible and well respected man is driven only by his hormonal urges. Very disappointing aftert the thrill of \\"Midwives\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not nearly as good as Midwives","review":"I'm not an expert on homeopathy, but I suspect the author isn't either. This story is told in a disjointed way, with many details missing. The reader is required to believe that a good father, lawyer, prosecutor, and person would suddenly decide to go against all that he knows is right by destroying evidence and living a lie in all aspects of his life. I couldn't believe that Leland would do this, and couldn't understand his reasons for doing it. Carissa Lake was an irresponsible homeopath, but didn't suffer any consequences. All in all, the story was disjointed and unbelievable. Midwives was wonderful, but The Law of Similars is very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outrageous Portrayal","review":"This is one of the most poorly- informed books concerning Homeopathy that I have ever picked up. When I saw the title I was excited, being a consultant in Homeopathy, and I bought the hardcover at O'Hare in Chicago to read on a flight. I was very disappointed to see the portrayal of the Vermont homeopath as a kind of \\"woo-woo\\" hippie and the focus on her mistakes. Homeopathy is a serious medical paradigm and most practitioners are serious scientists and conscientious health-care providers.I found it very presumptuous that the author used Samuel Hahnemann's aphorisms from his defining book on Homeopathy, the Organon of Medicine, as introductions to each chapter, since he obviously knows little about this inspired approach to healing. My hope is that readers of this book will not reject Homeopathy from the way it is presented by Bohjalian."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alternative medicine meets Vermont","review":"Chris Bohjalian is a truly amazing storyteller. Once again, he has created a book of wonderfully quirky characters, lovingly (and with humor) portraying life in his adopted home of Vermont. In this book, the story puts in reader in the position of judging a situation in which alternative medicine goes head-to-head with modern medicine, leading to legal repurcussion. Add in a conflicted love interest, and you have this thought-provoking novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow and Not realistic","review":"I found the book to be well written but very slow. The story about alternative medicine seemed realistic. What I found to be difficult to believe is that a man, who has seen a woman only a few times, would put his career on the line to falsify records. There seem to be no real evidence against Clarissa even without changing her patient notes. In addition, after a while the dialogue on Leland's infatuation with Clarissa became tiring. I won't read another book by Chris Bohjalian."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"A disappointing follow-up to \\"Midwives\\". The narrator rambled on for far too long and I found the characters unsympathetic. An interesting premise, but poor follow-through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I had hoped...","review":"After having read \\"Midwives,\\" I was looking forward to Chris Bohjalian's next book, \\"The Law of Similars.\\" Unfortunately, it was dull in comparison to \\"Midwives,\\" a book that kept me so enthralled I practically read it in a single sitting. \\"The Law of Similars\\" seemed to be too trendy and too slow such that I was almost completely disinterested by the time I reached the middle part of the novel when it became more interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Character Study","review":"I like all of his fiction I have read to date. Each story is a character study and yet each character is totally different. With so many \\"formula\\" authors out there, these stories are very refreshing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who's the narrator?","review":"Even if I could relate to Leland Fowler, I didn't like the fact that he told other people's stories through his own eyes, for example the wife of the guy who slips in a coma. Bohjalian is a gifted writer but this book just didn't move me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"So disappointed. I couldn't put down Midwives and thoroughly enjoyed Buffalo Soldiers. Both had realistic characters and thought-provoking situations. But this story felt like another author's work, or pehaps one of his earlier works. I even double checked the print date. Sure, the well-developed ethical dilemmas are there, but his main character was so pathetic and unrealistic. Still can't believe Bohjalian had the widower fall so hard and fast for a woman he barely knows, and I could do without the smutty description under the Xmas tree. Chris, you can do so much better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"Even though I read Midmives by the same author and liked it,this book was nothing like his other book.The subject matter homeopathy is interesting but the plot is far fetched.I also didn't like the fact that the main character is a father of a two year old daughter who just lost his wife and all he thinks about is sex.So if I wanted to read smut like that there are other authors I could have picked."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivating, \\"stay up all night\\" kind of novel","review":"Having read Chris Bohjalian's prior book \\"Midwives\\", and absolutely loving it, I was very anxious to start reading his new book when I discovered it at the local bookstore. This book was very captivating and charming, catching the magical small town environment of Vermont ! It explores the interesting subjects of alternative medicine, while putting his main character, a nice but stressed out attorney who, because of horrible accident, has lost his wife in their prime. The development of the character is wonderful. I plan on reading the rest of this author's books because I love his style. I also highly recommend the book \\"Midwives.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Medicine or Bad?","review":"This fast-moving novel of legal, medical, and ethical dilemas is hard to put down. The characters come alive as the plot thickens and we become enmeshed in the dramas of their lives. Leland Fowler, State Attorney and widower with a four-year-old daughter, meets Carissa Lake, a charming and lovely homeopath who not only cures Leland of his long time ills but who also falls in love with him. Homeopathy, a 200-year-old type of alternative medicine, plays a big part in the story that begins with alternative healing and ends with a unintended death. The question is whether the death is murder. What evoloves from that question is the focus of the book as legal ethics and moral compulsions vie for the top spot in both the office of the State Attorney and in the character's own lives. Definitely a page turner that you can't put down, this novel also sheds light on the field of homeopathy, and its authenticity, as well as on the human heart in all its many manifestations."},{"rating":"2","title":"4 star review","review":"I enjoyed this book a great deal, even though I had some problems with the character of Leland, who seemed both admirable and reprehensible at the same time. He reminded me a bit of Lester in \\"House of Sand and Fog.\\" Both are men who seem completely willing to give up everything to protect a woman they've known for an extremely short period of time. Why Leland, a prosecuting attorney would be willing to break the law, thus risking his career, reputation and most importantly, his daughter, to protect Carissa seemed a bit far-fetched to me. Had they known each other longer, maybe I could understand it. I did find the father/daughter relationship between Leland and Abby quite believable and the book did peak my interest in Homeopathy. Also, the story ended they only way I would have wanted it too. A four star recommendation for this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a guy's book","review":"This is not a guy's boook. The opening is a real downer, which is probably they chose to start the sample pages on page 17. Wish I had read that first, but it was recommended to me by a woman friend. Women will probably love this book, but it takes forever for the author to get into his story, and he is probably the wimpiest guy that ever passed for a hero in modern literature.If you're looking for hard-biting legal stuff, this is not it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Self Same Thing- A Familiar Tune","review":"Sarah Blackwood, the vocal genius behind this highly overlooked musical quartet, brings to light the exact \\"same thing\\" that this band is renound for- deeply emotional and lyrical ballads that evoke absolute feeling through song. Unlike many of the other more upbeat tracks on the band's latest lp \\"disgraceful\\", this ditty reminds us of the slow and hypnotic tunes from their previous albums. \\"Self Same Thing\\" harps on the common theme that weaves through many of the band's songs, relationships gone wrong. This song is just a sampling of the musical delight we have been waiting for since Dubstar's last release in 1997. Though the new album \\"Disgraceful\\" falls slightly short of the two previous lps, with it's techo suggestions and mature approach, it's definetly worth adding to your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helpful How-To for intermediate to Expert users","review":"This book is well-written, covers the basics of intermediate to expert features of excel and is useful as a permanent reference work on the Office 11 series.A comparable book is Microsoft Office Excel 2003 Step-by-Step.

In addition, the index does not make it easy to find items in the book. I find myself hunting and hunting for information. When I find it, it is not particulary clear.

Can't suggest strongly enough if you've not read previous books, give yourself the gift of that joy, and those of us who are fans, let's reread with gusto.The editor's notes and other reviews tell the plot, which is as wacky as the others, but I couldn't let this opportunity pass without thanking folks like Anne George for making us laugh and making us part of Southern Sisters' family. One only hopes others will care for Birmingham's Vulcan the way they do (and all Southerners)! Thanks Anne George and hope there are lots of laughs in Heaven!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Southern Sisters Mystery series","review":"\\"Murder Boogies with Elvis\\" was the last title in this delightful Anne George series, set in Alabama, about two Southern sisters and their capers. If you've ever lived in that part of the country, you'll recognize many of the \\"characters\\", and I do mean \\"characters\\".

Of course, I read the last one first. I was very disappointed to find out she had died but this book is an excellent last book. The story has the typical murder that both \\"Sister\\" and \\"Mouse\\" get involved in. This isn't really the best of the mysteries but I don't read her books for the mysteries. Anne George has a great way of making these two sisters very alive. I sometimes feel when I'm out that just around the corner I will find these two sisters bickering or laughing or just having a good time.As I said this is a good last book. All of the ongoing stories through all of her books are pulled together in the epilogue. Don't try to hard to get involved with the mystery of any of her books since that is not the real story. The real story is how she has all the people interactin between themselves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Murder Boogies With Elvis","review":"This was typical of Ms. George's Southern Sisters Mysteries.

Bitter sweet in the reading as I continued to enjoy the antics of Mouse and Sister, all the while knowing there would be no more. The 8 book series was a delightful read and I so enjoyed sitting down to romp through the Birmingham area with an unlikely pair of sleuths. I will forever wonder what happens to them all and what other troubles the two sisters could have worked their way through Had Ms George continued with us. She and her delightful characters will be missed."},{"rating":"2","title":"English teacher laughs herself silly!","review":"What great stress relief to come home from a long day of teaching English to indulge myself in a chapter of the Southern Sisters before bed each night.

I look forward to many more. What a great break from Oprah's book club!

Ms. George was an excellent and entertaining writer, and MURDER DIRTY BOOGIES WITH ELVIS proves my point perfectly.

We have all the wonderful people there, and our two southern sisters that I have fallen in love with as I've been reading the books. There are 30 Elvis impersonators, a dead body, a missing girl, and anything else that you could want. Even a wedding at the end. I recommend this series highly to cozy lovers. It's the best, and I am going to miss Patricia Ann and Mary Alice very much. I'll miss Woofer and Muffin too."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a Title!","review":"With a title like that, I couldn't resist purchasing this book.

Parents, you need to be easier on your children. Let them at least RENT the game! I mean, even though it has swearing and is a very bad influence (no, you wouldn't act like these people unless you're extremely high), they probably know about everything, the language, and know that it's wrong. I say you should be about 10 to play this. However, do keep in mind that it has very strong sexual themes and a strip club, but it's wrong to immediately turn your kids down on this. It has great replay value and challenging missions. Better than GTA3!

It's defiantely not made for kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply a masterpiece","review":"What can I say, this game is great. I picked it up the day it was released, and have played it ever since. The improvements over GTA3 are the abuility to travel by helicopter, motorcyle, and boat, own businesses, and more interacvtive environments.

There are now 130 vehicles total, including seaplanes, sialboats, motorcycles, and helicopters, as well as many new cars. There are 30 weapons now instead of 15, including a Colt Python, an M60, and the MAC 10.

It has all the good elements of GTA 3, but with more well rounded characters and a better developed plot in a larger, more diverse city. THe game has an excellent replay value and almost never gets old cuz there is always something new to do, from going on killing sprees to exploring the scenery or even playing the missions over again. This game will probably go down with classics such as Super Mario Brothers and Zelda."},{"rating":"2","title":"this game is like that","review":"when i first got this game I was like whoa this grand theft auto vice city is way better than GTAIII. I say this because the city is so big. You have so many places you can go for insane you could go to the mall and buy clothes from gash(gap) or you can just mess with the fake seceruity guards.On vice city when you do the bank job unlike GTAIII you really go in the bank and rob it, not just wait for the people to come out. This one is also better because you can go to the club if you just want to chill or once you buy the strip club you can go there and see some butts bounce up and down. So all I'm saying is that grand teft auto vice city is the best game ever. This game is on point if you like a challenge.//"},{"rating":"2","title":"Vice City review","review":"To start things off if you already have Gta3 then rent this one. Vice city is a Miami like town. You are Tommy Vecetti and you are looking for work. There is one town and two islands to terrorize. You have over 40 weapons ranging from chainsaws to gatling guns. There are motorcycles, convertibles, boats, planes and more to steal. Now you can even purchase buildings, that allow you to save you game in them. But you don't get paid much and buildings (like the malibu club) cost just a couple thousand dollars. Controls are easy and the graphics (while not great) are good. And where are the waves on the beach? Plus the car physics are not good at all. And one more thing all of that fake looking blood. It doesn't look real at all. But I congradulate Rockstar on this instant classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome","review":"I've played this game since it came out on the market, and have not grown tired of it yet.

I have immensely enjoyed the game since I first bought it."},{"rating":"1","title":"As a mother and a grandmother","review":"Please think twice before buying this game for a young child. This is one case where you can not always get what you want. My grandson got this gift from 'santa' and I'm very disappointed. Santa did not look at the rating or the contents. I'm very pleased that the game makers do put the ratings out there but as parents and grandparents, we need to follow the advice of the ratings. This game is not for the youngsters.Yes, I do agree that its the parents responsibilities to teach the child the difference between a game and real life. And yes, I do realize that a child will see much more on a made-for-tv movie. However, I control what is on my tv. And I won't even let my 15 year old son own this one. Now if it was designed that the player is the detective trying to solve the crimes it would be different. That would make it a great game."},{"rating":"1","title":"INAPPROPRIATE FOR CHILDREN","review":"As a school counselor of 3-5th grade age, I am appalled at how many of my students aged 8-10 are playing such a violent game that includes killing police, going to strip joints and being porno directors.

Compared to Grand Theft Auto III, Vice City has better graphics, new weapons and vehicles (including motorcycles) and brand-name music.

Is is not a game that is suitable for anybody who is of an age where they are so hugley influenced by what they see. Unless of course you think car-jackings are cool, murder is COOL, Killing cops is Cool, Breaking the law is Cool, massacring cities is cool, et cetera. This game rewards your child for the shear amount of destruction that they can create. If I was the manufacturer of this video game, I could not live with myself. It is of utter dissatisfaction to me that this game is so highly popular in our country. I hope that you do not choose to support something that will so awfully influence your child.

I've never played it or seen any screen shots, but it will be awesome so I am giving it five stars based on nothing other than gta3.\\" You realize that it affects the overall customer review average, and if the game comes out and isn't that great, the review average will be higher than what it should be because of people writing reviews way too early. Wait until the game comes out and you've played it to give your opinion on it. It makes no sense in wasting people's time and possibly money by doing this.

The world (the city in the title) is pretty extensive and you can roam where ever you want, that's cool. But to accomplish the tasks assigned to you, you're basically doing more of the boring old race car garbage. You're either chasing or being chased. Pretty uninspired, but that seems to be the threshold to which game developers aspire.Save your money.

Tommy Verceti's movements on foot are horrible.* Cheesy animations between missions. Characters are drawn horribly, with arms that look like flippers.* Horrible artificial intelligence. Cops pursuing you will just as likely kill each other before getting you.* Horrible physics. You can jump from a 200-foot building and live, but if you fall into three feet of water you will drown.And so many more examples.NOTE: I said this is what makes SOME games bad, BUT ....THIS IS WHAT MAKES GTA:VC SO GREAT!All of the above examples almost seem like they were intentional in the game.

If you don't, however, you might want to think twice about buying this game. As for the game itself, it is incredible. This game should be no less than a perfect five stars and if it is, then it's either because some over-protective parent who is too stupid to make sense of game ratings was horrified when they saw little Billy killing people, or because some moron who is too stupid to understand the game bought it just because \\"violence is cool,\\" and they wanted to shoot people.

I could have used a better sense of aquiring weapons and different types of vehicle abilities. But, I love the indoor capabillities and the fact that there is 80's music.

The cars on this game are really good you get 120 vehciles you get to take cars like vipers, lamberginies, jagaurs, and motercycles. You can go in over 50 buildings like malls, dinners (to regain energy), discos, and hotels and don't you even think about damageing any of these buildings or you'll be looking at a big fat construction fine! So can you see why I say this game is the best game ever invented!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thugged out","review":"This game is highly recommended for all PS2 owners, save for the lil' kiddies. The gameplay mechanics are refined with the addition of the extremely useful crouch (L3) button and the ability to look behind yourself while in a vehicle (L2&R2). Having your vehicles' tires blown out also adds a depth of realism to the driving physics and works well. So far, the meat cleaver is my personal favorite weapon. Injuring a pedestrian causes him/her to bleed profusely and leave traces of blood as they run away, which facilitates tracking them down. I also like the ability to purchase business properties. At the end of the day, you could stop by the business and collect an income. Overall, this game will definitely leave a mark in video game history."},{"rating":"2","title":"great game for kids","review":"this is the best game for kids under the age of 10.my son played it and he loved it. he siad its the coolest game he ever saw. he asked what it was ratted i said its rated M for mega fun"},{"rating":"2","title":"worth buying a PS2 for","review":"this game rocks i first played this at a freinds house and beggedfor it on christmas and i was in luck because toys r us had a day afterthanksgiving sale it was a bundle pack it came with a PS2 a PS2starter kit wich included an extra controler a dvd control and aextension cable 2 games GTA vice city and should havetony hawk 4 but they ran out so i had a choice for any other game in the store so i chose wwe smackdown 4 and boy am i glad idid in other words if you are at least 13 go buy this game you can do almost anything on it beleave me it is worth it"},{"rating":"2","title":"GRAND VICECITYISH FUN!","review":"My god, this game is awfully great!

This game can get very addictive, but...It's often annoyingly and excessively difficult. The weapons controls are very counter-intuitive and, even when mastered, often don't work very well. On many missions I have had to play it over and over, maybe 20 times, before I succeeded. On some I had to use the \\"slow game\\" cheat code to beat it. I've never had to do that on other games.I do recommend this game, but prepare to be annoyed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for little kids","review":"This game may be cool but too violent.

A lot of us complain about the BS in the world and never do anything about it. Well you can do little things, like not pander to gaming companies who take a perfectly fun concept - stealin' cars and haulin' *ss and add such cheesy violence against women. I'm guessing the guys at 'Rockstar' don't get to go on many dates.Look I've got a little sister, and I don't want the boys at her school growing up playing games like this. The only way Rockstar will take the woman bashing out of their games is if we don't buy them till they do.

It's Ps2 only for a year or 2 until they make a PC or Xbox versian. This might tempt me to buy a PS2 which I can easily afford. I'm a serious 11 year old gamer you loves 1st person shooters.

Another plus to Vice is the freedom that you have"},{"rating":"2","title":"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City --- Great shoot up game and more","review":"This is a game you must own, if your into shoot'em games. The only complaint I have is that when the sun goes down it is very hard to see in front of you and it is really bad when driving fast.

Once you beat it, it gets kinda boring but you'll find something fun to do. It is not as good as GTA3 in terms of city layout, but still is still jaw-dropping. The music is great for people who lived in the 80's but I like the regular made up music in previous GTA's. I still like the various cars and extensive amount of missons. It all makes a very good, ownable, and fun game for people who like to commit crime in games."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great game","review":"This is a great follow up to gta 3.

The store clerk made it clear that it was a good choice because the amount of people coming in to his store to buy the game would be rediculous. With all new weapons, places to go, gameplay, characters, and ways to move about the city...this game is sure to be the year's best seller. Grand Theft Auto 3 was one of the best games in the history of Playstation 2...just think about what this game could become. I'm going to pick it up the day it comes out.

But I can, and my parents and I feel that I'm mature enough to play it. But honestly, don't let your kids near it if you don't like the sound of blood, lots of it. Violence, lots of it. Language, there's some of it, not as bad as in most R rated movies, but there is some of it. Now that that's all out of the way, this game is great. So far, I've played for around 5 hours, and I'm only 6 % done the game, that's how big this game is.

Even if you finish all of the missions you can still go around and kill people.Its not that i think Vice City's gonna be bad, i actually think its gonna be as good as GTA3 if not better.

The missions are more creative rather than just \\"find so and so and kill them\\". There is so much you can do in this game like for instance you can take a part time job being a pizza delivery guy but thats all I'll give away. Sometimes I find myself just standing around watching the people interact with each other until a big group of thugs gets in the fight and when its over, you can take all their weapons and money.But thats just the tip of the iceberg.

Well let me list the pros and cons for this game.Pros:1) The story is rich and detailed, with many plot twists and for once good voice acting.2) Nice cars.3) Variety in missions make the game fun at all times.4) Very good music that never gets dull.Cons:1) THe cars tip a little to easily (even with improved driving on)2) Laslo, Tony, and Fernando from Grand Theft Auto 3 are back and as annoying as ever.SO if this in some ways doesn't help out to much than just go out and rent it (if you can) because this is another nomminee for best game of the year (the only other two thus far are Kingdom HEarts and Timesplitters 2)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vice City vs. San Andreas","review":"To people with neither Vice City nor San Andreas: Be sure to buy VC before SA. Vice City is far more enjoyable than San Andrea due to the great characters across the whole game, the missions and the overall feel of the game. Also VC as a city is far more entertaining than the drab and boring Los Santos. I have not yet got to the other 2 cities but the fake Miami is a hundred times better than the fake LA.The characters in VC are funnier, the missions are more interesting, and the overall experience gives the game a better feel whereas the characters in SA, across the board, are boring and lame and the missions are extremely tedious and often times boring.While San Andreas allows you to do more than Vice City, I guarantee you that you will have a far better time doing less in Vice City than you will doing endless missions and Sim City rip-offs in San Andreas.Definitely choose Vice City over San Andreas if you're looking for a fun game."},{"rating":"2","title":"GTA VICE CITY","review":"IF YOU LIKE GUNS, HOOKERS, EXPLOSIONS, AND KILLIN' LIKE I DO,THEN THIS GAME IS FOR YOU!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This game rocks 4\\\\22\\\\05","review":"this game kicks ass!

It makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. The characters are dull and didn't have much thought put into them, and the same thing with the missions. They are either too hard or too easy. Most of them, however, are dull and boring as ever.Second, people say that the objective of the game is to beat it without using cheats, but I believe it is to get a ton of property. The game focuses way too much on what house you own. Personally, I could care less about what I own. it just deducts from the money I make.Finally, it is obvious that the focus of this game was not on the quality, but how much you can do. They put all of their effort into making the radio stations and designing clothes, rather than making the game fun. I really did not enjoy playign this game."},{"rating":"2","title":"gta vice city","review":"This is a cool game but is a bad game i don't recomend this for children under 15. it has a lot of foul language and you can do a lot of bad stuff. like pick up prostitutes and enter strip clubs. it is fun and addicting but bad.it has good graffics but no start menu it just loads and you start playing. there is no 2 player mode u cant save it wenever you want you half to get to a save point. i like this game but i don't recomend this for children."},{"rating":"2","title":"GtA Rock on (-:","review":"This game totally rocks!

Anybody who played GTA3 knows how difficult these could be.3. The fonts look like ...4. The map is distorted and difficult to read5.

Any parents seeking to vigourously demonstrate their inability to tell their children \\"no;\\"2. Any parents who want to show the extent to which they have divested themselves of bringing up their kids w/any kind of respect for others;3. Any parents who are mostly focused on teaching their children how to satisfy their more primitive urges through violent, immediate gratification;4. Any parents who are actively cultivating sociopathy in their children...This is THE game!This is a hot seller for all of the above reasons, so get to the store before they're sold out... push some people over and step on them, if you have to.If you're interested in trying to teach your kids a value system that's different from the current culture's, you will be profoundly disappointed in, and disgusted by, this game."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best game on the planet","review":"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City is the best game every made it even better than the third one witch is also one of the best games every made i love all the violence in the game it so fun...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get off the couch","review":"If you can't get a date with a real girl, because you don't have a car, then this game is for you.

I can only see one thing wrong with this game, as all you guys remember we all played GTA 3 countless hours on end knowing nothing would be achived in the game just for pure fun. Vice city really doesn't have that same quality. Once you complete the main strand of missions the game runs a little dry. Just my opinion but if your looking for like a 2 week thrill i recomend it but if you want the countless hour play i would save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Game Much Fun","review":"It is hard to complete missions because you'll spend so much time just 'adventuring' and creating havoc.

I love driving down the road, crashing into cars listening to 'Nina- 99 Luft Balloons'. The control is the same as the original, but somehow seems more precise.

There are so many things that you can do from sight-seeing to flying war helicopters to blow cars up. By the way if you do enough of those helicopter missions than you will get armor from it.

O WOW THAT REALLY MATTERS. i just think that gta 3 is more up to date in time, but this game has so many extras its just amazing! this is just a great game and the only flaw is the blurry graphics. this game is the best overall game and i recommend it 2 anyone who knows wat a stripper of hooker is. thanks for reading my review"},{"rating":"2","title":"a true masterpiece","review":"When i think back of all the games i've played over the years, vice city sticks out as one of them, and for good reason too.This game is just a masterpiece hands down, i probably played this over 1000 hours just because it never got boring.Grand theft auto: vice city"},{"rating":"2","title":"......","review":"Well of course it has a lot of violence its rated \\"M\\" for mature :P So it is to violent for young ones but thats why its rated M to tell adults its violent and stuff.

Therefore GTA VC is heaven sent. My only complaint about this game is it's kinda easy to beat. After you've completed all the main missions which only accounts for 50% of full completion, there's not much else left to do. The remaining half of the game consists of side missions like picking up cab passengers which to me is not nearly as exciting as planning schemes to kill gang members.

In Vice City, everywhere looks similar. And cars and outfits in the 80's just do not look very appealing.They should've chosen LA where there are Crenshaw district, Compton, Santa Monica, Hollywood, Beverly Hills, East LA, Chinatown, and Koreatown for the different feel of the city, and please, choose today instead of the 80's!They did not do a good job in the design of the missions either.I've completed about 20 missions and the missions have been kind of boring.

Johnny Van Zandt is not as good as his brother, who could write beautiful lyrics and a wide variety of songs. Today's Skynyrd makes some horrible country rock fusion gone bad that try's to play on some tough image. The old skynyrd created hard rock songs like Free Bird, country songs like Gimme Three Steps and Whats your Name, and alsoo sensitive songs like Tuesdays gone with the wind and Simple Man. I am a huge Skynyrd fan but this album just doesnt measure up to the standards set by the real band."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Follow-Up","review":"Ah, the second Skynyrd album since the crash. This album to me is just as good as Skynyrd:1991, and maybe a little better. To me, this album does not qualify as southern rock, though. This album is probably the most country-influenced album Skynyrd has done. It has a few hard-rockers, but for the most part, this is a country album (which is fine with me).Some of the main hilights on this one are: \\"One Thing\\", \\"Outta Hell In My Dodge\\", & \\"Born To Run\\". There aren't really any songs on this album that I don't like. About half of the songs I would give 4-5/5, and the other half no lower than 3/5. If you liked 1991, buy this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Skynyrd purchase","review":"The Last Rebel by Lynyrd Skynyrd was great. It showed the true southern roots rock-n-roll by an excellent band. It lets you know that they have other songs other than the popular ones you hear on the radio. It was nice that you could preview the songs at Amazon prior to purchase. Definitely recommended for the true \\"Skynyrd Fan\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Born to Rock ....","review":"This album is great musically. No southern band puts together a tighter combination of sound with vocals, guitars, keyboards, bass, percussion, and background vocals. Lynyrd Skynyrd is pretty consistent album to album, which is kinda of my problem with them. They have a tendency to have similar melodies and rhythms with similar themes lyrically. Their albums sound alike and can be monotonous.I would not put this album up there with more recent releases such as God and Guns (I could listen to this every day) or Vicious Cycles or even older stuff such as Second Helping.However, it is worth a listen and if you can get it for a good price, worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfully romantic coming-of-age picture","review":"I remember watching this movie in my early teens (edited TV version), and being taken by the no-nonsense, decent storyline and a great performance by William Katt. The story was probably more original when it first came out, but all the choices we make, how luck drastically changes things we cannot control, being crazy in love only to lose your beloved one for one reason or another struck a nice cord. The ending is one of the best endings in my memory for a romantic movie. Without giving much away, I remember thinking that if I was in the position of Katt's character, I would have made the same choice. A decent nostalgic film from late 70's about the innocence and vulnerability of young lovers learning about life, with beautiful photography involving college campus scenes in the fall. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Melanie C,me dance!(lol)","review":"this is a great work of musically art the lyrics are well done every remix as well as the album version are well crafted .This is song turned me into a Melanie C fan it is a club record with soul at the core a luv song with a techno core if u will. pick up the austrilian import of this single better value with full length remixes.... check out what Victoria Beckham is doing also it is very good also.....Be well every 1 and enjoy Mel s best record to date"},{"rating":"2","title":"TOP-NOTCH FAST PACE SUSPENSE!","review":"Annie's novel \\"Like a Knife\\" is the wonderfully written suspense story of Rachel Goodman, who as a yound child witnessed the murder of her mother.

A couple of tracks could have been done more imaginatively, but most of them are a lot of fun.

Her voice doesn't sound dated at all and she could have been recorded yesterday."},{"rating":"1","title":"Marylin remixed","review":"While there are one or two reasonably good remixes; most though are generally electronic drum beats behind some of the original backing.

After a while, all you will hear are the drum-beats. The shame of it is that it would be interesting to hear her voice without the original instrumentation (all those 1950's violins and saxophones). But what we get here will bore you on the second listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent overview of cooperation and selfishness","review":"I have to say, I did not expect to like this book at all. A book that takes on such familiar themes as the selfish gene theory, but cooperation, competition, and gossip is fine, but this book goes into economics, politics (conservative and liberal) , human history, the actions of presidents... and does it very, very, well. This is truly an incredible book. Along with Jared Diamond's \\"The Third Chimpanzee\\", and Richard Dawkins \\"The Selfish Gene\\", this belongs on EVERYONE'S shelf. Your jaw will drop at the concepts involved in this ground-breaking book, and it will stay with you long after you finish it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining, but a little suspect.","review":"Ridley started off well, but didn't quite manage to pull me along all the way. I have no problem with sociobiological tough mindedness, in fact I'm all for it, as dynamite under moral-philosophical silliness about categorical moral imperatives and objective moral absolutes. However I've read better presentations than this, and I found just irritating the way an apology for Thatcherite conservatism is snuck in towards the end, in a new fangled version of Social Darwinism that is more simple than tough minded. Credit where credit is due though, it is definitely good in parts, and there are lots of entertaining facts. I'm told that his book on the origins of sex is better."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful book for anyone interested in genetics, sociology and psychology","review":"a very enjoyable reading. a lot of human behaviors and phenomena of societies explained with evolution and genetics.

The last 1/4 is another case of an expert launching himself into outer philosophy space.This happens to a lot of authors. Here, Ridley spends many chapters relating good science and drawing good conclusions, but near the end the scientific basis for his claims falls slowly away and you are left reading more and more stuff that is less and less supportable. The line is not clearly drawn, so the reader is unguided. That is a shame, because a good scientist should be absolutely perspicacious in delineating this.The book is well written, and I'd be delighted to spend time with this author. But you needs to build a defensive attitude and keep your critical thinker cap firmly in place."},{"rating":"2","title":"worth sticking with it","review":"I nearly gave up on this book at a little over the half way point. While he explores a number of interesting angles in the first half, it seems that all of them end up being blind alleys. It was worth staying with it, because his final answer comes (perhaps surprisingly) not out of biology or game theory, but anthropology. The first half is educational and interesting in its own right, but the latter half of the book is where he gets to his real points.It's true that he does allude to political anarchism, or perhaps mini-anarchism, which I do not agree with (and which he does not make a particularly good case for anyway). But he does lay out a good case for free markets, which some of us strongly agree with.Warning, if your political/philosophical leanings are at all left/socialist, you probably won't like this book very well...."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you're considering retiring early","review":"If you're getting ready to retire and only want to read one book this would make a great choice. It's comprehensive and very good advice. I recently retired at 54. If you're able to do it, my advice is to go ahead and do it. No one died regretting not having worked longer, not having done more e-mail or attended more business meetings. My blood pressure has dropped 20 points and my outlook hasn't been this good in decades."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much use for this product","review":"It worked well in my garage, but once on the road, the signal is quickly taken over by a radio station. It only gives four options to chose from and if those stations have a good signal, you cannot use the Car Kit. I am considering removing my antenna to see if I can purposely lose the radio signal and still pick up the Car Kit signal. Maybe in remote areas (mountains) it would work okay."},{"rating":"1","title":"it didn;t work for me","review":"I bought it and it worked GREAT for about a month.

First of all, there's no instructions that came along with the product, but only the flimsy cardboard. I fiddled with this item for almost an hour trying to get it to work. Finally, in the end, the sound quality is so bad that it wasn't even worth buying this product. It was in the way of my gears and lemme tell ya, it was hard to shift gears! Again, READ REVIEWS AND DO NOT PURCHASE THIS ITEM!"},{"rating":"2","title":"clunky but worth it","review":"It was totally worth the sale I got it for... It's pretty clunky but if you don't mind it being aesthetically not pleasing, it's a good deal. It functions well (better than other car kits I've tried) and I don't have to keep an eye on it while driving."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks great, functions horribly","review":"Several problems with this product. The main being that the sound quality of the FM transmitter is horrible. It doesn'tbroadcast stereo sound all the time, and unless you plan on sitting in your car in one area where you get a good signal, prepare to have the sound quality vary greatly. I also found I got a better signal when I held the transmitter in my hand or wrapped foil around it, which looks horribly.Bottom line, do not buy this expecting to have your ipod play through your car speakers just like your radio. In fact, there are very few FM transmitters that will give you flawless sound. If you want good \\"consistent\\" quality, you are going to have to use a casette deck transmitter which provides a direct line into your ipod. But out of the many FM transmitters I've tried, this is the worst."},{"rating":"1","title":"Functions as a decent holder, charger.","review":"This product works fine as a holder and charger for my iPod (4G) in my 98 Jetta. However, as an FM transmitter, the sound quality ranges anywhere from fair to poor. I still use my cassette adapter for sound input."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fried My Car's Circuits!","review":"I was using this iPod adapter for a few days when suddenly my car started to behave extremely strangely -- the clock stopped working, the central locking system failed, the door alarm went off all the time (even when the door was closed), and the RADIO STOPPED PLAYING ALTOGETHER!When I took it to an electrical auto specialist, he checked my fuses and found that the 3-in-1 had actually FRIED my fuse. He swapped the fuse out, told me never to use that piece of junk again, and everything worked properly. This no-name product is total garbage and for that matter dangerous. Use at your own risk if you are foolish enough to buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Steamy Pile of...Well...You Know...","review":"This is on par with having nothing except a bit more expensive.

I could live with this IF it did not produce a strong shissing sound when used. I tried all the pre set channels. They all did the same thing :-( I tried different types of musice to see if it just one track. But I got the same very loud shissing sound no matter what I played.

Poor quality, not useful at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it!","review":"I used to have a traspod...which is an expensive transmitter (paid nearly $100 for it) which used to work great, up until it broke as I was removing it. I decided to shop for a new one online, and when I came across this product I didn't believe it would be as good since it was being sold so cheap! I was so glad when I received it because not only does it play clear sound but I can use it without removing my iSkin. I have the ipod mini and with my old transmitter you would have to fit it inside and i always had to remove my iSkin (which became a nuisance since I would use my ipod inside and outside my car)...but with this product there is no need. Highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bait and Switch","review":"The description of this product specifically states \\"CTA Digital 3-in-1\\" device in several places. The ONLY reason I ordered was because of the CTA description. Now that I received the product I find that it is a no name, off brand product.

The reception was poor and the minute I drove off from my drive way, I could hear the broadcast of the pre-selected radio station. A friend of mine told me that she experienced the same, but bought the one that can be plugged into the cassette slot. I unfortunately only have a CD player in my car so this won't work for me. My advice: do your research before investing in ANY product intended to allow you to play your IPOD in your car. Keep in mind you will be \\"plugging\\" into a radio station that is not widely broadcast and will most likely have really crappy reception. I'll stick to my CD player."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work","review":"When you try to attach it to the car does not fit properly and in any curve or speed change the ipod goes to the floor of the car."},{"rating":"1","title":"This item is horrible","review":"I have to admit, the price of this item got me. It's now 40 bucks down the drain as it has failed to work completely. It worked for about 8 months but was very fuzzy. The quaility was that of an AM radio station. Recently, it quit working altogether so now I am back in the market for one that will work."},{"rating":"1","title":"CTA Digital 3 in 1 Car Kit for iPod","review":"Unfortunately I did not read the reviews before I purchased this unit...I was caught up in my new Christmas present...so I bought the car charger/transmitter. With only 4 FM setting choices to select from, I was unable to get the unit to play through my truck radio's FM stations. But, I did find out how great Amazon's return policy is and I returned the unit postage free the day after I got it. I'm still looking for a charger/transmitter. I bought a Belkin today but, the static is loud in the background and it does not charge the Ipod...only runs the Belkin transmitter. It drops the FM signal which, in turn, blows out your ears with the static that a non-transmitting station does when your radio is on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"item didn't work","review":"Unfortunately the item didn't work.

The convenience of playing music from the Ipod in the car, while charging the battery, is a blessing. Doing so without the hassel of wires and cords is an added benefit. I recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"No feeling, though great sound & music","review":"The previous reviewer who compared this version and the old Callas version to new and old Ferrari's was exactly correct. The old Ferrari, though it has not as good TECHNICAL qualities due to the advances in technology, it has real feeling and charisma, just like Callas's Tosca. This new version has really awesome sound and music, but the singing was weak, and lacked the fantastic feeling that Callas provided. Besides, the recording quality of the Callas version isn't really that bad, though side-by-side, the Callas version sounds compressed.I strongly prefer Callas because to me, Opera is about feeling and drama, not how clear the recording is... getting a stellar recording is just the icing, not the cake."},{"rating":"1","title":"Questionable casting... PERIOD!!!","review":"Wow, it's not every day that you get to hear some of the worst casting ever in Puccini's most melodramatic opera. This is my favorite opera in the entire Puccini repertoire, and this recording is a flat-out embarrassment to the Maestro.I can't stand the Sacristan's incessant dips in everything he sings... IT'S ANNOYING! And Alagna, whom is my favorite Rodolfo in his recording of La Boheme (which he also did with Gheorghiu), is using way too much shaky vibrato in \\"Recondita armonia.\\" It seriously makes me dizzy, like I'm in a boat caught in a torrent on the high seas of the Atlantic!!! He's just plain silly about it! I think he just likes hearing himself.Not much can be said for this most unremarkable of recordings... this is a huge black eye on the part of EMI, and I'm more than happy to bring it to everyone's attention before they make the mistake of buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Questo e il Bacio di Tosca!","review":"Angela Gheorghiu is the worst lyric soprano ever. I've never heard anybody sing \\"questo e il bacio di Tosca\\" like that, it's too loud, even louder than Leontyne Price's RCA recording. I don't like it! Gheorghiu is not acting like herself here. She tends to act like Teresa Stratas at times for no good reason. No soprano should ever sing the \\"Questo e il bacio di Tosca\\" to Scarpia like that and Zinka Milanov will tell you so. Maria Callas will also. That's the limit of how those sopranos should sing it, not scream it! Stupid Gheorghiu, she is too dramatic. Period!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleased","review":"Very pleased with these tweeters. Installed facing upwards from dash and made a dramatic difference in my cars sound. Exactly what I was looking for. They are very very loud though, and I had to build an enclosure over them to turn them down a little. If you have some sort of crossover it would help so you can turn these suckers down.If your building a budget system like I was, and you're looking for more highs in your sound, these will not dissapoint.

My 1,000 gallon pond was a murky green before i installed this filter. in less than two days it is crystal clear. I hooked it up to a laguna clear flo 900 gph pond pump. I think that was important as this particular pump was capable of handling larger particles. The only reason I did not give it five stars is that the water outflow nozzle is larger than a 1.25 inch and smaller than a 1.5 inch. I had to buy and fit a specialty hose so I could run an outflow line and not use the unit as a waterfall. I have a separate pump and hose for the waterfall. Also, it comes with the filter pad and the lava rock, but it would not have taken much to also include the plastic biological media which goes in the third stage. I had to buy that separately also. overall, the filter works very well, I would definitely recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Traditional style country","review":"John Michael is truly a great country singer. A voice at times reminiscent of Garth Brooks, but more traditional than Garth. This album contains some great good ol' country tunes. The sad ballads to love songs, to up-tempos. \\"I love the way you love me\\" was a big hit, and my personal favourite from the album. It was also later covered by Boyzone. This album was recorded in 1992 (I think it was his debut, but don't hold me to that), and he is still going strong."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete and utter crap","review":"I watched this movie after some off the beaten track review that said this was a avant guard movie and had scenes.But this has to be one of the worst movies that I have seen, on a rating out of ten I would give it a minus 10."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just ok","review":"2white mesh filters do not catch enough fine matter, ie algae.

All his characters are completely scripted. The bad guys always lose, the hero's can all jump tall buildings in a single bound and they always win and get that girls in the most ethical way possible, LOL.McKiernan is also horrible at foreshadowing or having any twists whatsoever in his books. Everything is completely scripted and you can predict the outcome of every battle or situation before it even happens.While the Iron Tower Trilogy was decent at a very childish level The Silver Call Duology is just pure garbage, pure dribble, and worthless from the first page to the last.I judge books on how quickly I want to read them again and how good they were the second time through, but these books aren't even worth reading completely the first time through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tolkien clone","review":"This book would be very engaging and enjoyable to anyone who has not read the Hobbit or Lord of the Rings, but in that case I would just encourage you to read the Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings! This book is an INCREDIBLY blatant mimic of Tolkien's classics, from place and character names to the plot (dwarves enlisting the help of halflings to reclaim an ancestral foretress); even phrasing and narrative techniques are strikingly similar. In places lines are very nearly verbatum, and I am utterly amazed that he was even able to get this printed.

This string is much thicker than the original. The originall had a separate groove or gutter for each string. This only has one. The two strings are stuck together when spooled and are supposed to separate as it unwinds (Like some licorice does). I don't like this design. One of these two things seems to make the motor work harder than it did before and the motor is stalling more frequently. It's having problems unwinding, probably because of one of the two issues above.Also, the thicker string means that it appears to be much shorter than the original, meaning I'll have to replace it sooner.When I have to replace it again, I'll look for something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Want to make your own patterns for your clothing needs?","review":"A very hands on approach to create your own clothing.

Now she is a cowgirl, her latest video showing disrespect for the law and the aged.' What it feels like for a girl' like most of her videos, projects immorality glamourized.

Shame on you Madonna!....You are now a mother and I can't believe that you would stoop to this horrible homage to violence instead of taking this great song of yours and making a beautiful video.A definite miss, however the dance single remixes are excellent.I may be contradicting here, but the music is great, however the video ruined my image of what a great song this was."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breathtaking and emotional","review":"I felt very emotional after viewing this video.

The first track is hysterical and probably worth your time, but the humor seems to wain shortly after. It's simply one of the worst albums I've ever heard in my entire life. It's so ridiculous it's awesome. The band tries to mask their inadequate songwriting with frequent flashy solos that have absolutely no meat to them. Technically they aren't even impressive. I can't tell you how many times the guitarists repeat the same riffs in their solos. What they are good at is double picking vamps.There are strong similarities between certain passages in this album and Celine Dion. I'm not kidding. How can these guys have the balls to get the \\"more metal than thou\\" platform? Let's not even get into the lyrics.

The dutch oven is very sturdy and well enameled. I got the cafe color and the color is nice and vibrant. I especially like the white enameled interior of the pot and lid - that makes it easier to see what you are cooking. It was well packaged and arrived in perfect condition and exactly on time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Meets expectations.","review":"Bought this for my fiancee, who has been mentioning she wanted a dutch oven. This arrived quickly, packed well, exactly as advertised. It is fully enameled, including the black rim (the instructions say this is not exposed iron). I chose the cafe color, because it was the best match for my cherry kitchen cabinets. Turns out, the color matches pretty well. The oven is very heavy, appears to retain heat for a long time, and was easy to clean. My only knock is that the knob on the lid is attached by a simple screw, and the instructions warn this may need to be tightened over time. Small thing, but worth mentioning. We're very happy with the purchase, and do not feel it necessary to buy a Le Creuset."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good cookware","review":"I bought this dutch oven with high hopes that it would be just like my Le Creuset dutch oven for MUCH less, but that was not the case. Perhaps I am just picky, but I did notice differences in the construction as well as in the enamel itself. The enamel was not as smooth and therefore not as easy to clean as Le Creuset. It did cook evenly and at a lower temperature. I have several traditional (non-enameled) pieces of Lodge Cast Iron pans that have been with me for years, and honestly, I like them better than this pot. I give it 4 stars since I am a life long fan of Lodge products. I also think that enameled cast iron is a great thing. Maybe this will grow on me with time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very easy to use","review":"These Dutch Ovens ar very easy to use as they don't require special cleaning and oiling effort.

But, the glazing chips very easily. I've hot it only a few months, and taken good care by not using sharp utensils and storing it without stacking anything on it or placing other pots next to it. But, it already has 3 minor chips on the exterior. These don't impact cooking but they are unsightly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"Perfect shape and size for all of my one-pot meals.

They were not exactly a perfect fit. Plus on the box it does not tell you that the toy only attaches to certain types of seats in the car.

We would not recommend this to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sucks!!!!","review":"I actually bought this toy for my baby.

Whiteman is best known today as the man who gave Bing Crosby (then with the Rhythm Boys) his first big break, but the songs on this album don't feature Bing, just joyous Whiteman orchestral music.

Lowell is one of those writers who are often pushed down your throat as being \\"The Most Important Poet Ever!\\" by college professors and I have to admit that this attitude lead me to resist reading further.I want to say that this was a mistake, because of how much I enjoyed this book, but I'm not sure how well I could have appreciated these poetry books had I been younger. They are not simple about anything they touch-- not histories (public or private), not love, not death, not depression. They are complicated words that are painted in detailed layers, so the richness gets deeper the longer you look. The setting is so subtle that when Lowell does say something overt, it comes as a distinct shock.I didn't want to stop reading the book when it was over, and went back and started reading the poems again-- it was that compelling."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of America's finest poets at the peak of his powers.","review":"In LIFE STUDIES, published in 1959, Lowell described his experiences growing up in a prominent Boston family, using a style so intimate and revealing that it became known as \\"confessional poetry.\\" Four years later came FOR THE UNION DEAD, in which he used the same style to address social themes as well as personal ones. Together, these two books constitute a watershed in modern American poetry. In a host of poems, including \\"Beyond the Alps,\\" \\"Skunk Hour,\\" and \\"For the Union Dead,\\" Lowell created a style that was colloquial and contemporary, but echoed the grandeur of a poetic tradition running back to Shakespeare. Of all the American poets to emerge since the war, few have had the wide-ranging influence of Lowell and a young student of his named Sylvia Plath. This is a book that every literate American should know."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love smoked salmon!","review":"That being said, this reminds me of smoked salmon, although not as good.

Indeed, re-reading the Prof's pompous and confused ramblings on Slate.com - and they are worth re-reading just to try and decode what he is trying to say - I am convinced he merely feels upsatged by this worthy newcomer.

I was hoping to have my daughter take pictures with it and maybe get one or two pictures that we could print and show as her first attempts. However, we have made this just a simple toy instead of a usable camera for pictures. Expensive toy camera. I would have paid a little more for one that had any quality of picture that matches the technological age :)Bottom line - if you want a toy that acts like a camera and that is durable, then this should suit your needs, if you want a camera you can use to print photos, by a new state of the art camera for your family and give your older one to your 3 year old."},{"rating":"2","title":"teaching kids to see things their way","review":"i work in a custom portrait studio and find myself keeping an eye on the kids while their folks look at photos. we watch tv and read etc, but their new favorite thing is to take their own pictures with the kid kamera i got online for them. they LOVE it. i LOVE it/ we have so much fun taking pics of each other, siblings, whatever. it is so awesome to \\"see through a child's eye\\". i've had this camera for about 2 months and so far it has been perfect. the only thing is the kids have to stand pretty still when they take the shot and also using the dual eye viewfinder tends to cut off heads. i have them use the lcd screen and stand still until they get what they want. this is usually just fine. i will be recommending it in our newsletter as a must have for all \\"my\\" kids this year.thanks fisher price! oh and we've dropped it a couple times and it works just like it did out of the box."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good beginners camera","review":"I was hesitant to buy this becasue of all the other negative reviews I read here.

I'd pay $10 for this toy, but feel ripped off at the current price."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a horrible camera for its price.","review":"It takes horrible pictures. Pictures are blurry, color-tinted. Worst of all, that viewfinder that Fisher Price advertised as kid friendly is its worst feature! What you see through the viewfinder is not what goes onto the memory. We got one for my 5 yr old daughter and I kept telling her that she should not cut people's heads off from the picture. After a few lectures on how she should see all of her subject in the viewfinder to no avail, I decided to try the camera - and guess what? I cut her head off, too. Only 75 % of what you see in the viewfinder goes through the actual lens of the camera. I, as an adult, can learn to compensate but try teaching kids how to compose pictures with such a handicap. It was a big disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Five year olds LOVE it!","review":"I read a lot of negative things about this camera in these reviews, but I went with my initial plans and bought each of my twins one for their fifth birthday.

They used them for the first time yesterday and spent the entire day taking pictures of my flower garden, the cat, each other...pretty much anything they could find. The kids couldn't care less that the image on the digital screen is not the clearest. THEY know what they took a photo of. And they had just as much fun deleting the old photos as taking new ones. The cameras are so easy for them to use. We went over what each button does, and they took it from there. They were already experimenting with taking photos of the same subject from different angles and distances to see how it affected the results. I highly recommend these cameras!"},{"rating":"1","title":"For fun only","review":"My mom bought this for my son and he was so excited when he opened it. The excitement quickly waned (for me anyway) after taking a few pictures. I took a few pictures myself to determine if the poor picture quality was from the camera or from being taken by a 3 year old. When I loaded the pictures onto my computer they were out of focus around the edges and very grainy. This would be a great product if it had higher pixels, hence the overall rating. This is a good item if you don't plan on printing the pictures and just want your child to have a kid-friendly camera of their own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disapointed","review":"Horrible, horrible pictures. I can't believe Fisher Price would put out such junk! At least make it good enogh so the pictures can be printed! Auto flash is a joke.

I think its great in every way, although I would like to see the quality a little better. I've gotten a couple cute pix from it but it would be neat if some of them would be a little more worth keeping. However, for my 4 year old, the best fun is just snapping them and looking at the screen, laughing, and taking more. The batteries actually have a pretty good life to them so that is a relief and the camera is easy to use and the photos easy to delete. I definately recommend this one! I did, however, get it early so the price tag was in the high 50's, not the 70's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, tough little camera, easy to use, but don't expect pro quality","review":"This was a great purchase for our 4 year old, who had become very adept at handling our \\"grownup\\" camera. He now focuses on his own camera without wasting film as he was with the old school film cameras for kids. We are happy with the durability, ease of use, etc. However, if you, the adult, are expecting great quality photos, you may be a little disappointed. The photos come out somewhat grainy, and occasionally blurry or with odd lighting, often too harsh. But we don't expect much from a kids camera, and have only printed out a few photos with it, indoors, in often bad lighting. The idea for us was to give him a way to participate in photographing his own memories without a) wasting real film/processing and b) using our own camera.

Let's be a little more cognizant to the sensitivities and capabilities of girls and boys."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible pics, still she likes it","review":"I was one of the \\"lucky\\" ones that found one camera on the shelf at WalMart for $54. It was pink and never opened so I was thrilled. Then we opened it up and started taking pictures. The image quality is horrible!!! Low dpi resolution, awful flash, images are blurry and colors are washed out. The only thing in the back lcd screen that looks good is the FP logo and when you look into the viewfinder to snap a pic it is not what gets recorded (head room is cut off). The only plus is that my 4-year-old daughter loves to take pictures with it. We run out of space quickly so I'm always downloading to my Mac (works fine).Now, having seen this camera in action I would never have bought it for her. VERY disappointed and I'm going to tell FP about it. I would invest my $50 in a cheap or reconditioned real digital camera."},{"rating":"1","title":"Returned all three","review":"I bought this camera as a gift for Christmas this year, when the camera came I opened it to put batteries in it so it could be used out of the box. I found that the battery connection had been put togother backwords, so the camera was unuseable. I returned it and purchased a new one, again I had the same problem. Again I bought another one and had the same problem.I have given up on buying this camera. Fisher Price help line addmited that most all of the cameras made for the holiday season would have this problem and have to be returned, Good luck to anyone who bought this as a gift."},{"rating":"1","title":"AVOID THIS CAMERA - Poor value for money -","review":"A sturdy, kids-proof camera - cannot fault that.......BUT....Poor quality pics...most pics were out of focus.Poor resolution - no specs on the box but it certainly isn't 640x480 like other cameras.No sounds on the camera when buttons are pressed - pity.No special effects or editing software included.We returned this after a week and got the V-Tech model for $10 more. Far better pics, great editing functions, special effects, and sounds too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Takes Horrible Pictures","review":"Believe me when I say that this camera takes horrible pictures. It may be okay for a toy for play, but don't expect it to take decent pictures inside or outdoors. The flash is useless beyond about 4 feet. Within four feet, the flash washes out the image. Even in bright outdoor sunlight, the images are grainy and blured."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Concept...Bad Product","review":"The first camera I purchased for Christmas never had a flash. It took awhile to get a new camera because they were so popular over the holidays. The second camera worked off and on for three months before it stopped working entirely.I'm very frustrated at all the time I spent trying to replace this product TWICE. I haven't tried to replace the product again because I am sure the end result will be the same. While it worked, my 4 1/2 year old loved the camera. It was easy to hold, he loved taking pictures and \\"seeing\\" what he had taken. He felt very big with his own digital camera. The LCD quality is very poor but he didn't care. The problem is that the product itself is so cheaply made and of poor quality that it doesn't matter how much my child liked it. The fact is that two of them have not worked. You can like something all you want but if it never works...then what does it matter?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Even though he is 2, he likes it!","review":"It is one of the best toy purchases I've made for my son.

If you have to get any of their albums, get this and possibly their debut album \\"Pride.\\" With awesome songs like \\"Wait,\\" \\"When The Children Cry,\\" \\"Broken Heart,\\" \\"Love Don't Come Easy,\\" and \\"Hungry,\\" this greatest hits compilation holds up well (although I would've preferred the album version of \\"All You Need Is Rock N Roll\\"). Worth getting if you like 80's rock, but if you are a hardcore rocker, you will probably not like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good rock band, good compilation","review":"It's good to have this CD.

It's a shame that their albuns were somewhat irregular and led the band to their finish, but the guitar work is very, very good!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A load of C*ap","review":"White Lion were just a rip off of Van Halen, except VH were better. I can't believe some of these reviews, I have listened to this album intensely, the guitar player was copying Eddie VH not only on his tapping, but wangy bar and riff building. The songs make you wanna heave, \\"Little Fighter\\", \\"when the Children Cry\\" and \\"Love don't come easy\\", this was just a sad attempt at trying to cash in with the glam rock chart material of the time, but they failed.

He learns that the heart and his penis can both be involved in the same pursuit. More than that, he learns how to accept himself - warts and all. The book is funny. The book is touching. The book will make you cry. I have loaned this work to several friends. It is one of my favorite works. Just as one can use a telescope to examine the heavens, Monet uses this journal to explore his own path to accepting his homosexuality humaness and perhaps if others read it, the journey into becoming whom we really are, we be made easier."},{"rating":"2","title":"Parallels with a life of disability are amazing","review":"The self-loathing that used to be a common way of life for people with disability is described painfully in Paul's work on his path of losing his self hate, coming out as a gay man and finding love of self through the love of Roger Horwitz. Monette's brother with a disability adds a dimension to his story that's fascinating and accurate. He sharply catches the way people with disabilities are minimized, made invisible, hated and even feared. AIDS marked it's early victims with the exact same stigmas. All of his books are bittersweet journeys of living as human beings..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful book","review":"I bought this book to better understand my brother, who had not come out yet, but, I was wanting to help him in some way. This was a great way to see things from his point of view and we grew very close because, later he was able to tell me."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Powerful, Though Defensive, Book","review":"This book moves the reader with the author's personal story of coming out in a homophobic society, mostly during the pre-Stonewall era. Monette speaks powerfully about the importance of queer love, though he seems to get so wrapped up with the point of view of himself during that time that he seems to need to defend same-sex love.The book, written in the context of his lovers' AIDS deaths and his own illness, offers a stirring reminder of how the queer community has been devasted by the plague---one made far worse than necessary by the neglect and prejudice of the government and society as a whole.When you read the book, chances are that you will feel like a queer man in the fifties and early sixties, vividly reliving the experiences of trying to find the \\"laughing man,\\" Monette's romantic ideal of a man that he could share joy and love."},{"rating":"1","title":"passionate but poisoned","review":"I read this book years ago and recently came across it in an old box and reread a chapter in the middle. It is rather brilliantly written--the author is a great raconteur, and has style and wit; reading it is like spending a few hours with a cantankerous and opinionated old guy who never lets anyone else get a word in edgewise. But finally the prejudice and self-righteousness become overbearing."},{"rating":"1","title":"SELF-IGNORANCE","review":"This book is an autobiography and, as such, is supposed to be an exploration of self. It is not. There is no self-knowledge in this book. If Paul Monette came to any conclusions about his life they are not on display here. Here there is self-congratulation and self-loathing side by side and, achingly, these qualities never meet. He hates being homosexual, hates his body, hates his lack of talent--emotions churn unendingly--but never, Never, NEVER does he realize that these hates are aspects of one whole. Bitter invectives against the government, the straight world, people in general are presented with a self-complacency that astounded me from someone who never ceases to beat his own breast about other things and cry \\"mea culpa.\\" It's like the man is two people, and these two haven't had a conversation in years. This book is a disaster from any point of view"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth your time","review":"Although I thought this book would be an interesting read when I got the assignment from my English professor, it turned out to be pretty boring.

The orchestra is excellent, and Daniel Harding - who's now only 25 years old - promises to become one of the great conductors of symphonic music, if he keeps it up this way. The fact that this CD pre-dates, of course, that concert shows he has reached a great fusion with the Bremen Philarmoniker. Harding still shows an enthusiastic, youthful display of movements while he's directing, but - after all - so used to do Bernstein in his already mature years (I saw and heard him, directing the Israeli Symphony Orchestra from Tel Aviv, in the same theatre).

His main premise and the exposition of it are of great value to the Church today. This book is not without flaws though. It is a bit confusing to follow at times, seeming a bit choppy. He also seems to stretch his point at times to make it fit the context of passages he is reading. If this was changed the book would probably be at least 50 pages shorter. Perhaps the biggest downfall of the book is that Fee seems blinded by his Pentecostal traditions, which is so shocking because he is a master expositor. This comes out clearly in many instances, specifically chapters 12-14. His backing of speaking in tongues is found wanting whereas his exegesis in many other points is superb.I do recommend this book, but come into this book with a mind ready to think and perhaps read slowly at times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved Every Page!

I found myself not able to put it down. Eric Lax has put in perspective where the true credit should be for the discovery and commercialisation of penicillin, with the consequence the rise of the antibiotic industry.The book is well research and documented. It is a great shame that Florey has not gone down in history as the person to bring penicillin to the world. It was his persistence in gaining money to equip a modest lab and his judgement in getting the right people involved (Chain and Heatley). Thisresulted in the isolation, purification, efficiency and toxicity testing and finally commercialisation of penicillin that has saved countless lives.An excellent book that I recomend to all interested in historical accuracy."},{"rating":"2","title":"80's Waymore","review":"This album is a collection of the recordings that Waylon made for MCA upon leaving RCA in 1986 after 20+ years with Nipper. You will find all four MCA albums in their entirety plus two bonus tracks. These records marked a departure from Waylon's approach to making records during his heyday. For example, there is a much greater dependence on/use of studio musicians and Nashville songwriters. The one exception to this from a songwriting standpoint is the audio-biography \\"A Man Called Hoss\\".~ The albums were co-produced by Waylon & Jimmy Bowen, recorded digitally and have a very clean, crisp sound to them.There are a few interesting covers, such as Los Lobos' 'Will The Wolf Survive', Gerry Rafferty's 'Baker Street' and Sammy Johns' 'Chevy Van'. Personally, I think the two best of these albums are his MCA debut, \\"Will The Wolf Survive\\" and $Q<input type=hidden name="},{"rating":"1","title":"A cheesy Cassanova Wong kickfest","review":"Evil Mongolians have taken over the Shaolin Temple and superkicker Cassanova Wong must stop them.

Most of the fights are not very good, but the last 20 minutes is nonstop sped up Cassanova craziness.

If you're looking for a horror video with lots of short stories, check out the fiendishly fun Creepshow (1982).

To the person who is concerned about the handle discoloring, I would say, regardless of what any manufacturer says, it is not a good idea to put any high quality knife in the dishwasher. Items can move around and the edge can get nicked. There is also the danger of getting cut when retrieving the knife from the dishwasher. I always just hand wash and dry it after I'm done using it and put it back in the block."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great blade","review":"Like the other reviewer of this knife, I read the review in Cook's Illustrated and was curious.

It focuses on plus-sized women, but most of the advice could be utilised by people who could benefit from improved self-esteem in other areas. The authors have included self-esteem-building exercises, which complement the message of the text. I particularly liked the stories from successful, well-adjusted women who wrote about their own struggles with acceptance of themselves, and by their families and the wider community - strong, uncompromising, successful women. I was disappointed, then, to find that the illustrations (photographs and drawings), almost without exception portrayed women who are average-sized or smaller. I found this particulalry inappropriate in the section of dressing to reflect your style and best features - the women drawn would have looked attractive in sackcloth! Other than this quiblle, I found this book interesting and worthwhile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Empty Fluff and Lies -","review":"This book is full of empty long winded paragraphs of hardly believable self-affirmations.

Gleason's concept was brilliant: mellow solos by the great trumpeter/cornetist Bobby Hackett accompanied by a smooth string orchestra, with no percussian to jar the romantic effect. In later albums Gleason added other instruments, but appealing as his later albums were, none was more successful than The original, Music for Lovers Only, which was the biggest selling LP issued to that time. The original version of this outstanding album was only a 10\\" LP with just eight songs. Consequently, its various reissues have added songs from other Gleason albums -- in this case, another winner, Music to Make You Misty. If you are at heart a romantic, I think you'll love this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ah to be back in the 50's","review":"Those of you not old enough to remember when music sounded this good. This was romance, baby. The great one made music for lovers. If you watch old movies or movies set in the fifties and sixties you've probably heard this type of music played on the soundtrack. Oh, the hot nights, the hot dames. Man, what a time that was."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch Out For Mono Tracks","review":"Unless you're especially enamoured of the 1952 monaural edition of Music For Lovers Only, you'll find the first album disappointing. Neither Amazon, Collectors' Choice, nor EMI Music make it clear that Music For Lovers Only (the more desirable of the two album set) is completely monaural, in spite of the fact that Capitol actually released the same album in stereo in 1959."},{"rating":"2","title":"Music for Lovers Only/Music","review":"A great collection of Jackie Gleason's best music.

Another reviewer said his/her first grader could do better. I believe that most first graders ought to be able to do better than this work. Maybe I'm taking this work out of context. I come from a multicultural background myself and simply cannot relate, except to say that it's a barely competent work overall and is stylistically uninteresting. As far as identity based political works go, there is far higher quality material than this. I haven't read her other work and this text doesn't encourage me to do so.

Because the reviews were so vaied we decided to try both the swaddlebees and the fuzzi bunz. The swaddlebees weren't very good. First small didn't fit (our baby was over 8 lbs) then when they did fit they always leaked. Also, because it is an all-in-one diaper it takes ages to dry. You would need three full sets becuase they take an entire day to dry. For new parents looking to take the cloth diaper option I would recommend the fuzzi bunz cloth diapers, the adjustable fit means you can use them from day one and because of the pocket insert they dry quickly. Hope it helps."},{"rating":"2","title":"You always need an insert with a pocket diaper.","review":"I feel so bad for the mama who posted that she put one of these pocket diapers on her baby without an insert. I'm sure it leaked profusely without stuffing. A pocket diaper is not an all-in-one (AIO). You always need an insert or other stuffing (prefold, towel, etc.) tucked inside the pockets. I love the side snaps! This is an awesome diaper, especially to people new to cloth diapering. Just don't stop here though, move on to wahm products - they are like art on a bottom! =)"},{"rating":"2","title":"beautiful diaper","review":"This really is a beautiful diaper!

I also felt like I needed to try a bunch of different kinds before I made a selection. I bought one of these, a couple of Happy Heinys, Kissaluvs, and BumGenius 3.0. The first and only time I put this one on her, I was nursing her, so she was laying on her side on a pillow in my lap. When I picked her up, the diaper had leaked all over the pillow, like she wasn't even wearing a diaper at all.We now use the Kissaluvs size 0 during the day, with nylon Dappi pants covers, and BumGenius at night and on-the-go, since they keep her drier. She is going to grow out of the Kissaluvs soon, at which point we will be using the BumGenius. I know that some of it depends on the shape of your baby, and our daughter has a smaller waist and pudgier legs, which these diapers don't seem to adjust to. All in all, I wouldn't recommend them."},{"rating":"1","title":"great diaper if you don't mind leaks.","review":"very disappointed. just switched to cloth diapers in February, and so far, every time our dd has worn them, they've leaked out the sides. which is a shame, b/c love the style, love the snaps on the hips, love the softness, love it being an AIO."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of money!! The worst","review":"For the really high price you pay for these diapers, you expect a lot! What you get is absolute rubbish! The reason it is worth 1 star, is because they have nice patterns.Problems:* LEAKS, LEAKS, LEAKS. Every time we tried this it came through to our baby's clothes. Our little one is pretty small and she outgrew the size small so quickly.* It is an ALL-In-One, and therefore does not clean out as easily.* It takes SO long to dry. We wash them inside out. It is still damp after you take out all the other clothes. We let it air dry since we don't want to run the dryer just for these diapers.* They take up a lot of space (not a good travel diaper)Simply put: too much trouble for how expensive they are. Skip these, there are much better ones out there.

When I stumbled across this guide, I felt as though I'd hit the jackpot. It features practically any cuisine you can think of, from Venezuelan to Tunisian with concise descriptions and suggestions of which entrees to order.The best part of the guide is that the restaurants featured are generally priced below $20 per person, a godsend in one of the most expensive cities in the world!

This first Bernstein reading from New York, recorded in 1960, has been passed over, and yet it is amazingly fresh and exciting. Unfortunately, the Fourth has become, as one reviewer said, a lyrical intermezzo positioned between greater works, yet in Bernstein's hands it shines as an extension of the magical world of the Third Symphony, dreamlike and enchanted, full of wonder and spiritual intenisty. I hadn't listend to it for some years, and a recent reacquaintance reminded me that Bernstien earned his credentials as a Maherian, not by extroverted emotion but by having constant insights into Mahler's musical idiom. A great reading, arguably the greatest on disc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Desperately needs a rewrite","review":"This was probably a fine book when it was first written in the early 1980s, but it's been badly (cheaply?) updated since.

All wharfedale products I've ever owned have always been above par and always impressed anybody that heard them. After seeing bad reviews I was a little worried that they made a lemon, but the one thing that nobody mentions with these speakers is that there's a very long break in period. My old wharfedale atlantic 200's took about 100 hours to break in. After that the entire frequency range sounded much better, especially the midrange. I'm noticing the same thing with the diamond 8.1's. After 20 hours of hard use they've already been mistaken for the kenwood 15\\" floorstanders they're sitting on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Damn Fine Speakers","review":"By all means, use quality gear to drive these speakers.. I've used Rotel, and Adcom amps as well as a Harman Kardon AVR-340 to drive both 8.1's and currently a pair of 8.2's They are sweet speakers.. Excellent sound stage, presence,. and wonderful imaging. The accurracy with quality Vs. Hype marketing amps is amazingly apparent. Positioning and accoustics will enhance their performance even more. They even have decent bass when set correctly using a good solid stand. I can almost relate the performance of the 8.1 or 8.2's in close comparison to Celestion Model 100's. Similar specs but the 100's are in a league of their own. For the price of either pair of the Wharf's make it a sure bargain for Hi End quality on a beer budget."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't be fooled","review":"Once you compare these speakers, you too will agree that they are GROSSLY overrated.

I consider myself is a music and electronic lover, not an audiophilic. To be an audiophilic you will be obsessed to look, the price and the frequency of the audio equipment. And sometimes forget to enjoy of the music. Of course those $10000 a piece of speaker will make the owner feels good just look at them. There is nothing wrong to enjoy your hard working money. But Wharfedale Atlantic 100 is a down to the earth speaker. Very musical, clean on high and middle range vocal. Bass is surprise good for its size. You have to give 2 weeks to break in.

Second, as a romantic comedy, it lacks heart, likable characters, and emotional appeal. Third, the acting is shockingly bad, particularly for a film about theater.

A coherent or even reasonably believable plot (and NO, I'm not talking about the ghosts. I'm fine with them)for one.

It has a pleasant shape and is perfect for two people.

S2 has the same bad packaging that the complete 7 season package does. May I suggest you do what I did and buy a package of DVD cases that hold 2 DVD's per case. Staples has some very nice slim line cases that hold 2 DVD's. I scanned the case cover and then made copies of it for each of those cases. I wrote on each one of the covers what season and disc numbers was in that case. This way the DVD's are protected from being scratched and you know what season and disc are in each case without going thru all of the paper sleeves looking for the one you may want to watch. The DVD cases will cost you $20 for the 20 cases in a package but it is better than risking the damage to your DVD's.

I bought the first 3 put out by Anchor Bay in 2005 & 2006. To me this would be a rip-off for the studios to put out only a few seasons then come out with the complete series. I have already invested $90.00 in my 3 Seasons and now you can get all 7 under $90 something needs to be done about this. Just another Con from the studios. Also if I was to purchase this complete set, I could not get anyone to buy the 3 seasons I originaly purchase so I just loose money."},{"rating":"2","title":"MUST HAVE!","review":"I haven't watched all the way through it yet, however, the show does tend to pull me in when I sit down to it. Bear in mind, this is a recording of a show from the late 1980's, so the picture and audio aren't going to be Blu Ray or even DVD quality. There are noticeable audio anomalies here and there.Hunter is a typical action show with some light (or sometimes coarse) humor mixed in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some of the programs don't play","review":"I was delighted to quickly receive this package of discs which were supposed to contain all of Hunter's shows. Well, to make a long story short, all of the discs were there, but they didn't all work. For example, almost half of the episodes on disc # 2 were unplayable. The rest of the dics seem playable, so I'm not going to take the time to send the package back.

It is also not quite as loud as some other mobiles, which I really liked. Unfortunately, wind up mobiles do not play for very long at all - 1 1/2 to 3 minutes, absolute tops, and you have to be careful not to overwind them. I then bought a battery operated Fisher Price Starry Night Mobile for 25% less, with lights and music (5 songs) which so far I like better. My son likes this one, too, so I gave it 4 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unhappy with Mobile-overpriced","review":"My husband and I bought the mobile \\"Jake\\" because it matched our bedding, lamp, etc. We were pretty disappointed in the quality and usefulness of the mobile. We thought it was way overpriced at almost $50. While it does play music, the music only last for about 2 minutes and came out sounding shrill and high-pitched. It wasn't soothing or comforting at all- I couldn't wait for it to stop playing, so I can't imagine my baby (not born yet) would enjoy such a high pitched sound. The animals that hang from the mobile are okay, but there is only 4, with no mirrors or soft lights. The best thing to say about the mobile is that it was easy to put together (we mounted it on the crib, but there is also a wall mount option). Ultimately, we decided to return it and look for something that plays better music for a better price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute Garbage!!","review":"The only good thing about this mobile is that it matches the Lambs and Ivy Jake set. Other than that it is absolute garbage.The cheap plastic molding of the assembly scratched my $600 crib and it is still not very secure. The mobile squeeks while playing music and it plays virtually for about 2 minutes. Then you have to wind it again. This Item is really good at it's main purpose however, which is suckering you to pay $30 because you have the rest of the set. If this piece was included in the set, I would expect this kind of quality, selling it as an extra cost is ridiculous. The good reviews must be based on looks alone , avoid at all costs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"Every detail is adorable. Looks hi-end. Easy to assemble. Clips on quick and snug.

She has a lovely voice, and sings the old Tin Pan Alley and similar genre songs straight in the way they were written, without a lot of jazz embellishment. (Not that jazz embellishment is bad, it just doesn't always work with this material.) I'm a big fan of hers, so my opinions may be a little biased; but if you love this music it's hard to not enjoy Morris singing it.This is one of two albums devoted to Irving Berlin.* While others may have written more sophisticated tunes or more profound lyrics, no one matched Berlin in term of just plain good, rousing , songs. And Morris is with him all the way. Great stuff to listen to around a holiday!*Blue Skies: Songs by Irving Berlin"},{"rating":"1","title":"Product not received, refund issued","review":"I was disappointed that this cd never arrived.

She was well before my time, but I thought she had a nice sound when I heard her in one of those \\"so you're getting old and want to hear the music of your foregone youth\\" commercials. I still like her voice, but after the first few tracks, every song sounds like it belongs in the background for the credits of a cheesy romance movie from the 80s. In the duets especially (with Peabo Bryson and Maxi Priest), the male singer is just spewing Velveeta into the microphone. I found myself looking at the CD player to see how much longer I'd have to listen to each track.\\"The First Time...\\", \\"Will you still love me...\\" and \\"killing me softly\\" are the only songs I'll listen to again.If these three songs make it worth your while, if you love Roberta Flack, or if you just don't have enough cheese in your musical diet, this is an album to get."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 stars is hardly enough","review":"Roberta Flack would earn a five on any album just for her voice alone. With such a rich, beautiful timbre, you can only wonder why she isn't still the top selling artist she was in the 70's and 80's. After more than 30 years, I still love hearing Killing Me Softly on the radio, along with the great duets here with Peabo Bryson and Donny Hathaway. The haunting First Time leads off the album and there is never a letdown until you realize the CD is over; and it really seems to happen that fast. Of all the albums I have, this is the only one that I could rate a 5 with no hesitancy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Roberta - the finest voice...","review":"I had the wonderful opportunity to see Roberta Flack live last night in NY at BB Kings. What a show, what a voice. Later, I thought about all of the songs that she did not sing, including \\"The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face,\\" perhaps the most soft and chilling song ever recorded. I got home and listened to this CD and then this morning, I listened to her masterpiece \\"Killing Me Softly,\\" at only 8 songs, some may think it's not worth buying, but it is. This happens to be her most intimate album ever and should be the first on your list.

She has a pure, sweet, clear, and pristine voice that is not matched by anyone in today's recording industry. I shudder to think what Mariah Carey would do to her classics given a chance. Roberta's music is legendary and is frequently redone by other artists, but never mastered. Sorry, Lauryn!There are so many hits. Like another reviewer, I also recommend that a serious fan purchase the individual albums if they really want what isn't included here. One song I think of is \\"Jesse.\\" It's sad and melancholy, but hey, sometimes that's what you want to hear.I love her duets with Donnie Hathaway and Peabo Bryson, but the duet with Maxi Priest is great too. She is a good collaborator which adds to her professional image. This CD is good to rotate with Sade, Erykah Badu, Les Nubians, Sarah Vaughn, Ella Fitzgerald, and Billie Holiday."},{"rating":"2","title":"Roberta Flack on CD","review":"Product arrived in a timely manner.

I have been a gigantic R. Flack fan since her monster days in the early 70s, when she scored the biggest, Grammy-winning best songs two years in a row, and the hits we all know are of course fabulous. But the best recording, for my money, in this package of perfection, is WILL YOU STILL LOVE ME TOMORROW, the Carole King pop classic that takes on a completely new, incredibly melancholy and poignant feeling in this spare, stunning arrangement and vocal. Everyone should have this record in their collection -- it is timeless and elegant pop music at its supreme best."},{"rating":"2","title":"GOOD AND GROTESQUE","review":"This really is a good movie, even if grotesque, with this crazy broad wanting to cut off the faces of pretty girls. The acting was good(defined as believable). The story is original. It would have been nice to see the ranger and the lady fly off of the 3-wheeler. The ending would have been better had either the brother or sisters' newfound love survived. I love the low budget authenticity of this movie. A four is a bit generous.

I am a member of a lot of the collector message boards and go to auctions and arcade events near my home. The price guide seems a bit out of wack. I don't think you can price guide an arcade. I have seen Ms. Pac-mans go from $250 to $1650 and Kung Fu Master games go from $200 all the way to $1000. The price ranges are so large it doesn't make sense to price guide these. It all depends on how much someone loves a game... Auctions skew the prices a lot, so do people on ebay that overpay. The guide lacks a lot of games I see out there. Waste of money.

When I got it home I washed it by hand, handling it very carefully, and placed it in a plastic strainer while I washed the lid. I had thoroughly inspected it coming out of the box, it was fine, after washing it had two chips in the handle. Cooking with it is great, it retains the heat well, heats evenly and the lid is snug, but the third washing produced another chip on the curve of the bottom and the interior stained. I went back to the store where I purchased this Dutch Oven and was told except for two (one being mine), all the others sold were returned. While this Dutch Oven is still usable I didn't want to have to check it for new chips every time I use it; I've replaced it with a Lodge enamel covered 6-quart Dutch Oven which provides the same benefits in cooking but doesn't chip or stain.

Also, the wrought iron is exposed along the edges of both the pot and the lid, so rust can drip down if it's not entirely dry. The inside bottom has a defect where the iron comes up, out of the enamel coating. Additionally, the inside bottom of this pot is not entirely flat, but raised in the middle. I should never have bought this pot and would reccomend that if you want a good enameled pot, you pay more and get it from a more reliable company. The pot is a cheap rendition of what an enameled pot should be, and you will pay for it in the end.

Frankly some of these should have been in the original; 'Good Times, Bad Times', 'You Shook Me', 'Bron-Yr-Aur', 'Hot Dog', 'Darlene', 'Hots on For Nowhere', 'Down By the Seaside' and 'How Many More Times' all great tunes that would be better off in box set 1 as opposed to some of the dreck that somehow got on there, particularly some of the stuff from the 3rd album."},{"rating":"2","title":"101 Dalmations","review":"101 Dalmations is a great book. I have both read this book and watched the movie. This book is a great adventure story about puppies that were stolen by Cruela DEVIL. Cruela makes fur, coats and clothing, so she stole the puppies in order to skin them. In the book the animals actually can talk, so this way all the dogs in town can find the puppies. Its called 101 dalmation because when the do save the puppies the find more that were hiding and they take them in to be a family. The book is great and all kids desirve to read this one.

Methlyparaban and polyparaban. For those of you who don't care about parabans - great! For those of you who look for 'paraban' free on lotions - not so great. Also it doesn't work....at least for me in regards for mosquitoes which is why I wanted to try it, I was looking for a healthy alternative to Off. Oklahoma City, in town, out in my garden and I was getting eaten alive by mosquitoes. No standing water anywhere and near drought conditions...how? Only in Oklahoma...sheesh. Anyway I had to once again pull out the Deep Woods Off that gives me a headache and spray myself all over with it. Better toxins than some nasty virus transmitted by a mosquito. Oh well the hunt goes on for a healthy alternative."},{"rating":"1","title":"Accuracy, Please!","review":"To be useful, a guidebook to canoeing trails must be accurate and complete in directing the reader and potential paddler to undertake the trips described with confidence and in safety. I am familiar with many of the rivers described in this book in north Florida and have noted several gross inaccuracies. The most dramatic being the description of a Blackwater River trip of more than thirty river miles being accomplished in four hours! This could certainly lead a novice paddler into considerable difficulty were they to try the same trip. Taken as entertaining prose and accepting the \\"poetic license\\" taken with some important details, I found the book otherwise to be enjoyable reading, written by folks who certainly do enjoy the sport. As a starting point in looking for a new river to cruise Carefree Canoeing is a fun and useful read, but accurate and complete sources must be consulted before planning a trip to any of the rivers described."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for TV; not so much for music..........","review":"For movies and TV, this unit is fine. For listening to music, I shut it off as it overpowers my Wharfdale Evo-8s and does not give a very refined sound.

Maybe the best. Certaintly one of the best seasons. It won its second Outstanding Comedy EMMY in a row and its second writing emmy.\\"CHEERS\\" is by far the greatest show ever, and that's why it is the longest running sitcom(tied with \\"M*A*S*H\\", and after this season \\"FRASIER\\")ever.

Always was, and always will be, one of the greatest shows to ever air on TV. Highly recommend purchasing this."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Greatest Shows Ever Made!","review":"I loved this show during its first five years. I think Shelly Long's character along with Ted Danson made Cheers a wonderful show. Shelly was irreplaceable in the show though it continued and the same went for the coach. The actor who played the coach contributed a lot to the show . Watching the second season reminds me of how good it was."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't Wait for the Release!","review":"I'm so glad the next season is being released!

That was a little more hassle than I was expecting but I've found no other way to convert the files.Other than that I think this is a winner. Computer wizards will not be impressed with the technology on this thing but kids will love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this purchase","review":"My daughter got this as a xmas gift. Biggest pain in the butt toy she's ever received. When it works she loves it. It took me almost an entire day to get the stupid thing to connect, ended up using my parents computer. Whenever you replace the batteries the thing resets and you have to plug it back into the computer to get it to put your songs on it, the pre-programed songs are pretty awful. If you buy this as a gift I would recommend setting it up for the kid first, unless you hate their parents and want to punish them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work for long","review":"I thought this toy was a great idea and was very excited to buy it for my daughter. We bought it as a gift and she loved it. The first issue and it was one I was aware of before purchasing was that you have to have a windows based operating system for the product. No problem, we pulled out the old laptop and used that. Everything loaded and worked just fine as far as the software was concerned. After the first use, it stopped working. It would start to play a song and then change to just a high pitch hum instead of music. It did this everytime. I called support they thought it was the batteries. Put new batteries in, reset the system, reinstalled the software and nothing worked. I had to return it to Mattel for a refund. Very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea, but needs some improvements","review":"I got this for my 3-year-old for her birthday, and she really loves it. It's easy to use and figure out--it took her almost no time to know what the buttons did. Putting music on was easy because we just used the CDs she already had. The two major flaws with it are:1. It EATS batteries like crazy!! It takes four AA batteries, and within just a few hours they were dead.2. There is no way to find a track on the system other than hitting the forward button until you find the song you're looking for. For a 3-year-old who keeps insisting on hearing a specific song, it's very frustrating. Also, when you turn on it returns to the beginning of the list of songs so you have to scroll through again.It's a great idea for kids, but it would be much better if they had a rechargable battery and a way to scroll through the songs to select the one you want."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Run on VISTA","review":"This product doesn't run on VISTA Operating System.

We got them each these - they LOVE them and so do we. We broused through the thousands of music files on our computer - and burned their favorites to a CD - then it was very easy to get them to the fp format.

Here is why:1. It only runs on windows. If you have mac, linux, freebsd you are out of luck.2. The player only plays fisher price proprietary format music files. So sorryall those MP3 files you have spent years ripping from your CDs will not work.Time to re rip them into FP3 format, that is if you can still read the CDs.This is yet another example of anti-consumer lock in products that areunfortunately becoming more common."},{"rating":"2","title":"We love it!","review":"This FP3 player is great! I deleted the pre-programmed songs but kept the stories. Now my 3 year old daughter can listen to her favorite songs and I don't have to worry whether the volume is too loud or if it will be damaged when she drops it. The software could be better - to add songs you have to have the CD and the program copies it from there but you can't move music files already on your computer. I only added 12 songs at approximately 3-4 minutes each but I think I could add almost 3x that amount."},{"rating":"2","title":"I bought 3 of these...","review":"for my kids.

My son got his when he was 5 and my daughter got her's when she was 3. They are both still using it and loving it. My son is now 7 so we might have to think about a MP3 player, but this was worth every dime. We didn't use the songs from the Fisher Price store though....we used CDs of our own and put them on the players. Over the years we have taken off and added more songs. The speakers that can be purchased separatley are also a great buy.

For an example, Sarah's brother Charlie was mentally-handicapped in the book and unable to speak, but here he is a talkative little boy who chatters away. Not to mention the fact that in the film he is celebrating his FIFTH birthday! In the book Charlie was ten years old. Also, Sarah has the character development of a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Really, in one scene she takes one look at her orange sneakers and tells her brother that she likes them, but then two seconds later she literally told her brother she hated them. The plot was fast-paced, too, and the acting wasn't the best. But at least we had some time away from class."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really not all that great......","review":"Ms. Hawke creates an interesting 'live' vampire here, but he is the only good thing about this book. The author's use of descriptors [spec. colors] with EVERYTHING do not seem that of a professional writer.As for being erotic, well the few love scenes were slightly steamy but nothing to write home about.This is obviously a planned series as there are so many loose strings left at the end its a wonder my book didn't unravel.

Essentially a series of scenes with linking music, The Fairy Queen, like other semi-operas, lacks the integrity of plot and action of real opera. In performance, I suspect this work would be somewhat static, sort of a serious music variety show. The music, however, is lovely. The Fairy Queen contains some of Purcell's best vocal and instrumental work with some components that became part of the concert repertoire. Hearing all the music together is a fine experience, though the semi-opera format tends to work against the dramatic and musical cohesion which can be found in even merely good operas. The vocalists are splendid, particularly Lorraine (as she was then spelling her name) Hunt. The orchestral playing is just as good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very bad. A really crap. Don\`t waste your money in this","review":"A book full of bad quality pics (low resolution in many cases and very bad composition).

First I love the fact that the fast songs are all at the beginning and the slow songs are at the end. It is one of those CD's that you pop in while you are on a date. In the beginning of the date you play the more upbeat stuff, but towards the end of the night it is all about the slow jams. The lead singer of the group has a very powerful voice. Intro's rendition of Stevie Wonder's \\"Ribbon In the Sky\\" is a good one. They put their spin on it without taking anything away from the song. However, my favorite song is \\"Come Inside\\" it is sexual without being down right nasty. I wish we could get R&B back to this point."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is still a very good album!","review":"I originally bought the cassette in 1993! I was in the ninth grade and going through my Mary J Blige, Jodeci, and Boys II Men stage (all of them came out around the same time) and then there was Intro! I played their album to alot! I had to replace the cassette twice! My favorite songs are \\"Anything for You\\" and \\"One of A Kind Love\\". I am so glad to see that I was not the only one who loved Intro! I am so sad to hear that Kenny is gone from this earth, his talents as well be missed, I hope they have some unreleased material so that it may be released someday!

I love the whole Cd. Their rendition of Stevie Wonders ribbon in the Sky is worth its weight in gold. Its beautifully redone. There are many other songs that I love on this Cd that didn't get much airplay, but they are still gems to me.

Mr. Cohn shows his vast musical knowledge by dabbling with various genres of music, including some folk sounds reinforced with the unexpected sound of a Wurlitzer organ. Listen closely to the title track for the unmistakable Bonnie Raitt guitar harmonies. 'Medicine Man' carries some intriguing literary references, and spotlights some southern influence. 'The Things We've Handed Down' is an excellent example of this artist's ability to access and identify the factors which play on the human condition. In this touching lullaby to his unborn son, Mr. Cohn shows he has a rare ability to mix incredible songwriting skill with vulnerable and emotional elements. I really enjoyed the diversity displayed on this album, and it has become one of my own personal favorites. I hope that his works get more of the recognition they deserve."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Slump!","review":"This is no sophmore slump. This is near perfect, just like the first one. And like another reviewer said, it just gets better with time--maybe the older I get. If you have kids, listen to \\"Things We've Handed Down,\\" and tell me it doesn't make you cry. I was 26 when I first heard this album, and now I am 40, and it is one of the VERY VERY BEST. 80 cents for a used copy? Better than anything that's drivelled out on modern radio today. Best dollar you ever spent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maybe not quite as good as his debut, but grossly underrated","review":"I agree with another reviewer that this album went exactly nowhere. It ended up in the cutout bin before you could say $3.99. That seems a shame since there are really great songs here including \\"Walk Through the World\\", \\"The Rainy Season\\", \\"Paper Walls\\", and \\"She's Becoming Gold\\". I think perhaps a lot of people were not willing to give it a chance when they realized \\"Walking in Memphis\\" was not here.

She is very weak on plot development. I will purchase others in the series to see if the books improve; however, if the books continue in this vein, I can't recommend them.

I was putting my makeup on and drying my hair while trying to read at the same time.I felt like I can relate to Sarah Booth, other than the stealing my friends dog for money scandal, lol.

If you're looking for a good starter book that simplifies basic tasks without having to search endlessly with the user's manual that comes with the PDA, then this book is for you.

My first thought was to get an orthopedic ankle sleeve, but I was worried that regular compression might not be good for my ankle seeing as it is uninjured. Then I came across this gel tubing product on Amazon and thought I'd give it a try. There is some compression, but it's minimal. The material is light and comfortable. It can stretch without losing elasticity and the gel lining slides onto the skin and rests smoothly on top. While obvious that I'm wearing some kind of sleeve, the nude color (on my white skin) is discreet enough for work. This isn't the original, intended use of the gel tubing and anyone looking for its anti-abrasion quality will have to ask someone else, but it's a perfect option for my circumstance. The only thing stopping me from rating this a 5-star product is that I have yet to try and wash it, though the product literature says it is washable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deliciously disturbing","review":"Though previous reviewers have expressed dissatisfaction over the triumphs evildoers enjoy in this series, and especially in this book.. I find it a refreshing change from the godlike Drizzt, who prevails against impossible things no matter what.Plot style is akin in this series to George RR Martin's Song of Fire and Ice series in the sense that no one is safe, and anyone can die at the turn of any page. Holds suspense and does away with the more juvenile and hopeful ambience of the Forgotten Realm's Drizzt story, though I love those for their attributes as well.Overall, I finish this book with a heavy heart for the characters that I grew to root for and their unimaginable pain and losses.. and a smirk for the villans who enjoy victories not often seen in this genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"Riveting!","review":"Salvatore reached new heights in Mortalis, but Ascendence is a worthy successor.

She sizzles and scolds and gets sassy. Her stature as a vocalist, performer and modern day icon is on the same level as Streisand. This CD is a good starter collection for the neophite.

This albums tries to show the different styles of the Divine, but the package got lost in the mix, making an odd track order. Of course the GH includes Midler highlights, \\"Wind Beneath My Wings, Form A Distance, Do You Want To dance?, and of course The Rose\\", but the album is somehow missing the key factor that made Midler a star, a well produced ecletic album that doesn't fall in boriness, but this collection does fall."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"Bette Midler sounds as good today as she did 30 years ago.

You'll get some idea of what people are working on in the field, but don't expect anything in depth. Overall the book is a good, lightweight read. You can pick it up and read an interview or two and then not touch it for a couple of days. Some reviews have suggested this is a bad thing, but I think it is exactly what the book intends to provide.The book itself is rather large and contains beautiful photographs that have an artistic element to them.

Boy, was I in for an unhappy surprise. These performances arein general joyless and sound like Mr. Pletnev was sight-reading themafter a few disinterested practice sessions, eager to finish his contractual obligation, collect, and move on. The recorded sound isvery blah. In no way can these performances be compared with thoseof pianists like Horowitz or Sudbin or Browning, who bring life-enriching insight, technical polish and a sense of mission to theirwork. Do yourselves a favor and stay away. Oh, and BTW, don't forgetthe old saw, \\"If the bargain is too good to be true..\\" You get what youpay for."},{"rating":"1","title":"glenn gould wannabee 30 years too late","review":"Along with Zarafiants's Naxos recording, this recording ranks at the bottom of currently available Scarlatti recordings. Sure, Pletnev has the chops, and his take on K 519 is exhilarating. But overall, the performances are weirdly accentuated and too fast--K 113, in which all sense of dialogue between the bass and extreme treble in this hand-crossing masterpiece is lost, is a sad example. Scarlatti can sound great on piano, as Pogorelich and Michael Lewin make clear."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exelent product","review":"This is definitely one of my best buys.The Jolly light is very well built, is very comfortable for the my daughter, and we have covered many miles hiking together already, and still counting.Overall, I would rate this product as best amongst its concurrent products, with the only other that matches the qualities of this one being the \\"deuter\\". I still picked this one, and continue to be hapy with that fact.It is also very well fitting on the carrier (me usually).The seat hight adjustment is a little bit awkward, but it doesn't take long learning to leave with it.The child head protection looks a bit ridiculous at first sight, but it had proven to be doing very good job already, so it is a must have for me.Baggage compartment is fairly enough, and it can be coupled with a piggy back backpack that can be put on the carrier itself.

We actually laughed at the end. The only reason one might watch this film is to gaze at the lovely Italian scenery.

It is typical Hollywood product - the four and five star movies are few and far between.Nearly everything that happens in this movie is entirely predictable. The dialogue is painfully poor - I actually felt sympathy for the actors at several points during this movie for having to follow the script. Vanessa Redgrave deserves better parts than this.In addition to these serious flaws, I was bothered by the main character's \\"issue\\" with her fiance. For her to be disappointed that he didn't want to do most of their activities together on this trip was understandable. But the viewer gets the impression that she wanted him to focus ONLY on her during this trip - a very childish and egocentric view of \\"true love.\\"The friend I saw it with brought her 9 year old daughter and I saw no reason why the movie was rated PG.

This movie did nothing for my romance-loving self. The two main love interests had no detectable chemistry with each other and were just plain bland. I thought it was really weird that this movie had some similarities to \\"Mama Mia\\" (Amanda Seyfried plays a Sophie in both movies and some of the characters said/did similar things to \\"Mama Mia\\"). Can't understand the praises for Vanessa Redgrave - she moved and acted way too slow. She looked really frail. I think she was just too old for the part. Then again, Betty White is way old and she's all kinds of awesome. Vanessa Redgrave, along with the rest of the cast were just so vanilla!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst movie ever.","review":"I think I stopped this movie and deleted it within the first 30 minutes.

Had to take 1* off due to the lame ending. Why oh why do writers always have to make cringe-worthy endings for romantic comedies? Why did Sophie had to be crying on the balcony? I think it would have been better if Sophie said, \\"I did not run away, I had to go to the watercloset which surprisingly has a balcony attached.\\" And no tears! I really cringe when heroines are crying while confessing their love to the hero...oh please! It's ok to blurt out your feelings to the guy, but don't be a watering can, otherwise he can't look deep into your eyes as he's staring in aghast at your ruined eye make-up dripping ugly streaks down your face.Otherwise, fantastic romantic comedy.

Sells story. Back to old life. Realizes mistake. New love.The only thing a bit fun in this is that the love whom Redgrave is seeking is in fact the Lancelot she met on the film set of Camelot.

It contains issues 54-67 of Marvel's Star Wars run, as well as the second annual. In my opinion, these are the best stories to come out of the Marvel comics so far. The stories generally cover multiple issues, which allows for deeper and more complex stories. New characters are introduced, such as Shira Brie, and other characters are explored with more depth, specifically Lando. It's good to see the addition of new characters that do not appear in the movies, on the rebel and Imperial sides. The Shira Brie story arc was the best so far, and even the recurring hoojibs contribute as well. The stories that span a single issue are generally weaker, but they are becoming more uncommon as the series continues. With this collection it seems that the Marvel stories have turned a corner."},{"rating":"2","title":"best business book","review":"This is the best business book I've read.

The book is full of interesting material. I do agree with another reviewer that the type could be larger."},{"rating":"1","title":"If Only The Type Was Large Enough To Read","review":"For some unfathomable reason the publisher has elected to produce a very small format edition (pages have lines only 3-1/2 inches long). Regrettably this appears to have been effected by literally shrinking the page size of a previous edition. This has resulted in a minute font which my eyes (even with powerful reading glasses) cannot read without also using a magnifying glass.Years ago, when my eyes were much younger, I used Assimil books in French and Italian ans was highly satisfied. The current Spanish course which uses the same approach is presumably equally effective.Iy you are young with acute vision I would highly recommend the Assimil series and award it 4 stars.

It is a very underrated album, and in my opinion is by far the best of the three originals. If this album had been released in the mid to late 80's, I feel it would have sold much better than it has. The album has a more mature feel to it than the previous two. My favorite song is \\"junkyard dog\\" (tears on stone). For anyone who thinks Winger can't rock, listen to this one! Other notables include \\"blind revolution mad\\", \\"down incognito\\", \\"spell I'm under\\", and the accoustic \\"who's the one.\\" If you enjoy accoustic guitar mixed in with screaming electric guitars, this album is for you!

I am a connoisseur and this really is terrific, one of the best of any marmalade and certainly by far and away the best blood-orange variant on the market.The lack of the fifth star is NOT a comment on the quality of the product but on the company's hidden shipping costs. The charges are well above average and well above actual cost if you only buy a few jars. Even if you buy five jars, the most you can get against a $15 shipping fee, please note that actual UPS Ground shipping costs was really $9.95--or so the UPS web site told me.

The Wusthof Classic knives are \\"forged\\" and are therefore much stronger, more durable, and stay sharp longer. They also feel a bit heavier and thicker to me, which makes cutting easier. They're more expensive, but are worth it in my opinion. There is also a bolster (the thick metal portion joining the handle and the blade, which adds weight and balance and keeps the cook's hand from slipping) on the Classic Chef knife whereas this Gourmet Chef knife simply has a handle that curves into a finger guard, which is not quite as good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Knife for the Money","review":"The Wusthof Gourmet 8 inch knife is a good knife for the money. Are there better knives that exist? Yes, but they are much more expensive. This knife has good edge retention and has remained very sharp. It was pretty sharp out of the box. I am careful to only cut on a cutting board, cutting on glass or metal will dull any knife. A very tiny portion on the tip rolled when the knife fell in the sink. It was very easy to fix though.

The author writes vivid descriptions of what he does and what he sees during his time in Siberia. His descriptions of the people who lived there, how they lived and how they survived are good for historic reference. He experienced severe cold and hunger but he also saw great beauty in the mountains, the aurora borealis and the phosphoresence of the seas.

Kennan: An American Life\\", John Lewis Gaddis' new biography of the diplomat, George F. Kennan. (The author of Tent Life was a cousin of the diplomat's grandfather.)Tent life is an engaging real life adventure of the older George Kennan's work on a proposed trans-Siberian telegraph line, proposed to link Europe and The Americas via a telegraph line across the Bering Straight.

The arrangements are magic. He does covers beautifully."},{"rating":"2","title":"Michael Buble \\"Let It Snow\\"","review":"This CD is another indication that Mr. Buble is here to stay. His rendition of \\"I'll Be Home For Christmas\\" would touch the soul of the most hardened Scrooge. Michael Buble's style reminds one of Frank Sinatra with one difference: the quality of his voice is ten times better. My only complaint with this CD is that it is all too short. I would have enjoyed six more songs in this brilliant artist's voice."},{"rating":"2","title":"+ 1/2 stars...Reissue Plus a Bonus Track","review":"With the well deserved success of Michael Buble's major label debut in 2003, it only made sense to follow that up with a holiday release the same year. It is now being released with a bonus track--a live performance of the title track (complete with audience sing-a-long on the chorus).Produced by fellow Canadian David Foster, the EP's six tracks feature Buble's trademark jazzy vocals and lush arrangements. If there's a criticism, it's that there isn't much variety in tempo. Except for \\"Let It Snow,\\" these are all ballads. Which, if you're looking for Christmas music to snuggle with your sweetie in front of the fire, makes this the perfect choice. [Running Time - 20:08] RECOMMENDED"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!!","review":"You might think this is crazy but I actually bought this EP after Christmas. All the songs are great.

The EP (too short to be an LP) Let It Snow by Michael Buble brings a fresh voice with familiar styling into the season. Smooth as always, Buble does his swing thing just right on the live recording of Let It Snow, which is positioned almost as a \\"bonus\\" track. The studio version is lacking by comparison, due to the big band arrangement Michael brings to the stage. While not stuffed like a stocking, this little package does fit nicely among the Christmas traditions we just can't do without. In all, a worthwhile purchase. - Tim Brown"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very COOL Album for Christmas!","review":"The spirit of Sinatra lives on in Michael Bublé! He is cool without trying to be cool.

The musicians support him perfectly with a style that varies from big-band swing to smooth romantic. Buble's vocals are always in command, though, as he welcomes you into the Christmas season. In fact, if you can't get into the Christmas mood after listening to this, you might think about asking Santa for a new heart this year. My only complaint is that there are only six songs here. Michael, give us more! As it is, my wife and I listen to this every evening during the holidays.

I haven't played the piano in a while and I thought, since I love Michael Buble's music and especially wanted the music to \\"My Grownup Christmas List\\", which is beautiful, I shouldn't have too much trouble playing it, but it's just not what I expected. I can make something out of the right hand and some of the notes for a left hand but it's not really giving the music the right sound. Unfortunately, as I was looking forward to this music book, I thought it would be different. But, if nothing else, I DO have some form of the sheet music for my beautiful song, \\"My Grownup Christmas List\\" but it's somewhat of a disappointment. \\"White Christmas\\" doesn't sound like \\"White Christmas\\" the way this music is set up either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed with Let it Snow - michael buble'","review":"I love Mr. Buble's music and am looking forward to seeing him in Dallas, Texas in March of 2008, but I was EXTREMELY disappointed with the length of this CD.

Replacing the new machine after only 2 months of use. Yes, ours did leak. It leaks when you try to fill the water reservoir and it leaks when you pour the brewed coffee. It has leaked grounds and overflowed on the counter and floor 3 times, for 3 different people. It happened to my husband last night and included some weird white substance that is proving very difficult to remove from the cupboards and drawers it spilled onto.

This hot sauce wasn't thick like most, but was runny and came pouring out of the bottle. I gave it a taste, and fell instantly in love. This little bottle has all the goodness of a can of chipotle in adobe sauce. It is strong, flavorful, and smoky. There is almost no heat--at least not to me--and I mixed it with a drop ofDave's Insanity Sauceto give it a little bite.

The author talks about her little-bo-peep adventures like the hardships and interesting things she experiences have made her a wise sage. Her voice becomes redundant and obnoxious. While she seeks these hardships she can talk to no end about, she is a middle class white girl whose mundane life bores even her to death. I found no moral, lesson, or value from reading most of this book. The author appears bright and probably likable, but reading this book was like being on a bad date in which the person accross the table will not stop talking about how bright they are, tough they have had it, adventures they have had etc......"},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete waste of time!","review":"This whole movie is someone's daydream that should have never been put on tape.

The plot could have been decent but all characters were unrealistic, over-the-top caricatures of stereotypes. Seriously. The dialog was also truly amiss.

The back of the volume contains a complete 1,700 doll name page index for ready reference. Dolls are grouped by manufacturer. A wonderful reference book, and a bargain at the paperback price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Little note about Return to Serenity","review":"Great CD, but just take note that Return to Serenity on this CD is a shorter, edited version, missing the original intro and also half of the original mind-blowing guitar solo."},{"rating":"1","title":"I never understood","review":"to me this cd seemed a cash grab, there was nothing worth purchasing this cd for I love testament but this is only for someone who needs everything if you want live go to live at the Filmore, if you want the classic sound pick up first strike still deadly...this is just junk"},{"rating":"2","title":"Try wallpaper adhesive....","review":"We hung this up last weekend using a wallpaper adhesive specifically for prepasted wallpaper that came with a roller attached ($5).

I have read all of her books and love them because she mixes a little drama, everyday life and lots of hilarious moments that anyone can relate too. If you want to try one of her books, I would recommend you start with Marrying Mom. I literally had tears running down my face from laughing so hard. It was wonderful as are all her books. Try them - I am sure you will like them as much as I have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun!!","review":"This book was fun and funny. Especially the revenge scenario involving Angie's husband. Who cares if some of the situations seem implausable in real life...Its all meant for good fun. (I don't think Olivia wants you to sit there and think \\"we'll that wouldn't happen in real life.\\") I don't think anyone should read this book who is easily offended (like some of the reviewers) by illegal or promiscuous activities. (Oh no!) The husbands of these women were such jerks they deserved everything coming to them. (I think they still got off a little too easy.)It's very entertaining and certainly worth the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous","review":"Having read and enjoyed \\"The Bestseller\\" a few months back I was very disappointed with \\"Young Wives.\\" It should have been entitled \\"First Wives Club Part II\\" because it has the same plot.

I will never again buy a book by Olivia Goldsmith."},{"rating":"2","title":"So sad by her death","review":"I am a fan of Olivia Goldsmith. It is shocking that she died recently.

She will be missed."},{"rating":"1","title":"too long!","review":"I was really loving this book for about the first 150 pages, but quickly tired of all the LONG descriptions of every thought each character had. I skipped to the end and think the author could have also!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Concept fiction is good, but take this author's agenda away!","review":"Olivia Goldsmith did a great job with _First Wives Club_, and her \\"concept\\" fiction -- that is, stuff built up around Hollywood (_Flavor of the Month_), fashion (_Fashionably Late_), or publishing (_The Bestseller_) -- was even better.But the problem is that when she attempts to construct a story without a theme, it ends up with a theme.Repeat after me: \\"Men are bad. Men are evil. Men are pigs.\\"I'm as feminist as the next woman, but come freaking on. I can only tolerate so much drivel personifying Evil Comes In The Y Chromosome.It's really sad, because her earlier fiction is great. This stuff is pathetic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stop the Insanity","review":"I've really enjoyed this author's earlier works, but this novel left me flat. The storylines were painfully predictible. There were some jewels hidden in the mire, though it wasn't really worth the effort to find them. I found myself saying please finish and let the pain stop. The stories were contrived and generally unbelievable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nasty and mean-spirited","review":"Every other book Ms. Goldsmith has written has had an element of lovingkindness, rueful acceptance that life ain't perfect, and a sense of mature, adult hope. This book just struck me as a journal-fantasy by a very unhappy person who pulls a lot of weight in the publishing industry; and it's not very well copy-edited at that. Sorry, won't be buying more Goldsmith."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book disgusted me","review":"It's not about the boring style and flat characters, but the fact that the 'heroes' show such a despicable behavior that I was upset in reading it. These women faces bad husbands, we agree, but they pay them back with such a disgusting behavior that shows how they are not a bit better than them. I couldn't help feeling bad for the children. This book should be a manual about how not to behave during divorce, no matter if you're wife or husband."},{"rating":"1","title":"trash to the trash","review":"Based on the excellent, clever movie \\"The First Wives Club\\", I bought two of Olivia Goldsmith's books. Both went into the trash. \\"Young Wives\\" is disapponting and poorly written with a very preditable, stereotypical plot. I have never taken the time to review a book, but this one was such a waste of time and money, I feel obligated to warn other readers - beware."},{"rating":"2","title":"Suburban sisterhood","review":"From the first witty chapter heading, Olivia Goldsmith dismantles the perfect suburban lives of attorney Angela, bank manager Jada and housewife Michelle. Then, with her characteristic wit, irony and laugh-aloud humor, she weaves their lives together and with not-so-surprising plot twists, gives them the strength to triumph over incredible (read man related) adversity.While I read, I was sure I'd met Angela, Jada and Michelle before. I loved watching them develop new powers and talents as their friendship deepened. And, now that I've finished Young Wives, I miss them. I'd love to read a sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Howlingly Funny!","review":"This is the first Goldsmith book I've read, though I did see and enjoy \\"The First Wives Club\\" movie. It has interesting and believeable female characters, slimeball husbands, and a fabulous revenge plot, all of which make it entirely enjoyable in the hands of a very accomplished writer. While I personally like my hiss! boo! villians a little more nuanced, watching them receive their comeuppance was extremely satisfying. Goldsmith understands real female bonding. Her sub-theme of what happens when women's idealistic dreams are shattered, and how they must become independent to achieve lasting happiness, adds a certian poignancy to the book. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sad, Funny and some ingenuous revenge","review":"Jada, Angie and Michelle are the three heroines in the piece. They are great friends with terrible husbands. But then what would a Goldsmith novel be without \\"terrible\\" men. It was sad and funny...the bit about the crazy glue was brilliant! No, not all men are as scummy as the ones found in a Goldsmith novel but hey, this is fiction folks! I enjoy the author's sense of humor and her rich imagination when she plots out the heroines revenge. An enjoyable read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was pretty disappointed with this book. I'd read such good reviews of Olivia Goldsmith that I was expecting a really funny book. This book is about men that are the lowest of the low and the women who love them. I found the female characters to be fairly stupid and the male characters to be dispicable. This might be a fun read if you'd recently been with a guy who has done something horrible to you, but if you're not a man hater at the moment, you'll probably be unhappy with this choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"No one gets revenge like Olivia Goldsmith","review":"Olivia Goldsmiths books are getting to be formulaic-woman wronged, woman gets revenge-but the revenge part is just so much fun! In this novel, the protagonists are three women in their thirties-the young wives of the title. Their husbands have secret lives, cheating drug dealing, and the marriages fall apart. They all get together at a legal clinic for victimized women and the fun begins. Definitely worth reading!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware!","review":"I heard Emanuel Ax play the Chopin Concerto No. 1 in concert. It was stunning. I immediately bought this CD, hoping it would replicate the experience. I was dismayed that not only did this historic piano sound honky-tonk and tinny, but the high registers were out of tune as well. I didn't make it through an entire listening of the CD - it was simply too painful! I'm scared to give it another chance. I would NOT recommend this recording to anyone who wants to relax and enjoy the beauty of Chopin!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Art - 'Supernatural Fairytales' (Edsel)","review":"Originally released in 1967, as this was the British progressive / psych band's sole effort. Most memorable tunes are \\"I Think I'm Going Weird\\", \\"African Thing\\", title track \\"Supernatural Fairytale\\", \\"Love Is Real\\" (good soulful vibe, as I'm sure I remember hearing this song on late night FM radio sometime ago) and \\"Rome Take Away Tree\\". Line-up, included a couple of future Spooky Tooth members - Mike Harrison - keyboard & vocals, Luther Grosvenor - guitar & vocals, Greg Ridley (Humble Pie) - bass and Mike Kellie - drums. Might appeal to fans of Wishbone Ash, Free, Humbie Pie and possibly Traffic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Quality","review":"Ordered this hardware to mount some fork mounted wind deflectors that I made.The hardware is high quality and holds the deflectors very securely.I have now ridden about 10,000 miles with absolutely no problems.

Very nice.The drum-duet is boring and un-inspiring, and should not have been included. After all, when you've heard this, I only have one wish: To see Genesis live!"},{"rating":"2","title":"For the progressive fans , a little present a little too lat","review":"It is obvious that there are 2 type of fans of Genesis , those who like the pop years , and those who like the ART rock years .Drum Duet is a MUST , 2 minutes too short , it shows that Collins could do it when he wanted , just the money factor was stronger ."},{"rating":"1","title":"sadly mediocre","review":"It's such a shame that Genesis went commercial, not that it was all terrible, but that they never challenged their musical abilities once they did. Sure, the recording is great, but the songs get stale quickly, as the band makes no effort to do anything different than the album versions. The ending of the old medley is abominable, as phil tries to spurt out as many song choruses as he can in a terrible butchering. The best moment is the mid-section of Firth of Fifth, showing how elaborate their songs can be, but it also shows how fabulous guitarist Daryl Stuermer is criminally underused, playing bass while the terrible lead of Mike Rutherford wanders around. Firth of Fifth is Daryl's only chance to perform to his capabilities, and the same is true of the whole band. Hearing this fine moment followed by the dullness of the rest of the cd illustrates just how far this once proud band has fallen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not fossilized yet","review":"The longs album is a much better idea, to me, than the shorts one. Not that I don't also love 'Invisible Touch,' etc., but those songs I feel are much better appreciated in the studio. These particular songs are better appreciated in a live context. \\"Fading Lights\\" and \\"Home By the Sea\\" are highlights, as well as parts of the 'Old Medley.'Actually, some parts of the 'Medley' are strangly boring, exemplified by my friend's comment during Musical Box: \\"hey, didn't this song used to rock?\\" Some other parts are very enjoyable, though, especially Firth of Fifth.Definitely not by any means essential, but still 70+ minutes of music performed by the last true version of a great band."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn","review":"This live collection suggests that during the 80s and 90s Genesis's longer tunes were just as lacking in ideas as their pop singles. Putting \\"Home by the Sea\\", \\"Domino\\" and \\"Fading Lights\\" on here may have been a sop to older fans, but they bore the hell out of me. There's also an out-of-place drum duet and a 20 minute medley of older songs which sounds like a bad cut'n'paste job. This is marginally better than the other volume of The Way We Walk, but is that really saying anything?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best kept secret in goth music","review":"These musicians are truly amazing.

Oh, and both an editor and a copywritter would have been helpful...they couldn't have turned this pig's ear into a silk purse, but it would have been slighlty less painful.Oh, and one side note: The praise above for the author (not reader reviews, the critics reviews) is not for this book, but for a different book.

What's missing in all this is any sense of terror; most of us know this world too well to find it frightening, and Campbell doesn't give us the kind of pathology of place that makes, for instance, Shirley Jackson's sour spots -- especially Hill House -- so enthralling. As for the plot, skip any fifty pages after the first and see if it makes much difference."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good","review":"i have to disagree with the previous review of this book. i think Mr.Campbell is a great writer but i think this is one of the worst horror novel's he has ever written. the story centers around a book store obviously. apparently the store is haunted or some such it is never very clear what is going on.what happens through most of the book is the store's employee's bicker back and forth and there is always fog surrounding the building. apparently there are grey blobs that also play a part here too but i am not too sure what. this is literally what happens throughout the book. grey blobs run around the shelf pulling books down. the lift is probably the scariest thing in this book.don't get me wring there are some generally creepy moments in this book but they are few and far between. the story line is never really explained either except for a pitiful ending that tries to wrap everything up and make sense of it all. the book is just not very good..."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst books I have ever read","review":"Mr. Campbell's short horror stories are among the best ever written.

But the best way to sum up my feelings is in this simple statement: Ramsey Campbell has gone into my wallet and stolen $7.99 (plus tax) of my hard-earned money.

I liked the chapters being told from different employees' points of view - the characters didn't seem too hard to keep track of because while there are many perspectives, the chapters aren't limited to just the one person speaking - you just get to know the characters better because it's through more than one person's view. I could appreciate much about the plot, but I wish more detail could have been given regarding the fates of the characters - I don't mind not knowing all that happens to them (some \\"cliffhangers\\" are fine), but I'd like more on what happened (as in background) and WHY it happened - there is the \\"embittered author\\" who offers just a speck of background, and there are a few other clues, but I wanted more.

I only got about 20 pages into the novel and found that I had to stop reading it... why? This is the most poorly edited book I have ever read in my life! I found myself questioning my own reading ability in trying to read this book. Words, sentence structure, and tenses seem to be slapped together in a total attempt to be absolutely incoherent. Like I said, I started blaming myself - that maybe I was too tired when sitting down and reading this - but after showing other people the claptrap that seemed to plague the first 20 pages I realized that this book was desperately in search of an editor and, I hate to say it, a writer. If this is the style that Ramsey Campbell has evolved in to then I can seriously understand why he had to get a second job and work in a bookstore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Abyssmal","review":"I'm really trying to finish this book simply because it's not so engrossing that I'd ever miss my stop on mny daily commute. There is nothing scary about this book besides the day-to-day horror of working in a bookstore (of which I can speak first-hand). It drags so much you wish something awful would hurry up and happen just so you don't have to deal with such boring characters and lack of storyline any longer."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a pity!","review":"Robertson's Marmalades WERE superb. Their \\"chunky\\" and \\"original\\" were both best of all marmalades made anywhere. Unfortunately the only one the new owners chose to save of Robertson's many types is the insipid \\"Golden Shred\\", not worth bothering the effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"silly and unoriginal","review":"The title says it all. This is another typical ghost story in which a wealthy dead guy gathers together a bunch of strangers to his isolated, creepy old mansion. Ghosts appear, people get picked off, and then the evil ghost is defeated. One of the ghosts has a chopped off hand that crawls around and attacks people ala Thing in the Addams Family. If that were not ridiculous enough, the main ghost inhabits a statue carved out of wood and stumbles around like Frankenstein's monster carrying his head. The final straw is that the good guys are annoying and just not likeable. There is no vivid and mind capturing description of the mansion or its history. There is no sense of mystery or suspense. This book is just bad and I want my money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"book - the manor","review":"Never did finish this book. It's so jumbled and takes forever to build each character. Wish more time was spent getting to the nitty gritty and leaving some of the character and scenic descriptions up to my imagination. The scenes flip around so much, I had to keep going backwards to figure out what last happened at each situation. Definitely not a Dean Koontz, Stephen King, or Patricia Cornwell book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the Scare?","review":"Thought I would try a new author, and was very disappointed...a lot of build up to nothing...would not recommend this book to anyone. If you want to read something to keep you awake at night, try THE DEVIL IN GRAY by Grahamn Masterson or ETERNITY by Tamara Thorne. Great reads!"},{"rating":"1","title":"My 1.5F capacitor was more like .4F","review":"It is pretty easy to measure how much energy is stored in a capacitior. Use the following equiation V=I*T/C. Since my PowerAcustik capacitor draws about .1A to run the display, all you need to do to check the capacitance is see how long it takes the voltage to drop once you disconnect it from the source of power. For example, in my case it took about 4 seconds for the voltage to drop from 13.5 down to 12.5. Rearranging the equation and solving for C....I come up with about .4F. Fortunaetly, .4F is still probably good enough to ride out one thump of the car stereo...so it propably doesn't matter at the end of the day...but I still want to get what I am paying for. F. H.

I purchased the black ones, the lines are actually see through, they appear silver in the picture online. Overall for the price paid these are a descent set. Note that the width of the mountain fenders is only about as wide as my 1.75\\" tires. There not as wide as some of the older retro style metal fenders out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"look for version 6 now out","review":"Excellent software, very stable. Version 6 is now out, on the +DVD side, it's now version 3. The newer version fixes my only quibble with the software, it adds support for project playlists so you can put your video on the DVD and do scene selection menus without copying it on again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some Truth about Ramesses","review":"Finally, a book which without being overbearing gives the reader a great overview of the amazing man known as Ramesses II! Well written and enjoyable to read, \\"Ramesses II, Greatest of the Pharaohs\\" is a beautifully illustrated guide to the life of one of history's most interesting men. I was very impressed with the attention paid to the gods and the impact they had on the kings of the 19th dynasty, as well as the listing of Ramesses known advisors, sons and wives. All in all, a very enjoyable book for those with an interest in Ramesses and Ancient Egypt."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intriguing, descriptive, and elaborate","review":"Very nice book. Pages are all colorfully illustrated and well written. Focuses on every point of Ramesses's life possible. Very informative and would recommend to anyone who is a Egypt enthusiast or for reference."},{"rating":"2","title":"The New Messies Manual: The Procrastinator's Guide to Good Housekeeping","review":"This method of housekeeping changed me from a genuine \\"messy\\" to a better-than-average housekeeper when I took Sandra Felton's original course in Miami, FL in 1981. However, 31 years of career and 3 major moves, caused me to lose my original course materials. I was delighted to see the updated manual, and was pleased to note that the original core material, such as the \\"Mount Vernon\\" housekeeping method, is still featured. Everything, from blinds to throw rugs to ceiling fans and shower enclosures, can be cleaned regularly and quickly with instructions from this manual! Sandra Felton's humor, compassion, and true desire to streamline and improve the often dreary task of housekeeping make this manual a real asset in a modern home."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Much Talk","review":"I was really motivated to change my housekeeping habits when I bought this book, but by the time I got to chapter 12 where they actually teach you some techniques I lost interest.I agree with a previous reviewer that there is too much \\"why\\" and not enough \\"how\\". It analyzes too much about what makes us messies tick, and only about half the book gets into strategies for changing your habits. I think that if you are buying this book you already KNOW you have issues, just get to the point already!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great...","review":"I have not seen in any of the editorial info that Ms. Felton has a medical degree, yet she blithely states in this book that if you are a \\"messie\\", you probably have ADD. Gee, like ADD and ADHD aren't already overused as an excuse for just about anything these days--it is now a fashionable way to say your children have these \\"disabilities\\" in order to get them extra test time at school. Anyone would rather read a book or watch TV than clean house, that doesn't mean you have a disorder, it means you are normal!I liked her earlier books (where she goes into specific types of upbringing that can influence your housekeeping--or lack thereof--style), and was hoping for good info from this book, but the ADD copout turned me right off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much talk, not enough \\"how to\\"","review":"I felt that this book spent too much time talking about \\"why\\" someone is a Messie. If you're looking for in-depth analysis of why you might have issues with housework, this is the book for you. If you're looking for some fast ideas on how to keep the house tidy, there's better books out there (such as \\"Sink Reflections\\" or \\"Confessions of an Organized Homemaker\\"). Some of the ideas in this book sound great, but honestly - if a person is finding it hard to tackle the housework, are they going to tackle making a complicated file system for reminding them to do the housework? Probably not. This book could be an addition to housekeeping books but I wouldn't recommend it as the main one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Understand Your Personal \\"Whys\\"","review":"This insightful book tells the story of everyone who tries to keep house and somehow never manages to get it together. Not only does it help the reader understand why they are the way they are, but it offers simple, helpful baby steps to achieve a pretty house. If you want to invite company over without blocking the three days before they come to get your house ready, if you cringe when company arrives unexpectedly, or if you just can't fit another box anywhere, this book is for you. It gives you the tools to become a successful average housekeeper. This book is definitely a keeper... You'll want to read it over and over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"music could last longer","review":"It is very lovely. I do enjoy the beauty of it, but for $40, it could play music longer than it does which I would say plays for about 3 minutes.

It goes great with the bedding set! My only concern is that we have a fancy sleigh crib that has a \\"headboard looking\\" back part to it. It is one that converts later on. Well the mobile does not fit in the back of the crib so we had to put it on the front. I hate looking at that large plastic thing sticking out of the front of my crib. I wish they would make it more versitile for all the newer crib styles. My daughter is not born yet (3 more weeks) but I think I might have to remove it sooner than most because it is in the front of the crib and can posssibly get in the way when putting her down to sleep. I can't wait to try it though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful but can not mount on the wall","review":"This item is truly beautiful as other reviewers have said, however, it lacks one very important thing.

It is insightful, a bit nostalgic and autobiographical. The entire cassette devoted to the Exploded story is quite deftly presented \\"live\\" to an audience who randomly choose which of the twelve or so segments he reads next. Bodett is a master of writing stand-alone stories that fit perfectly into a sequence. I must say that Exploded made me howl and also brought me to tears--I consider this to be a strong endorsement!Tom Bodett has so obviously LIVED his life that it is a real treat when he shares his defining moments,his friends, his heart-felt eperiences with the rest of us. I only regret that there are so many people who would get so much joy from his work but who only know him as \\"that Motel 6 guy\\" Believe me he is much, much more!"},{"rating":"1","title":"for die hard Bodett fans","review":"It was good to hear the piano music of JohnnyB again; it was good (as always) to hear Tom's voice. But...The story is taken from Tom's life. The particular episode involves climbing a power pole, being electrocuted (surprise!),and almost losing an arm.The story lacks the tale teller's humor of \\"The End of the Road\\" and is a bit self serving at times.If you are one of those people (like me) that reads EVERYTHING an author has ever done, then this is one for the collection. Otherwise, don't bother."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"This is the coordinating lamp that goes with thepaloma crib bedding. It puts off a nice medium light.

Though many people probably won't agree with all of his conclusions, it seems to me that a reading of Dawson's work is essential to understanding western culture."},{"rating":"2","title":"the truth","review":"The truth is, the Melvins, while most worthy of the played out \\"grunge\\" title, are not responsible for it at all. They are in fact \\"dirge metal\\". They are not Northwest, rather Bay Area.Whenever and however you take this album, it is about the best of dark, droning, beautiful music it can get.

It was the first music I had ever heard by the Melvins. A few months later I forced myself to listen to it again, and I was transformed. I couldn't believe that I actually disliked it the first time I heard it. It kept growing and growing on me. There's not one song on the whole album that I don't love, and the fact that nearly all the lyrics are unintelligible actually adds to the overall appeal.Be warned: alot of reviews of this album as well as other albums by the Melvins tend to categorize the music as grunge or alternative. As far as I can tell, the Melvins are in their OWN musical category.......so don't expect to hear Nirvana/Pearl Jam types of songs here. The music on Houdini ranges from speed metal to sludge to god knows what. Give it a whirl.......I'm glad I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's all relative","review":"Mostly forgetable, compared to all Melvins albums that came it.

This one is harder and sludgier than the others and represents Melvins at their peak with this type of sound. Coming from the grunge era you can only see some of that at this point.

Rather than waiting until she was ready to eat to start warming the bottle, we started warming it an hour ahead of time. It was warm enough by then.

As a previous poster noted, the heating wrap gets warm, but never warm enough to heat the contents of a bottle. After 45 minutes, our formula had inched its way up from cold to barely room temperature, and after that much time, I started to worry about food safety. Going through the Starbucks drive-through and asking for an extra cup of piping hot water to warm a bottle in is more practical than using this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate this bottle warmer!","review":"Before purchasing this bottle warmer from Target, I had the regular bottle warmer by Munchkin (not the deluxe one shown here). The original would heat a bottle pretty quickly to a pretty high temperature (which was great for long car rides!). This one, however, does not work. I can't even get it to keep a bottle warm after I have warmed the water in the microwave and then place the bottle in the warmer in the bag and plug it in. Maybe mine has a defect, but from my personal experience, the original munchkin car bottle warmer works MUCH better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not warm a bottle","review":"While the inside of this device does get warm to the touch it will not warm a bottle (even a room temperature bottle).

I have tried having it plugged in for over an hour and the bottle only got vaguely warm. Save your money don't buy this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible product- doesn't work","review":"I really like some munchkin products, but this is not one of them. They can't seem to get it right with the warmers and this one is just worthless.

Don't waste your money on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Biggest waste of money","review":"We bought this warmer at Target to take with us on a 8 hr car ride. I kept the bottles in a cooler on our drive and when I tried to heat them up after an hour in this warmer, the bottle was still cold.

At first he thought it was steam, but then he opened the warmer to check and a metal peice was burning through the plastic and started melting the bottle!DO NOT BUY THIS, it is a serious safety hazard...I also talked to my sister about it because she had one previously, and theirs also started smoking in the car so bad they had to throw it out the window into a snow bank.Do not risk it..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money.","review":"This barely warmed my bottles and I left them in there for at least 30 min.

It is about a very happy couple, a miller and his beautiful wife, who live in a pretty mill-house in Andalusia, Southern Spain, in the early 1800's. Everybody in town has a crush with the miller's wife, including the town's principal political figure, a disgusting, lascivious old man. When this man tries to seduce the woman, all hell breaks loose in a crazy tale of mistaken identities, nocturnal escapades, horseriding and farce. It is a very easy to read book and it will give you a couple of hours of good-written entertainment, just like if you had gone to the movies, only here you get to decide the faces, places and color of everything."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rosen and his grandmas","review":"The title is a little misleading. This book doesn't have all that much to do with the internet (Rosen uses it as a point of departure and a point of reference, but I guess I think his analogy can only go so far). But it is a very nice quasi-memoir. Rosen ponders the different experiences and natures of his two grandmothers, one born in America and the benefitiary of a comfortable American upbringing, the other an immigrant and refugee. It's a nice read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disappointing, but....","review":"I was disappointed by The Talmud and the Internet for two reasons. First, it was more a collection of essays on a common theme than an extended meditation, which is what I was expecting. As such, it was frequently redundant. Slight as it was, it could have been even more so. Second, it was very much more Talmud than Internet, which the author does in fact mention in his preface. But the connection between the Talmud and the Internet was not very well developed.Some of the problem may well be, of course, that my expectations were off. Leaving those aside, it was worth reading. The prose is thoughtful and graceful, and the tone very personal. Rosen's description of the Talmud as a sort of literary replacement for the Temple at Jerusalem was new to me. I was also interested in his comparison of the multi-generational, non-linear aspect of the Talmud to the idiosyncratic character of the Internet (and, as mentioned above, would have liked to see this better developed)."},{"rating":"1","title":"A lot of fluff, no meat.","review":"I was very disappointed with this book.

It is just not the kind of writing to which I am accustom. If you like writtings which take a thoroughly explicit and systematic approach to religious questions this book is probably not for you. Still, I think it is impossible to read this book without being moved by the power the author's holiness.

I looked at some of the other brackets in this price range and they felt flimsy and unreliable. The Manfrotto 233B, on the other hand, is a very solid bracket for a very good price.On the down side, this would not be a great choice if you were going to want to shoot in vertical orientation often, or if you wanted to switch quickly from one orientation to the other. Yes, it is possible to twist the flash arm around so the flash is above the camera in vertical orientation. But it's awkward to do this. I have to sit down, hold the whole shebang very carefully, and it takes a couple of seconds. And it's very awkward to use the camera like this.But if you're content to keep the camera in normal (horizontal) orientation, this bracket is a good way to do it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Flash Bracket","review":"This is a great flash bracket it works well with various light modifiers.

This bracket lets you get a lot of separation between the lens and the flash, dramatically reducing red-eye problems. It's a bit heavy, but I use a monopod when I'm shooting so the weight doesn't matter much. The only other disadvantage of this bracket is that you can't rotate the flash from landscape to portrait alignment. If that important to you, you can solve the problem by adding a mini-ballhead to the flash mount.There's lots of flexibility in how you position the camera and the flash unit. See the user photos others have posted for more info on this. Overall, a really practical bracket at a great price."},{"rating":"1","title":"reject","review":"The one I received was evidently a return.

The true compositions (Roundabout, Heart of the Sunrise, and South Side of the Sky) are excellent, no doubt about it. But the solo pieces are average to poor, and really serve as no more than filler (as a matter of fact, this album was rush-released to pay for Wakeman's huge number of keyboards).

I found the book predictable and not very interesting. There were a few parts that made me laugh. However, all and all I found the book not very exciting. Also, I thought she tired to relate to us \\"everyday\\" women, but she lost me when she suggested getting a personal trainer to help lose the baby weight. I mean come on, give me something that is realistic. I don't have to time or the money for a personal trainer. I am mother who works full time and takes care of my son. I don't have my afternoon's free to give my son to the nanny and have a personal trainer come to my house. Plus, she talks all this talk about her wonderful hunsband and how they made it through everything together. Give me a break, she is now divorced."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny and True","review":"I truly enjoyed reading this book. Jenny gives some detailed descriptions but they are so true that you can't help but find youself laughing outloud with her. Recommend this book to any expecting mothers or those who are already moms. Makes you feel good to know even celebrities go through the ups and downs of pregnancy."},{"rating":"2","title":"WONDERFUL BOOK!","review":"To my surprise, this book was just as good as BELLY LAUGHS. Very funny and blunt stories about her first year of being a Mommy. I highly recommend this book to everyone I know expecting a baby and even to those who already have children. The only reason I didn't give this a full 5 stars is because of the length of the book. It's a short read. I finished it in one day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Hit :-)","review":"I bought this because of the belly laughs book, and altho the belly laughs i thought had more humor to it, this book was great also. i will be getting the life laughs book next."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious","review":"I read both of McCarthy's books (Belly Laughs and Baby Laughs). While her course and brutally descriptive language may be offensive to some, there are some true pearls in her humor. The book is not meant to be an intellectual journey or provide reference, but is wonderful prose for moms just wanting some validation. I laughed out loud at both books and provided you like McCarthy's style, you can't help it. She describes the selfless sacrifice that a mother gives for her child in the voice of the class clown without cheapening the underlying sentiment. She is seriously funny. I would buy as a shower gift (for my \\"Non-stick-in-the-mud\\" friends). A perfect lighthearted read for stressed,sleep-deprived moms or moms-to-be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Hit","review":"As with Belly Laughs, I was pleasantly surprised to find that I loved this book. It was very down to earth and made me laugh. It was nice to know that a celebrity shared similar experiences that I have in my baby's first year of life and wasn't afraid to talk about them. I would highly recommend this book to new moms."},{"rating":"2","title":"OMG this book is awesome!","review":"I read this book at the end of my second trimester and laughed so hard I started crying. I read it in two nights and I swear my husband thought I was nuts. Jenny talks about things others do not. I thought I was the only one who had the \\"snail trail.\\" I started asking my family and friends who have children about things and they were like yeah I remember that and I am like why didn't you ever say anything or warn me!

Something to check out of the library maybe, not one I'd purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time!","review":"Yes, I am aware that Jenny McCarthy is not a baby expert. I thought reading this book would be at least amusing, unfortunately it does not even have that. This book would have been better titled, \\"What I heard from my friends about parenting.\\" Several times in the book she mentions certain woes of the first year such as colic and breastfeeding and then says she did not actually go through them herself but she heard alot about it from her friends! Don't waste your money on this tiny little book. If you must read it for whatever reason, check it out at the library as I did and don't expect to gain any new insight on parenting from this book. Jenny McCarthy is obviously just trying to capitalize on her B-status celebrity by throwing together a stupid book that she did no research on and expecting the public to buy it. Don't!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Moments of truth, hours of baloney","review":"It may be that it has been too long since I've had a newborn. (my youngest is 3.) I've always enjoyed Jenny McCarthy's acting and when I saw this book I picked it up. I agree with some of the other reviews that she comes across as a very uninformed parent all the while claiming she did oodles of research (e.g. breastfeeding, circumcision).Needless to say I didn't enjoy this book, I didn't find it funny - perhaps Jenny is more of a visual artist, not literary.The one thing she nailed on the head was the chapter on mommy competition. While she did not explore this topic in depth, she did relate some amusing tales about hearing and dealing with this issue.Overall, I give this book 1 star. Luckily, it is a quick read and I didn't waste too much time reading it and I checked it out of the library, which I suggest you do also!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny","review":"A very light and fast-paced read with humorous anecdotes.

I read it in two days; I didn't want to put it down. I found myself giggling out loud, this book was great. Jenny McCarthy has a knack for writing. I wasn't a fan before and didn't really expect too much, I was pleasantly surprised and highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great book!!","review":"Jenny McCarthy is a truly gifted writer. My sister gave me this book as a Mothers Day gift after having Baby #2. Jenny depicts the first year of \\"mommyhood\\" as realistic as you can get!

She made a decision to circumcise her child without being informed in the slightest about the harm and diminishment that it would mean to him. Do your child a favor and pass on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't find it funny at all","review":"She circumsised her son because she wanted his penis to 'look pretty' (her words) That is not funny.

Clearly you are living in the dark ages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy read, lots of laughs","review":"Just like her book, Belly Laughs, Jenny McCarthy delivers honesty and hilarity. A quick read, I finished this book in one day- while caring for my newborn. Thank goodness for nap time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny, especially for new moms!","review":"I read this book for the first time when I was pregnant with my second child. I shared a few chapters with my husband and we laughed uproariously. I recently reread it and laughed just as much -- thrilled those diaper years are behind me.I love how McCarthy is so open -- she leaves no subject undone -- and I respect her greatly for that.This book doesn't try to teach you anything, though you may inadvertently learn some tips. She's being truthful about HER experiences and her reaction to them. Having written my own books of humorous essays, I also like that the essays are short -- she's targeting the busy mom.Definitely now a classic, this is a great book for any mom to be!Rachel Thompson, bestselling author A Walk In The Snark and The Mancode: Exposed"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mommyhood","review":"Quirky quite funny and sometimes quite true (at least from this male's perspective).

I NEED FOOT NOTES! Some of his claims are so ridiculous, not to mention racist. I'm all for educating the black community but there should be proof to support his outrageous claims.

I have high hopes of using this scanner for many years thanks to the more robust construction. A scanner isn't really a portable appliance, so I'm happy to be getting heavy steel for my money.The automatic configuration software seems to be pretty smart. For instance, it trims the scan to exactly the size of the scanned object.Color quality and image sharpness are first rate.I am SO happy to have moved up to an office grade scanner instead of wasting hours fighting with a \\"bargain\\" model."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great quality but a bit slow.","review":"I purchased the HP 5200Cxi about a month ago and have found it to be great.

Also, the last two letters of the \\"wusthof\\" logo stamped on the front are so faint as to be unreadable. I'm wondering if I received a knockoff or factory second.

The plot could have been good but the lack of love between the two characters left me cold. Not only that I have a hard time believing that Caterine who was raped multiple times by soldiers doesn't have deep emotinal problems and she would need tenderness instead of constantly thinking about his groin.Marmaduke has the same problem and if I had a dollar for every time he thought about it I could buy another book.

I most certainly would have noticed. They must have edited it in Soviet version of the novel and reprinted the original version in this last 2009 edition. It left me with the very unpleasant taste, although understandable about the attitiudes existing at the time, but still... I can't love Sand the same way anymore.

As the series developed It began to lack all credibility. I think it became a victim of it's overt complicated plot line.

He defends a \\"causal trope\\" account to this end. His development criticizes (amongst others) the views of Donald Davidson on events, and does not do adequate justice to exploring them for his purposes.

For example, most people use the unsharp mask or sharpen tools to crispen images, in addition to this, she will show you some lesser-known features such as high-pass, which may give better sharpening results in many situations. This whole book is based on stuff like that. So if you are interested in exploring lesser-known ways of going about things, then you should get it.

The ones that do exist, for the most part, are pretty dry and sleep-inducing.The nice thing about Hunting the Elements is that it appeals to a pretty wide range of ages and ability levels. There is an excess of corny jokes, for sure, but these keep the younger and lower-level students attention. There is also a pretty reasonable level of actual chemistry content: electron orbitals, radioactivity, the breaking and re-assembling of chemical bonds that occur during a reaction, and so on.The video is also divided into sections that are relevant for different classes, so if you're teaching bio, you can show the 15 minute segment on the elements of life. Upper level chem students might be more interested in the rare earth metals."},{"rating":"1","title":"For an Emotional trip - but terrible book","review":"I agree with Mark bennett \\"Mark\\" and wish I could have read it as fast as his four hours, I wasted 12 hours,"},{"rating":"2","title":"HOT!

This album does not connect for me. It is an Original Cast Recording- which in retrospect I've come to realize means that all this music is created by people who not only like, but also perform in musicals. Musicals lack sincerity almost by definition. After all, they are the inhuman, plastinated smile of music- which is the polar opposite of what I've come to love about the music Crumb and pals have introduced me to. Net result is that there is nothing substantive to hold onto at all on this album.Save your money and fill out your Cheap Suit Serenaders collection or go with \\"That's what I call Sweet Music\\" (an AMAZING collection) or R.

This video was produced poorly and the sound quality reverberates and it is irritating to where you cannot take this serious. It sounds like porno music. If you have seen the commercials you can hear the music in the background although it is faint. Borrow one from a friend first and you can judge for yourself.

All fitness regimines that teach you how to define your chest, arms, triceps, etc.... always show tons of gym equipment, or they have routines done at home that just do not produce results. The Fitness Made Simple Upper Body Workout is the only one that can be done at home and produce better results than most gym equipment can. John lays it all out for you and I loved that I understood what to do, how to do it, why I was doing it, and bottom line loved the results it gave me in just a few weeks! This is the best upper body workout I have ever done, and even though I go to a gym now just to get out of the house, I still utilize all the concepts and the same exercises because they simply are the best ones I can do to get the results that I want to achieve.

I found it online and ordered it immediately. I received the CD very quickly (much quicker than I expected).The songs are very reminiscent of old southern charm and oddities. Songs like Big Houses and Family Tree are so back porch-y - I can imagine sitting out with friends and family, someone reaches for a guitar and this is what you'd expect to hear. Kill the Mockingbird is a humorous recount of starting off a bad day. Sometimes I wake up and no matter how wonderful and beautiful the day may be, I am just grumpy (though I've never wanted to kill a mockingbird!). :) So many of the songs are fun and well-written southern tunes.Overall, I love the CD and was very pleased with the service and fast delivery."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was disappointed...","review":"While the artwork and verse is generally lovely, I was very disappointed by the reference to ''Mother Earth'' for the letter ''M''.

The picture was terribly grainy and the sound volume varies frequently. The voice dubbing was hilariously bad. The plot involves a villain named Chia-Siu (roast pork?) who tries to kill a Tibetan prince and ignite a war between the prince's faction and the Shaolin temple. The movie largely consists of fight after fight, tied together by a thin plot. The fighting was good, but not the best I've seen. Pay close attention to the scene where the prince visits a temple during a funeral ceremony, and you will see a couple of black-and-white photographs of the deceased people displayed prominently on the altar - photographs in ancient China?!!!

It's a good prehistory of Everest, Mallory and Irvine. Ghosts rightfully covers the search for them but only lightly touches on Mallory and Irvine. This book talks about Mallory and Irvine and lightly touches the search for their bodies.The one thing I liked was the fact the book portrayed the men as being men. Mallory had his faults like anybody else. For example, He could be forgetful, he was a little bit of a slob and he could get moody.One thing that is lacking is the amount of information about Irvine. I see there is a book about him.If you are looking for information about the finding of Mallory's body, don't look to this book. As mentioned, it only gives a couple chapters to it.

Ironically however, if they did make it, it might have helped cause their deaths. By the time they would have got there it would have been early evening at the earliest. Then tiredness, exhaustion, dehydration combined might have caused Mallory's fall to his death. The irony being that they were at that point quite close, less than 200 ft, from Camp VI, from where they set off that morning. This book is divided into two parts. Part one is a biography of George Mallory, and a brief history of Himalayan mountanerring expeditions up till the 1920s, the second is an account of the expedition that found Mallory's body earlier this year. Worth reading, if only to look at the possible scenearios and evidence"},{"rating":"2","title":"Priceless view of history","review":"Includes photographs from the expeditions of the 1920s and excerpts from letters, interviews, and journals of the members of those expeditions. All but the last 2 chapters focus on those expeditions. The final 2 chapters are about the expedition to find the bodies (they found Mallory's, but not Irving's) and their suppositions about whether Mallory and Irving summited or not. The final question remains a question, although we have enough evidence right now that a good argument could be made saying that they did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting for all readers","review":"I approached this book as something that seemed interesting. I am not a climber, not particularly interested in Everest, and not even that much of a history buff.

But, for \\"The Story of My Life\\" album I cannot say that. I find 10 of the tracks ok but I do have a problem with track 9 \\"Sunny Day\\". Deana thanked God for her gift and the album but I do not think He gave her this song. The profanity is hard to take and ruins the song.

If not mistaken, she came out with a CD \\"Collection\\" after 2 CDs. What's that all about - run out of material? Even her debut CD \\"Did I shave my legs...\\" was mediocre at best.

However, let me be brief. This is evidently a very personal experience for the artist. Her voice tells the stories so well that to over analyze each song would be an injustice. This is an very good album that deserves, but probably will not get much airplay because the songs were not cut as \\"radio-hits.\\" They are in truth artistic expressions. Do youself a favor and listen to each song yourself and let Deana touch you as she will undoubtedly touch everyone with a heart who listens to her.

And the story was told in a way that the children actually got to \\"feel\\" what it was like to live in Matty's day and time, as well as the pressure of her circumstances of racial issues for that time.I would Highly reccommend this book for older kids, as a great way to open up conversations about different things."},{"rating":"1","title":"great material extremely bad sound quality","review":"I own more than 300 comedy cds. I am a Jeff Foxworthy fan. This is unfortunately the worst sounding comedy cd I have ever bought (ever worse that Rock's Bigger and Blacker). The sound level goes up and down so at some point you think you are listening to a golf game description and then think you are listening to someone using a megaphone at a protest rally. This happens track after track and deters from enjoying this cd. What I don't understand is if I can fix the problem with a little freeware program I found that copies the tracks and normalizes the sound, why can't the producer or warner brothers do it? And, believe it or not, the cd SKIPS!!! I suggest you either contact the producer of the cd or Warner Bros. and ask them when the correctly produced version of this cd will be re-released and buy it only then."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Jeff Foxworthy's Best!","review":"I just bought this album today and it's undoubtably one of Jeff Foxworthy's best.

Scholarly and far-reaching, it delves into linguistics, archaeology, religion, and other disciplines.It didn't actually dwell on the mummies of Tarim much. Most of it's book scholarship, not field investigation. It tries to show how various populations in China got where they did, using whatever means it can. In this regard, it succeeds. But I wish it'd talked about the actual mummies more than it did. I got occasional glimpses, but nothing more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clara Schumann bei mehr als","review":"Leck mich am Arsch! Clara Schumann bei mehr als 120 Millionen Menschen mit Deutsch als Muttersprache in 8 Ländern, überrascht es kaum, dass die tatsächliche Sprachverwendung variiert. Wie Englisch, ist Deutsch eine plurizentrische Sprache mit 3 nationalen Zentren der Sprachverwendung: Deutschland, Österreich und die Schweiz. Die sprachliche Schumann Situation in der Schweiz unterscheidet sich deutlich von der Situation in Deutschland und Österreich. 'Switzertütsch', die durchgängig verwendete Umgangssprache, wird auch von Deutschen und Österreichern kaum bzw. nicht verstanden. Das Verhältnis zwischen Switzertütsch und Hochdeutsch ist eines der Zweisprachigkeit. Aus diesem Grund bezieht Brahms sich der folgende Überblick nicht auf die Situation der Schweiz."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"The writer and director of this film is Peter Schamoni, not Alfred Hirschmeier as reported in another customer review, and he took most of the dialogue from the correspondence and other documentation of Robert,Clara and Friedrich Wieck. Anyone with knowledge of Schumann's correspondence, his love of poetry and dramatic narrative and the world of 19th century German romanticism will recognize the accuracy and faithfulness of the dialogue used throughout this wonderful film.The look and sound of the pianofortes used is another example of the care lavished on presenting Robert and Clara's world as accurately as possible.Good performances, excellent photography and glorious music.

There are good stretching techniques mentioned in the book, complete with exercise plans depending on your sport and an Question/Answer section.However, the book reads more like a technical thesis than something intended for a non-medical audience. For a book that is past its third revision, the pictures HAVE to be updated from grainy black-and-white and confusing stick figures. Finally, one can't help thinking less of the author when he peppers his writing with comments that show a lack of understanding of existing martial art stretching techniques.There is much that can be improved in this book.

I didn't really feel that her relationship with the love of her life was persuasive enough for me to get into. Why did Scarlett love a woman who was hardly in her life for most of the book?? That's the reason why I'm only giving this book a 4 out of 5. I wish I would have gotten to know that mysterious love more so that their coming togehter would have been more heartfelt and real.

I say this because their best work, namely the epics, are not on this. What you have here is a collection of their more popular songs from 1969-87. It's safe to say that most of these songs have gotten a considerable amount of airplay, and even a complete Yes virgin will recognize two or three of these songs.But, being a one disc album that covers almost 20 years of steady output from the band, it's bound to miss quite a bit. But you do get a sense of how the band evolved from it's late 60's British-prog roots to a more electronic pop band of the 80's.You do miss out on the more obscure recent output from 88-present, in which they return more or less to their prog roots, but bring their more electronic poppy sound to the music.But on the whole, this is a good cd for the casual Yes fan that only wants the hits."},{"rating":"2","title":"GET THIS CD NOW!","review":"The best cd of yes there ever was.

Maybe I'd have been better off buying one or two of their later albums. Strangly, I am glad I bought this CD, especially since I recorded a section of the guitar intro to \\"Owner of a Lonely Heart\\" onto my Wakeyoo alarm clock to wake me up in the morning. However, this is not one of those albums I'll be reaching when I just want to listen to music.

As it was released in 1993 when people still remember the glories of 80s great melodic rock masters. And for most of music fans Yes was part of melodic rock history represented by Asia/Survivor styled hits such as Owner of A Lonely Heart, and Love Will Find A Way. If you like 80s melodic rock superstars such as Asia, Survivor, Journey, Styx and Foreigner, it is definitely a must have because it shows progressive rock was fathers to those bands. Particularly Yes influence is immense for the development of melodic rock during late 70s. My favorites from this collection include Survival(very melodic indeed!) and I've Seen All Good People and Leave It as well as No.1 hit Owner of A Lonely Heart. Modern day prog appreciators who love Dream Theater or Transatlantic may, however, need different collections such as Classic Yes."},{"rating":"1","title":"PEOPLE BE REASONABLE","review":"I have nothing against greatest hit collections. However, a band like Yes is not a \\"singles\\" band. Yes, yes they did have hit singles but it wasn't something contrived or planned. Yes has CD's which take you on a musical journey. You can have favorite songs but to make a compilation of songs is like loping off a long distance runner's right foot because it is the dominant foot. Silly when you look at it that way isn't it. Like Jethro Tull, Yes was never a singles band. Buying this CD cuts you off from such beautiful musical landscapes that Yes created for you to hear in its entirety, not in bite sized pieces."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good introduction, or all the Yes the casual fan needs","review":"If you love the bombastic Yes singles that you hear on the classic rock station, but just can't get into the extended compositions on the albums, then this collection ought to do the trick for you. The hits are here; the few obscurities are well-chosen; and the duds (like from off of _Tormato_) are avoided. This stripped-down setting portrays the band's truly amazing instrumental virtuosity to all the better effect. It also testifies to their durability, tracing their career from late '60s mysticism, high baroque art-rock, to MTV pop smarts. This is only a part of Yes' career, but if the singles are the part that interest you, this is the disk to get."},{"rating":"1","title":"The pink color does not stay!","review":"This fades in the sun or should I say darkens.

We enjoyed sharing responses to questions, but kept the journal as a private time for her to write down what was in her heart.

This book covers everything from homosexual rights, to abortion, and how Christians view the poor and what should be done by Christians for the poor. If I have a criticism it is not my disagreement with Dr. Campolo on the issues he addresses, but I think he is predisposed to a certain kind of naivity in what he sometimes professes to believe.

Grew up near Detroit which in the 60s and 70s was truly on life support - a city dying right before ones eyes, but the author simply tags various intersections and adds a few over-the-top descriptions of the snow or rain or wind or whatever.

After listening to them with all different types of music and also playing them to friends and family the response was rather negative. These speakershave a really boomy bass, at some points it was hard to distinguish other sounds over it. I tried turning it up and at points the vocal became disorted and shrill, it also sound very flat and 2 dimensional.When played at low, easy listening levels the musical details are lost by the silk dome tweeter and its overly tame driver.I dont use these any more as i have bought myself some Bose but i would not recommend them to anyone except those on a very tight budget who are not so fussy about sound quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Musicality and Soundstage for Little Money","review":"I was a bit worried when I ordered the Wharfedale Diamond 8.2's based solely on written recommendations from here and from the web. Any concerns I had disappeared the first moment I heard them. They give clean musical sound with a transparency and realistic soundstage I didn't think possible from such an inexpensive speaker. The sound just 'pops' on these babies and you'll hear things that never made it to your ears before. I'm running them with ancient Carver equipment (TFM-25 amp, CT-17 Sonic Holography Preamp tuner) that has never sounded sweeter. The sound is clean and strong throughout the music range.

The cds played through my Rega Apollo Cd player sound pretty good... Although I have to say there is much distortion in the first 3 cds.

Mine is that it's not clear that anything that's come since them in the way of hard, grunge rock has been any sort of improvement over what these guys did. They were the original, and still the best. The combination of Plant and Page is the all-time best in testosterone driven blues and rock.Treat yourself and get this set - it's worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Led Zeppelin, the best band that ever played","review":"I'm 17 years old, and a huge fan of Zeppelin, I bought my first Zeppelin album when I was 10, and it was the 4th album.

I say it was a labor of love, and that love shows. Hubby does admit that they sound even more awesome than before. So you already own the CD's individually? Sell them to a friend or used record store, take that money and put it towards this set. And if you were planning on buying them individually, this is actually just as good a deal, maybe better since you get the B-sides and Cameron Crowe's book (which my husband couldn't stop reading). And I hate to say this, but Zep IS better than the Beatles - each LZ album is a classic while the Beatles did put out a few less-than-great recordings...as far as I'm concerned, Jimmy and the rest of Zep deserve every penny in royalties they make for the sheer pleasure derived from their music! This set is ESSENTIAL!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothing short of staggering","review":"Jimmy Page...what more need one say? A powerful reminder of the butt-kicking impact and influence the mighty Led Zeppelin had on rock in general.

It has been said in the past that \\"Clapton is God\\", another artist I have seen many times; in truth and fact that title belongs to Jimmy Page. Buy this full boxed set--you will not be sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Praise God","review":"First of all I truly thank God for Led Zeppelin because they have brought many a great evening of listening enjoyment. Second of all I really must admit that I would have honestly rather purchased all of these cds seperatley. It is an attractive set but it is rather annoying to have the cds slip into the artwork like they do. I don't believe anyone can compain about the selection of cds themselves at all. Not only do you get every studio album but you also receive several rare bonus tracks that did not come on their regular issue cds. In all seriousness though, if I had to do it all over again I would have purchased them all seperatly although it would have cost approximatly double the money to go that route. All the nice artwork and pics may sway you to go for this box set though.

I bought this and was blown away. 117 songs from Led is unbelivable. It was a lot of money but it was worth it. I listened to this thing and it had fantastic songs. I absolutely have no complaints about this, not even one. If you are a true Zeppelin fan then you must buy this. The 2 box sets that were offered were more money ocmbined and just more trouble. I like how you can get all this in just one buy. This band introduced hard rock. Even some of the young people today are getting into Led Zeppelin. Zeppelin has never left popularity and probaly never will. This collection also has good artwork in it of Led Zeppelin and some of his old cds. In my opinion, if there was never Led Zeppelin than classic rock would just not be the same. I encourage you to buy this collection and I am sure that you will not be dissapointed. Led Zeppelin is my favorite band of all time. Keep on listening to classic rock and God bless you."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Complete Studio Recordings [BOX SET] Led Zeppelin","review":"If you are a \\"DIE HARD\\" Led Zeppelin Fan, you must own this box set.

In the end, I bought it and I'm glad I did. I don't find the remix to be guitar-centric as some have said. I don't find the packaging to be a problem. My CDs are a bit hard to get out of the sleeves, but they certainly don't fall out as some have said. Conversely, I agree with all the good things people said so I won't repeat them.One plus over the original individual CDs is that, in addition to the original albums' play lists (those which were on the original album covers), there is an additional play list for each album that is easy to read and contains authors, play time, date, and location where each song was recorded. Another plus is the booklet that contains the history of the band with many photos."},{"rating":"2","title":"Possibly the best band ever.","review":"Led Zeppelin, to me, symobilze what rock and roll is. It can be anything. Led Zeppelin, to me, symoblize what a rock ban should sound like. Brilliant rythym section, excellent riffs, and a great singer. Personally, every member is important. Robert Plant is the god of singing, from low to screeching high. Jimmy Page is the riff master, who has made some of the best riffs ever made. John Paul Jones is the brilliant bassist, the observer, who watches everything with careful prescion. And John Bonham, who revolutionized the way drums should sound. Every album they made is a classic, and I am a proud owner of every album. I think that this band is probably the greatest band of all time. I just had to say that.

They are just not worth my time."},{"rating":"2","title":"AnEntertaining Read","review":"This was my first Jake Lassiter book and I found him to be an engaging character. I especially liked his irreverent approach to his job, as well as life in general. Secondary characters were equally engaging, although Granny Lassiter was a bit much. Most of the plot elements rang true, with the exception of some of the scenes with the dead body. Not being a lawyer, I can't say how true the courtroom scenes were, but I do know criminal law is showmanship, and that is something Lassiter does well.By far, the best part of a Paul Levine book is his wry sense of humor and wonderful twist of wordage. I found myself wanting to highlight every other wisecrack or sardonic comment that came from Lassiter or Granny, or any of the other great characters in the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strong characters.","review":"I always enjoy a mystery that has the same character carried forward from previous novels.

New to me and I have been downloading his books to my KF since I have seen them being offered for FREE. After reading a couple of them now, I am looking forward to getting the rest in this series and his writing has intrigued me enough that I want to read his Solomon & Lord Series also. I love Lassiter as a character. This is really a great read and reminds me of Harlan Coben, another great author! This first book is a great intro to the series and character. Lassiter is a former pro football player come lawyer who has more care and compassion than your average lawyer. He gets in deeper than has to for the purpose of truth and honor. I also love his supporting character Charlie Riggs and hope he follows with Jake through the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Page Turner","review":"I picked this up as a recommendation through my Kindle Facebook newsfeed. I like trying different authors that are similar to other authors I find enjoyable (Michael Connelly, John Sandford, Steve Berry, etc). For me, this one was just as much of a page turner as any one of those author's books. I enjoyed it very much - it was well written and certainly well thought out. I have already picked up another one of his books off of Amazon for my Kindle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly, not recommended","review":"I say \\"sadly\\" because the author shows some flashes of greatness, with features of levity similar to Elmore Leonard and detail similar to Michael Connelly.However, for a non-fantasy book to be good it has to be at least somewhat believable and this one is so ridiculous at times on legal grounds, medical grounds, and martial arts grounds, not to mention just common sense, that it is more pitiful than even laughable.I find it inexplicable that the author does enough research to know what a rongeur is but not an aneurysm, and with many similar examples throughout the book.It really is a shame that the author didn't refine this into something much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ludicrous.","review":"I gave this book a second star ONLY because I wanted to find out what happened enough to read to its end. And for Tyrone Hambone Washington.Otherwise, it was unbelievable, no matter what \\"Lady Trial Lawyer\\" claims. No prosecutor would go to trial based on merely the word of a woman who could have planted the alleged murder weapon and who had already sued the alleged murderer for malpractice. If he or she did, no competent lawyer would fail to ask when and where the accuser met the accused, i.e., when she was stripping and giving lap dances in a strip bar. Nor do judges wait until the middle of a trial to rule on whether certain evidence is admissable.It's also unbelievable that a person who hears the gruesome and painful details of a loved one's death from a \\"friend\\" would continue to consider that person a friend.Maybe that's just me. But the rest of it simply doesn't hold up. Not recommended for the well-informed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly formatted and over the top","review":"I recently tried this book because of the reviews. I tried to give it every chance despite the over the top metaphors and the broad approach the author takes toward courtroom drama. Maybe I would have even gotten to some point where the book would have been interesting except that the page formatting suddenly changed from 'left', which is normal for reading a book to 'center', where all the paragraphs are centered. Made for difficult reading. I looked ahead for a few chapters and realized it wasn't just a few paragraphs but as far as I could see, the whole book was center formatted. This seems unforgivable with a digital copy. The author or publisher need replace this file with a re-formatted version before selling another e-copy of this book. Even at $4.99 I'd like to have my money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"dumb writing","review":"I thought the writing was sophmoric and entirely without suspense.

It is BORING at best. It rambles at times. The plot is all over the place. Obviously he has a lot of devoted fans, as anyone with even a two digit IQ would describe this terrible at best."},{"rating":"2","title":"John does it again but even better!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"John's first novel really moved me with its intimate detail and personal family feel. But this new novel had my head spinning and my tummy doing flip flops. There was so much action and adventure that my head was whirling around, but the warmth and strength and human-ness (if that's even a word) of the characters made me feel part of a great spiritual journey. The story seemed so real to life in the crazy and frightening world we live in but the John's new book shows that tenderness, faith, hope and, like Jesus said, most of all LOVE, will conquer all evil and darkness ... thanks for making me believe in enduring and death defying love John!!!!! Your words are wonderful!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Please stick to non-fiction, John","review":"Two of us read this book and we were both disappointed. Characters are depressing and annoying. The storyline is predictable. We both loved John's two last books but fiction is not his forte. I would not recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disturbing book coming from a psychic","review":"I've read most or all of John Edward's previous books and found them comforting to read, if a bit predictable. His message is usually clear, and the same over and over. This one was disturbing - it's a disturbing scenario, and coming from a psychic, I was left wonder what-all he is intending to say and suggest by it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Im undecided but hey its John.","review":"I love work By John Edward but you can tell his work from this one..

My fav John Book is \\"After-life\\" ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"As much as I hate to say this, because I love John Edward, this book was terrible from a literary standpoint. It had no character development, no plot that held up. The dialogue was really bad. I didn't really care what happened to any of the characters. It probably would make an acceptable movie of the week, but that's about it. To be fair, I haven't read any of his earlier books, but maybe he should just stick to what he does on his tv show. And if the book was mainly written by Natasha Stoyoff, he should dump her. I really try to go by the saying, \\"don't say anything if you can't say anything nice\\", but I was really disapointed by this book. Even though, gotta love John Edward!"},{"rating":"2","title":"OUTSTANDING","review":"Final Beginnings is an amazing story! I didn't want to put it down, page by page you get drawn into the characters lives and are eager to understand them. JOHN EDWARD has created a story that touches upon his work and even though it is a fictional piece it sends the message home that everything happens for a reason. I can't wait to read what is next from Mr. Edward and Natasha Stoynoff - they are a great team! I highly recommend this to any reader whether just for entertainment purposes or to touch their heart!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting and Informative","review":"This novel transcends the typical mystery. It informs and entertains. The author's many years of diverse law enforcement experience is evident. As you read the book you learn many fundamental investigative techniques at the same time as being absorbed in the action. The teaching and entertaining is woven together in a subtle way. You never feel like you are being taught directly, however you walk away with an understanding of the psychological and practical aspects of detective work.The author's love of nature is also evident. It is apparent Mr. D'Augustine has a love for the outdoors and he is able to convey this through his description of the natural setting and its inhabitants.The pace of the book moves quickly. The intensity never wanes and your curiosity and interest spurs you to keep reading. An excellent read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"Smith and Wesson 10X Style Safety Glasses with Clear Lens are the best and relatively cheap safety glasses on the market, look no further... buy it now while it still lasts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very powerful","review":"The battery life is about what you expect and mechanically the machine works well. The problem with this machine is the power. It really doesn't have enough power to adequatly till the ground unless the ground is pretty mushy in the first place.For two years I've tried to use this tiller and after a 1/2 hour or less I end up pushing it aside and just using my hand tiller or my shovel.I would strongly recomend anyone thinking of buying a tiller to spend a little more money and get something that will work more effectively."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total junk","review":"This thing is a total POS, Unless you beds are topspil straight from the bag dont waste your money.

Tried using both before and after a rain - the cultivator did nothing. I tried making sure weeds were cleared first and all that happened was that the tines(sp?) just spun. Live and learn. Guess I will try an electric Mantis tiller or something like that. Learned (once again) that you get what you pay for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Black & Decker 18-Volt Cordless Garden Cultivator #GC818","review":"The only way I found this device works well is in previously cultivated or at least dug up moist soil, and, under such conditions, it worked admirably---loosening the soil to the entire dept of the tines; but not in a timely manner. Plus it didn't make a dent in packed, dry soil nor did it remove the weeds. As to its weeding capabilities after a lengthy time period it did destroy small weeds, those not more than 1 1/2\\" tall. Larger weeds got tangled in the tines. I do not recommend this cultivator over the standard rotary ones because I still had to loosen the earth, wet it down if dry, then use this tool to break the soil into smaller pieces suitable for planting seeds--removing taller, sturdy weeds all the while by hand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good experience","review":"The delivery was quick despite supersaver shipping.

It's really quite useless, and a fully charged battery lasts less than an hour. I have a Black and Decker weed trimmer, which is a similar design, and it works great. Takes the same battery, and the batteries last a long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good toy for your kids","review":"I bought this cultivator based on reviews I read here. After using it twice I am returning it. For any serious gardener this thing is almost useless. The battery life is less than 1/2 hour, so I couldn't even cultivate around one 30 foot row of tomato plants without charging it twice, which takes at least 3 hours each time to charge. To use it effectively, I had to push it into the ground, back up 2 inches, push it in again, and so on. So effectively one is cultivating a 2\\" by 6\\" section with each push, which is slow going, let me tell you. I will be buying a gas-powered cultivator to do some real gardening in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"A simple hoe is much easier to use","review":"Bought this at Lowes after reading the reviews here.

The motor started grinding and the gears stopped moving."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible","review":"Bought this at Lowes and am so happy that it has a 30 day money back guarantee, because it's going back.

I'm still thinking about another gasoline powered small rorotiller."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a bad tool","review":"I just used this for the first time today. I wasn't to certain it would work all that well but I just wanted something to help dig up a small patch for a little veggie garder. I have to say considering I was using it to dig up some pretty thick crabgrass and really hard ground in an un-tilled area it did a pretty good job. It took me two full charges to get an area approximately 4x9 or so, but saved me a whole lot of back breaking digging. I know it's really not meant for initial tilling of ground but if you just have a small patch or are using it for maintainance in your garden it's pretty handy. The only thing I think would have made it a lot better would be if the digging teeth rotated all the way to chop (similar to a mixer) and they should have made an option to attach a cord so that you could use it plugged in also."},{"rating":"2","title":"Black & Decker Cordless Cultivator","review":"This product worked as touted and is suprisingly powerful. I just finished cultivating a flower bed about 5 by 10 feet and it did an excellent job. You have to occasionally clean the tines as they will clog if the ground is damp.

I have a roto tiller and bought this cordless cultivator to ferret out weeds in my garden.The battery takes a long time to charge initially and I would advise purchasing an additional battery if you want to have more time to accomplish your task. The instructions are specific to the battery charging timing - the initial charge takes over nine hours and slightly less for subsequent charges. Overall it is very sturdy and easy to put together, although I needed to use a pair of pliers to pull the devices through that hold the tines in place.It's quite powerful and would recommend it for specific use, as I did, or if you have a small area to cultivate."},{"rating":"1","title":"over rated product","review":"This product will not work on a garden 2 days after rain as it does not have the power to turn dry dirt. I suppose if you used it every day to keep the dirt soft or used a larger (motor driven) tiller before using this one, it would be o.k., although a huge waist of time.

The soil had not been turned in several years and was somewhat compacted and full of roots. The thought of turning the soil by hand brought visions of an afternoon of hard labor and an evening of sore muscles. The Black & Decker unit made the job a snap. It churned the dirt to a depth of about 4 inches. The unit worked like a charm and let me do the entire job in about an hour -- about the length of time a full charge of its battery lasts. The motor appears to be strong and the blades are made of thick steel. For my purposes the cultivator was perfect. I think the unit might not work so well with dirt that is highly compacted, consists mostly of clay, or is full of large rocks. I am happy with the purchase and would not hesitate to do it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"Although I will still use my rototiller to dig it up, this is wonderful for keeping the weeds gone.

I live in Cincinnati where the earth is half clay, half dirt. I followed the directions and waited until the ground was plenty dry (a week after the last rain) and it was almost impossible to use. I'm seriously thinking of taking it back because I made more progress with a hoe in a half hour than I did with this cultivator in an hour which really disappoints me because I was eyeballing this for the longest time."},{"rating":"1","title":"did not like it","review":"it did not work for my yard. there is so much of noise while operating this cultivator. i tried contacting the vendor and they in turn directly told me to contact the manufacturer. if your soil is hard or clay, pls. do not buy this unit. i saw so many review and bought this one. also the battery dies out so fast. i should have got the corded unit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Tiller for small people and spaces.","review":"I love this tiller for small spaces.

It took about 1 hour of time to complete the job, (about 40 minutes of running time) and the battery still had life left in it.

I was able to work for about 20-30 minutes on a 25'x6' section of garden with one battery. As long the soil wasn't too hard, it did a nice job at dressing it up and breaking up small clods of soil. As another reviewer said, if the soil is impacted, this doesn't do much at all. It would be nice if the teeth on it could grab and dig a little better. It does have decent power/torque, and I think it would tear up the impacted soil if it could grab it. I debated returning it, but I am glad I didn't. It has proven useful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Garden Cultivator Handy Tool","review":"I bought this cultivator for my 79 year old father so he wouldn't have to kneel to weed his flower garden. It is very easy to use and does a good job, even with loosening grass that has crept into the garden.

It's very sturdy and does not bog down with thicker batter. Mixes throughly and the splash guard is somewhat awkward, but works.However, I wish this either tilted back or had a way for you to spin as much of the batter off the beater as possible. Disconnecting the beater and removing it while the bowl is still in place leaves more batter than I like on the beater and trying to remove the bowl with the beater still attached is even worse. I spend too much time scraping batter off the beater.

It's easy to use, easy to clean, and the attachments are wonderful! I make almost everything from scratch now because it's so much simpler. Not having to hold on to a hand mixer in one hand while trying to slowly add dry ingredients in the other is so nice.

However, I had the same model mixer as this one for 16 years and it worked very well. For the first 7 years the mixer was in my bakery and was used 5-6 days a week for 3 to 6 hours a day. If this new mixer only performs half as good as my old one, which I do expect, it is well worth the price. I recommend this mixer as it is built well and performs as well as a pro model."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to expectation","review":"I returned the item. It wasn't what I had expected. This is the industrial model. The head doesn't tilt backward, its heavy & a lot taller than a standard house mixer. I didn't like the fact that the bowl raised to meet the beater. I found it very hard to remove the bowl as well as the beater itself. The bowl capacity is no larger than that of the Artisan (which I replaced this item with)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Mixer, Poor Vendor","review":"I have a Kitchen Aid Mixer of my own and when my sister-in-law was getting married. I wanted to purchase one for her as well. We found a great deal on Amazon, but the package came damaged. The mixer was not transported in a separate box, but in the factory box it came in. There were postal labels slapped all over the box and a hole on one side. I was very upset since I was planning on giving the mixer as a gift. Luckily, the mixer was not damaged. We still gave her the mixer as a gift with the caveat of the mixer was fine even though the box was a mess. That's way I gave the product 4 stars and I gave the vendor 2 out of 5 stars.One thing to note even though the mixer description says black, it's not a glossy black but more of a matte black, which really looks more like a charcoal grey. The stand also uses a lever to lift the mixing bowl up and down. This is different than mine where the top of the mixer retracts up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Messy, messy, messy!!!!","review":"The title of this review says it all. This stuff is so messy- you better treat it just like regular sand and have your kids play with it outside.It will get everywhere, and if you can sweep most of it up and return it to the sandbox, it's not bad. But after doing this 50 times a day, you get tired of the stuff. And don't even try to vaccuum it- it will clog your vaccuum cleaner big time. It sticks to the floor, your socks, your clothes, anything it comes in contact with. you can brush it off, but then it's on the floor.it might be fun, but I think we're going back to play doh. At least it dries out where you can clean it up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of Fun","review":"I am an educator and I absolutely love watching my students play with their moon sand. The children have so much fun! My rule for the moon sand is that they have to keep the sand in the blow-up container; if they don't they have to leave the center. Even my non-verbal three year olds can follow the rule, and enjoy playing in the moon sand. So, for those of you that think moon sand is too messy-----set some rules! I bought moon sand for my son for Christmas because he always wanted to play in it after school. The same rule applies at home and he does great too. I have no moon sand to get out of the carpet or floor. The moon sand is smooth, and not gritty and messy like real sand. It wipes off your hands really easy.ENJOY your moon sand."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is so much fun!","review":"What is the problem here? It's messy? We do have kids right?

He takes his little star wars guys and playing with them with the sand. It's fun!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great creative play","review":"My twin daughters (age 5) received this, and two other Moonsand sets, as Christmas gifts. They opened them ASAP and began to let their imaginations run wild. My older two boys (ages 8 and 10) even joined in on the fun.They sit on the kitchen floor to play. Does it make a mess? On occassion but they scoop it right back up. This is sand after all and like any craft/creative product, I do expect some sort of mess. Cleanup is a breeze though.My only complaint is the storage of the colored sand. The kids have been careful to keep it as separate as possible but it would be nice to be able to store it all in the inflatable case!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Moon Sand Nightmare!","review":"Imagine trillions of sand-sized particles of Post-it Notes glue. Now imagine giving a bucket of it to your four-year-old. My son played with it, very carefully, for ten minutes and then quoted the commercial. . .without the mess? He wanted to wash up and didn't even object when I told him it was going into the garbage. He begged for it for weeks and hated it within ten minutes!Avoid it at all costs! It sticks to everything like a gritty film."},{"rating":"1","title":"MISLEADING!!","review":"Clean? Neat? Easy? These are the words used to promote this product. But there's nothing clean and neat about it! No way around it...it's sand...and it gets EVERYWHERE! Even if you have the inflatable sandbox. It sticks to their hands, their clothes and their hair. And if you drop it on the floor, it will not vacuum up w/the dustbuster! It is fun (as sand is always fun for kids), but it is NOT clean, NOT neat and NOT easy.They make it seem that it is magic play-doh like sand...that once it's squished a bit, it gets moldable and clay-like. Don't be fooled...it just stays...sand-like. And unlike playdoh, if you mix the colors - there's NO going back!Unless u're willing to take it OUTSIDE...I wouldn't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kind of neat but very, very messy","review":"Moon Sand works as advertised (molds kind of like wet sand, make sand objects inside the house without going to the beach). However, the fun is limited in that you don't really create anything (for example, molding clay into an animal). All you do is fill something with it and pop out the mold. Plus, most of the fun of building sand castles is wrecking them afterwards. You don't want to that with this product. It is extremely hard to clean up."},{"rating":"1","title":"messy - too sticky","review":"Like many other reviewers, we also found the moonsand to be messy. Another issue we had was that you try to get the moonsand into the pieces in order to create your castle, but then the sand doesn't want to leave! You have to tap it really hard to force it out, or not compact the sand hard at all, in which case it just crumbles when it comes out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Moon Sand not better then playdough!","review":"I got this Moon Sand for my kids for Christmas and I gave it to them as an early Christmas gift. Boy was that a mistake! It was more of an heasdach then playdough has ever been. The sand was EVERYWHERE! and yes you may be able to vacume it up but we lost 1/4 of the sand in the first play. Playdough you make sure there in the kitchen so when it falls it's no big deal, you pick up the big peices droped add them back to the mix, moon sand goes everywhere and aside from the fact that it doesn't come with very much sand to begin with so of course you need to buy more which works well for the manufacture because they have a continuing customer. Once this is done I will be happy to show it the garbage and save me another headach."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not exactly what it says it is","review":"I purchased this for each of my 3 children ages 5, 8 & 10. I do not recommend it for any child over 8 years of age. The 10 year was so bored with it he poured all of the mixture in his youngest sibling's tray. They tried to build with it but ended up just squishing it. It seems fun to run your hands through and try to pack it, but it won't pack enough to build a castle like what is shown on the packaging. The mixture gets stuck inside the molds and when you try to get it out to make a castle it crumbles. The 5 year old wants to take the molds and blow up tray to the beach and play with them in the real sand. Come to think of it, real sand and water would work a lot better than this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't gift this","review":"Beware that if you give this as a gift it may garner resentment.

Despite the high price, I gave in thinking it would be similar to Play-doh which they play with for hours at a time. Instead they were bored within 10 minutes, and I had hours worth of clean-up! It is just sandy enough to get everywhere, yet sticky enough to want to stay in every little crack and crevice. It was impossible to remove it from any of the molds that it came with, unless it was dug out. Save yourself the time, money and frustration and avoid Moon Sand!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Big disappointment","review":"My child was desperate for this toy for Christmas. After one use, we packed it up and returned it! The sand wouldn't come out of the molds, you couldn't shape it, it was not fun at all. It was a big diappointment. Stick with Play-doh would be my advice."},{"rating":"1","title":"URGENT! STAY AWAY!","review":"This is the messiest children's product I have ever encountered. It ruins any fabric (including rugs and carpet) that it comes into contact with. If you intend to use this in your house, you would be much better off with a bag of playsand. At least real sand can be vacuumed and swept. This stuff sticks to everything and is nearly impossible to get up off of the floor. Yes... the kids do enjoy playing with this, but they are equally as happy with [..] worth of Play-doh."},{"rating":"1","title":"short lived messy fun","review":"After reading many reviews on this item, I caved due to my curiosity, plus I am an easy marketing target. I thought about how cool it would be for my two little ones (2 & 5) to play with during the winter since they love the sandbox - WRONG! It holds their attention for only 5-10 min., then they don't like the feel of it stuck on their hands, along with the rest of them, as it gets EVERYWHERE (as I know some reviews warned me...). I think we've had to vacuum up almost 1/4 of it in just 2 times playing with it. We bought 2 extra cartons of sand and only put 1 extra in at first. The 2nd one will NOT be going it, as this will be disappearing once the sand has dwindled to useless amounts. NOT worth the money...I'd rather go cheap and buy playdoh or splurge and get more magnatiles. THOSE are worth their weight in gold - NOT this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE STUFF!","review":"We were given this as a gift for Christmas and I'm sorry but its not something I would ever give to a friend. Its EXTREMELY messy and not appropriate for 3 year olds (especially active hyper boys like I have). The sand gets everywhere. At least with playdough you could use it to pick up the rest of its stray parts by sticking it together. Moon sand sticks to nothing with means its goes EVERYWHERE. Most of it is going to end up in the vacuum after the first use. Also, the colors get all mixed together VERY easily because you can't stick them together. Its impossible to make what they show in the picture without being at least 10 years old and VERY patient! This is definitely at toy that requires DIRECT adult supervision if you don't want to be feeling \\"the sand between your toes\\" for days to come!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Messy, expensive - just stick with playdough","review":"My 6 yr old son saw the commercials and has been wanting this for months. Finally got it for Christmas and what a disappointment! The sand is fun to play with but there isn't enough of it and it makes a huge mess everywhere. No big deal with cheap, inexpensive playdough but with this, I was on my hands and knees trying to scrape up every last bit to save. I like that you can leave it out w/o it drying but what's the use? Just send them to the backyard sandbox. For inside, stick with playdough. It's wayyyyyy cheaper and honestly, more fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply too messy, but the kids loved it","review":"As a parent, unless you like to be constantly using your mini-vacuum to clean up the mess this makes, you will not buy this again. This was bought for my young daughter. She loved to play with it, but kept losing sand every time to the vacuum cleaner when we had to clean up the mess. Sure we tried tossing what we could back in, but this toy was simply too frustrating to keep having to clean up after over and over again (especially five minutes after we had just cleaned it up). Playdoh isn't as messy as this. We limited our daughter to playing with it in the kitchen where our vinyl floor is. I would never allow the kids to play with this nor Playdoh on the carpet, as both are too messy. However, this one takes the cake as far as mess is concerned. Perhaps they should sell this with a mini-cordless vacuum instead of the mat - more ended up in that than in the play mat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Fun for All Ages!","review":"I read the reviews and was torn about getting this for my 4 year old daughter... but she really wanted it so we did. We all really love it! Yes, it is messy like real sand - best for outdoor use - but it sticks together well, just like real damp sand, and the carrying case works to keep the sand and toys together. I highly recommend this [outdoor] toy!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"FROM YOUNGER TO OLDER THEY ENJOY","review":"ALL MY GRANDKIDS JUST LOVE THIS.

This product is beyond messy. Just like beach sand it gets EVERYWHERE but unlike beach sand it never dries out so you can't just sweep it or vacuum it up. We banished it to the backporch and ACK! even worse.The price of this product is very high when you consider that you will have to buy refills. The stuff may not dry out but because it goes everywhere after a few play sessions you have to buy refills. That gets VERY expensive. Also, the playmat we received with our kit that cost 30 dollars wasn't big enough for two kids to play with and believe me you do not want to use this without the mat.Bottom line - stick to playdough. There is a reason why it's a classic!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not practical at all","review":"My daughter got this for her birthday and I am giving it 2 stars, because the concept of it is OK, but the product itself is too much of a hassle. There isn't enough sand and what little there is, ends up in the vaccum cleaner, because of the mess it makes. And the \\"sand\\" itself is useless with the molds that accompany it, since it sticks on the inside and doesn't come out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Messy, messy, messy","review":"I do not usually fault a toy for messiness. As an example, I love playdoh. However, this toy creates a huge mess. Do not expect this product to become the indoor replacement for your outdoor sandbox. The sand molds break apart easily as children play with them, scattering the sand everywhere. My living room was a mess! My daughter prefers playdoh because you can actually play with the things you've molded."},{"rating":"1","title":"Moon Sand Concerns","review":"I do believe Moon Sand lives up to it's claims of being an indoor sand alternative, but I also think it is my five year's first experience of being dissapointed by what he thought he was going to get as based on the TV ads. The amount of sand is deceiving, the molds are small and flimsy. My son has enjoyed playing with it a few times, but I've noticed after I've played with it to get the sand soft and moldable that my face becomes itchy. Reading the documentation about getting it into your eyes and the warning to wash your hands after playing with it gives me a few concerns. I wouldn't want a kid under five to play with it. I'm always warning my son not to touch his face."},{"rating":"1","title":"Messy","review":"This is a neat idea and the kids loved playing with it, but it is very MESSY. It doesn't stay in the inflatable container well with 3 boys playing. Also as others have mentioned you don't get nearly enough sand in the original set to make the castle. We couldn't keep the sand separated into colors (with a 7, 6, and 3 yo) so now we have a lot of mixed colors. It doesn't stay nice and separated as they lead you to believe.We will definately be playing with this outside from now on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great gift idea","review":"We love the moon sand castle kit...definitely one of our favorite birthday toys this year! I have a 6 and 3 year old and they both love it.It really isn't that messy and my kids keep most of it inside the blow up base. It's not grainy like real sand and makes clean up easy. The blow up base is wonderful, when the kids are finished playing, we just fold it up(sand inside) and put it away until next time.It doesn't come with enough sand, but you can buy more. The sand does tend to get stuck in the molds, but so far that is my only complaint.I would definitely recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product!","review":"I purchased this item for my 5 year old daughter. She absolutely loves this product. I even found it hard to keep my hands out of it. It is a bit messy...but for the fun you have, well worth it. It cleans up easily and the mat helps to contain most of it. The only thing that I would say could make it better would be to have the option to just purchase the white sand which comes with it. I purchased all of the colors as well, which does come with one additional container of the white, but would have preferred to have all white sand. I would recommend this to anyone who has a kid that you have to drag away from the beach!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Moon sand","review":"What a mess this makes and is overly priced. Once the colors are mixed kids loose interest in it. Would not recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed - what a mess!","review":"I only allowed my children to play with this outside, as it gets EVERYWHERE inside, it is difficult for young children to keep it within the play set. There isn't a whole lot of sand in the pack so children easily become annoyed when they can only build a few things and then they have to destroy them. It also manages to attract dirt, soil etc outside so after only playing with this a few times I had to throw the whole thing away. Complete waste of money. Get some real sand..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Concept but falls short there.","review":"I thought this would be the best gift for a little girl that LOVES the Beach. However this is not something that I love. It comes with very little sand and does not seem to puff up like it says it should once you open a package of it. The colors that you can purchase only mix together and become a colorful blob (yes basic common sense would know this). In addition it is very difficult to get the sand out of the molds once you mold it (impossible for a 4 year old). Probably due to the fact that you need to pack the sand in so hard to make it mold that it is very difficult to get out even after washing the molds in warm soapy water as suggested in the directions. Like I said in the tital great concept but falls short of being good. Stick with real sand."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like clean up, you'll love moon sand","review":"I got this for my 6 year old. While it is fun to mold and play with, it is HORRIBLE to clean up. We put down a mat to keep it off the table and a tray to try and keep it in one place. Not 3 minutes into play it was all over and stuck in every nook and cranny (including on the dog). It sticks to clothes and ends up ground into the couch, carpet, you name it- it's stuck there. It also scratched up the wooden table as it found its way under the mat. It has been banned to outdoor play. Where it gets all over still, but at least my son can run his trucks through it and not have to worry about ruining things."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you kidding?","review":"As a mother of 3 kids, I tend to rate a toy based on the following criteria: Is the hassle of it worth the enjoyment? Moon Sand is a definite NO. It's really, really messy. It does not stay in the blow up tray, and gets on your floor. Because it's coated to stick together, when it gets tracked over carpets you need to sweep it up with a brush because my central vac system couldn't do it. All this mess just to hear my kids complain that it's not as cool as on TV, and that the castles won't come out of their molds in one piece."},{"rating":"1","title":"buyer beware","review":"It is a waste of money. It's messy and my children were bored with it almost immediately. It neither sticks together well enough to mold anything (like Playdoh does) nor crumbles like sand. The directions specifically mention that you should not add water, but yet the consistency is not pliant enough. The castle kit comes with very little Moonsand to play with in the first place. There's a reason Playdoh and sandboxes have stood the test of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Messy, Sticky, Yucky Product","review":"Do NOT buy this product if you don't want it absolutely all over your house.

It's going to take forever to clean it up.Not pleased with Moon Sand!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Neat Idea - Too messy to be worth it.","review":"The sand itself is a neat idea. Kind of like playing with damp sand. My kids loved it for a while but I think they were really more into the idea of playing with sand inside. Like others mentioned, it's hard to get the sand out of the molds, impossible for a 4 year old. For me, the time my kids spent playing with it wasn't worth the mess they made. I put paper down on the wood kitchen floor and let them play. After they were done and I trashed the paper I still had to vaccum the floor and change their clothes. Not worth it in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"The kids will love this!","review":"When we first listened to this cd, I would have given it a 1 star. I thought the narration was so cheesy and I was sorry I bought it. The kids liked it though and the second time I reluctantly put it on for them, I thought it wasn't too bad. Now I really like alot of the songs on this cd. They are catchy and well sung. They love the first song, which is an alphabet song, and they not only learn the letters but also different dinosuar names as well. I have found myself singing \\"Dem Bones\\" out loud at home. The narration is interesting for the kids, and educational as well. My only complaint is the woman who narrates has a fake Southern accent which is really corny because it is so obvious it is fake. Otherwise, this is a great cd for the kids and I'm liking it as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Provides details not readily found elsewhere","review":"Martin Clemens is deserving of our gratitude and respect.

It is his story, what he saw, what he thought, during the time from before the war started until the U.S. army had solid control of Guadalcanal.Where it is weak is that there is no context for the story. If you don't know about the Solomon's campaign, you will be totally lost. And there is no context for what he sees so again, you don't know how key some of the battles he was in were.I think this is a good book for people who have a strong knowledge of the Solomin's campaign.

The threads go all the way to the hilt.When you screw on the cap it does not seal properly to the o-ring and further presses and scrapes the o-ring on the sharp threads.

That book ranks side by side with its film version and is one of the greatest books ever written.This book was very well written and has a great surprise ending, but I found it to have too much satire. Take the scene where the Scarecrow and Jack are so interested in formalities they get an interpreter without realizing they speak the same language. Is it just me, or have the Scarecrow and Tin Woodsman become more clueless in this book after getting what they wanted? Also, the Woggle Bug character poked a lot of fun at snobbish people which I found funny, but I fear a seven year old might not understand the humor.As the second part in a long series, maybe it's alright.

I just looked this up on the internet and can't believe what I am reading! OK, Sentry. Nobody's cats like your new formulation! I am sure the change was all about money. Now I will go in search of something my cats will actually eat. Thanks for throwing away a good thing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply awful","review":"My cat won't even go near the stuff, probably because it smells like a mixture of soy sauce and pickle juice.. not to mention it's got the consistency of pine tar. It gets EVERYWHERE. She'll eventually lick it off her paw, but I can tell it's only because it's annoying her. To the people who said their cats love it, thanks for confirming that my cat is weird. Don't waste your money without some kind of trial, first. See if you can borrow some from a friend, or something. Don't dive in an purchase this stuff without knowing it will work."}]`),M={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:E},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:D,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},O={class:"card-container"},x=["disabled"],B={key:0},W={key:1};function N(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=y("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your SNAP 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",O,[(a(!0),i(w,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(a(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",W,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",B,"See more"))],8,x)):b("",!0)])}const H=d(M,[["render",N],["__scopeId","data-v-bf924c49"]]),G=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"people/9.md","filePath":"people/9.md"}'),L={name:"people/9.md"},R=Object.assign(L,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(H)]))}});export{G as __pageData,R as default};
