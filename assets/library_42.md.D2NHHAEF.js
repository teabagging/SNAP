Elminster has to be one of the genre's most annoying characters. It took me more than 1000 pages before I started to hate Drizzit, but only a few dozen for Elminster. In Greenwood's world the most powerful person on Faerun is always cracking bad jokes, winking at his companions, and observing how funny he is. The people around \\"El\\" are continually groaning and sighing. The novel ends up reading like an unfunny episode of Cheers (the sitcom): cloying atmosphere combined with the impossibility of character development.If you enjoy reading about world-changing events, check out some of the Cyric stories, like _Crucible_ by Troy Denning. Otherwise check out some good FR books by Elaine Cunningham and Paul Kemp."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb Series; into the World Of Elminister","review":"Greenwod pulls you into the world of Faerun.

However, of the 11 tracks on this album, 7 are upbeat. The slow songs sound no different than songs from his other CDs around that time, but the fast songs offer a change. Personally, I enjoy \\"Fire on the Tracks\\", \\"Primitive\\" and \\"One by One\\". Most of these songs are only available here, so if you were disappointed by \\"Heartlight\\" or \\"Best Years\\" because they were way too slow, this one's a little different."},{"rating":"2","title":"underrated","review":"Primitive is one of those albums ruined by record company interference.When Neil gave in the original Primitive,Sony didnt hear the middle of the road pop ballads that they think sells Neil Diamond albums.But those added ballads(Turn Around,Sleep With Me Tonight and You Make Me Feel Like Chritmas)completely feel out of place here.Skip the ballads,and you will hear a good (if dated) collection of funky songs about primitive love,space love,Brooklyn street gangs and fire on the tracks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost a great album","review":"This is one of those albums that sits on a fine line between great and terrible. Sadly, it falls on the terrible side. Almost every song on the album is an almost great song that comes up shallow on lyrics. The best examples are \\"One By One\\" this simple tune almost makes you feel good when you sing along. \\"Fire on the Tracks\\" lets you down due to a steady fall into Vegas. \\"Loves Own Song\\" takes on \\"Cherry Cherry\\" and is thrown for a loss. The albums one saving grace is the title tract \\"Primitive.\\" This could have been a nice single in the late 70's. Too bad the song was released in 1984. \\"Turn Around\\" is just another failed ballad that Diamond released as a single in that decade. It sounds just like the later \\"The Man You Need\\" (not a radio single) and \\"Turn Around\\" from Best Years of Our Lives. The Christmas song? Don't even go there.Neil gets an A for effort with Primitive but, it simply doesn't work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uneven","review":"Using a variety of producers and studio musicians, this 1984 effort probably represents the low point in the downward spiral Neil Diamond's artistic acreer took after the late 1970's.The problems begin right there with the cover! Again using a ten-year old picture (as on its even weaker predecessor \\"Heartlight\\") Neil Diamond at the time seemed to have no idea where to go with this album. Some tunes that are quite OK musically (like \\"One by One\\") suffer from incredibly poor lyrics and vise-versa. The use of different producers doesn't help in giving this effort any profile whatsoever. \\"Turn Around\\" could've been a great later-day Diamond power ballad but never catches on, \\"Fire on the Tracks\\" loses steam after the first chorus, and \\"Go for the Moon\\" or the awkward title track should've been erased from the tapes completely.I saw Neil Diamond on stage a few days after \\"Primitive\\" was originally released and was incredibly relieved to find that the man had not lost it completely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What You Want in a Black Light","review":"Disappointing all the way around.

The mix of high energy songs (\\"Walking for You,\\" \\"A lot of Movin',\\" \\"A Gift for Melody Anne\\") and soothing ballads & love songs (a tremendous version of \\"November Blue,\\" \\"Offering\\")is perfect. Furthermore, the audio mix also captures the essence of a standard TAB audience without overpowering the vocal tracks; a task that was undoubtedly difficult to accomplish.Overall, a great album for long-time Avett fans and Avett newbies alike. It stays in heavy rotation around our house."},{"rating":"1","title":"Small Sound for Heavy headphones","review":"The Koss TD-60 Headphones are heavy, and uncomfortable to wear, which detracts from the enjoyment of listening to music.

The show really held their attention and the students sincerely enjoyed watching it. I especially like the review test at the end.

The cast is absolutely magnificent and the singing is superb!! Jos�� Carreras is the definitive Prince Calaf and his delivery is dramatic, filled with a sublime emotion that reaches to the depths of one's soul. His version of Nessun dorma is powerful and passionate. The rest of the cast, from Eva Marton cast in the title role, to Katia Ricciarelli, who performs the role of Liu, transports us to another realm.I recently saw Turandot and truly enjoyed the performances. A new ending was featured at the finale of the opera, which was very intriguing and fresh, however, this version of the Puccini masterpiece will forever reign in my heart as the best!!Highly recommended with a five star rating plus!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bought it for my kids","review":"The music was lame and the video had different images flashing in front of you.

Carole King is not the most fluent and interesting interviewee. Erica Jong too has a certain boring quality which perhaps relates to the extreme seriousness with which she talks about herself. Jong also talks about her new book 'Fear of Fifty' explaining that she is not really afraid of being fifty. King also is involved in a riff about herself and her own work. We learn that King is interested in preserving the environment, and Jong at fifty- two has achieved 'peace'. It is difficult to know what to take seriously and what not with all of this. Rose and his guests seemed pleased about the whole thing but both these interviews had no flash, no pizzazz, no humor, no life. It would have been better had King simply sung 'You've Got a Friend'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good - by comparison","review":"I think my problem with the series is that I read the Graphic Novels first. The graphic novels are top notch with great art and a great story that has a lot of action and flows really well. The G.N.'s also manage a wide emotional range that is not diminished by the humor.The animation seems childish by comparison. It starts I guess in the middle of the graphic novels and doesn't even bother to follow the story line. It goes its own way with people from other dimensions and battle with dragons and such. The characters are 2 dimensional (pardon the pun) with no real emotional depth being created. Most of the events seem to be directed at a younger crowd (like kids).As I recall the music wasn't bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"one of the WORST animes i've seen!","review":"SAVE YUR MONEY!!! from the description i thought it sounded like a good story and anime to watch but geez what a waste of money. i have the whole series collection and i had to force myself to keep watching after the first episode in order to give it a fair chance. i kept hoping it would get better but it didnt! i watched 2 and a half episodes and shut it off. the anime isnt that good, the dialogue is horrible, the story is silly but in a dumb/stupid way not in a cute funny way. it comes off as very kiddish and NOt entertaining but i can't even pass it off to my little cousins to watch it because it depicts the female characters in such a how do u say derogatory manner? they show the high school girls wearing the skimpiest hoochiest clothes for no reason... oh what a dissapointment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Low quality...","review":"This is exactly the type of album that gives progressive rock a bad name; it's trite, over-bearing and dull. There's no doubt that these are skilled musicians, but the songwriting is painfully dreary and uninspired. On top of it all, the production is just awful, turning the band's already insipid music into a somber mass of sound that simply fails to move.It's a shame that bands like Cast or Iconoclasta have become Mexico's main exports in progressive rock, and I'd discourage anyone but a true fan of rare and relatively unknown prog from buying anything by this less than stellar band."},{"rating":"2","title":"I am what I promise","review":"Most people construe branding as merely a matter of naming and promoting, as though the brand name merely reminds you of the quality of the product or service so branded. Dr. Barlow and her colleagues have cleverly reminded us that branding is much more; that it is an active process that translates to living up to a promise. The brand is not about the product: it's about the promise. Barlow and Stewart explore the interrelatedness of the product or service and the promise; they then tie the various connections to the processes required to achieve and maintain the promise. If you promise reliability, you'd better be reliable: at all levels of the company, be it small or very large. The authors demonstrate how to identify these various levels and how to implement level-appropriate strategies.

Antony in particular is a character that will live for a long time in my memory. I sometimes find myself in situations where I would not mind having an Antony handy.The butterfly motif here would shame even Nabakov.All in all, I find myself not wanting to say too much to ruin this book for you.

The 3 boys who played on it weighed in at exactly 200 pounds cumulatively and the seams ripped apart anyway. This thing is great fun but I would strongly urge anyone who gets one to severely limit the weight on it at anyone time to much less than its stated maximum of 200 pounds.

Today we put it out again and found that it did not want to stay fully inflated which prevented the kids from climbing it.

Glad I didn't actually pay for it!Also, I did get someone on the helpline (after waiting almost 45 minutes on hold). I was told I could just use a needle and thread and sew any seams that appear to be coming apart, or I could use the repair kit that came with the slide.

We are very disappointed on the quality and durability of this product. I hope your new re-designed slide will be worth buying. Also, I would like to mention to the manufacturer, that the pool area, in which the children fall into, should be made a little more longer (3 or 4 ft.)because when my two kids come down the slide they sometimes would fall over which can be dangerous.

It's smaller, ALOT smaller. My two boys (6 & 7) went down it twice and said \\"forget it - it's for babies\\". My 3 year old wouldn't go down without holding our hand. The end \\"pool\\" is a joke.

By the end of the summer, the entire center part between the slides ripped into a gaping hole (about two and a half feet in length). The slide's material was paper thin.When I called the manufacturer, I received no satisfaction. Those customer service representatives are clearly trained to admit nothing and give no concessions. I would strongly recommend against buying this slide, unless you want to throw your money away. It is fun, but over $400 for just one season is not worth it.

Again we contacted the manufacturer. This time, however, we were told, too bad. Only one replacement per customer. I have been sewing the seams and patching them with liquid rubber to get it to work. Every time it is used, out comes the repair kit. After a winter in the garage, we go through the same thing. Now the blower failed.

I am over it.The problem I am having is that we love the curved design of the Mabels, but the quality of the product has declined so badly from 2006 until 2009, I am wondering what it is like in 2011???Having been an owner of two different Mabels, I can definitely confirm inflation is not the issue.

The old-fashioned, simple braces always worked well, but they don't seem to make them anymore, so I recently switched to this. I used it for a few months, but my wrist got worse and worse and I finally had to stop. It feels very comfortable, but it just didn't provide enough support. I recently switched to a new kind where you wrap the support around once, then wrap a second, narrower strap, on top of that. I was wary about it, but it seems to work really well--much stronger support.

So when I saw someone had was selling them at close out price of $3.00, I bought three. Regretfully, have broken two more in less than a season. The problem is the head is very thin aluminum and if you drop it when you finish using it, the head can break of where it screws onto the hose. Or if you try to screw the bubbler on by twisting its head, it comes right off. All in all, a very poor execution of product that can be of great use.And yes, the old cheap plastic bubbler just keeps working. Drops concrete, no problem. Twist the head to tighten, no problem.

I saw this film in the '60s in Berkeley, and I loved it then partly because it spoke to me of what I believed were the issues of the day--freedom (artistic and otherwise) and the power of the individual. I am now buying the video so that I can at long last have a joyous reunion with the unforgettable characters--the artist's dishevelled, indignant and loyal girlfriend; his equally dishevelled, adoring and unquestioning young admirer, and the artist himself, the outrageous Gully Jimson (Guinness). I still see his raffish little boat on the Thames, chugging along to the regal strains of Prokofiev, just as the often obnoxious and stubborn Jimson is dignified by the strength of his commitment to art and self. (This film was based on the novel by Joyce Cary)"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you love the novel, avoid the film","review":"Having been a reader of the novel The Horse's Mouth for the past fifty= years, I came to the file with high expectations of seeinga version of what I had been imagining over the years.

The film is a travesty of the story and I was unable to sit through the whole film.Two stars for the photography, none for the acting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Artists and Others","review":"I got hold of the DVD of this 50-year-old film to show at home movie night for my young artist friends who have never seen it. With Alec Guinness as grubby, brilliant, egocentric painter and con man Gulley Jimson, and with memorable scenes, a great score, and paintings you don't forget, it makes the point that extremism in the service of art is, in the end, forgiven by almost everybody. Fight for your vision, sacrifice for your vision--force your friends and family to sacrifice for your vision--you are not wrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a forgotten masterpiece","review":"I might speculate that this is the best Ronald Neame movie. Alec Guinness wrote the script from the novel and has a blast playing the dirty old painter, Gulley Jimson. The Prokofiev fits perfectly and the movie is a pleasure from start to finish. Despite the humor it also has a very strong note of emotional realism that the movie will occasionally strike just to remind us that these are real people. It's a movie about art and artists and so much more. There might have been more special features, but the interview with Neame is pretty good."},{"rating":"2","title":"hard to find gem","review":"This movie is different from others of the same time period starring Alec Guinness (Lavendar Hill Mob, Lady Killers, Kind Hearts and Coronets).

It was shown in a public channel in Puerto Rico. That was my first contact with Art in general.As I watched the movie I realized that I identified strongly with the artist character played by Alec Guiness. Eveything seemed so cool about him.I also loved the image of the sculptor wearing the long scarf and creating an abstract image as he worked inspired by a nude female model.My whole life was tranformed at the end of this movie. I was only ten years old but I was decided to be myself like the artists in the movie.

Instead, these were dozens of acts consisting of 10 seconds to a few minutes. Most of them were just quick strips to bra, pasties or breasts. Only a few of them seemed professional and entertaining. A few of them were depressing to look at. I even fast-forwarded through many because they were so bad.At best, it's a well-preserved piece of history. Also, it's an interesting glimpse into how women were oppressed to empowered (looking at their faces and acts) by participating in burlesque...or how burlesque could be interpreted as an artform (by those in it) to a self-shaming act of quick stripping (many looked embarrassed, while only a few looked to be enjoying and performing well). Enjoy? Not so much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible!!!","review":"I'll cut straight to the point - the course review is quite nearly unintelligable, especially the part about organic nomenclature. The editing is abysmal; numerous typos abound, and there are certain questions on the provided practice tests where the answers don't match up and the explanations are just wrong. I would bet my life on the fact that the following statement is false: \\"All matter is composed of small particles called molecules\\". We all know atoms, rather than molecules, fit this sentence better, but apparently, the book doesn't agree. The typo problem especially hurts when you're trying to make heads or tails of a question and the typo just throws everything off (i.e. 10.2 when 1x10^-2 is meant). All in all, if you absolutely need to practice and can't find anything else, use this as your last resort.

Individual lifes swirl with mystery and suspense as they weave amongst others. I recommend all of Blakes books to anyone who enjoys a great action novel with fantastic characters that are hard to forget and easy to empathise with.

I used it once and probably won't use it again unless for some reason I need to hold a dry hair style in place, which is not something I ever do.

The story starts off with Jason coming out of the ocean he was buried in and getting on a cruise ship where he slashes half the crew into oblivion. A few of the crew members escape on a canoe where they make it to Manhattan. Even though the kills are okay, the movie is so slow paced that the kills hardly break the spell of tedium that the movie has cast on you. I'll admit that the part where Jason knocked the guy's head off was pretty funny. The part where he got caught by the toxic waste in the sewer was pretty funny too. He sounded like a deer that just got hit by an oncoming car. lol. The acting is hohum as well as the the pace of the movie and for a horror film so bland its longer than it needs to be. This is not the worst of the Friday The 13th series but it's one of the worst. If you are looking for a godd Friday The 13th flick look elsewhere.

Now we should be thanking the Lord that directors have thrown in some humor in recent releases preceding this one, but there really isn't any here, which makes it all the more, let's say, stupid. Now I know a couple of people myself who would watch a movie with no plot just to see a couple of people diced like Mexican tomatoes, and that's really what this movie is all about. The anti-plot, we'll call it, is that Jason Voorhees, the incredibly ugly and incredibly stupid bad guy (or maybe we should say hero?) with a knack for not dying, is making his way to Manhattan to kill a couple peeps. Basically, the movie isn't worth the buck it costs to rent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Friday","review":"This film has an incoherent plot seemingly unrelated to any of the previous Fridays.

The last half hour of the film is spent in N.Y.C. but, you would never know it with all of the crack alleys, and sewer tunnels that are shown.The DVD is worthless. The movie sucks & there are no special features. Why buy it, let alone rent it?!?!The only redeeming value is an all to brief gag with Jason's mask and a couple thugs who try to mug him and the film also marks the big screen debut of Kelly Hu (she would go on to star in \\"The Scorpion King\\" and as the mutant villian Lady Deathstrike in \\"X2: X Men United\\").

My favorite Friday the 13th movies probably are 1,2,3,4,6,7, Jason Goes to Hell, and Freddy vs. Jason definetly. I hated 5 and 8 main reasons why is because in 5 Jason is not in it it's just some psycho guy being Jason and in 8 I thought 8 was pretty slow and the worst Friday the 13th movie.

The plot was completely horrible (if there even was one.) With the title \\"Jason in MANHATTAN\\", you would think some of the movie would be in NY. Only about 20 minutes is in NY, the rest is on a boat. The only good things about the movie was the fact of seeing future stars like Kelly Hu(The Scorpion King),and Ken Kirzinger who is the stunt coordinater of the film and was thrown through a mirror or window by Jason.

Yes, it has horrible acting, cheesy special effects and makes no sense. But this is easily the funniest movie in the entire series, and must be viewed with that in mind. Part VIII cannot be watched seriously, for then it truly is a pain. C'mon, the black kid boxing Jason on the rooftop? The school slut seducing the principal for passing grades? The metal chick getting her hot-pink flying V smashed through her torso?? This is the classic \\"Get Drunk With Your Friends & Laugh\\" movie, and Jason does gets his licks in, to boot.

Now the thought of Jason in Manhattan sound quite interesting, but until you see it, now thats a whole new story. First of all this movie mostly takes place in a ship where most of the characters die off, then you got some the worst acting out of the series, but nothings as worse as Jason x in the acting category. The story is as simple as the title names it. A group of teens are set sailing to The Big Apple along with a deadly passenger unknown to the teens , and well you get the picture. Now I must give some credit to the writers on account that theres a girl that relates to jason in a way, the deaths in this film are pretty good, and the gore is also quite good. This isnt very bad, i mean ive seen bad and ive seen worse but definitly is one of the worst in the trilogy."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst Jason movie","review":"I give it a 2.5 out of 5, the title is misleading, most of the movie took place in a boat, only a small amount was spent on Manhattan, some scenes were good, but overall it failed as a Jason movie, don't waste your money on this, you will regret it, it doesn't even feel like a Jason movie"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jason takes a cruise ship...than some of Manhattan","review":"As I see a lot of people who have said bad things about this film always say the same thing (not that I don't agree) what happened with this one is, they got the green light to make the film, but were given restrictions...being they could only shot in New York for a short time, so that's why Jason only got to take \\"The Big Apple\\" for the last half of the film...that's the \\"SUITS\\" in the movie business for ya, they know nothing about making movies yet, they're the first ones to say \\"We do not feel that this is what people want\\". That's a bunch of BS. When people want to blame the director, understand it's not his fault, as he wanted to and would've shot the whole film in New York had he been given the chance.I for one loved the film, even with the restrictions, they did what they could with what they were allowed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Deluxe Edition!!","review":"This is one of the best in the series and finally it has gone to something different besides Crystal Lake for once.

Rob Hedden very imaginatively and creatively wrote/directed this film. Had this not been the 8th installment, i think this film would've gotten better attention...the attention that it deserves. but since it WAS the 8th installment, normal people were tired of the just about worn-out concept and just blew this one off as \\"just another slasher film.\\" therefore it didn't get the attention it deserved. the acting in this film was even slightly greater than what it had been in earlier films. this film was darker than the others and the dark theme made it stand out....5 stars"},{"rating":"1","title":"A movie that if you miss, don't worry!","review":"A complete waste of film.It seems that Jason will never die.If they make a part 9 I will shoot myself.

The slasher flick is now at it's lowest peak. The plotline is of course routine....after drowning in Crystal Lake once and for all, Jason is accidentally resurrected by an anchor thrown down by a loveboat! The producers wanted to make a change in this film, they wanted to change the scenery. Camp Crystal, the original setting of all the killings has now become quiet because Jason is on his way to Manhattan! He makes his way onto a ship from the boat he travels on and so slaughters the teenagers on the boat one by one. it is up to those remaining in Manhattan to stop him once and for all. Terrible plot, poor acting, and a boring film overall. Do not invest your money in renting or buying this video whatsoever!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Argh!","review":"I am a big Friday fan, but this film was, quite simply, awful.

He's pretty good at it. He also played Jason in Part 7, Jason Goes to Hell, and Jason X. Every other actor is terrible. Also this one wasn't scary at all. Everything in the others is left out of this one. It didn't seem like a true Friday the 13th."},{"rating":"1","title":"JASON TAKES A TURN FOR THE WORST","review":"Im a huge friday the 13th fan and i love the first 7 instalements, which is the only reason i got this dvd cause i wanted to whole series with no holes, but i definitly didnt get it for the film, it stinks, jasons make-up is the worst of all the films he looks like a scooby doo version of jason, the ending of the film is ridiculous and makes no sense , where part 9 jason goes to hell couldnt even pick up on where this one leaves off which was the first time that happend in the franchise, The kills are unoriginal and not very bloody at all, and since when did crystal lake join up with the ocean its terrible, the only reason to buy this dvd is the special features. I give it one star for improving on the packaging."},{"rating":"1","title":"JASON ON VACATION!? MISLEADING TITLE!","review":"I am writing reviews for each of the Friday the 13th, but I own the box set and the older releases of the later two. The reviews are for those editions not the newer deluxe editions.What could have been an interesting entry in the series is one of the worst installments. The title is very misleading as Jason is only in \\"The Big Apple\\" for the last few minutes. With so many of the films taking place in the woods, it could have been a breath of fresh air to have Jason in Manhattan for most of the film. Regardless, this film is so bad, it's hysterical!The DVD transfer is good and this is the last of the films to be included in the box set."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only question left is which is worse, this one or Part 5?","review":"Absolutely horrendous, I can't pick which was worse, this one or five...the only thing about this flick that was semi-good is Kane Hodder's performance as Jason Voorhees...(It's surprising how tough it is to act as the killer in a slasher flick)...But even the stuntman extraordinaire Hodder's performance wasn't enough to salvage this flick...Don't see it; the next movie in line, Jason Goes to Hell:The Final Friday doesn't even acknowledge this one,it completely disregards \\"Manhattan\\"s ending...again, don't see this one. Take my word for it. Don't waste two hours of your life watching it. You'll be sorry if you do. Your time would be better spent cleaning your bathroom."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jason takes Manhattan the misunderstood Friday","review":"For some really strange reasons most Friday the 13th fans dont like this one. The mood in this one is perfect for Jason. Yeah some parts are kinda dumb like why does Jason seem to teleport everywhere. Besides that this a good entry in the series the rock tune in the beginning is cool and didnt we all cheer when Jason killed that guy who was going to kill Rennie. this is a good movie and is one of the better entrie s so go see it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Jason takes Manhattan and the look of the muppets.","review":"I don't like the whole \\"away from Crystal Lake' concept. I want my backwoods psychopath back! Part 8 is descent but it clearly lacks the things that made the originals good and the slasher formula, set by the earliest in the series, is gone. Still Kane's back as Jason and there is a pretty good number of kills. Oh, i almost forgot. Jason has the worst makeup job in this film. He looks like he's crying for the Muppets, but they were on Broadway while he was chasing this girl for no apparent reason."},{"rating":"2","title":"I prefer the title \\"Jason Takes the Love Boat\\"","review":"Not the best in the series, but Jason in a new setting! An unwelcome stowaway on the graduation trip to New York, he starts in killing the teens one at a time. The best part of the movie is when they actually get to New York, which is about the last 30 minutes of the movie. Humorous to see my favorite killer chasing teens through subway tunnels and well lit streets and NO ONE SEEMS TO NOTICE! But most of the movie takes place on the boat. Fast forward to when Jason really takes Manhattan! If you don't, Jason will come for you! Tonight!"},{"rating":"2","title":"First Jason movie seen, Sweet as Hell!","review":"This movie was great, even by tv standards. One funny thing was the old guy sayin' \\"He's coming, Jason Voorhees is coming.\\" And then there's the end of the film which is cool. His body's all mutilated by rot and the Toxic Waste. His mask burns and cripples. He is then turned back into a child, apparently in an attempt to have a second chance at life. But old habits die hard as Jason Goes to Hell, Jason X and Freddy vs. Jason proved. Anyway, the overall movie was amazing. My favorite part, if you're wondering, is in NYC, when he sees the hockey billboard. He looks at the goalie mask and I thought that was funny and good. Overall a great movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Excellent Sequel","review":"Part 8 along with Part 6 is another sequel that tops the series in my opinion. In this movie you have a new idea that ends up making a successful sequel unlike Part 7. Jason Takes Manhattan is a good twist to the series. Even though Part 8 doesn't take place in Manhattan until the 2nd half of the movie the plot still holds up. Just as you saw Jason get chained to the bottom of Crystal Lake in Part 6, Part 8 starts off with Jason chained down to the bottom of Cystal Lake which is part of why Jason Takes Manhattan should have been the next sequel after Jason Lives in the series. As in Part 6, there are some characters that you care about and some that you don't. Plus, there is something about Jason that you don't get to see in the previous sequels but I won't spoil that for anyone. As of Part 5 and 7, do yourself a favor by skipping Part 9: Jason Goes to Hell and watch Jason X."},{"rating":"1","title":"BRIEFLY THAT IS...","review":"First of all, the title is misleading. Due to budget restrictions, Paramount wouldn't let them film a lot in the Big Apple, so Jason's only in Manhattan for about twenty minutes of the movie.The rest of the time he takes to slaughtering students on a graduation trip on one of the student's father's ship. It's all more of the same formula which was definitely getting tired by this 8th installment. There's little suspense and veteran character actor Peter Mark Richman looks embarrassed to be involved. The least entertaining of the eleven films to be sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its so bad its laughable!","review":"By far the worst Friday ever. What is this piece of trash. This movie looks like it was made for TV and the acting is down right embarrassing. Who picked these people. Why is Jason away from Crystal Lake. And whats up wiyh him turning as a boy again. Simply atrocious. I have this one in forsake that I am a huge Friday Fan,but this was completely unneccasary. Part 8 makes Parts 6 and 7 look like masterpieces.

Not because there's a lack of gore(the deicapation of the boxer on the roof is hilarous), not because we don't see any boobies( Jensen Dagget is very hot) but because the film is barely set in New York. I think the film should have stayed on the cruise ship the entire time because we only spend maybe 20 min in NY which in acutal fact is Canada."},{"rating":"2","title":"Is Manhattan Ready Jason?","review":"I think this is one of the best Friday's yet. jason's back and this time he's taking on the big apple.if there any place that can handle Jason its manhattan.

In the begining you get excited by the title Jason takes Manhatten, this is an interesting idea, how could it not be, well I think they found a way. JAson is brought back to life after an underwater power line electrically rechares him and he re-awakens. This is where the movie gets bad, instead of having Jason terrorize Manhatten, they deciede to let him terrrorize a cruise ship of students that are graduating from high school who are embarking on their senior trip. At no point in time does Jason even attempt to take Manhatten. The only reason I give this movie two stars is because Jason at least seems to keep up to his old tricks of maiming and killing teenagers who are doing things that they should'nt. Only see this movie to keep up with the Friday the 13th series. Out.

The first 80 mins of this piece of garbage takes place in a ship where jason takes out the crew one by one leaving a small amount of survivors that he stalks once in manhatton.

This movie does not even resemble the previous Friday the 13th movies because it does not take place near Camp Blood or Camp Crystal Lake.Therefore, any Friday the 13th theme left in this series is extinguished and the curse of Camp Crystal Lake, which provided somewhat of a creepy atmosphere, is not even utilized rendering this flick meaningless and just plain stupid. Of course, this is a masterpiece compared to \\"Jason X\\", just to let you know how bad that one is.Friday the 13th part 2, 3, 4 and 6 are the most entertaining of the series with part 2 and 3 being the absolute best of the lot."},{"rating":"1","title":"crap","review":"boy does this movie ever stink.

Also, before it crapped out on me, I did notice that it didn't charge batteries as quickly or as effectively as the original Canon charger did, they ran out of juice much more quickly with this thing.

I saw problems of scapegoating the children fall one by one by the wayside until the parents and the parent's parents faced the hard issues they had so skillfully avoided through the dynamics they set up among themselves.

The engine mount was flimsy and the track had popped out of it's housing making it useless. I went back to the store and they offered me the Horizon WT951 instead because they were out of the Pro Form I had purchased. What a blessing in disguise! It was easy to set up and far sturdier than the Pro Form. You could see and feel the quality. This was a machine, baby! Heavy gauge metal support bars, killer display and all-round cool appearance.

In this film, someone is killing the residents of a small mining town because they want to hold a Valentine's Day dance on the anniversary of a mining accident and a massacre that occurred around 20 years earlier. If you've seen any of the \\"Friday the 13th\\" films, then there's not much new here, but if that's the sort of thing that you like, then this film isn't too bad, although there aren't any real scares in it.

Glad that didn't happen, although I would have prefered a sequal to that even lamer 1999 movie Valentine.The acting in this movie is mediocre, not great as some people think. But mediocre is a high standard for an early eighties horror movie. I didn't think this movie was \\"so 80's\\", it was more like \\"so crappy\\". It was more like a seventies horror flick than anything.P.S.

It's a classic slasher movie, better than most of the Friday the 13th sequels but was heavily cut when first released. I haven't really got much faith in Paramount as they are one of the worst DVD producers around. Look what they did to the Friday the 13th films: The same old butchered R rated versions and no extras except the trailers and it's very rare for a Paramount disc to have many extras, even classics like Apocalypse Now and Face/Off. Hopefully they will prove that they are not just fleecing us and release it uncut. More likely they'll wait until everyone has bought this version then re-release an unrated one.

Moreover, the 'teens' in this movie all seem to be aged about 30 and while the gore is undoubtedly more explicit than it was in the cut version, it is still nothing special and certainly does not redeem the film.

I almost fell asleep twice, even during the killing spree. Go rent Holloween for the hundredth time, it'll beat the hell out of watching this dumb flick.

Unfortunately as many people have stated, there are cuts to the film so not as much gore or murders are actually seen, but if you enjoy your films just for the suspense factor alone, than you will be happy with this. The locations used for this film are great especially the creepy, isolated mine. However, it's your typical slasher horror fare so don't expect too many surprises.

Now the curse is about to be brought back as the people of Valentine's Bluff are preparing for their first Valentine's day party in 20 years.

The story is recycled, which is good, but could have been much more minimalistic. Why not just have the party and let the miner kill the kids?

Butchered by the MPAA upon its original release, fans have clamored to have it released fully uncut in all its gory glory. Well, here it is finally. In anticipation of the upcoming 3-D remake, Lion's Gate has re-released Paramount's original slasher in its uncut form, which you can view with the deleted scenes re-inserted into the film the way it was meant to be seen, or you can watch the butchered theatrical version. There's some interesting extras that are included here as well, including a retrospective on the film, and an interactive text-based mini-history of horror.

The only problem I came across with this game was that about two months after I got it, the game wouldn't work anymore. I don't know if it was just my game that did that, but who knows. Other than that fact, this game is good. It is kinda educational because you learn the consequenses and rewards of tinkering with your engine while drag racing. I love drag racing, so naturally I loved this game. If it were more durable I'd give it a five, but it's not durable, so it gave it a 4. I think NHRA should come out with theri own drag racing game for PS2 and X-Box, so us real NHRA Fans aren't stuck with the stupid IHRA games. Come on NHRA.P.S. Tony Schumacher & Brandon Bernstien ROCK the world of Top Fuel!!!!!P.S. John Force ROCKS the Funny Car World!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS IS A GAME?","review":"If you were to ask me to review this game I'd say it sucked! There are more bugs in the game than the amount of cars to choose from. The graphics are just to simple for the PS2 and the gameplay gets boring. The first few mins are fun at first then it just gets boring. There is just no real challange in this game and the computer is just to slow(their cars and reaction time). The only good thing about the game is the amount of setting for your car to choose from. If you want a Drag racing game I'd invest in a version for the computer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmmmm....","review":"Buy this game if you have alot of patience, because load times are long and this game has a habit of freezing up. You can pick from a number of cars and then totally customize them and build your own engine. You can also make a custom engine and then throw a turbo or supercharger on it. But as far as gameplay goes, well brand new it is [not much money]. That says it all. Any good game will not sell for [that amount] when it is newly released. Would I purchase for [that amount] knowing how the game is? Probally not, I would recommend renting this game, if you can find it for rent. Replay value on this game is pretty low."},{"rating":"1","title":"This drag racing game sucks","review":"I'm going to say please don't waste your money on this game, it's bad. I love drag racing but this is just pathetic. The game is cheesy and let me say this. If you know nothing about car parts don't play because it's the complicated. I have to install every part. You can play using the selected cars but it's just not fun to play. And it's hard to figure out the controls. I have a headache now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasted money","review":"This game was by far the worst thing I have spent my money on this whole year. Terrible graphics, you can spend 45 minutes tuning the car, due to the bad instruction manual, all for 4 seconds of racing and then losing. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading...","review":"Don't be deceived by the term \\"Rubberized\\". The title and pics represented by Boxwave, via the Amazon website, indicate the case for the ipod touch 3rd generation is \\"Rubberized\\". When in fact it's merely a Jet Black hard plastic shell casing for the ipod touch. It affords no protection in the event the ipod it dropped because it's encased in plastic which would not absorb any impact, as apposed to an rubberized casing which would absorb the impact. The term \\"Rubberized\\" indicates there is a rubber component to the casing, which is not true, it's simply plastic.

I have gone through 3 chargers. The first lasted about 2 weeks, the second about 3 months and this last one about 4. The first stopped charging, but the others just fell to pieces while unplugging then (one from the phone and the other from the wall outlet). The company replaced the first 2 for free (even beyond the warranty period) and didn't charge shipping. I am not going to bother replacing this last one.

Discovered that the rubber gasket in the cap was missing and from your instructions contacted the manufacturer, Rain Bird. They understood my problem and told me that they would send me a kit, including the gasket around 11-15-2012 and advised that it would take about 5-7 days to arrive. It arrived today 12-17-2012 as I was writing this rating. It obviously took a lot longer than they stated and the above one star rating obviously has improved and I suspect that the installation will fix the problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I bought and installed this \\"Professional Grade\\" valve in June 2011 as a replacement for a similar, but no longer available Rainbird valve. The solenoid/flow control lasted a year and began to leak badly. The old units lasted 3-4 years each (have 5 zones). I just (today) installed a Toro replacement valve (Toro 53763 3/4-Inch Anti-Siphon Jar Top Underground Sprinkler System Valve with Flow Control). So far, I'm impressed by quality & features; although it is only day 1."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaks","review":"I probably got a defected one.

However, I do not have an HD TV and just wanted the S-Video and Digital Optical Audio for Dolby Surround Sound. For this purpose it works great and includes some free cables. 1x S-Video, 1x Standard AV cable, and 1x High Def cable. It does not include an Digital Optical cable but they are easy to find, and it includes more cables than the Microsoft one did.So I would recommend this if you need the dolby sound and better picture, but not if you are looking for HDTV."},{"rating":"2","title":"dont believe the previous posts about this not working","review":"This product does work, see the problem with people is they dont take time to read directions. What you need to do is hook up these cords correctly and then go into your setting on your xbox and enable it to work on HD for 420,720,1080 it just doesnt automatically work, you need to set it to read HD.

My problem is that I have widescreen enabled and it shows up on the tv as a 4:3 image, and it looks horrible.Yes, I did read and follow the instructions... buy the Microsoft version if you need one of these. I found them in CompUSA and Best Buy at a very reasonable price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money on this product.","review":"This product is totally unacceptable. Reading the other reviews, and my own experience leads me to conclude that this product is poorly designed. Most likely, the cabling and switchbox are not suitable for the radio-frequency signals present on the component interface. It is obvious that the channels are interfering with each other. It does enable HD for the XBOX, but the picture is worse than SD due to ghosting/noise.If you want HD on your classic XBOX, I recommend you buy a Psyclone component cable. It is only a few dollars more and (unlike the Intec cable) works well."},{"rating":"1","title":"High Definition DOES NOT WORK!","review":"This product is bogus. It does not enable High Definition use with your XBOX."},{"rating":"1","title":"Video HD does not work","review":"Although the Digtal Audio out worked fine, this adapter does not output in HD. I replaced this unit with the official Microsoft version which works fine with the same settings on the TV and XBox. I'm sure the s-video works fine, but if you are looking for 480p, 720p, or 1080i look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Buy!!!","review":"The component output on this DOES NOT work correctly. It displays ghosting on all HD resolutions. I am 100% sure I am hooking it up correctly.The S-Video, Composite, and Optical connections all work fine.

I bought RP114 largely because I like RT314 very much. I have upgraded the firmware from v3.24 to v3.25 for improved management functionality and extra features (e.g. port range forwarding).Strength : - once you set it up, it's maintenance-free - Small footprint - All 4 ports are autosensing MDI/MDIX - Keyword-based filtering and URL logging are great additions to already-good RT314.Weakness : - Forward-facing ethernet ports (may be a strength) - The power tranformer block is too big. - Management functions are not entirely web-browser-based just yet. Certain management functions are still telnet-based. - It would be nice if it includes a print server."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible router","review":"I have similar problems as described by someone here.

Ours locks up several times a day, with three people using it. Typically, if one of us is connecting to a web server that is down, it hangs the entire router for a few minutes, or longer.

Frankly, if this was just a trailer reel, I'd highly recommend it, but it's edited together like any one of the endless VH1 shows of similar title. The only thing missing is the \\"funny\\" pundits waxing poetically on the subject at hand. (Just try not to get tired of the cheesy linking scene of the crowd throwing stuff at a move screen that is repeated after every movie.)On the plus side, I discovered a few movies I'm going to have to look for now.

You get to see the dead version of Jason without the mask at the end of the movie but it's really no big deal. I tried to like Part 7, I really did, but the movie was just somewhat dull.

I give props to Kane Hodder for bringing new depth and dimension as well as undeniable character to Jason, who after being previously portrayed by mediocre actors, just did not have the scariness that he did when he emerged from the water to drag Alice down to his \\"resting\\" place at the end of the original. The storyline reeked. The whole idea of \\"Carrie vs. Jason\\" holds about as much water as the long awaited, in the making, yet totally impossible \\"Jason vs. Freddy\\". Thanks Kane for your effort, but more effort should have been put into the overall story."},{"rating":"2","title":"new blood, new light","review":"this one was fairly entertaining....kane hodder does quite an impressive job at portraying the diabolical jason. this one is probably the 3rd best in the entire series being behind parts 8 and either 6 or 4. the plotline was fairly decent as was the acting but jason just looked plain disgusting because of the fact that his spinal cord was showing. but the movie was entertaining and rates above average to the rest of the series but since it is still essentially in the same place it pales in comparison to part 8. 4 out of 5 stars here"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is like scary movie","review":"this movie is not the worse but its really korny about the whole story line to it.i dont think the series is going to become any better"},{"rating":"1","title":"PARAMOUNT/BUECHLER SHAFT US AGAIN.","review":"Once again Paramount has released this severely cut version on home video.THE SLEEPING BAG MURDER IS STILL CENSORED.I saw this movie in the theater in May of 1988.I saw the complete uncut sleeping bag scene.Everyone in the theater screamed like maniacs.It was shocking.It was horrifying.It was THE greatest moment in the Friday series.It was in every release print that played, therefore, It must still exist.By the time the VHS came out, the sleeping bag kill was gone forever.Paramount Pictures.

This film just doesn't fit with the rest of the series, apparently the girl, Tina, used to live in Crystal Lakes, yet in none of the other Friday the 13th's do you see Tina, or hear about her father drowning, it just doesn't fit.

The story is a little over-the-top,with Tina and her telepathic abilities,but hey it's a Jason movie. Kane Hodder rocks as the psyco serial killer because of the attitude and pure menicing look he gives Jason, plus the special effects for the movie and just Jason specifically are awesome(You can see his bones in some places and he actually looks like he has been at the bottom of a lake for a while).

The script is terrible and wastes the psychic spin completely. The spin with the psychic girl could have been done well but it is so poorly executed that one wonders if this movie was done as a high-school project. The acting is downright awful and the actors sound like they had like been to Hollywood upstairs acting school. The music though is the worst schlock I have heard in a long time and is absolutely atrocious. I love the tacky and cheap looking 80's clothes, the even worst hair does and the cheap special effects that even looked cheap back when this movie was done. Then again this is the seventh movie in a series and to think that it would have a huge budget is delusional. Still it gets like 2 out of 5 stars.

The new blood's predecessor JASON LIVES, was a great sequel and everybody likes part 6. The entry after The New Blood, Jason Takes Manhattan, is my personal favorite because it was the first horror movie that I saw ever and I am in love with Kelly Hu, who made her acting debut in Jason takes Manhattan. The New Blood is about Tina , a telepathic girl whose dead father saves her ass from Jason. They should have skipped from Jason Lives to Jason takes Manhattan, because this probably the worst out of all the Friday the 13th movies( JAson goes to Hell and Jason X don't vount because they aren't real Friday the 13th movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cut or uncut, this is a BAD movie","review":"It all boils down to Jason vs. Carrie.

Unrealistic and a tearjerker","review":"It is offensive that Hollywood would make this movie and not donate the profits to people like John Q. Imagine the medical care Denzel Washington's salary alone would pay for? Probably at least one kidney transplant.There should be a purpose to a movie like John Q., and there just wasn't one in this film. The plot was very unrealistic with the free care, welfare, and other hospital-assisted funding programs out there. We should thank heaven above we are living in the United States of America where we still have some of the very best healthcare services available to everyone.I thought this movie made hospitals the bad guy just to make John Q. more sympathetic.

Great movie, and, while not speaking from personal experience, I can safely say that situations like the one John Q lives through occur constantly in this country. Why doesn't the US adopt a health care system like Canada? Federally financed health care means that everyone is taken care of. I know that some of the content of my \\"review\\" didn't directly concern the movie, but I thought it would be an ample opportunity to voice some of my views on world issues and concerns."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great movie!","review":"John Q is definitely a wonderful movie, full of a lot heart. Denzel Washington does an outstanding job as John Q. In my opinion, an even better job than in Training Day. He should definitely get an oscar for this one.John Q is essentially about a man whose son encounters a life threatening medical situation. His job has changed medical plans and his hours have been cut, all more or less without him being aware of it. When told his son needs a heart transplant, he finds out that his insurance won't really be there help out. As a good father, he does every thing he can, within the system to get this surgery for his son, but to no avail. He's left with no options, so he chooses to basically kidnap the ER and his son's heart surgeon.Overall a very gut wrenching at times and extremely enlightening film. While not approving of his final solution, John Q is a very good movie, that brings to the spotlight some facts about health care in our country!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Masterpiece of Moving Emotions That Touch Your Soul","review":"John Q is a masterpiece about a father who's son goes into heart failure. Left broke and no options left he can't afford the expense for the donor's list he snaps. Left with no options he goes onto the edge.

This is a blatant propaganda film about the poor health care system in this country. I know the system is bad, but do I need a movie with horrible dialogue and stereotyped characters to tell me this? The writing for this film is so unoriginal and uninspired. It sounds as though the writer of the screenplay was working under serious time constraints. Denzel's repeated cries of \\"Sick/Help! Sick/Help!\\" is just one example. I almost puked at the end when Denzel's little boy repeats one of Denzel's lines from earlier in the film: \\"don't say goodbye, say see you later,\\" or something like that. Holy smokes! Now that's original writing! I could go on and on.

Smith are ok, but then as the movie progresses the support cast is simply awful. How can the likes of Anne Heche, James Woods, and Robert Duvall ruin a movie with bad acting? I don't know but it happened here. With a cast like this this film could have been gold, with a subject like this this movie could have had a social impact. But it's trash.This is probably the first movie I have seen Denzel in that was this bad.

Romm is to learn that for the ancients, geography was more of a literary device than a budding science. In a way, it was more complex than that as the lines between literature and science were often blurred. It is interesting to note that the idea of the edge of the earth was most often used to create a moral lesson and what a better well to draw a taste of moral water from than the area where the least information is available. It was a blank slate of sorts for the ancient historians, geographers, philosophers and various other writers to create their own messages for their own purposes.

Nearly impossible to place on the center of your roof.I had it off to the side close to the door. Ran the cable to the cigg lighter, without much tension. At 70mph, the power of the magnet failed, and it became detached from my roof and was dangling outside my car.

Well, we'll never know, because the sound quality is so poor (it's marginally better in some sonatas than in others). Grumiaux and Haskil are such superb and musicianly players that one has to give them the benefit of the doubt -- and we know of their quality from other recordings: Haskil's Mozart, Grumiax's Beethoven Concerto recordings. But in the Kreutzer, for example, you just can't hear the clear articulation of the piano's notes. The violin sound is a bit more to the fore, but it too seems \\"spread,\\" so there is clearly a problem in the engineering somewhere. Put on Argerich and Kremer's Kreutzer, and you're hearing stuff you didn't know was there in the Grumiaux/Haskil recording.

Everybody involved in this film should either be punished or have their SAG memberships revoked! Where to start - the writers of the screenplay obviously only read the book jacket.

Aailyah (sp?) would have died from embarrassment if the plane hadn't taken her. We could go on down the line, beacuse everyone is either horribly miscast or a horrible actor.

Alot of you need to stop bashing Aaliyah's role,her being in the cast was perfect.The writers should have picked other actresses/actors to play the others but Aaliyah as Akasha was truly a blessing because she was mysterious and it showed in this movie that she can play in scary films -- Her accent was flawless.

What I GOT was something different and suprisingly interesting. Some of the scenes were very beautiful. Mostly the ones between Stuart Townsend and Aaliyah. One of my favorite scenes would have to be when Lestat was playing his violin for the statue of Akasha. The only thing that got me was this: What you KNOW is that the title, \\"Queen of the Damned\\", suggests that Aaliyah has the big (better yet biggest) part in the movie. What you DON'T KNOW is that Aaliyah is in the last half of the movie. Well, with the part she was given Aaliyah was fantastic. Overall, \\"Queen of the Damned\\" is well-worth a watch. Maybe even purchasing the DVD if there is alot of good special features.GRADE: B+ earning 4 stars.*You'll always be in our hearts Aaliyah*"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure Entertainment","review":"It might not go hand in hand with the books, and some fans of the books might be dissapointed in that but the movie in itself is a great experience.

I'd never heard of Anne Rice before, so when I saw that most of the negative reviews were from the fans of Anne Rice I thought I might like it. Needless to say I was wrong. I found the plot boring and uneven, and the actors didn't do a very good job (except MAYBE Aaliyah, but she was only in like 3 scenes, even though she's the title character). Again, needless to say, watching this at 1 in the morning for the first (and probably last) time, I almost fell asleep.If the fact that movie was as bad as it was isn't funny enough, one of the guys who got his blood sucked by a vampire was credited as \\"Guy Being Sucked.\\" How embarrassing."},{"rating":"1","title":"How can something suck so bad?","review":"Look folks, this movie is so horriffic it should only appeal to the 13 and under crowd that look for nothing more than special effects and lousy goth music.

I don't think I could take any person seriously who enjoyed this on any level unless they like to slap the monkey to vampire costumes, it's that bad.ACTING: sucked. SCRIPT: sucked. COHESION TO ACTUAL STORY: non-existant.The real shame here is that this movie may represent what the intrigue and beauty of reading this series can provide to potential readers. Now that Anne is gone Christian, she should begggg Jesus to destroy all copies of this movie before it poisons further a remarkable story.

But the elements which are essential to develop a story are missing altogether here. First, the characters in the film are shallow and empty, totally straying from what makes Anne Rice's books so interesting. The surface of internal conflict is scratched, but vainly. The characters don't even follow physical descriptions given in the series. Acting in the film was HORRIBLE! Special effects were cheap and embarrassing. Overall, a poor adaptation that leaves you wondering what book the producers read. Too bad , so many good things could have been done with this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"NOT EXACTLY THE BOOK BUT STILL GREAT!!!","review":"Granted that QOTD is not totally the same as the book.

Though it is not at all like the book, it carries out themes and plots that were in the book. Basically the book had things in it that weren't appealing to most audiences so the director & screen writer changed things a bit. The movie really is rather good though. It is not very confusing and it has a lot of action in it. The music from it was also very good because Johnathan Davis (the guy from Korn) helped write it."},{"rating":"1","title":"blah","review":"i am a big fan of the vampire cronicles and all of Anne Rices work. Interview With The VAmpire had to be one of my most favorite movies. When i heard that Queen Of The Damned was coming out i got very excited. I was extremly upset whan i saw who was casted. I thought Tom Cruise did a superb job as Lestat.He made Lestat come to life for me. Stuart Townsend killed that image. His hair was too dark, his accent funny, and he was nothing like the tom lestat. Armand (who wasn't even introduced)was short ,chubby, and had very short curly blonde hair, nothing like the armand in IWTV. it was like the just made the movie, didnt bother to read the books more than once and completely forgot about TWTV. i enjoyed some of the effects, and the music wasnt bad. i saw it twice and maybe will rent it but it deffinatly isnt of the same calibur as IWTV."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I have never looked at my watch as many times as I did during this film.

It begs the question, how much worse could the director possibly have made this movie? unless Freddie Prinze Jr played Lestat I don't think it could have gotten any worse. The movie theater [took] my money and I am resentful for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could they find any more ways of destroying the book???","review":"The first and last time I saw this movie was horrible, the characters were mostly unnamed and even as a anne rice fanatic I couldn't tell who was who...dissapointing was the best word for it...if you want to experience Queen of the Damned, please read the book, it is SO MUCH BETTER!"},{"rating":"2","title":"More detail.","review":"I am a vampire fan and vampire movies are my favorite. But this movie needed more detail. Like how did Akasha become queen and how did she get her king. The legend behind Akasha. It was nice to tell us about it. But if the movie was going to concentrate on Lestat and what made him famous and how and who bore him. They could at least came up with how Akasha played by Aaliyah became who she was. Like I said need more detail. And there was not enough struggle on how Lestat became a rock singer. We all know that it's hard in the show business world and there was no struggle at all to how he became a rock singer. The movie just wasn't complete. It missed out on crucial detail.

Spanning centuries of History, the story of the red-headed twins and their encounter with the self-centered Egyptian queen, and the origin of all vampires, all the way down to the final battle was an intense maelstorm of events. To put that into one movie...impossible. Anne Rice should have put her energy into a mini-series or at least had faith in her fans to do what Peter Jackson did with LOTR. I was disappointed in the movie. Why did I buy the DVD? I liked the romantic interplay between Jesse and Lestat! Yes most of the movie had nothing to do with the book, but I found that in the movie Lestat's character went beyond the shallow Tom Cruise portrayal. And I loved the soundtrack. I bought the movie just for that violin piece on the beach. Don't buy the movie looking for a great adaptation of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst adaptation ever made","review":"To anyone who has read the book, this will be a great disapointment. The entire plotline is wrecked from the romance between Jesse and Lestat, to the childish-ness of Pandora.The movie has lost all of the elegance and charm given to it by the chronicles and the first movie. If you want a good storyline with intriguing characters- Stick to the books. If you want another teen flick- see the movie.The only reason I gave this movie 1 star was because of the soundtrack, and a few cute guys with their shirts off."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE","review":"I saw this the week it had opened and was disgusted by the lack of adaptation. It had no connection with the book except for stealing the names of characters. It was like some horrible MTV Original Movie.The acting was absolutely terrible. I don't want to be harsh, but Aaliyah's effort in the film was awful, the only others who probably think otherwise are those who are still mourning over her death. Stuart was just downright ridiculous.The directors ruined the book as a whole. I won't say anymore, since everyone's practically covered it all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a newcomer, but enjoyed the movie all the same","review":"The only thing that is keeping me from giving the full five stars to this is that having been a follower of the Chronicles since first reading all three of the originals in 1992, I found some things left out and others not touched on a little more. But the movie still managed to pull me into it which I will honestly admit that I didn't believe it would do. I think that Lestat was played nicely by Stuart Townsend. In my mind, he brought out my envision of him. Never mind the fact that the hair color and such was off because it never really was about that. At any rate. Would I recommend the movie? Yes, of course."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money!","review":"If you are an Anne Rice reader, and have read and memorized every detail of the Chronicles, I have this to say: Don't watch this movie. It will break your heart.The only thing this movie has in common with the books is the title and the names of the characters. They've changed everything that made the book exceptional! I kept waiting for the joke to end and the real story to begin - but it didn't happen. I am thankful I didn't spend the money to watch this in the theater, and that I rented it first - otherwise I would probably have burned the DVD on my grill.If you haven't read the books and you like vampire/goth stuff, then you'll probably think the movie is just great. But trust me, read the books. They're better. I wasted two hours of my life that I'll never get back on this movie.I gave it one star since that's the lowest of the low, and another star just for Stuart Townsend who made a credible Lestat. Everything else about this movie was terribly disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it","review":"My daughter is a symphony player and there is a violin piece that we wanted to have off this movie. Price was so good and delivery was fast. I would use this seller again. Thank you"},{"rating":"2","title":"Does not meet expectations of the book","review":"Before vampires sparkled you had truly entertaining stories. Lestat is on a mission to out vampires to the world and in his doing so meets the true vampire queen Akasha. Great acting, okay story line but NOTHING like the book. If you take it on its own you will be able to enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable, pretty, boring.","review":"I never read the book, and watching the movie alone was terrible. SPOILERS AHEAD.In a word, Queen of the Damned was trite. Every sensitive little vamp boy needs a cute human girlfriend, so a queen arises, is vanquished, and leaves him with the girlfriend turned undead, happily ever after. WHAT a plot.It's hard to comment on the acting when there was so little for the actors to portray.The visuals are nice. It's uncommon for vampire flicks to have people spontaneously bursting into flame and turning into charred human embers in a span of five seconds. Also, the use of a natural redhead -- freckles and all -- is satisfying.Nothing else is innovative. But, if you like vampire flicks, the way one might like romantic comedies with a beach setting, then sure, watch it. You'll get nothing new out of it and it's not memorable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully shot","review":"I'm a big fan of the novels. I was astonished of how they took two books and made one movie out of it. It was beautifully shot, very sensual and gothic. The soundtrack was kick-ass which made it feel like a long MTV video. The deleted scenes add more story, but are worth watching after viewing the movie for fill ins. I personally re-edited it with all the deleted scenes and extended music to give it more of a rock movie feel. It flows fine though without it, but I love the videos. The costumes and make-up were fierce. One disappointment - Some of the actors didn't fit the original descriptions of the characters at all. The original DVD was one of few that really had a lot to offer in extras. Hopefully this one will to. I'll buy it and watch it with my headphones and the music turned all the way up!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Danger Will Robinson....Warning","review":"Quite simply put, this is the worst films & most inaccurate adaptation of a book.....ever. I love the Anne Rice book and both its predecessaors (Interview, and Vampire Lestat) Some of the actors are atrociously miscast and bear no resemblence to the characters, others actually have a certain charm about them and I found myself feeling compassion for them having to act in such a disaster of a production. This is the Corvair of movies (unsafe at any price)."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was not the book at all...!","review":"Most of the other reviewers were right: This movie sucked!It was bad!These are my reasons:In the book:1. Lestat was blonde, not a dark red head!2. Lestat and Jessie never got emotionally involved with one another!3. Stuart Townsend was a great vampire, but he was not Lestat!4. Lestat killed evil doers, not young women who liked rock stars!5. The story was supposed to be about Akasha, not Lastat... that is why the book is called 'QUEEN OF THE DAMNED'!6. Marias was not Lastat's maker!The other things wrong with this movie are:7. It did not follow the book at all!8. Most of the actors were stale.9. Lena Olin's character was the only one who matched her description in the book!10. There was no character development for any of the characters except Lastat!Overall; This movie was a major let down to both fans and movie-goers alike!Read the book and own (the awesome) soundtrack!My grade: F or no stars!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you've read the chronicles, DON'T WATCH THIS","review":"The movie totally destroys the beautiful books Rice has written. First of all Lestat is blond, not black-haired. Magnus made Lestat, not Marius. Jesse is much older. Louis is missing. Lestat adopts the violin from his friend, Nicolas, not some woman he sees at a campfire. Lestat does not kill just the young, he kills the evil-doer. The producer must have seen or read Interview and made Lestat as Louis saw him. If you haven't read the books and you are a moron who is looking for action (things that go boom), half-naked women, and bad guys, then buy the movie. If you expect a shade of art in films or prefer books over movies, DON'T WATCH THIS. You'll become dumber."},{"rating":"2","title":"OK entertainment","review":"It's a vampire movie, the kind where the writers create new parts of the myth (\\"never take the last drop\\") then seem to break their own rules.That's not the point, though. The point is that it's good action, it has a good noir feel, and that Aaliyah was about the hottest thing that ever hit the screen. In fact, the clean lines of her feline, much-exposed self barely fit the jagged grunge of the rest of the movie. That's the movie's problem, not hers.Three stars for the movie as a whole, but one more for Aaliyah. She was sorely under-utilized in this film, and it's sad to know that we won't see more of her.//wiredweird"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great DVD, really crap movie.","review":"Ok, eeh, am I a complete moron, or has this movie completely copied \\"Interview with the Vampire\\", made everybody gay, and put MTV in there as well\`? Hmm, \\"Aaalyyyaaaaajaa!\\" (or, yahoo as some prefer..))The loaded with extra's DVD doesn't help this movie. The movie stinks helped by helpful ingredients such as bad acting, and terrible directing and camera angle solutions. Some of the acting is actually so terrible, that it's quite humourous actually.Too bad the family of Aaalyyyaaaaajaa didn't see this movie, before they approved it....

From then on i thought Ann Rice is one of the most awsome writers i truly enjoyed the book all the way. When I was inform that it was going to be made into a movie i was soo excited, but my blissful moment was soon to be destroyed once the movie started, it did not follow the book one bit. What the ... is up with Hollywood and Love stories?!! yo that was weak that they totally twisted the movie and turned it into a love story and compared to the book to the movie, the movie starts in the middle of the book. The characters are all way off by personality and on looks and some important actors are cut from the movie. But i give props to the action scenes cuz without it i prolly fall right to sleep."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Queen of What?","review":"Obviously, the only thing Anne Rice had to do with this was to wirte the novel that gave some functionally illiterate film makers an idea for a really badly made vampire movie.The main characters were barely able to speak English. The script writer must have used an cheap scriptwriter's computer programme to create such a garble of dialogue and screenplay.Ms. Rice has a genius for writing and language that was lost on the producer and director of this movie. Apparently this movie was an attempt to bring an elevated level of entertainment to people who enjoy watching big wheel truck crush cars and call their sister Mom. Very disappointed in what would have been a great movie, if as in An Interview with a Vampire, the storyline had been followed and real actors employed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good in the right mindset...","review":"This was a great movie and I think it added allot of enviornment to both the books it covered. Although it did not follow the books it followed the it close enough to keep me satisfied. The only downfall of the movie was the casting. The only people who fit there characters were Lestat (Arrogant, sexy, and bloodthirsty) and Marius (Quintessential elder speaking from the background.) The worst was Louis, A chubby cheeked frat boy? What was that? His only line was \\"I will not.\\" and that wasnt that good either....Overall though the movie was good and the imagery was excellent! I would reccomend this to any with a strong stomach and an open mind....thanks"},{"rating":"1","title":"Anne Rice shouldn't watch it ...","review":"This is a really bad movie, and awful adaptation of the second best vampires book by Anne Rice. I just hope Ms. Rice didn't bless this adaptation. There is only a very loose connection to the book, and not a good one. The movie tells the story about the vampire Lestat. The book is about the awakening of the evil represented by Akasha, the mother of all vampires, and about the struggle of \\"good\\" ancient vampires, who don't want to see the end of the humanity. The movie completely ignored the best part of the book: the story of ancient siblings, and only showed Maharet, in a few meaningless sequences. I don't recommend buying DVD or VHS. Wait until it gets shown on broadcast TV. You will be bored anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip It -- Read the Books Instead!","review":"The only reason this movie gets ONE star is because of the potential of Stuart Townsend and Aaliyah. If this movie had been done right; that is, as two movies -- the Vampire Lestat and Queen of the Damned -- then they would have been a hell of a lot better than this bastardized version of two great novels. The writers, producer and director have pulled a mish-mast of plots from both novels, changed complete story lines, and created a mess. Stuart Townsend,Aaliyha, and Marguerite Moreau were great choices for the characters of Lestat, Akasha, and Jesse, but the rest were pathetic. Vincent Perez was completely wrong as Marius, Lena Olin was over the top as Maharet -- and this time no twin sister, in addition the characters of Pandora, Armand, and Mael were completely underused and poorly acted. If you love the Vampire Chronicles, skip his movie and enjoy the books instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing Like the Book","review":"If you enjoyed Anne Rice's Books, and thought that you wanted to see the movie \\"based\\" on the book you will be very dissapointed. It was as if someone gave the writer a incomplete outline on what the book was like. No twins, no story on how the queen became damned, no historical story line what so ever, is just another vampire movie. It should be viewed in that light."},{"rating":"1","title":"Go for 'Interview' instead","review":"I am a huge fan of the 1994 film, \\"Interview with the Vampire\\". When I rented this film, \\"Queen of the Damned\\", to be quite honest, I was awfully disappointed! First off, Stuart Townsend as Lestat de Lioncourt? He does not look anything like Lestat! Lestat had flowing, golden hair not short, black roots hair! Tom Cruise portrayl was way better and closer to the novels than Stuart Townsend and he looked more like Lestat. The one burning question I had while watching this film was, \\"Where's Louis and Claudia? What, they never existed?\\". Unless your some achne ridden teen, skip this film and go right for the copy of Interview with the Vampire. Trust me on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just a Bad Movie","review":"Putting aside the fact that this film is an insult to the integrity of Anne Rice's novel, this is just a bad movie. Aaliyah, tragic though her death is, destroyed the character of Akasha. She portrayed the title character as vapid and bestial, and exuded none of the elegance and evil momentum one might expect from a 6,000 year old vampire queen. She continuously swiveled her hips and walked around like an old-style B-movie whore in an obvious play for the attention of teenage male viewers. Stuart Townsend was equally awful and the plot was shallow, uninteresting, and poorly-written. Don't waste your time with this film; read the book or rent Interview With the Vampire."},{"rating":"1","title":"Damned if you do...","review":"Silly, witless, wooden, dreary, jagged mess. Actors lack presence (they're like paper mache up there). Direction lacks direction. Script is crummy and forgettable. Visuals are unimpressive. Soundtrack is better than the movie... and... yep, I'm done. Reviewing this stupid movie any further is a waste of my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"I saw it opening night","review":"I am a huge fan of the vampire chronicles and absolutely LOVED the first movie, however, this movie was a great disappointment. The music was good, but it had way too much narrative (nearly half of the total movie)! The action was abbreviated and not nearly as intense as it should have been. I was seriously disappointed by the distortion of two novels (The vampire Lestat and The Queen of the Damned). Many things were different than the books without improvement to the storyline. Overall, I was very disappointed and think those who have waited to see this should wait until video."},{"rating":"1","title":"How?","review":"How in the world can you give a movie five freaking stars before you've even seen it?

You heard that the director was impressed with it?Look up the word 'review' in the dictionary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only b/c you can't select 0 stars!","review":"This movie was pure hollywood. They took something great and made it shallow and flashy. No substance, no plot, nothing. I can't fault the actors for anything except accepting roles in this disaster. I can't help but wonder if the people in charge even read the whole book. Did an assistant highlight the \\"important scenes\\" for them? Truly an awful, awful movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was kinda weak","review":"I say this with the utmost respect to Mrs. Rice, I love her books, adore them, even, and i loved the Interview movie. This movie was weak. It didn't have that absolute gorgeousness that is the bread and butter of all of her work. Her books are so beautiful that they make me wanna cry. This movie made me wanna cry for a wholly other reason. It was simply........awful. See, now i'm mad at the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHY???","review":"I loved the books and was all into it when I heard they were making Queen of the Damned into a movie but this movie just made me sad. I have a list of a hundred plus things that are off from the book. I know Interview has its faults but not near as many as this movie. Aaliyah did a great job playing Akasha but most of the rest of the cast leave something to be desired. No blonde Lestat or Marius,no Louis, no Daniel, and no Armand or anyone else that made the book any fun. If you make a movie based on a book try to keep some of the book in the movie. But that's just what I think don't let me keep you from seeing it but it's something I could only handle watching a few times before throwing things at my TV and yelling."},{"rating":"1","title":"A BIG PIECE OF FILTH","review":"This has to be one of the worst adaptation of a book. The acting was good, that's the only good thing. Other than references to names, nothing else resemble the book. If a person never read the book, I don't see how anyone understand the plot. The book was complex and exciting. The movie is simple and explains nothing. Lestat is a vampire. He joins a band and market himself as a real vampire. Some girl from a British institute studies vampires. This girl read a book diary of Lestat was made. Akasha, the queen, wakes up. She kills other vampires and falls in love with Lestat. A bunch of other ancient vampires (very interesting and important to the plot in th book, but never named or explained in the movie) battles with her in the end for their survival. They won. Lestat makes the girl and vampire and everyone lives for a few more centuries. Watch it, if you have to, but don't buy it. It sucks and very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the twins?","review":"The movie was ok if you didn't read the book. If they are taking a book and making it a movie shouldn't they try to keep it as a close as possible. I was expecting it to be closely like the book but i was deeply disappointed. What happen to the story of the twins? That was one of the most importing things. They didn't even show how the Queen was made. That was the best part of the book. They cut so much out. I was expecting to get to meet the other vampires, they never mentioned them just showed them briefly at the end. And the end wasn't even close as it was in the book. The only things that were good were the acting and the music. Why didn't they let Anne Rice have a say.She should have let the people who made \\"Interview with a vampire\\" make this one, at least it would be have close."},{"rating":"1","title":"How Come there is no zero star choice???","review":"I tried to watch this movie with an open mine. But after the first 10 minutes the only thing that came to mind was \\"What the H@ll\\". I am a mainstream teenage american for whom this \\"film\\", if i dare call it that, was made and i really didn't like it. The first thing you really notice is that the whole movie should have been on MTV.The movie didn't have a plot what so ever. They could have atleast made on up for gods sake. Why cut out character who were important to only have them in for one minute of the film???The casting was terrible. Over all it was just a bad movie. Don't waste you time unless you like to self inflict pain towards oneself."},{"rating":"1","title":"...Anne Rice liked it!!!????","review":"first of all i am a big fan of the Author who wrote the book this movie was supposedly based on. the last book they made into a movie, turned out great... but this one was a big disappointment. i am 15 and all my friends that had seen it (that didn't read the book) did NOT like this movie. they didn't understand it. i had read the book and was sorley disappointed by this movie. the story lines of the books was not all put into effect. first off they could not only get the hair color right, but they totally caboshed the storyline and tore apart the last movie. you would think that the people involved in the making of this movie had at least read the book! i cant even put into words how awful this movie was. pretty much, dont watch it- if you have read the book(s)(or heard anything about) it will be an utter dissappointment, and if you haven't then dont plan on understanding it. it is a roller coaster of confusion."},{"rating":"1","title":"bring your blanket","review":"I would give Ann Rice a piece of my mind if she went with the making of this piece of trash, this was a poor excuse of a movie.

Aaliyah"},{"rating":"1","title":"Greatest Movie of 2002","review":"This movie was so great, I have not read the books seen interview with the vampire nothing, before seeing this I'd never even heard of Anne Rice. The day after I saw this movie I ran and bought the books and the movie \\"Interview with the Vampire\\". This one tops that movie in so so many ways. Stuart Townsend is Lestat and he does it 100 times better that Tom Cruise, who was only cast for star power. The late Aaliyah captured her character Akasha brillantly and proved just how great of an actress she really was. I hated Akasha all because of her talent. The music was good I dont usually like that goth style music, but I did buy the soundtrack and it is very good. Bottom line even if you don't like vampires this is a great movie to see."},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL, but almost amusing for its sheer perversity","review":"As a reverant fan of Anne Rice's books, I vowed to stay far away from this film. One night I was bored, it was there, so I watched it.This film is so terrible that a serious review isn't worth the effort. What is worth commentary is that far from being offended at seeing such a ludicrous interpretation of a book I loved, I was nearly amused at the sheer virtuostic badness of the film.It has the pleasure one gets when reading a collection of absurd first lines of novels, written to be deliberately and outstandlingly bad.If you know how the story was meant to be, you might get a good laugh, or at least a contemptous snigger. If not, this film won't leave so much as a clue to what you're missing - though you will rather wish you'd missed IT."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Anne Rice Feel","review":"If anyone has read any of my reviews they know I am a huge vampire movie fan. This movie is very fun to watch and has many cool aspects to it. The only problem I have with it is that it just doesn't have the same Anne Rice feel as did Interview With A Vampire. \\"The Vampire Chronicles\\" by Anne Rice have a certain feel about them. I didn't feel that Lestat was played to perfection or that the Queen could show exactly how powerful she was on screen. This is the only down side I can see to reading a book then seeing the movie afterword. Books always have more to work with and then leave it up to the imagination of the reader. If you haven't read the book this movie will be awesome to have in your collection. If you have read the book, and are a vampire movie freak like myself, then this movie would also need to be in your collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing.....","review":"I wasn't thrilled to see this was the so called \\"sequel\\" to Interview With A Vampire, as I am a fan of the books and I still believe they skipped a story in between. I didn't see the film in the theaters and waited to see it on cable. A few nights ago, I got my chance only to find not only did a skip a story in between the Interview With A Vampire, they skipped most the story of Queen of the Damned itself! They ruined this story in my opinion. The point of the story was to develop a new vampire Coven which Rice did brilliantly in her book. Leave it to Hollywood to screw it up! Stories were changed, as were characters and some were downright unrecognizable and grossly underdeveloped, leaving me to wonder, \\"What in the HELL were they thinking?\\" Not to mention they left out the important part of the story itself, which was to explain the vampire origins! Save your money.....this movie is a no go from beginning to end. I'd give it fewer stars if amazon would let me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is the nearest exit?","review":"I am glad I didn't see this at the movies. This was a poor book based movie. Where was the twin sister? The one with no tounge. Why didn't the other one not eat the heart of the queen? Where was Louis? The music was awful. I put the movie on mute and had subtitles so I could know what was being said without hearing satanic music by Marilyn Manson. I know this is based on the book but not by much. This movie could have done more with the book if it did less with the musical career of Lestat. The acting was good. If you want to see a vampire movie this isn't much of one either. I like Anne Rice but this movie could have been done better like Interview with a Vampire. Now that was a good movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Damned Movie","review":"I had not heard good reviews for this movie when it came out in the theatres, but I watched it, hoping against hope that it was more than the critics had made it out to be. Well, as it turns out, the critics were nice. I have read Anne Rice's, \\"The Queen of the Damned\\", and it was a good book. This movie raped that book in almost every possible way. Even were one to forget about the book and watch it just as another movie, it would still have been absolutely atrocious. I am usually nice to movies. I go easy on most. I even liked the Dungeons and Dragons movie, but Queen of the Damned disgusted me. Poor acting, poor screenwriting, poor directing. Please do yourself a huge favor and close your browser on this movie forever."},{"rating":"1","title":"A huge waste of time.","review":"\\"Queen of the Damned\\" is one of the worst vampire movies i have had the misfortune of watching. I thought Dracula 2000 was bad until i saw this, this, whatever it is. Sharing only its title in common with the book, this movie has butchered Anne Rice's vision. The acting is not bad, but not great. The special effects are good and yes Aaliyah is beautiful. I highly recommend you think twice about purchasing this movie. Most of the people that gave this movie 3 or more stars did so because they are big Aaliyah fans. Some even went so far as to write a condescending, self-serving, 'shame on you for not giving this movie 5 stars because Aaliyah's in it for 15 min.' review.

Quite the opposite my friends. Stuart Townsend brings a sexy, passionate Lestat to the screen. I found myself loving every minute he dominated my TV. His presence and his acting are excellent. Alliah was good but sometimes her preformance was a little off. One thing I did not like about this movie is the BLONDE headed Armand instead of a black haired Armand (As Antonio Banderas played him in Interview). I also didn't like the fact that points with Louis were left out of this movie but...there can always be another sequel.The music was to die for. I have never heard such a score and such an awesome collection of rock/metal music.All in all...Queen of the Damned was a very good quality movie. Some parts are shakey but it is 100% worthy of seeing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure Swill, Waste of Money, 0 stars","review":"This movie is the poorest movie i've ever seen, besides anything ed wood directed. but anyways, this movie was horrible, the lip syncing was hilariously made, you could tell that he lip synced every single time he sang in the movie. in fact the only parts that are worth watching are when jonathan davis does a cameo, and pretty much any part that involves the music (besides the concerts, they ...). the soundtrack was awesome though, buy the soundtrack, forget the movie. i found the quality funnier than almost anything i've ever seen. it's terrible, don't buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great dvd, slooooowwww shipping","review":"We enjoyed the dvd.

Now I will admit Aliyah (how ever you spell her name) does make a cool LOOKING vampire they did do a good job with that, however it's ruined the minute she opens her mouth! Horrible acting! I think the only reason this movie made any money was from Aliyah's fans especially since she died."},{"rating":"1","title":"really a negative 5 stars","review":"If I were Anne Rice I would not be relating this movie to her book. The hollywoood people have yet again ruined a brilliant masterpiece by ignoring facts in both Queen of the Damned and The Vampire Lestat. Nowhere is there a real resemblance at all. It is a real shame when the Hollywood guys get a hold of a good book and do a poor job adapting to the screen (which seems to be the norm). So do us all a favour in hollywood guys: start making real movies from books and stay true to the plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"A commendable effort, but not quite the WORST film ever","review":"The Vampire Lestat (Townsend reprising Cruise from INTERVIEW WITH THE VAMPIRE), now a famous rock star, resurrects evil vampire queen Akasha (Aaliyah in her last performance) who plans to dominate the world. This goes nowhere for more than one hundred unbearable minutes and bears virtually no resemblance to Anne Rice's novels (despite the title). Originally slated for video release, but went theatrical due to Aaliyah's death shortly after completion. What a waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Queen of the Stupid","review":"If you are an Anne Rice fan and are expecting a movie based on the book, don't look for it here. It seems as though the writers thought it would be enough to just read a short summary of the book in order to write the script. If you've read the book, don't expect anything that was in the book to appear in the movie. If you've never read the book, don't expect to understand a thing about the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"The crow returns to the big screen","review":"...\\"Hi guys if your a goth this is the movie you should be going to watch\\". \\"We've done our research you see and put a song by the guy Marilyn Manson so you should all like it\\".

In that case the movie isn't great, but there's worse out there. But for those who've read Rice and where hoping on a sequel to Interview with a Vampire (even though there wasn't a movie of the Vampire Lestat)this movie is a sad dissapointment, and not even worth one star. Aaliyah can't act, and moves as if trying to be shakira. The movie fails to stick to the story in the book on ALL critical points. Besides that, the fx are terrible, the acting is worse. Too bad, a good Queen of the Damned is what we were waiting for"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lestat's \\"Grease 2\\"","review":"While it is bad enough that this movie is not even remotely like the book it also seems the no-talent hack that wrote the script for this monstrousity couldn't even bother to show that this movie was in fact a sequal. Not only is Louis not even mentioned in this movie, it seems that the script writer had such a high opinion of himself that he wrote this movie to be the only Vampire Chronicle. There is no indication in it that Interview with the Vampire ever existed.This movie is an embarassment to a great book series and the movie that preceeded it, don't waste your time or your money on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Departure","review":"I started reading the Vampire Chronicles after watching \\"Interview With the Vampire\\" when I was about 11. \\"Queen of the Damned\\" came out when I was in high school and, at the time, I was really into that type of music. I was disappointed that the movie was so different than the book, though I understand that the several different story lines in the book would be hard to translate to a movie, it would have been nice for some of the main plots to be seen. Stuart Townsend definately depicts the modern Lestat in the same way that Tom Cruise was able to embody the 18th-19th century Lestat. All in all, it's worth a watch once or twice, but it was a disappointment. Anne Rice should have been allowed to write the script for this installment as she did for \\"Interview With the Vampire\\" and I think we would have been more pleased."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good vamp film","review":"This film was overall a good film, the music rocked in this film which I think helped it out alot which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 3. The acting in this film was really good but especially by Lestat and some of the older vampires. Alyiah was just ok but that was amainly because she hardly spoke and when she did it was unclear because of the fake accent and fangs. But the storyline was very good and is one of the better vamp movies i've seen, so i would recommend it to others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst film adaptation yet.","review":"This movie is terrible. Even if I would of watched it on its own without ever reading the Anne Rice book it would of been a terrible cheesy vampire movie. I dont care how cute Stuart Townsend (Lestat) is. But being a big Anne Rice fan and Queen of the Damn being one of my favorite books made me hate this film even more. For anybody that hasnt seen it yet and is interested in watching it, I would strongly suggest reading the book first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely dissapointed.","review":"If I could give this movie less than one star I would. Me being an Anne Rice fan I cannot believe how much they butchered this movie. This movie was definately made for the young MTV type crowd. I can only hope that perhaps one day some movie studio will remake the story of Lestat's life the way it really occured. Or at least come close. Plus the acting was terrible. Stuart Townsend is definately NO Lestat."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT WORTHY!","review":"First off I have to say that I bought this DVD, because I am a huge Anne Rice fan. Like many people, I read the book before seeing the movie, and was somewhat thrilled when I heard that Stuart Townsend was going to play Lestat-though many American's didn't know who he was at the time.However, this movie was not what I had expected. I believed that it would capture many aspects of Anne Rice's novel, like Interview With The Vampire did, but it's lacking. It would have been an enjoyable film for me, if I wouldn't have read the book, and found too many flaws within it. This movie was not worthy of being called QUEEN OF THE DAMNED-yes it has the characters that are so well known in The Vampire Chronicles, but this movie was lacking what it needed.If you haven't read the book, perhaps you'll enjoy the movie. On the otherhand, if you want the real story, don't waste your time-buy the book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment...","review":"This movie is terrible. It doesn't do Anne Rice's novels justice.

I read the book and loved it. But what many of these people dont understand is the book is never like the movie so u r going to be disapointed. I came into this movie knowing it would probably suck and i was impressed. It was no where near the book but looking past that it was still good. I think that tom cruise was better that stuart townsend but i can t really see tom cruise being a goithic rockstar. If u have read the book just look past the book and see it as a movie based not exactly like the book. And if you havent read the book id say that you should definatly see this."},{"rating":"1","title":"WORST MOVIE EVER","review":"I am a HUGE Anne Rice fan.I looked foward to seeing thsi movie once I knew it ws in production. But I should have had a clue when it was going to go straight to video. Once Aliyah passed away theu released it. They should have laid the movie to rest. I think this is the worst movie ever! It did not follow the storyline of the book. Even if you take it as just a vampire movie not based on Anne Rice's beloved characters, it still did not even make sense. My advice is to watch one of the greatest movies, Interview with a VAmpire and forget this movie exists. That's the only way I can get past this abomination of a movie. NO ONE SHOULD EVER EVEN WATCH THIS MOVIE MUCH LESS BUY IT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the WORST movies ever made!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"OMG this was the worst movies I have EVER seen. If I could I would give this movie minus stars. Like most of the reviewers who say this movie is awful I am a VC obsesee. I adore the vampire chronicles, I basically worship them. this movie does the book no justice. Its NOTHING like the book. it made me cry. Did you SEE what they did to Armand?*cry*Even if I never read the book this movie is still awful. I dont care that Aaliyah died this movie is stupid. Just because an actress dies doesn't mean you have to give the movie a good rating. So do yourself a favor and don't buy this. Read the book. If you HAVE to see it rent it. Dont buy it. Its not worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Queen of the Damned","review":"This movie was horrible, it was completely different than the book. Lestat is a rock star, you'd think they'd make soome original songs but instead he lip synches to Korn songs!I think I just about lost it when Lestat walked out into the sun and didn't burn up. This movie is very, very loosely based on The Vampire Lestat and Queen of the Damned book but it gets everything wrong. Horrible, horrible movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie sucked balls","review":"This had nothing to do with the book and made me want to kill someone (not to be taken seriously). This director should never work on a movie set again especially if he's planning on making totbt. Nothing in the movie even resembled the genious of Anne Rice's work. There wasn't one scene that was corresponding to the book! I myself will be boycotting this movie, who's with me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A miserable attempt to give life to a great book","review":"It's always been my personal belief that if you aren't going to stay true to a novel, then you shouldn't make a movie about it. This movie was in no way, shape, or form either The Vampire Lestat or The Queen of the Damned. It was a pathetic attempt to gather some actors together, have them hiss and bare their fangs, and play music. The producers should never have tried to make this movie. They have no concept of being true to a novel, of characterization, or even of the concept of a plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have watched Peter Pan instead!","review":"A ludicrous adaptation of a great novel. One star is too much credit. The bubblegum stuck to my shoes caught my attention better than the cheesy visuals and plot of this fetid [stuff].

I had thought that maybe they combined The Vampire Lestat and Queen of the Damned into one movie since they overlap so much-none of Lestat history so you don't understand in the movie why this gathering is so important to Lestat and Akasha. Why she let these vampires live. The portrayal of Lestat looses all the contriversaial casting of Lestat that Tom Cruise gave it. Despite trepidation and after many viewings Tom Cruise played the Lestat that LOUIS DESCRIBED perfectly. The self doubts that Lestat occasionally describes in himself are never described by Louis.Irregardless if you love the books or collect the books or movies go ahead buy Queen of the Damned-but keep the shrink wrap on."},{"rating":"1","title":"REALLY REALLY Disappointing","review":"Oh man, I actually thought this was going to be a good movie, but i was wrong---dead wrong. The title of this movie should have been \\"Completely Pointless\\" because really, that is exactly what is was. Wow, an old vampire wakes up from his sleep and starts a rock and roll band as the lead singer. What kind of moron thought of that???? Seriously though, if you like vampire movies go see Blade with Wesley Snipes, that movie was waaaay better than this hunk of junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor","review":"I thought the film was supposed to be amazing and actually related to the book. I found the acting rather poor with vampires who couldnt even act or look vampirey...Lestat had a few good moments and so did Aaliyah...Marius and all the others are a disgrace. It turns out that the only thing the book and the film have in common are the names. I can't believe Anne Rice allowed such a mess be shown.Even though it had so many mistakes I believe that Interview was thousands of times better than this. The music though gives it a major plus...so better buy the soundtrack than the DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"The only good thing about this movie:","review":"\\"How did you make through the 50s in red velvet?\\"The reasons why this movie is an abomination to any fan of the book have been said and re-said, so I'll leave it at that :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worthy of the Name Anne Rice","review":"The Queen of the Damned is the third book in Anne Rice's series about the undead, that began with Interview with the Vampire. So, what on earth possessed Warner Brothers to just skip the second and most interesting part? That is just one of many things that is wrong with this movie. Whereas the big screen adaptation of Interview with the Vampire stayed true to the original written work, the Queen of the Damned does nothing of the sort: the story is completely wrong and the vampires are nothing like the ones portrayed in the books. In fact, the only good thing about this film is its soundtrack. If you liked the books, please don't watch this film and just stick to its predecessor. It's not even worth getting worked up over."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie sucks","review":"This movie mainly sucked to me because it was nothing like the book the only good thing i think in this movie is that lestat played by stuart townsend is very good looking and the soundtract for the movie is really good but besides that it was a dissapointment. The movie interview with a vampire was much better because Anne Rice was very involved in the making of the film and this movie sucked so bad because she had no part in it she was late on renewing her copy right and somebody stole it from her and butchered the hell out of it. I was hoping maybe she would redo the movie but she turned all religious now and i highly doubt that will happen"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't watch! Read the book instead!","review":"This is the worst movie made from a book I've ever seen. They left half of the book out. There was nothing about the vampire early history and that was a major part of the story. I also think they did a terrible casting job. Lestat, Marius, Maharet and Akasha were not even close to their characters in the book. Jessie was only one that came close. And Marius didn't make Lestat a vampire! I suppose if you hadn't read the book then the movie would be ok. But the book is so much better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly disappointed.","review":"I'm a gracious fan of Anne Rice, and as said before they hacked the book horribly. I anticipated the release of this movie, because i love the vampire chronicles. Yet on opening night they just killed it. I bet the movie was great for those who never read the book or loved it. It bothered me that Marius was said to have made Lestat. Or that they never made a reference to Louis or Claudia, saying he was always alone. Or the time he spent with Armand. Where was Mekare... The ancients were never named in the movie. Something else agitated me was the fact is that they made it a love story of Lestat and Jessie..Oh well, I know I'm not alone in my feelings. Not that the movie was all that bad, but I just really loved the book..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"If you are a real Rice fan, this movie will leave you upset. Aaliyah's acting stunk, really. They left out so many important things. It was nice to see Jonathan Davis of KoRn having a cameo in the movie as a ticket scalper. It didn't seem \\"real\\" like Interview did. Rent it but don't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had she survived.......","review":"What makes this movie get any kind of press, good particularly is the death of Aaliyah. Had she lived, it would've been panned as teh horrible film it is. because she died, restraint was shown and curiousity picqued to see it. It's a bad movie. No really bad. I give 1 1/2 stars for gumption alone. The other half, I give for Aaliyah's attempts at acting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Adaptation","review":"I was excited that this book was going to be turned into a movie because I had started reading it and loved it. I finally saw the movie and it was completely off!And characters were missing.Some scenes were really good like the one where Jessie was given the choice in becoming the vampire. But the death of Akasha was awful! That was the most ruined scene in the whole movie. UCK!If they make another movie out of any of Anne Rice's books I pray that they read it and remember the plot and any other important facts so that another mishap like this doesn't happen.But on a brighter note, the performances of Stuart Townshend and Aaliyah were great. And the songs that I heard were good. But you'd have to read reviews from people who actually heard both of the CD's to know if they're good or not."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very expressive movie","review":"Even though many people may think this movie was horrible.I believe this was a very unique and extremely talented movie. I think anyone who enjoy's movies that are scary and sexy at the same time should check out this movie sometime. It's one of the best so far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Talk about a killer movie","review":"This movie was great. Although, I was kinda disappointed in the ending.

I will tell you this I did sit through BloodRayne and that was a bad movie too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing special","review":"Queen of the Damned is nothing more than a vamprie flick. One has to wonder was the film released after a year of being on the shelf just to cash in on Aaliyah's death? Micheal Rymer makes a okay his direction is nice and the special effects are cool but the film has a choppy script. As for the performances Aaliyah and Stuart Townsend are in top form the rest of the cast is ho-hum."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even close to the book.","review":"The only similarity between the movie and the book are the characters and the fact that it's about vampires. Granted, if you havn't read the book, it's not a bad vampire movie, but for those that have, you will hate it. The entire story was butchered."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay movie IF you have never read the book","review":"The acting was bad, the plot had many holes. If it wasn't for Anne Rice the original story would not exsist. Unfortunately, whoever is responsible for this movie failed to do the book any kind of justice. If you have never read the book or enjoy teeny bopper movies, then there is hope for you and this movie. That is why I did give it 2 stars. Do yourself a favor and read the book if you never have. It is alot more fulfilling to say the least. I am sure Rice fans where hoping for a whole lot more."},{"rating":"1","title":"What were they thinking","review":"I came into this movie really, really wanting to love it. I am a veteran Anne Rice reader and this was so loosely based on the work it's not even funny. Many of the important details were either changed or overlooked entirely. (The most annoying of these was Maheret's bleeding eyes. It's mentioned once with no reason for it. If I hadn't read the book that little detail would have driven me crazy). I'd list the others but I don't think there isn't enough space. The acting was adequate, just barely, and although Townsend was pretty he just wasn't Lestat (neither was Tom Cruise, but at least that was a good movie) The only real fun was trying to figure out who the vampires were in the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you've read the book don't see the movie","review":"If you haven't read the book you might like the movie.If you have read it you will probably hate the movie.Almost the entire story has been changed or left out.With all of the things that were left out,it could be some what confusing for any one that didn't read the book and didn't know what was supposed to be going on. The questions like Who is Akasha?,Who is Maharet?,and why do they matter? were never answered in the movie.I don't see how Anne Rice could let the writers do this to her book. The only good thing about the movie I can say is that Stuart Townsend is closer to the way Lestat was described in the book than Tom Cruise was in Interview with the Vampire."},{"rating":"1","title":"How Could They Have Ruined it THAT Much?","review":"Whoever wrote the screenply for this movie muust have tried to find out how many waysthey could ruin the book. It was nothing like it. Annne Rice fans: Beware! Thay must have not even read the book. Mekare didn't exist, Marius made Lestat, there were no dreams about the twins, and the list goes on and on! The didn't even kill Akasha the same way. If you have never read the book then it might have been OK (Which is why I gave it 2 stars). This movie should have never been made the way it was!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Anne Rice fans: avoid this one","review":"I could have forgiven the fact that the director obviously never read the books, and ignored important plot points, if the movie was decent on its own. Taken by itself, this movie is just bad. It's closer to a bad '80s horror flick than anything else. The only redeming qualities were the music, which was OK, and Aaliyah's portrail of Akasha was pretty good, even if she was young for the part."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm glad I didn't see this at the theater","review":"Even though I didn't read the book, I didn't like this movie much. Special effects were so-so, but, when Akasha did finally make a debut (not in the dream sequences/images) it seemed compressed, like they cut out pieces between her resurrection and \\"death\\". I know Aaliyah died toward the end of filming this, but Akasha just seemed to be shoved in at the end and only had about 5 or 6 scenes in the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is NOT the story of Akasha","review":"Why they chose to jump to the end of the Vampire novels of Anne Rice and make this movie instead of any others eludes me. Although 'Interview with a Vampire' was very good (except Armand just plainly was not the Armand of the book), 'The Queen of the Damned' is no where even remotely close to the book. How she killed her male counter part, the journey she took Lestat on. None of this is in the book. I would give more detail but it would spoil the movie for anyone else. The actress who played Akasha was abdominal. It is an ok story, but it is not the story of Akasha."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good entertainment","review":"Don't know what to say about it, vampire movie.. not too much of a vampire fan, but I did enjoy this one and Interview with a Vampire."},{"rating":"2","title":"queen of the damned","review":"fantastic movie...stupendous price....never disappointed when i order from amazon.com. you have a very satisfied customer"},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!!","review":"Queen of the damned is definately a classic, as far as vamperic legend is concerned.

This movie is unlike anything I've ever seen. It combines blood, sex, and rock 'n roll as only Anne Rice can.

See it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blechh","review":"One star rating says it all....zero would have been better. Rice's creative genius is notably missing and Cruise's smooth portrayal of Lestat is even more to be mourned.

Unfortunately, it fails miserably in this regard. The story is incoherent and diverges greatly from Rice's novels. Any one of Rice's novels (well the earlier ones at least) could easily be the basis for an entire movie. It is beyond me why the creators of this film felt the need to butcher several novels to come up with their script. The movie also suffers from bad acting and cheesy effects. This film is pure garbage. Avoid it at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that Great","review":"The DVD was nothing to get ancy about, but the real crime here is the movie itself. Anne Rice's story-telling masterpiece is butchered to the point of The Lost World: Jurassic Park. Aaliyah is the only highlight, and her part is only a few scenes and lines. The movie over all is a failure, but it really would have taken a 4 hour epic to cover the novel to a \\"T.\\" I would recomend the novel over the movie anyday.

And, what a shame that is. Trying to take two books, filled with centuries of information and character development, into a 2-hour movie is impossible. The fact that they could put the name of a wonderful book on a stylized music video is beyond me.I know this movie is not a follow-up to the movie, Interview with the Vampire. However, that movie showed what these books brought to life could be. When reading her books, the world Anne Rice created becomes vivid and real. And, after watching this movie, those images are nowhere to be found.Even apart from the book, this movie was absolutely horrible. I gave it a chance because I really wanted to like it, I really wanted it to be good. Unfortunately, it was a vast disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly Disappointed","review":"I was very excited when I heard that QUEEN OF THE DAMNED was coming out. The day is arrived at the theatre I got my ticket and watched one of the 1st viewings. After the first 20 minutes I wanted to scream and walk out. But...I held my seat and finished the film. There were many inaccuracies. If I had never read the books I may have liked the movie with a bit of editing. There were a lot of characters left out of the movie; Lestats Mother, Armand, Louis.... I hope Anne doesn't go to see this."},{"rating":"1","title":"let's smoke crack and cast some ugly people","review":"The guy who played Armand looked like a deformed potato. The casting must have been done blindfolded or while smoking some serious crack."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wretched!","review":"Like many of the reviewers here, I am an Anne Rice fan. However, I knew that there were going to be liberties taken and was comfortable with them. I mean, few of the \\"Dracula\\" movies throughout the years have had anything to do with Bram Stoker's novel. All I wanted - and expected - was a flashy, no substance guilty pleasure movie, a la \\"Dracula 2000.\\" That alone should tell you my expectations.But QotD failed even as a guilty pleasure. The storyline didn't make a lot of sense when taken on it's own, and the acting was bad to bland. I also take issue with the badly-done look of the vampires. Rice's vampires are supposed to be beautiful, whereas this bunch looked like Eurotrash or people at a Halloween spook house.However, one good thing about this movie is the music videos for Lestat. SInce the videos are included on the DVD, it earns 1 star."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool movie","review":"This movie is one of my favorites. Although at one point it's a little corny, it's overall an awesome movie. It's definitely a plus that Jonathan Davis of Korn does the music. The music is definitely beyond great.

I loved the movie Interview With The Vampire and was really looking forward to seeing Queen of the Damned. I was so disappointed. Anne Rice did the screenplay for Interview and it was very well adapted to a movie. Anne Rice did not do the screenplay for Queen and it really shows. The book was far better. I only gave this 2 stars because I know people who have never read the books and they liked the movie. I suppose for them it was good. For me this movie totally destroyed a very exciting story. Queen is one of the best books in the Vampire Chronicles. I just wish the movie had done a better job of telling the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"....Yeah, If You Read The Books...DON'T WATCH THIS!","review":"This movie sucked. They took two amazing books (The Vampire Lestat & Queen of the Damned) and slammed them together; hoping in some way to make a good movie...well, they failed! I know everyone was so hyped about this movie being Alyiah (sp) last film whem she died but the movie didn't do whatever start of a acting career justice. Hell, it was even like the Aksaha in the book! They storyline is all mashed together and ... MARIUS is NOT Lestat's sire and that is NOT how Lestat learned to play the violin. They should have taken the time and made two movies and cultivated the story. I do think Stuart Townsend made a wonderful Lestat and it's too bad he wasn't in Interview with a Vampire because it was Lestat's true age... but... trust me, rent this before you buy it. The only thing cool I found while watching a friend's DVD is that it has the music video's for a few of the songs....PS - The soundtrack is AMAZING"},{"rating":"1","title":"Was this SUPPOSED to be based on QOTD????","review":"In general, the movie was pretty good. Stuart Townsend, hotty that he is, was the wrong person to play Lestat. Lestat, is blue-violet eyed, long BLONDE hair and not created by Marius! That peeved me...the music was great. acting was o.k. story line, for someone who has not read QOTD, was o.k.If your reading this, and have seen the movie already, did u know that the blonde curly haired vampire was Armand? WHAT!!Interview was a much better movie, and it stuck pretty well to the book. buy that one, rent this one!if i were you, i would watch this movie. Then go out and buy the book, and READ IT.Never judge a book by its movie... dudes im serious on that one!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"You will like this movie if...","review":"...you are dazzled by cheap special effects with overscored sound bursts -- whoosh-bam! -- swiss cheese plotlines, and Frenchmen who have Transylvanian accents. I know what you're thinking: \\"Wow! I never thought having A.D.D. could be so advantageous to maintaining a normal sleep pattern!\\" That's right -- if you've struggled to follow difficult storylines like those in \\"Titanic\\" and \\"Batman Forever,\\" then \\"Queen of the Damned\\" is for you. This movie will naturally keep you awake even when others are forced to reach for the Trucker's Choice! Don't be bothered by those annoying questions like, \\"Why did that happen\\" or \\"Who's that\\" any more! Buy the DVD version RIGHT NOW -- buy 4 and round out a full set of coasters! Mmmm...

I guess the best thing to say about this movie is that it's a lesson in how not to make a movie.I wish I could go into more detail, but that would require thinking about this mind-numbingly dull pretense for a film.The film it reminds me of most is LOST IN SPACE which seemed like it could have been entertaining if someone had figured out how to present it in a way that wasn't so boring.Skip over this one in favor of BLADE II or practically any other vampire drama."},{"rating":"1","title":"AN AMAZING DISSAPOINTMENT","review":"Not worth the buy. If you are really curious rent this movie. I agree with most other messages posted but want to further stress my disappointment with this film. I am a large fan of Anne Rice's Vampire chronicles and thought that this movie was a disgrace to her character development and beautiful looks into a dark and beautiful melancholy world of seclusion and misunderstanding.IF however you are merely looking for yet another modern vampire action flick, which in no way tries to provide any new artistic inspiration to film, this might be worth the buy.Enjoy your surround sound, cgi, and digital resolution I will continue my search for something better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's [bad]","review":"I saw this movie thinking it was going to be great, I mean it was about an Anne Rice book. Well, I must say that it is horrible, the only thing that I really enjoy was the music, it is amazing.The plot doesn't exist or it doesn't resemble the book, they overlook things that are so important for the story, it is a crime."},{"rating":"1","title":"A truly horrible movie","review":"This movie was horrendous. It was corny and teenybopper, with a ridiculous plotline. However, it was also incredibly funny, you have to laugh. I would recommend this movie (and I have) just for it's unintentional humour. This is not a horror movie, this is a comedy. It's fantastic, I laughed the whole way through. Apart from that, the only reason you would watch it is for it's pretty costumes, awesome soundtrack and for, of course, the georgeous Stuart Townsend."},{"rating":"1","title":"GROSS","review":"the only good thing about this movie was the way aaliyah looked nuff saidps. she sucked as an actor god rest her soul"},{"rating":"1","title":"could it possibly get any worse?","review":"it sucks it sucks it sucksThe only redeming feature of this flick is that Townsend is frankly sexy and frequently half naked"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst movie ever","review":"this is the worst ive seen in a long time mabey it because i read the books and Interview the movie was exellent..... do your self a favor save the 2 hrs of your life and steer clear of this piece of crap"},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointing.","review":"This is a good movie for poeple that haven't read the book. The movie in itself isn't bad, with god actors and beautiful special effects. For these that have read the book, it's very disappointing. I 've a memory of a great book, long but never boring. Of course, to be remain loyal to the book, the movie would take a too long time, but here, the hystory has been changed, some charachters don't appear, ect. In my opinion, they could do better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oddly very pleased","review":"I went to this movie set up to not like it and after I got over my dislike of the fact that they changed lestat's benafactor and little story points I found a very \\"Pretty\\" movie. well worth seeing and buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie really peeved my friends & I.","review":"We had to see it even though we knew we'd be dissapointed (No Tom Cruise, no Louis) & we were right.We pointed out everything that was wrong. In fact, if you changed the character names, you would never know it was QOTD, seriously, it's THAT different.Only one twin, Marius's heritage & hair is wrong & he's ugly, lots of ugly bald vamipres which in the book was against the rules, no return of Louis, Jessi & Lestat are not even supposed to get along, Louis was supposed to leave the story with Louis, Marius did not create Lestat, Lestat is not supposed to be a brunette Russian, Townseed's portrail of Lestat was WAY off, & Akasha's death seen was pathetically overdone. & that's just a FEW examples.In my life I have only ever tried to get a refund from 3 movies; Aeon Flux, Dungeons & Dragons, & this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Music but a disgrace to Anne Rice","review":"I enjoyed the soundtrack but this is NOTHING like the book. The acting is poor,make up is great, special effects cheesy, and the voice of KORN does not FIT with Stuart Townsend.EVEN STUART TOWNSEND HIMSELF SAID THE MOVIE WAS CHEESY.

I only recommend this to fans of rock music (which was pretty good)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Queen of the Damned","review":"The 2002 screen adaption of Anne Rice's \\"Queen of the Damned\\" is a mood film. Stylish and dark, it serves its purpose well as a chilly late-night watch. Beyond that, the film is too empty and devoid of any emotion or substance. Stuart Townsend delivers a decent performance, but again not anything exceedingly impressive. The real standout is, obviously, Aaliyah in the title role, but the late singer (who died during production in a 2001 plane crash) doesn't appear until a good hour into the film. She doesn't do much acting- plenty of sexy moving, devilish looks- but she still manages to steal the film (which poses a problem right there). Not a straight-out horror film, not quite a suspense piece, \\"Queen of the Damned\\" is just another excuse for sets and costumes."},{"rating":"1","title":"A visually stunning disappointment","review":"The movie adaptation makes a complete hash of the books and their timelines. This would be mostly fine if it had bothered to explain any of the characters' motivations, but it fails completely to do that. The end result is that you must read the books to understand the movie, but once you have read the books you see how much of a botch the movie really is.The visual effects and costuming were fantastic however, and if you can forgive the fact that everyone was acting around a mouthful of prosthetics, all of the actors did a wonderful job.Overall the movie seems to be a half hearted attempt to draw in the goth dollar without delivering too much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anne Rice fans stay away","review":"Wow. There has hardly been a novel so mangled into movie form. Instead of the deep and intricate plot and character development I expected after the transformation of \\"Interview with a vampire\\" into movie form, I was wholeheartedly disappointed in this flick. It manages to swipe the cash out of Anne Rice fan pockets without delivering anything akin to the book. Where is the sister of the queen? Why are the facts of the book so thoroughly mangled? It is as if the people who could not grasp the first movie decided to do a pop-culture cash-grab with this movie, cashing in on Rice's fiction without giving her book any influence in teh film. Stay away, it's utterly disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"These reviews are pointless","review":"If you're going to write a review, please make sure you've seen the movie first! Everyone on here says its a great movie, but they haven't seen it yet. The one person who did see it said that it was really bad, so that blows everyone else's arguments out of the water. Please don't predict how the movie is going to be on here, tell us what you think after you've seen it.

I mean I thought it was great when Armond was at least a kid but can't we have the Red hair now please and Lestats is a blond sorry. Get a wig if you have to.Overall the DVD was great I liked the new fetures and added material we never got to see on the movie.The fact that it was more of a based on then a screen adaption doesn't take away the actualy quality of the DVD it's self I would recomend this product to any fan of the Vampire genera or Anne Rice fan just forget it's based on a book and think of it as an original piece."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classy Telling","review":"Well, yes, it is not exactly what Ann Rice wrote, but that does not make this any less of a great movie. The acting is quite excellent and the story told is a gripping one.

Every character in this movie was made to appear one-dimensional as was the story. Also, the acting was stale, not that they had much to work with since the screen play was even more atrocious. Aaliyah was decent, I am willing to admit that, but I pray that if they make another movie of the Vampire Chronicles, they ditch Townsend who just shot Lestat's character to dust. There is so much more to Lestat than blood and death; there is love and sensuality and appreciation for life and humans. What happened to our more realistic \\"Interview with the Vampire\\" Lestat? Next time, please let Anne Rice write the screen play!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Queen of the Damned?","review":"This movie was very disappointing. I expected differences, but they went to far. Any Anne Rice fan would understand what I am saying. But, for those of you who go out to see movies for the fun of it (even if they TOTALLY disgrace the book) go ahead. There is enough gore for anyone to appriciate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even close","review":"The reason they made this movie was an attempt to share some the success with that of \\"Interview With A Vampire\\". They did a terrible job at adapting this novel to film. And worst of all, it's not even the same as the novel they stole the name from. This is a terrible, terrible blend of two wonderful books.i love vampire movies and when i saw this, i was hoping for something worthwhile. i hadn't read the novels then, but i felt robbed when i left the theatre. Where was the depth? Were was the dark romance?Sure, it's got it's special effects and it's throbbing soundtrack. (By the way, i abhored seeing Stuart Townsend lip-sync to Jonathan Davis) i do agree that he was better pick for Lestat than Tom Cruise, but his acting was not as convincing as it should have been.i suggest you read \\"The Vampire Lestat\\" and \\"Queen of the Damned\\" by Mrs. Anne Rice to truly appreicate this vampire culture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheesy movie","review":"If you loved Interview with a Vampire you will Hate this movie. The whole movie just seemed like a really long metal video. I haven't read any of Ms. Rice's novels but this movie seemed to leave too many question marks. The whole slow motion scene of Alliyah walking into the bar should've been edited so more of the story could've been explained. Not a good movie and painful to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not good for anne rice fans, but good for other vampire fans","review":"I would like to say first that I enjoyed this movie the first time I watched it. My main reason is because I had purchased the soundtrack before I saw the movie, and became entrance with it. The soundtrack brought me into rock music and the movie brought me to books.I was disappointed with the movie after reading the book, but I think the movie can be good for people that have not read the book. I have now read the first 4 \\"Vampire Chronicles\\" books and I am currently reading \\"The Witching Hour\\". I have read all of this in just the span of a few months. Which is pretty amazing for a 15-year old.(Stuart Townsend is a member of the Talamasca in TWH. Hmm...)The movie might have killed the book, but it revived my faith in reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"campy and I do not mean that in a good way","review":"Queen of the Damned was camp. That's the best that can be said of this bloated and unintentionally funny piece of garbage. Aaliyah did okay and the actress playing Jesse was respectable but in all other ways it was ghastly. Well, there was one good scene: Lestat and Marius admit the power of Elvis. That's it and since this was a good scene I'm betting it got into the final cut by accident."},{"rating":"1","title":"It Reeks","review":"If you absolutely MUST see this movie, currently running on USANetwork, then watch the tv presentation-or rent it from yourlocal video store.I personally can think of a two word succinct review, and I think everyone can guess what it is, but in lieu of seeming badtaste, I shall just say \\"It Reeks.\\"Music was hardly something that would excite the living, muchless a six thousand year sleep of a Queen. Aaliyah's actingwas poor-posed well, but as far as acting goes, forget it. AndI can't think that anyone associated with an ancient order ofparanormal watchers would get excited over some rocker vampireeither.Put this series to rest-drive a stake through it, cut off it'shead, do something so that we don't have to see anymore of thisgarbage arise like the odor off a garbage heap at night!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyed the movie and music","review":"After reading everyone's negative posts, I thought I would put my 2 cents in. I really enjoyed the movie and couldn't take my eyes off of it. It took me away from reality and mystified me with its \\"Korn\\" like music. It is not just a Vampire movie or a Goth movie. I'm glad I didn't read the book trilogy first, then I might have a different opinion, but now I will read the books since the readers have said the books are 100% better than the movies, now to just get them in the right order."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have known...","review":"Rather than re-hashing in detail what has already been said, let me just confirm the following:1) Below-Average acting in general. Stuart Townshend had some OK moments, and Vincent Perez was fairly good as Marius.2) Poor storyline. Hey, it's not a rule that you always have to stay faithful to the book....but if you're going to stray, at least make sure that the result is good.One other thing...I realize that a large percentage of people that went to see QOTD were Aaliyah fans, and I agree that she had talent...but don't make more out of her role than there really was. Anyone that thinks they can make a real assessment of her acting ability from the role she had in this movie is kidding themselves."},{"rating":"1","title":"well...","review":"Queen of the Damned was very stupid. I went to see the movie out of respect for Aaliyah. Had I known that she would only be in it for 15 minutes, I wouldn't have bothered. The only reason I gave the movie 2 stars was because she was in it. She was a good actress and I give her props for the way she portrayed her character. However, in my opinion, she carried the other actors the whole movie. I personally think that if Aaliyah wouldn't have been in the movie, nobody would've gone to see it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great DVD and features!","review":"I really enjoyed the movie and I love the features that they offer. There's a lot of information about the movie, the actors, special effects...there's a tribute to Aaliyah, interviews, and also actual information about Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles! I was really impressed with how this CD turned out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage, but with some cool music videos","review":"Like many of the reviewers here, I am an Anne Rice fan. However, I knew that there were going to be liberties taken and was comfortable with them. I mean, few of the \\"Dracula\\" movies throughout the years have had anything to do with Bram Stoker's novel. All I wanted - and expected - was a flashy, no substance guilty pleasure movie, a la \\"Dracula 2000.\\" That alone should tell you my expectations.But QotD failed even as a guilty pleasure. The storyline didn't make a lot of sense when taken on it's own, and the acting was bad to bland. I also take issue with the badly-done look of the vampires. Rice's vampires are supposed to be beautiful, whereas this bunch looked like Eurotrash or people at a Halloween spook house.However, one good thing about this movie is the music videos for Lestat. SInce the videos are included on the DVD, I give it 2 - instead of 1 - stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Queen of the Damned (DVD)","review":"I am a huge Anne Rice fan, have read anything and everything that she has written and had published. With much anticipation I went and saw this movie, and was shocked to bits. I couldn't understand why she allowed those ppl to botch her work ...!!! I much preferred Tom Cruise as Lestat as he gave a very real to life performance, Stuart Townsend did a really good job \\"trying\\". Overall I was thoroughly disappointed in this movie, there wasn't a plot and things just didn't make sense, the actor gave a good try and the only reason I would view this film again would be to watch the good job the actors did in trying to portray this poor poor script, they seem to have made the best of the situation. Hope they allow Anne to write the next scripts, that is if there will ever be another movie thanks to the poor abilities of those in Hollywood who think they know best!"},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty good..","review":"im not a big vampire movie fan..but for some reason(mainly Lestat..lol) i really liked this movie. i didnt care for the music at all..and Aalyiah had about 15 minutes of screen time when i thought she was the main character..but i really enjoyed it!!

I then bought the book, and was thoroughly disappointed. I had to force myself through it, and have never read another Anne Rice (give me L. K. Hamilton any day).Therefore, I have no background on Queen of the Damned. I only watched it because of the hype surrounding Aaliyah's role.Overall, the acting was good, and I want to see more of Vincent Perez, the actor who played Marius. He really nailed the exasperated but indulgent attitude towards Stuart Townsend's Lestat.I will buy this on DVD, because the producer has written that too many well acted scenes had to be cut due to time constraints ... perhaps they will be included on DVD extras.My only (slight) gripe about the film is the title, \\"A Vampire and his music: Lestat's story\\" would have been more appropriate."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Very Dissapointing Movie From A V Cronical Fan","review":"First of all I do agree with the previous veiwer who gave this movie a one star. They ruined the story from the book. They made this movie a teens night out movie. I guess my expectations was high because of \\"Interview With A Vampire\\" was a excellent movie.

One African American writer refered to the theory as 'bad mythology'. Hence said, casting Aalliyah as QUEEN OF THE DAMNED (although she was great in the role) was just a politcally correct marketing scheme.I mean, have some common sense for goodness sake. Who lives in Egypt? Egyptians. And they are not African. This theory is just like the Black Israelites who say they are the real Jews,and that the race that calls themselves Jews are impostors.

Not only for Egyptologists and Egyptofans, but for anybody interested in learning seriously about the treasures of art and architecture in the Nile Valley. Highly recommendable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent sourcebook","review":"This is a sourcebook, set out in chronological order, with a focus on art and architecture, that conveys a huge amount of information in a readable and even enjoyable fashion. For one writing on the period, the information here is invaluable, and mine is a keeper.There is a brief discussion of a drawing (found, I think, in a tomb) that seems to show a winged being descending. The image is fragmentary, but the reconstruction is well done and the discussion of what the image seems to show is excellently handled.As I've said (rather ironically) with the other sourcebooks in my research shelves, this is not a page-turner. Not all books should be. This is a book where the reader sits with a pencil and paper (or, perhaps, a laptop), frowns at a page, says 'Hmmmmm...' and takes notes.I recommend it very highly for research purposes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful.","review":"I think this cd is a breath of fresh air.

I am \\"over 50\\" and noticed the standard wrinkles, dry skin and loss of firmness that comes with age. I have tried a lot of face and body creams to minimize the effects, but nothing seemed to help much until I started taking this supplement. Now I am convinced that beauty comes from within based on what you give your body to work with. What you put in your body does more to keep your skin young then what you rub into it. My skin looks better now then it did ten years ago. The elasticity has improved considerably - it seems more firm, softer and more hydrated with fewer fine lines. Don't waste money on expensive skin cream, this is so much more effective. I will keep taking this supplement forever!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Resource","review":"This is a great book, with beautiful illustrations (way better than photographs), and just about all the data one would need to go birding in Nepal.

They were seductive enough to draw me away from Hannibal's dinner plans; the execution of the quartests by Florilegium is a nearly flawless balance of the lightness necessary to the quartets that Telemann seemed to have understood would make them popular and the musically weighty delivery that gives them punch. The organization of the cd, alternating between the quartets and solo fantasies for the violin, flute, and harpsichord individually works wonderfully well. This cd bears playing many times."},{"rating":"2","title":"His First Legos!","review":"I know that there is a relatively brief period of time that these Lego Quatro blocks will be useful before my son discovers the smaller, sturdier Duplos, but I just couldn't wait to introduce him to the building blocks that captivated me as a child.At just 9 months old, my son is too young for the Duplo series. That's where these extra large Quatro blocks come in perfectly. They are larger and softer than their toddler-appropriate counterparts, but they are every bit as much fun, even if they're only being used as teething aides or noisemakers! As other reviewers have stated, the blocks don't stay together as securely as the Duplos would, but I find that to be beneficial while my son is learning how to put them together and take them apart. It also makes the inevitable collapses of my Lego towers that much more spectacular when my son knocks them down!Even if they are only \\"useful\\" for a few months, it is well worth it for our family to be able to play with Legos together."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great toy, still played with years later","review":"I bought 2 sets of these about 7 yrs ago when my youngest grandchild was about 10 months old, and coming for her first visit.

Not in agreement with other reviewers, i think on thisassociation as very fortunate, not only for those Tchaikovsky recordings,but for Mahler and many other composers. This 2nd symphony is one of thehighlights in Abbado's very good cycle with this orchestra. Very wellplayed, perfectly judged in tempi, balance and dynamics and a very goodsound quality. This was the first version i got of this symphony and formy taste is still the first choice when i want lo listen it. Perhaps not\\"odorously russian\\" as Svetlanov or bombastic as Muti, but you'll alwaysfind everything in the correct place.

La sinfonia N2 es bellisima y Abbado logra entregarnos una magnifica version, el punto de conflicto y lo he comentado es la fuerza y brillantes de la Orquesta de Chicago que no alcanza el nivel del director italiano. Por ello que la sinfonia suena un poco mas fria u oscura, y el sonido es mas apagado. La interpretacion se apega a el esquema clasico de la sinfonia con momentos sublimes y sensibles, y otros mas luminosos y alegres.Para la Tempestad un aumento de puntaje, quizas la forma de afrentar el poema sinfonico sea el motivo que en comparacion este por sobre el nivel de la sinfonia.Claudio Abbado excelente, la orquesta un poco debil, para la sinfonia Igor Markevitch es soberbio."},{"rating":"1","title":"the two stars are a stretch...","review":"My love of romance novels began with bodice rippers so although popular tastes have changed I always allow for \\"that certain style of writing\\" particular to romances written in the late 70s, early 80s.

Everyone says it's \\"gentle\\" and \\"non greasy\\" and \\"non irritating\\", etc. All true. BUT if doesn't even come close to removing my mascara....doesn't even make it smudge. Of course, I use an awesome waterproof mascara (tarte) that won't come off while swimming. So I was looking for a remover that could tackle that job - and this one couldn't. I do agree that it's gentle, non irritating, etc. And it's probably great at taking off eyeshadow (if you wear it)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the style of remover I prefer","review":"I ordered this online and had never tried it before. In the past I had tried (and liked) oil-free eye make-up removers, eye make-up remover pads, and oil-based eye make-up removers. I was in the market for something oil-free when I found this.This remover is almost like gel. When I would put it on a cotton ball it would mush around the surface of the cotton and slather across my eye. It was very difficult to remove and left a weird film over my eyelids. I had to follow up with a hot wash cloth every time I used this. I finally gave up and gave it to a friend, and went back to my oil-free solution from the drug store."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well for removing smears","review":"I see that another reviewer mentions that this will not take off waterproof mascara, that is true. Generally this gentle formula does not take off heavy duty make ups. However, I find it is excellent for removing smears, raccoon eye, and make up residue. I use it every morning under my eyes before applying lotion and eye makeup. I also put a little bit on a q-tip to help even out eyeliner. It has kind of an oily feeling, and is a little viscous, but leaves no residue on skin, and leaves skin feeling silky and moisturized. I would recommend this product if you looking for a gentle, natural make up remover. However, there are certainly stronger products out there if you need to remove some serious makeup."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother...","review":"I like Sybex's idea of giving the reader 1,000 pages of info for under [price].

Indeed that is what comes over in this documentary.Unfortunately when the documentary is closely examined it is not objective. For example Robinson conducts an irrelevant Grail chase and he ridicules Dan Brown's claim that all the art, architecture and secret societies in his book are real. However, Robinson does not prove that any of these are false. It is true that he challenges their significance but that is not the same as proving that Brown was wrong in identifying them.This documentary lacks the balance that is necessary to make it credible and my impression is that it follows a preconceived notion to present the book as a hoax.

Also, they are aware that under Windows XP, the card is unable to wake up after standby/hibernation. This is what I experienced with my Thinkpad laptop. So the card installs OK and operates correctly....but the moment the laptop goes into standby the card will turn off, and then when the rest of the laptop wakes up the card will not. I have to reboot to wake it up. The kind telephone representative I spoke with was hopeful about a driver fix soon.

Dial up works better. Its suppose to give you 54Mbps, but the highest I get is 36Mbps from my 108Mbps router. I have tried the tech support, but it was futile. I was hanged up upon twice, and really got nowhere from them. They only have 1 driver for this card that is almost 2 years old. They finally said sent it back to us at your expense, and we will send you a refurbished one. That is horrible. I tossed the card in garbage can.

This is a piece of garbage. I am on WinXP and the connection drops in and out. Constantly. My Linksys card worked flawlessly for over a year and a half. Also, if you have 2.4 Ghz phones in your house, this card is very susceptable to the interferance from it, so try not to keep the phone near the card if possible, but even this will not help much. This card is still not XP certified after being out for months, meaning either the company is to lazy/cheap to get it certified or it failed certification testing due to drives issues and overall poor quality. Tech support is also laughable. If you look at other online reviews, you will see that the card works great on some computers but will crash others, so its a toss up.

While Mr. Greenwood is a master of describing the intricacies of spell battles, his skills at characters development and human interaction are tragically underdeveloped. One gets the impression that every heroic character in his works has the same sophomoric, sarcastic sense of humor; the same selfless devotion to good causes (usually without any motivation); and the same overly sexualized past (read his books and you'll see what I mean) without any real follow-through in the present-day. The villains are even worse. I had to force myself to finish this book (nee trilogy) because I paid good money for it and I wouldn't be able to live with myself if I didn't.

This DVD set is by no means \\"remastered, restored and uncut\\". I sent two emails to Genius Products and have not received any reply. With just a little more effort and a knowledgeable \\"Our Gang\\" consultant this could have been one of Genius Products' finest and best-selling DVD sets. Shame on them. I am returning this falsely advertised and poorly made product. Cabin Fever did a much better job for RHI in the 1990's.

No effort was put into digitally re-mastering and transfering the picture and sound. I could have done just as good of a job transfering these clips using just a VCR and a DVR.

The God under the musicians is back.","review":"In comparative to Growing Up Live, this is not all filmed in one show, but instead over several shows. The tracks focus on ratter the pre-up stuff, so several oldies. Garbriel played with different sets during the 2 years of touring for his album 'Up'. As in the First US leg he played alot more older songs, in the last part of his tour. So you should see it as a nice add on to the Growing Up DVD. On that DVD there were mainly UP songs, on this one you find the o0ld things. The songs I hoped he would play a few of in 2003 when I saw him, but unfortunatly not. That doesn't mean his show was not brilliant, cos it was. In my eyes everything he does is woth ten times in gold. As we are used to with Gabriel, performances, sound and picture are all top notch.

I felt like I was in there, right in the middle of the killings, and then seeing how we uncover a huge net of corruption and lies.Athi�� proves that to make movies with a different ''feeling'' you just have to feel like doing them. Regardless of the budget. Where there's a will, there's a way..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and Predictable","review":"I find this movie a big disappointment, esp. after seeing Lumi in \\"Like Water for Chocolate\\", I thought this would be a good one too. I've seen dozens of Spanish-speaking movies and were quite impressed with most of them so far. I've enjoyed \\"All About My Mother\\", \\"Open Your Eyes - Obre Los Ojos\\", \\"Like Water for Chocolate\\", \\"Jamon Jamon\\", \\"Y Tu Mama Tambien\\", \\"Nine Queen\\" and a few others.However, I find this movie to be quite boring and predictable in the plot. I correctly guessed the person behind the murder in the early part of the movie. Then I have to endure all the stupid story to confirm my prediction. There are no profound messages that audience can learn. Overall, I've wasted about 1 hr 45 min on a boring movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome First Movie","review":"\\"For Catherine\\" brings humor and sentiment to the TV screen in a poetic waltz. This first production by 207 pictures develops the theme of the romantic comedy through the backdoor via a sensitive, witty young man eperiencing his first true love.

My 2-1/2 year old is a big fan of \\"Rolie Polie Olie\\" and was very disappointed in this movie. The animation, for some reason, has lost its computer-generated fluidity and is a jittery headache to watch and the usual slow-paced and charming writing is gone and been replaced with your standard good guy/bad guy conflict and lots of frenetic racing around. Everytime \\"Gloomius Maximus\\" came on, my daughter asked me to fast forward it because he scared her. Eventually, my daughter picked up one of her books and wandered off... Hmm..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Olie to the Rescue !!!!","review":"My kids and i love to watch Playhouse Disney in the morningwere Rolie Polie is pretty much are morning entertainment. Iwas happy to see Rolie Polie put to a full feature presentation.I'm glad to see it was a hit with my kids, they've watched it atleast four times already. I was at first a little worried Itwould take a detour from the family qualities of the morning show, but it did'nt in my opinion. At times Gloomius could seemfrightening but it was done in a light hearted way. When happybubbles come from a gun to make you feel good inside is alrightwith me...! Good Show"},{"rating":"1","title":"Evil in Rolie Polie Olie","review":"Sensitive young children will be scared by this movie. They have introduced an evil character that wants to destroy the world and almost does. It is disappointing that Rolie Polie Olie is not a safe haven for kids. I have watched the TV show with the kids many times and don't recall the sinister plots like those in the movie.The DVD was produced well. Too bad about the movie.The best part is the Stanley cartoon extra feature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painfully frenetic","review":"My two-and-a-half year old loves Rolie Polie Olie, and I have to admit that I enjoy the show too. Unfortunately this DVD is so hyper that it is painful to watch, and even my son seems not to like it that much. We both enjoy the action on the TV episodes, but Great Defender of Fun does not have one single second that is not completely filled with a hundred different things tearing around the screen as fast as they could possibly make them. Moreover, the bits where Pappy's \\"happy gear\\" repeatedly breaks look like someone having a massive heart attack. To sit through this for an hour plus is headache-inducing torture."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"My 5 year old eagerly awaited this video but was very disappointed when he watched it. The villian was \\"too scary\\" for him and it seemed to drag on and on for me as an adult. I don't recall the TV show as ever having villians like that. It was always a light hearted sweet show. Needless to say we won't be viewing this one more than once."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too edgy for my taste as a Mom","review":"My 27 month old loves Rolie Polie Olie, but this feature is a departure from the sweet robots on tv. The villain looks like something Tim Burton (Nightmare Before Christmas) cooked up. There are also frowning characters with baseball bats in their hands floating in space. Plus the action and sound is, just like another reviewer said, frenetic. I wanted to run to the tv and turn it off.If I had screened this video, I would not have purchased it. It's just not what I like for my child. Of course, if you don't mind that sponge on Nickelodeon, this probably won't bother you either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Full Length DVD Movie","review":"Excellent DVD full length movie is based of a popular Children's Story(Turned TV show), about a robot family the \\"Olie\\"s.

We hooked up the laptop and played the DVD for her while on the road and it was a LIFESAVER!! We bought 4 different movies and she wanted THIS one played over and over. It really is a cute movie and I love the Olie family.I love that the characters always remain positive and \\"can-do\\", there isn't any violence (the worst is when Gloomious takes a toy from a child), and it's all about having fun.Now that we are home, I am limiting her to watching it once a day, but TRUST me...she could watch it completely mesmerized over and over and over....I am now on the hunt for more Olie movies!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not in the same spirit as the TV show","review":"My 4.5 year old LOVES Olie, but finds this movie much too scary. It has a dark side that isn't usually part of the up-beat, happy show we see on TV. I've wondered if this movie and the TV episodes were created by different writers, they're so different from each other. If your child is sensitive to gloom and doom you might think twice before getting this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little too busy","review":"A real effort went into this production, to be sure. Perhaps too much. There's just too much going on here to take in - the story is too complicated for Rolie Polie - too many characters. Great Defender lacks the sweet simplicity that makes the episodes so special."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Fun","review":"This movie hits the spot - My 4 year old daughter loves it and wants to play it over and over again - We love the music and the story and are glad that the gang finally made a full length movieThis is quality entertainment!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My daughter loves it!!!!!!!!!","review":"My 4 year old wants to watch \\"The Great Defender of Fun\\" over and over again.

I didn't know much about Wright beyond the usual, general knowledge surrounding his life and major works. But because I lived in Japan for a couple of years, I became curious about his own years in Japan and what this film might make of crosscultural influences.The film was richly textured and extremely informative, far more so than the usual PBS or A&E; documentaries. I didn't realize that Wright worked on so many projects in Japan, or that he had such an enduring impact on Japanese architecture. If you're interested in Wright or architecture, you'll thoroughly enjoy the visual appeal of and informative narrative in this DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"killer nitro engine","review":"THIS ENGINE IS A PURE BEAST IT WILL BLOW THE TIRES OFF WHATEVER RC YOU HAVE BE IT BUGGY, TRUGGY, MONSTER TRUCK THIS ENGINE IS THE BOMB.

Like other movies it tries to make itself in to a cult picture. The writting, acting and direction however fail terribly. For a film with big name actors (Lana Turner, George Chikaris)the acting it awful. It's funny - unintentionally and good for laughs at just how bad it is, but not much more.

It's not the radio version or the MTV version you remember.Update: 2009Speaking with another Amazon member I had run 99LB through Adobe Audition and was not able to clean the track up, so warning audiophiles, it's hopeless you can't edit out what the album producer did.

All the songs there kept my interest, even though my German is not really all that strong. The great music was enough for me.

Unfortunately, the best song on the CD (99 Red Balloons) is the Club Mix version, and not as good as the original. (I am still looking for the original english version on CD). The German '99 Luftballons' is the original - albeit in German. 'Just a Dream' is probably the second best song on the CD, and many of the songs have a wonderful, combined punchy, dreamy, floating quality to them. I would highly recommend this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have read the other reviews","review":"I got this for the English version of 99 Red Balloons.

It is new agish, and aimed at people who are frankly neurotic. For instance, part of the program emphasizes sponge downs and friction rubs. Some of the suggestions are outright dangerous; for instance, enemas, and meals high in nuts and seeds. If you have an acute flair, by day 3 you should be eating ALL FRESH FRUIT.The instructions on how to have a bowel movement that someone mentioned is there.

It takes a lot of skill to get this down and it is a core component of being able to master the game. I assumed that Strawberry Shortcake would be for young kids but was sadly mistaken. I think this game misses the mark in all categories. Young kids can't master the technique of the game and older kids will find the concept babyish. A game that you can't progress in, is not a fun game to play.My daughter loves all the Mario games and loves the Carnival Games.

I had to look at the front so many times to figure out who the people actually were.2) The characters are long out of steam. Nothing of interest happens.3) There is absolutely no conflict. In a time of apostasy - no one apostasizes in the family. In a time of death to many of the Saints - no one dies in the family.Aside from that, I can't imagine everyone being so sticky sweet to each other. They must have had their arguments, faults, weaknesses, complaints, etc. just like everyone else. Yet, the Steeds seem to be beyond that. Further, anyone who was even remotely faithful was placed in to leadership positions in the church. Yet none of the Steeds were ever put into truly important postitions. It was all too predictable. The first 4 in the series were worth reading - past that it was like Lund despaired - \\"How will I ever get this to end?\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Work and Glory","review":"I have enjoyed all of the volumes in the Work and Glory series.

This 3-pack game case holds three Game Boy Advance games into one convient compartment.

(You have to buy TWO CDs to know where the words and phrases are.) Also, there isn't a choice of high, medium, or low voice accompaniment (though there is a lot of space on the CD) and the tunes sound pretty synthetic/pathetic.It was MY fault for buying this CD and trusting that it was like the very satisfactory tapes we buy.If you want schmaltz background - go buy muzak.

There are few references to Hadiths that may not necessarily be sahih or reliable but considering that they are muslim sources, author seems to take them as they are.

It is very much like a sequel to \\"The Wall,\\" but it isn't. It is a drifting, sweeping, nightmare vision all rendered in spurts of Eric Clapton's guitarwork. Spacey keyboard pads underscore all the songs, but Clapton is, musically, the clear-cut star of the album. Very worthy. Some minor quibbles: Waters shifts between sotto voce and screaming, which becomes a little grating after a while, especially on songs like \\"Go Fishing.\\" On the other hand, the use of melodies from \\"The Wall\\" that pop up on occasion are, far from a cheap pull from past greatness, add to the album's sense of continuity. (Examples would be the piano melody on \\"Go Fishing,\\" taken from the first sequence of \\"One of My Turns,\\" as well as the glaring guitar riff at the end of \\"Dunroamin, Duncarin, Dunlivin\\" taken from \\"In the Flesh\\")."},{"rating":"1","title":"3-In-One Review","review":"A REVIEW OF:THE PROS AND CONS OF HITCHHIKINGRADIO K.A.O.S.AMUSED TO DEATHby Roger WatersThese three solo albums are important simply because they are the first, second, and third worst albums ever recorded. It doesn't matter what order, they are all interchangable. Roger Waters has shown us what horrible, unlistenable, pretentious garbage this medium called \\"music\\" can be turned into. Truly, these are landmark recordings."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is only for fans","review":"This album is an unlistenable mess. I do like it, but I am a fan and would find anything by Roger of interest (even if it is only passing interest). It has moments of brilliance, but for the most part it is just god-awful. Misogynistic, navel-gazing, spiteful, and yet -- there is a real revelation of the value of relationships, and those moments when you see your \\"self in every stranger's eyes\\". Eric Clapton and David Sanborn have moments of brilliance, but overall, some of the worst music I've ever heard, with Roger basically speaking the album. A curiosity piece for fans only."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very dull...","review":"Warning: this album has little or no melody! The only good song is \\"Every strangers eyes\\", and Rogers voice is totally neurotic throughout. Songs such as \\"Sexual revolution\\" and \\"The pros and cons of hitchhiking\\" are no classics - they're just below par rock filler. \\"Go fishing\\" is ok, but thats generous! I don't want to slag off an album by one of my favourite artists but I can't listen to this record. Thats why I can't understand all these 5 star reviews. The first 4 tracks on this album are totally unmemorable, and the overall 'feel' of the record seems creepy and cold. Roger failed at his first attempt at going solo; \\"Radio Kaos\\" and \\"Amused to Death\\" are great though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Holy sh*t","review":"This album rocks! More fastpaced and rockin than any other Roger Waters album...mabybe more than any Pink Floyd album for that matter. (is it Eric?) As usual, people will criticize this for too much lyrics...but Roger just has so much to say, and he does it so well. I love concept albums, and Roger does it better than anyone. That being said, you wont find maybe any singles...this is a piece that must be played start to finish...to fully enjoy, to be moved by, and to be entranced in. Dont know why, but I felt like taking one star off. Nothing is perfect...though this is close."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painfully Tuneless","review":"It's not whether or not you \\"get\\" Roger Waters, it's the fact that, aside from the title track, Every Stranger's Eyes, and Sexualy Revolution, this is an utterly tuneless album that even Eric Clapton can't save. It's a good thing that Gilmour and co. chose to do the Wall instead of spending time on this lame excuse of a CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Cons of of an over inflated ego","review":"This album was one of the greatest disappointments for me ever as a rock fan. Pink Floyd was my favorite group when this came out--and landed with a huge thud. There is simply not a single decent song, melody or interesting lyric on the whole album. The album allegedly tells the tales of some hippies who moved to the countryside. Excuse me, but this was in 1984, who cared about hippies anymore? Eric Clapton must have been short on cash the week he agreed to apprear on this farce. Stay away, far away, from this total musical mistake."},{"rating":"2","title":"terrific","review":"this album is one of the most melodious albums of dave gilmour.in it he has exemplified the perfect combination of rock and emotions."},{"rating":"1","title":"craptastic","review":"The first of 3 post pink floyd albums. Of all of them, this has to be the crappiest. I guess since he knew it wouldn't sell well because he couldn't put Pink Floyd on the cover, he put a half naked chick on the cover. Nice. Roger must have had something on Eric Clapton to make him play on this album. Even with him on this album, it still sucked. I have to say his other albums were at least decent this is just not worth listening to."},{"rating":"1","title":"A truly weak album","review":"Well, after listening to this album, now I know where Marylin Manson got his inspiration for the insipid \\"Antichrist Superstar\\". Waters has got to be the lamest, dumbest, most rediculous excuse for a \\"cult icon\\" ever. At times, I almost pity Rog. It's so easy to see that he's pretty much just an average joe blessed with exceptionally mediocre intelligence and little natural musical talent.The only reason to listen to this album is for the lyrics, as there is no musical substance to be found. And if all you want is to have lyrics recited to you, why not just get some good poetry on tape? .Seriously, Waters should just write a book filled with all of his \\"insights\\" and just get it out of his system.Don't even think about listening to waters other solo albums either, they're just as popouse and senseless as this on. All in all, the only solo Floyd matrial worth checking out is Syd Barrett's first solo album, \\"The Madcap Laughs\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"CONCEPTUAL BRILLIANCE","review":"The first time you listen to this album, you can't help but think what could have been. The second time you give it an ear, you realize it couldn't be any better. Roger Waters has taken the male psyche (fear of lost love) and turned it into a rock opera. His use of strings and guitars are incredible, and it still sounds great today. Clapton's guitar work is so breathtaking, sometimes tears form in my eyes. The lyrics are brilliant, and the fact that the last track is the softest and shortest while quite possibly the best is unheard of. \\"I had a little bit of luck you were awake I couldn't take another moment alone.\\" It makes you want to grab your loved one and tell her how much you love her. One of the greats."},{"rating":"2","title":"his best solo effort!","review":"my fav out of his 3.radio kaos is great pop. amused is decent but boring.fav tracks are apparantly they were traveling aboard,running shoes, sexual revolution, and pros and cons.nice album coverthe final cut is slightly better if you consider that a waters solo album. hehe"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Wonderful Album","review":"Roger Waters once again turns his beautiful poetry into great songs. Many people think that you need to have beating drums and a wailing guitar to make it into a great song, but Waters does it with his lyrics. If you're a fan of \\"The Final Cut\\" and \\"Amused to Death\\" you won't be disappointed in this album. This album lets you think and use your imagination to figure out what the story is really about. Claptons plays brillantly on guitar, and the story and the album flow nicely. I'm a big fan of The Final Cut and this album is like that except its a dream instead of a war story. Great album, a must of any Waters fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perhaps the best narrative in rock music","review":"I've been listening to this album since its release in 1984. All I can really say is the storytelling is so fantastic in the album-that one can almost visualize the poor soul through every moment of the epic journey."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Trip","review":"I really like this and I am not a fan of Rogers. Don't expect great songs here, the title track might be the only real song here and its the weakest on the album - but it is a commerical overture that seems to achieve the goal of leading to the close of the album. Clearly meant to be heard start to finish, I like the trip, and music moves well, the sax and Clapton's sparse guitar rifs fill in the beauty of the picture being painted here. Reading the other reviews I realize the story that plays in my head may not be exactly what its supposed to be! Oh well! I like the roadtrip the album takes me on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth a ride","review":"Roger Waters basically made three albums after Pink Floyd broke up, and this is the best of them. It's very much a concept album, and though a couple of the songs are good listens on their own, you can't really \\"get it\\" unless you listen to the whole thing. The lyrics are as clever as any Roger Waters wrote for Pink Floyd, but unlike The Final Cut, there are a lot of humerous touches. The best part of the musical side of the album is an extremely vital performance throughout from Eric Clapton, a big contrast to his solo work at the time, which was buried in overproduction. You're probably looking at this review if you're a recent discoverer of Pink Floyd and wondering what else is worth having. I recommend giving this a shot before buying any of the post 1983 David Gilmour only Pink Floyd releases."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreary, Self-Absorbed, & Unmelodic!","review":"He ruined Floyd to do this???Great band! Great story & concept! Unfortunately the songs are dreary & not catchy! This is self-absorbed mysogyny, and lyrically top-heavy! Melody wise this is paper-thin! The Wall & Final Cut were both dreary, but both had solid songs with good hooks! Rog, it's called collaboration...look into it!PROS: Nice guitar solo on Sexual Revolution from Slowhand, and the brief duet on For the First Time Today Part 2 was a pleasant surprise!CONS: Clapton, Sandborn & the other A-Listers take a backseat to Waters' self-absorbed mysogynistic lyrics. The concept is an interesting one involving dreams, temptation & fidelity (kind of like Doctor Zhivago goes on a cross country trip across Europe). With a little less lyrics, some well written hooks from Clapton, and perhaps just a lttle more lead singing from others and this could have been a classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Poor Solo Debut","review":"Musically monotonous and lyrically overwrought, Waters turns in a disappointing and terribly boring album. Pink Floyd's \\"The Final Cut,\\" which was basically a solo project for Waters, stands far above this hodgepodge of sounds and noises. The title track shines bright, but the rest of the album ranks well below even the weakest Floyd album. You will not want to listen to it twice!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Roger and Eric are incredible!","review":"This solo effort by Roger Waters is more like Floyd thanPink Floyd is anymore. In fact this is an album that wasrejected by Pink Floyd for being too personal, not for quality. This is Waters' original Wall concept with some of the sounds comig from songs on the Wall. It is the best Eric Clapton guitar playing since his days with cream, real bluesy and subtly explosive. This album is a look at what Floyd might have been like had Roger stuck around. The people who don't get this album are not real Floyd fans or only like David Gilmor. This album is Roger Waters at his best, personal and honest. The genius behindPink Floyd is Roger Waters andhere he is personal and \\"in the flesh\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Masterpiece!","review":"This first outing by the founder of Pink Floyd is nothing short of a quiet masterpiece. The album works on many levels. Musically is very strong with Clapton leaving his mark. The lyrics by Roger Waters are poetic and written at the height of his writing powers. The fact that he wrote this at the same time as 'The Wall' may have something to do with it. Also, go to ROGER-WATERS.COM (Written in Sept. 2004) and hear two new songs by Roger Waters for FREE. These songs are written after a decade of silence."},{"rating":"1","title":"One word...BORING","review":"I just do not like this album. The music is uninspired, and it seems too dark and bleak (after all, it IS about dreams). The only song I liked on this album was \\"4:41AM (Sexual Revolution)\\", but one song does not an album make. Only true Waters fans (or maybe only hardcore Waters fans) should get this one. I;m a Waters fan, but I do not like this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Bad Career Move For Waters","review":"After a brilliant career with Pink Floyd, The Pros and Cons of Hitchhiking, the first solo album from Roger Waters, is a major let down. With the exception of the song, \\"Every Stranger's Eyes\\", this CD is totally forgettable. Not even Eric Clapton's guitar work can save this. Even the melodies are a rip off. The melody from \\"In The Flesh\\" is present during several of the albums tracks. If you are a Roger Waters fanatic, go ahead. Everyone else steer clear."},{"rating":"1","title":"yeah...this was a good buy","review":"i can't really say i'm a pink floyd fan and after getting this album i'm certainly not a roger waters fan, but this album was just horrible. i noticed that a lot of the other reviews talked about the wall which, in most people's views, was a great album. the idea of the concept album is great and has a place in music and art but where the wall loosely linked the songs together with the concept allowing songs to stand on their own, this piece requires the listener to spend 45 minutes to get the idea that nothing's being said. maybe i just don't get the deep meaning buried within the pointless tunes, but then why should we have to work hard? the best songs have deep meaning and are good to listen to. anyone can throw another brick in the wall part 2 in the cd player after a day dealing with society and enjoy that song without having to listen to both disks just to get an idea of what's going on. DON'T BUY THIS CD!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Pros are definately outweighed by the Cons!","review":"Reading the reviews of this album I find people say you have to listen to the lyrics to appreciate this album. Trouble is Roger whispers or moans for most of the album and I can't understand what the heck he is singing about.I tried a few times to give this album a listen but gave up. Even Eric Claptons beautiful guitar does not save this album. also Eric declined playing The Pros And Cons live probably because he discovered how impossible Roger is to work with.Roger strength is definately writing intelligent even poetic lyrics - the trouble is whats the point of listening to the lyrics if the music is weak and Roger insists on whispering, moaning or screaming the lyrics at you.Buy only if you are a die hard Roger Waters fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"compatible???","review":"So how in the world do I tell if it'll be compatible?

My grandson can't build things yet, but he likes putting them in the container and taking them out, and, of course, knocking down whatever has been built. Recommend this toy highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect First Blocks","review":"I think these giant Legos are perfect first blocks for a baby. We got them for my daughter soon after she turned 1, and she loves them. Of course, for her to actually connect the blocks is sort of hit and miss, but she loves taking them out of the bucket, putting them into the bucket, and taking apart anything her mommy or daddy build. She also likes picking out which blocks to hand to me, which I then use on whatever I am building. We always refer to the color of the blocks, and whether they are big or small or long. They are a great learning tool, and the perfect size for her tiny hands to pick up. My only reason for the 4 rating is because the blocks don't stay connected very well, although I'm sure that is intentional so little kids can easily take them apart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip Quatro, go straight for the Duplo","review":"My daughter has had these for a year now (she is now 2), and doesn't play with them. They are almost too big for little hands. I have difficulties getting them to stay together (too loose!) and the lid is concave.

I wish I had save the twenty dollars and bought Duplos in the first place."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful toy","review":"We purchased these Legos for my daughter when she was one.

And I love seeing the two of them interact-- but I don't want to go into the bedroom.I'd always thought that westerns were \\"men's books.\\" Most impressive for me about Brandvold stories and characters-- outside the sirloin studio-- is that they appeal to women as well as to men. ONCE MORE WITH A .44 falls a mite short in its appeal. First, because of the descriptive [love scenes]; second, because the [love scenes] interferes with the storyline. I think that shoot-out on the train is one heck of a scene, and Ben is all hero. It's his nature. Leon's arrival tweaks the dynamics of plot and character. I'd like to see more. Read more. But right now I'm heading into DAKOTA KILL....

First, a Regency novel by definition takes place during Prince George's Regency. In this novel, George is already King George IV.

Third, titles like that of Lady Larkspur's father pass from the peer to his next male relation. Lark hopes that one of her four sisters will have a son, as she says that boy will inherit her father's title. That is simply not how it was done, ever.

The archival material was superb as well as some of the newer performances he did for this video.Watching him perform, it seems so effortless. I loved hearing the stories about him and his father taking guitar lessons together when he showed interest in the instrument.Bream appears so down to earth and approachable. There was a funny moment when Bream introduced himself to Stravinsky while the composer was clearly there to hear one of his own performances. He took out his lute and continued to play one movement of a piece in front of him.

This cleanse does nothing for me--at all! Yes, I am drinking a lot of water and eating healthy, but still nothing. The only redeeming factor is the free Cleanse More pills they include in the package.

Here I have to add that I only eat raw food, and I am never normally constipated. The constipation was actually caused by the cleanse. There was no changes in elimination besides that, so I felt I was worse off than before I did the cleanse.My husband also tried it, with no effect, until he decided to open the capsules and put the powder directly into water.

The major problem has usually been an almost Wagnerian approach to the singing (even in the choruses), and an orchestra that was both too large and too modern for the task.Here, at last, we have a version that uses period instruments tastefully, and yet with all the vigour we might have experienced when Handel supervised the first performance in Dublin. Perhaps the ornamentation is a little safe at times (oh for some really adventurous repeats!), but there's a lot to like about this performance, not least the phrasing and highly musical sense of line, and evocation of the lyric context (certainly the most emotional aspect of the work, when performed well).If you have yet to hear as Handel intended, then this CD is highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"As good as it gets! First rate performance for the price.","review":"This 'Messiah' by Georg Friedrich Haendel done by a 'continental ensemble rather than an English team is every bit as good, and maybe just a bit better than some of the Anglo efforts by Sir Colin Davis and others.Compared to other Handel oratorios, this work is not only the home of the glorious Hallaleujh chorus. From front to back, virtually the entire work has superior choral arrangements, and Handel's choral works are easily his strongest suit.And, the work is recorded by harmonia mundi, which seems to have a talent for superior recordings of sacred works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Has its good points","review":"I like all kinds of Messiahs, from the big and bombastic performances which were popular for over 150 years to the fine and nuanced \\"authentic\\" approaches that regained popularity in the last 50 years. Christie's orchestra is very fine and precise. The soloists are excellent but there's one problem. Countertenors did not exist in the 18th century. It is a poor imitation of the castrato voice. So why use the limited dynamic range of the falsetto voice? Since Castrati are no longer an option why not just do what conductors have been doing for 200 years and use a female alto. It may not be \\"authentic\\" but then neither are countertenors. The great Norma Proctor may be gone but I'll take any good contralto or mezzo over a guy singing falsetto."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not in correct KEY!","review":"It's difficult to know whether the entire ensemble transposed this classic work of Handel but it seems unlikely.

The slot machine is too mindless to be very entertaining, and blackjack is only a little better. Bubblet is very cool -- FreeCell fans should like this one, and maybe other people too.

I am glad I didn't pay the full price. The game is actually fun when the it is letting you do what you want to do. When trying to lock on you have to be close to your opponent (Fireballs auto lock for the most part). This wouldn't be so bad if the combat field were less chaotic. That leads to another problem. No radar, just an arrow. from a distance it is difficult to tell who is an enemy dragon and who is a friendly. Cut scenes unnecessarily interrupt the gameplay and then throw you right back into the fray with no warning.

I didn't even go past the fourth mission because I was so frustrated with the controls. Lair makes you draw your attention from the actual game because you are trying to figure out the game controls. It's too sensitive, and when you try to do something it makes you do something else. I was REALLY frustrated!! Not a recommended buy. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!However, the best part of the game (and I really mean it!) is the music. This game has had one of the most epic, and glorious music scored for a video game.

If you spend the time to get use the controller and controls you'll find that you'll get the hang of it and do quite well. Sure things could be a bit more responsive at times but the same gripes can be said of regular controllers on other games. Come on, how many times have you had a fit of anger with regular controllers during games such as Lost Planet or Resident Evil? Come on! I wanted you to fire to the right! Jesus!!

The graphics are terrible, it's like I was playing a PS1 game all over again. The plot is also pretty bad. The flying controls aren't too bad though they are a bit unweildy at times, trying to actually find an enemy with the crappy taergeting system is very frustrating.

The SIXAXIS controller required to maneuver the dragon was difficult and not very responsive. Ground control was counter-intuitive too.The graphics at first glance looked impressive, especially on the intros. But a closer look showed a lot of repetitive rendering--something one wouldn't expect to see game designed exclusively for a top-of-the-line console like the PS3.Gameplay was linear with long intros you are forced to sit through each time you wanted to start a level/chapter with no way to skip. Story line was unoriginal and mediocre.I had great expectations for this game...few were met."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than reported","review":"The big complaint in regards to this game is the motion sixaxis controls. I thought these worked well after the patch was done. There were still problems trying to reverse dragons direction but overall I though the motion was good. Graphics were good and the missions were quite varied. Some extremely good cutscenes and I generally am not a big fan of cutscenes especially long, corny ones like in MGS4. This game is worth the money and is quite fun overall. There is one mission that is extremely frustrating that almost ruined it for me. Its in the middle where you have to find the path to the boss. The boss on this level is poorly done and there are flaws in regards to the controls to kill it. Game could have been really good with a coop option.

To my suprise the results are reversed. That being said I must say that this game is not as bad as some of the reviews that were left. Honestly the game's concept is very cool, there were just few things that really got on my nerves. First, the dialog in the game is very very corney almost intended for a young player which was wierd after seeing the trailer for it and percieved it as a very intense adult targeted game. The next thing is that it is fairly slow paced. The dragon does not have the ability to turn on a dime, and flys relatively slow.ProsGreat GraphicsGreat Sound (dispite the dialoge)Very unique controlsGround Breaking conceptConsCheesy DialogA little boring if not in a tightly enclosed battle areaWould have been better with a Mature ratingRent this one......"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"Was hoping for a revolutionary game, but it turns out the controls were to convoluted and confusing to really work well and create a fun game. They should have allowed for traditional controls, but rather instead force you to use the \\"Six Axis\\" controls. It seems many of the reviews of the game coming out are pretty accurate in this respect. I was hoping that the developers would take extra time to fix these issues as they did delay the game; but it seems they didn't have enough time to address these issues. This game could have been great, but is ultimately held back by the restrictive and confusing control scheme.

They are excellent quality and have been washed so many time that It scares me now to think that they would still be presentable after all this time. Besides being serviceable for so long I like the fact that they are longer than most other T shirts and so they still fully cover my large 'belly'. They are generously cut and haven't shrunk much ---maybe just a tad---over all this time (or maybe the truth is that I'm growing into them more than they are shrinking?

And now the common reader has the same opportunity! On the whole the book captures my great grandfather perfectly - but there are a few omissions. If the anecdotes my parents' entertained their eleven children with are true, Thomas Condon spent more time with women than involved in women's suffrage; more time in prison than involved in prison reform.

Doctorow comes to talk about his novel 'Waterworks'. It is set in nineteenth century New York. Rose mentions that Doctorow's novels set in different times and places in the history of the City seem to constitute a special kind of history of it. Doctorow who appears very staid and calm says that this did not happen intentionally. He speaks about his own artistic process in which the artist follows and shapes what emerges, not what is strictly planned. Doctorow appears somehow more sombre than I had imagined him. Rose asks him questions which not always relaly connect with his intention and direction in thought. It turns out he was named after Poe, and that Poe has had a shaping hand in this fiction. Doctorow suprises by not having brilliance or hunger as part of his personality. This is a pleasant segment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work with Visio 4.0","review":"I was very disappointed in this product because I was unable to install it.

The characters aren't very likeable in my opinion in any of the books, frankly, they are all way too self centered and just annoying.

Jacqueline Wilson ccleverly tackles an issue that many girls suffer from in the world today- anorexia. She cleverly brings in the fact that the problem can be brought on by your friends being more popular or pretty than you, as Ellie finds. At least you know Ellie won't die.

Since a lot of detail and thought were put into the previous books in the series, this is not right for an author to do. It seems as if Blue and Liz genuinely liked each other all throughout the series and then their romance was rushed so that the series could end with Sal and Liz together. That would have taken much more time to develop; she would not have realistically suddenly realized that Sal was too amazing to pass up. Blue was a great guy too. I'm a little surprised at the author for doing such a rushed, messy job at ending the series. The same thing happened with the Sweet Valley Twins series. The general quality of work went down at the end as she scrambled to make all ends meet in a mere couple of books. Shame on Francine Pascal.

The plot is a melding of folksongs and ballads: A young wife is stolen to be nursemaid to the child of the evil king of elfland, leaving behind a beloved husband and newborn baby. Nora hates her situation but she pities the elf-queen and her weak child and gives him all the love she yearns to give her lost baby. This selflessness is rewarded when her foster child learns human love in spite of his father. This love will save both of them from the elf-king's cruelty. Unfortunately for most readers the language *is* lyrical, owing more in its rhythms and word-choices to old ballads than to modern prose. The characters are archetypes rather than individuals: A Dark Horn Blowing is driven by setting, mood and plot rather than by an in-depth exploration of character. Fans of the mythopoeic, however, will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure magic... wonderful!","review":"This story is beautiful.

But when they arrive at his home in Italy for their so-called honeymoon, he tries to keep her pregnancy secret from his family, especially his mother, who turns out to be the mother-in-law from hell. Finding out what's really going on behind the walls of the villa kept me turning the pages of this book.

I thought it would be nice to use from my electric scooter and it would fit well in my scooter basket. It fits ok, but does not have much reach. I have to be quite close to an item in order to pick it up. My longer, folding reacher works better. Second, the tips do not hold anything as well as the rubber suction tips on other reachers. Many things slip out of the grip of the plastic tips and it frustrates me to no end. For now, I use this reacher to get things out of the back of the dryer in the laundryroom. Would not buy again."},{"rating":"1","title":"worthless","review":"Won't close up tight enough to grasp anything.

I have not found it so. The tips are not as flexible as other grabbers I have. It is very hard to grip some things. I didn't return it because it came in a huge box and I couldn't deal with it. Also, too short, but that is my fault-I did not measure it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Contains LATEX","review":"The description didn't match what was sent.

I discovered this PikStick Pro on your site and wanted to give it a try. The day it arrived I began using it right away. It was easy for me to pick up very small things, such as pen, without any trouble. It is also easy for me to use on objects, such as newspaper, magazine, candle,drink containers, etc... I like how the grabber makes me feel that I have a sure grip on whatever it is I need to pick up. I did like how you can turn the locking feature on or off simply with the slide of your thumb. There are times I can hold the grasp tight for the length of time to pick an item up, but if I use the lock my worries are over. I am very satisfied with my new reacher and have already bought another for a friend of mine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Walk Videos are the best","review":"I have most of her walk videos and used all of them all the time so it doesn't get boring.

I do enjoy some workouts more than others, and on another site I belong to I saw some negative reviews on this one, but decided to give it a shot. I completely disagree! If you are a Sansone fan (if not still go for it!) But it has two of the old tried and trues, Mary Kay and Carol working along with Leslie. It is a strenght training workout that you will need weights for, and is not hard, but gives you a great feeling that you have built up some strenght and worked some muscles. I love the background which is someone's beautiful house, and the music is upbeat and uplifting. I loved this one!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"where is the walk?","review":"I was very disappointed to discover that this had no walking at all, other than the warm up which really doesn't count.

Off to the office tea basket it goes with all of the other generic teas where someone else who doesn't know what it's supposed to taste like \\"might\\" enjoy it - lol."},{"rating":"1","title":"Taste is too subtle","review":"If Zen exalts nothingness then Darjeeling is Zen-like. It tastes no different than water and the only hint of tea is its very very slight bitterness. Otherwise it is like colored water with caffeine. I even bit into the used tea bag to try to find some sort of aroma and found nothing; just a flavorless, sad sack of leaves. This black tea makes plain green tea taste opulent. If you like black tea, go for Awake. Darjeeling is too zen for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite teas","review":"This is one of my favorite teas. The other is Tazo Awake. The Darjeeling has a great flavor, as strong as you want it. I brew my for a strong cuppa. I highly recommend this for those that don't want a wimpy, weak taste."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Series!","review":"What's not to love about Inspector Morse! He is his own man and is an interesting character study in general. He does crossword puzzles, likes his 'pints', doesn't suffer fools, neither the pedestrian kind nor the fellow police kind. His faithful partner Lewis is always at his side, although there are times when Lewis get's aggravated with him, they nonetheless, have a close relationship and Morse depends on him more than he ever admits.I've seen him age in this wonderful series and was deeply saddened by not only his passing in the final episode of the series, but also his passing in reality! I will always be a fan of both John Thaw and Inpector Morse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must have set!","review":"I purchased this collection a book at a time; If you love to cook and you are tired of the Food Police and the Convenience Revolution, this is the set you need. Out of print, but still extremely relevant. The instructional photos are very, very helpful. I was clueless in the kitchen, when I started collecting these books the first time (they got lost in multiple moves, over the years)The pictures an descriptions will give you confidence in no time at all.

You cannot live without this set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fans of the Forgotten Realms should love this!","review":"This is a great anthology, provided that you not only know about the Forgotten Realms but are also a fan. I personally think that the story about the origins of Guenhwyvar (Drizzt Do'Urden's feline companion) make it worth reading, but there are other great stories that involve popular Realmsian characters like the wizards Elminster and Blackstaff. There are also stories about unknown characters that are very entertaining. Again, if you are not a fan of the Forgotten Realms you might not enjoy this much, but if you are a fan, get it, read it, and enjoy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read for all those intreasted in magic stories","review":"I really liked all the different short stories.

NAU set aside basic standards of ethical research to gain private information that should not have been made public. If Small is so proud of this work she should hold a public press conference where all (not just a select few) of the students she lived around are given a chance to respond to what she did without the defensive censoring and editing of these reactions by her and her university administrators.There is no legitimate scientific reason for publishing this book under a pseudonym, and Cornell University Press's decission to do this seriously damages its reputation.

The author was a bit unethical in not telling the people around her about her real reasons for being there and I thought it was kind of sketchy that a lady her age was living in a dorm full of 18 year olds. I think her data might be biased because even if she did become a student, most actual students wouldn't divulge their inner most thoughts with someone that's not exactly like them. I wouldn't for sure anyhow for fear of getting in trouble or something like that. She seems like a nice enough lady with good intentions however, I'm just not sure she went about this study in the correct way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Things look better when you're there","review":"Shows what an older person in her 50s can get out of the college atmosphere by registering as a real full-time student. This anthropologist learned how younger students behave in the dorms, in the hall discussions, and what they really think of their teachers and of one another. The new (but somewhat older freshman) did not reveal who she really was and went along with the students in what they did or said. Not until the very end does she tell who she is; surprise and understanding are the remarks she heard, but retributions.Quite an open book, like Augustine's Confessions (almost) and Rousseau's of the same title.

I suppose if you've spent 20 years living in a remote village on another continent you might find some of this interesting.\\"Nathan\\" violates professional standards and common decency to discover such shocking things as: students relish independence and like to have fun, foreign students find Americans individualistic and parochial, and college campuses have many different activities.In other words, \\"Nathan\\" (hopefully) wrecked her career to produce a devastatingly useless book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Research based on betrayal has no place in anthropology","review":"My daughter is a sophmore in college, and she loaned me her copy of My Freshman Year. As an anthropologist I was disapointed to see \\"Rebekah Nathan\\" use dishonesty at so many junctures where a straight forward approach would have produced similar or better results. Nathan seemed to believed that these freshmen were so exotic that they would not be honest with her, so then she chose to become the liar and misrepresented herself to them. I hope she leaves anthropology for sociology, where such practices are more accepted, anthropologists have no use for such trickery.

The author failed as an anthropologist to report concise and accurate data, as she did few consistant studies and never reported as an unbiased individual. Since she was a professor, she looked at college from a professor's eyes, not that of a students. Therefore, this work is not in any means insightful as to the real college experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why not just install spy cameras in the dorms?","review":"Rebekah Nathan must be really disappointed that the US Congress only passed a six month extension of the Patriot Act instead of making it permanent legislation.

We all thought \\"Nathan\\" was a bit odd, so the book had to be funny. I was reading and laughing too until I found parts of my own life here. True, it wasn't anything I am ashamed of, but this is my life and I never told her she could have it. It made me feel dirty, like the time when I caught my mom going through my room and looking at my diary. Why is it OK for her to so secretly enter the dorms, showers, bathrooms, classroom and insert herself in our lives and conversations without warning us to protect ourselves?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A dry read that offers no real insight to real students","review":"Considering that this book could have been fascinating, it is disappointing that the author merely produced a fairly dull analysis of the most superficial aspects of the student experience. At no point did the author manage to really get close to the true student experience, nor is she closer to understanding the inner lives of students by the end of the book. Her conclusions about students are ultimately one big DUH: it seems students want to appear attractive and fun, they like to talk about sex, drugs, and pop culture, and they prefer easier classes to hard ones. I recommend instead \\"I'm the Teacher, You're the Student\\" by Patrick Allitt for a more interesting and straightforward read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clueless","review":"I'm around the author's age (50) and I actually went back to college to study, not to spy on people.

One of the nubs is missing. Still holds together alright, but I wouldn't want to shake it around or drop it on non-carpeted floor or anything. It came like this. Obviously is broke somewhere along the way and wasn't designed like this.Not sure what else to say about push pins.

With chapters about Ed Wood, Jess Franco, Andy Milligan, H.G. Lewis, John Waters and Ted V. Mikels to name a few, this could be a winner. But the quality of the essays are in some cases rather bad. The Ed Wood chapter is just a shortened version of Rudolph Grey's superb book 'Nightmare of Ecstacy', including quotes from interviews from 'Nightmare...'. The chapters about Franco and Milligan for example is just reviews of some films the author has seen. But some chapters have interviews like the ones about H.G. Lewis and David F.

She meets up with the cowboy Texas Teeth and they have some adventures together herding cattle before eventually falling in love.Although the illustrations are colorful, they verge on amateurishness.

Each of our previous copies has held up remarkably well considering how well-loved they were, but as with all books with moving pieces, eventually you need to reinvest. My son, now five, adored this. The page that introduces you to the 26 mice in Mr. Brice's house was a perennial favorite for him and taught him phonics as well as being just plain fun. Your child will get exposure to opposites, reasoning and problem solving, and to many other great skills, all while having a blast with this book. Well worth the investment, even the third time around (in fact, I'm counting on it keeping my two-year-old daughter occupied on a six-hour flight!)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pop Up Mice of Mr. Brice","review":"This book is about the mice in Mr. Brice's home and what they do. It teaches the kids about so many different things like counting, alphabet, measuring, colors, telling time, and so many other things. The age level would probably be around the age of eight at the most that they would learn something, any older they would probably just find the pop ups and pictures amusing. I think the book was excellent for children and I think any child who reads this will enjoy it and learn."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mr. Brice","review":"I had this book for my children and rebought it for my two year old grandson.

It has a volume and many different choices in sound and can be plugged in or used on battery power. My only criticism, is that you can't pack it with the batteries in!

I wanted him to have a constant sound all through the night as when he woke he would be able to go back to sleep. I searched through all the reviews and this one had that feature. Our son loves it and so do we! We don't have to worry about being quite when he is sleeping because this blocks out most sound. We only use the white noise feature for now but maybe when he gets older we will use others. What we also like about this is that its small enough that you can travel with it.

Because of this fatal flaw you hear tiny little \\"defects\\" or imperfections in some of the sounds which it is capable of generating. My favorite is white noise where the defects are especially audible. So, as you're trying to fall asleep your mind will quickly become aware of these defects and \\"anticipate\\" them mentally, causing you to probably \\"time\\" them in your head. An incredibly subtle defect, but it has devastating consequences for falling asleep.This is a common problem with all of these cheaper sound therapy machines. The better ones don't seem to have this problem.Mine is going back to Greal Lakes HHS in Erie, PA, and I'm probably going to buy a Marpac unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your $8 and order the Conair","review":"I ordered this sound machine, along with the Conair one to try out different ones for my babies rooms.

But, there are 11 tracks by mostly \\"No Names\\" that I burned onto a seperate CD years ago that I still enjoy on a regular basis. These artists were jazz musicians from the '50's and '60's that clearly played just for the love of making music. While their talent isn't honed like the big names, it's real, lively and visceral jazz making that still comes across loud and clear decades later. Depending on your taste, you may like some of the harsh blues tunes of certain artists but they weren't for me.

One example is text that is not scaleable. Why would anybody in their right mind want a graphics program where the test does not scale with the graphic? Selecting objects and using layers are both absolutely horrible. The interface is also very not intuitive! Microsoft, please put this foolish excuse for a graphics program out of it's (and our) misery!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting but needs more counterarguments","review":"Darknet uses the stories about individuals and their relationship to media to discuss complex issues such as copyright and fair use. It is a very easy read. It does not get into legal or technical issues directly. It uses these personal stories to illustrate the impact of those issues on a few interesting, unusual people. Reading the book is like being around strangers who all believe the same thing and are reinforcing each others' beliefs. Yes there are truths here, but you know that you are only getting one side of the story. It would be nice to find a book that presents the counter arguments. Amazon would do the world a service by identifying that book and selling it with Darknet as a boxed set. Until then, if you are interested in understanding all sides of the debate over copyright and fair use, I do not recommend Darknet for a stand-alone read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Regretfully unbalanced writing","review":"J. D. Lasica certainly has a large number of friends and family. There is no other explanation for the plethora of 5 star ratings for this biased diatribe. Based on many of the reviews, I was hoping for a thoughtful presentation of both sides of the arguments around some very important issues; fair use, artistic freedom, and consumer rights. Instead he presents the extreme end of one side's position and either mocks or omits completely any rational presentation of the other. Very disappointing.

Your money is better spent elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ultimate, the same old points","review":"This is a well written book that makes a number of points via anecdotal evidence. Unfortunate, it is another in a growing collection of documents that makes no attempt to understand or explain why Hollywood acts the way it does. I wish the author had made at least a slight effort to explore why Hollywood reacted the way it did when he was denied permission to use movie clips for his personal use, or why it is more than problematic that a minister likes to download TV programs from a satellite feed instead of waiting for the broadcast.

You'll get a good grounding in both sides of the issue - something that the book itself does not provide."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book misses the point","review":"This book tells us that consumers are hurt by big media. My friends are artists, and I know that they are hurt by the arguments made in this book. The book encourages file sharing, which I have no problem with in general. But the book does not give artists a say in the matter. That really hurts them. I know it is easy to agree with this book. But that doesn't mean it is right. Artists have rights, too. Some choose to work with big media companies. Some choose to be indie. But that should be their choice. Not the Darknet's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good ideas, presented in an extremely biased manner","review":"Having just read the book and reread these reviews, I am struck by the unarguable fact that the lower-starred reviews actually review the book, while the four and five star entries are advocates expressing their support for the author's position. This is a very frustrating book to read, not because what the author says is wrong, but because it is so unbalanced. The author fixates on the good that may come from 'freeing' content, but completely fails to discuss the 'chilling effect' such actions can have on artists who don't want their work to be freed. The author mocks and demonizes 'big media' without acknowledge that it supports the innovation and creativity of artists and artisans who chose to be a part of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent map of the new media landscape","review":"This is a superb documentation of how people want to use and are in fact using the new digital media technology.I'd strongly recommend it to anyone who is trying to make sense of what's happening in the media industry and society at large.

There is very little structure involved here, and the style does not in any way grab me. The best parts were the Jazz-influenced parts. The middle tracks had great stretches, but in between those stretches are crammed long, unneccessary, totally masturbatory stretches of over-the-top noise.Fifteen or twenty minutes of this album are worth listening to and are, dare I say, intriguing. The problem is wading through the rest of the garbage to find it.Some say this is \\"experimental\\". Experimental is nice if it is something that is both (a) novel and (b) worthwhile.

Philosophers can tend to be teleological in their view of themselves. This is understandable, but can be tiring. The book is average, certainly could be written better, I think there are better books on the subject. Look through his most damning reviews for a good indication of what those books are. He has, perhaps, also written reviews of his own book. He probably isn't the only philosopher to do that.I'm sure that such comments will inevitably trigger another twelve paragraph response of some form. I'm not certain that I'll come back to read it.

Yes, the picture isn't up to the standard we all now expect, and the writing can be extremely complex. But the intelligence level is always high, and John Thaw and his fellow British actors are uniformly first rate. It's a distinctive series in many ways, appealing to the mind far more than the groin and the incessant adolescent clamor for explosions, violence, and bad music. It takes a while, for example, to get used to the main character, a complex man of many sorrows and culture joys who never quite gets his way.There is one selection in this set, however, that is a dud: \\"Deceived By Flight.\\" It is a mess, and the responsibility is the writer's.

It is well acted and sticks fairly closely to the books. The main character is a well educated, very intelligent man with an appreciation of fine music and cross-word puzzles.

A call to customer service was disappointing. Not worth fixing and out of the 90 day warranty, buy a new one. Other than not reading the disc, the display was impossible to read without lifting the unit to a 45degree angle. Emerson could care less about customer satisfaction.

They only play CDs; they know how to work it; they like that it's not heavy. However, it is remarkably unintuitive. The first time we used it, the songs were repeating, and I had to read the directions to figure out how to get it off this setting. The buttons that control the CD player are arranged around the CD area but also on the front of the player. The buttons that control the tape player are next to where the CDs are inserted. A very illogical arrangement and a disappointment. I shouldn't have to study the buttons before I can get my music going.Because this is for the kids, its appearance doesn't bother me, but I'd be disappointed if I bought it for myself. The colors are strong, like something Little Tikes would make, and the shape is pretty big and pretty round.

The way this CD has been musicly put together is amazing. They can move from a true heavy metal riff, straight into backing harmany giutars that would bring a tear to any church organist. Not only does farmer boys have a graet guitar line up, because there vocalist is also a forced to be reckonded with.

The phrase, \\"If you've heard one, you've heard them all\\", comes to mind. Each track changes slightly...way too slightly for me. I also found the voice sounding a little too falsetto and thus very annoying. Maybe this is traditional Icelandic music. I am not an Icelandic music scholar. But I have studied some of Iceland and it's people. From what little I know this music does not seem fit to represent the granduer of the land or the Scandinavian and Irish people who settled there.

He had an injury riddled pro career, so we will never know how good he could have been. One thing is certain, his place as one of the greatest centers in college basketball history is assured.

Since you spend very little time learning the principles of the system, you can begin practicing and building your speed and confidence almost immediately.

Don't even think about puting Win95 (or above) on this thing.

The cpu used in this, the AMD 5x86 133MHz isn't the sharpest knife in the drawer any way. A 486 25 or 33mhz bus speed can't keep up with the cpu. That letz-go guy ahead of me said to get more memory. Now you see, once you buy this cpu and more memory (which is difficult to find and expensive to buy), you'll be spending well over $150 dollars. Now who wants to upgrade something that will still be 3 or 4 years out of date, can't run most modern software, and can't use modern hardware.

It is down to a few threads on the band and I think the only hope for it now is to rip the seams out of the cap, put the band well into the cap, and sew it again.It seems like this should be designed to be worn tightly on the head.

I use it in compost tea, and I use a weak spray when growing seedlings for outdoor planting. When it's time to plant seedlings outdoors, I use it after I've hardened them off and I'm convinced it helps transplant shock.

Only a couple of orchids have bloomed since I started using it and so far I haven't seen an increase in flowers but the roots are large, white and prolific.

Even the music has been replaced, so I've heard (its been years since I saw the original version so I wouldn't have caught that on my own). The Australian feel to it helped make it great. Now they've dubbed over everything with American phrases and names, and have simply cut out a few other things. There is now a DVD of it out in Australia, but it isn't widescreen.

Thanks to a tip from my best friend, RQA-Karen, who resides in Australia, I rented this wonderful film. It has the terrific combination of being both funny AND heart-warming. It shares a unique Australian comedic component, as well as an Australian/American family value component.

Better than that.","review":"There is plenty of good humor, but it is the relationships and compassion and pride that excel in this film. A family that respects each other and is unafraid to show their love and mutual respect and who work at being a family. Caring for the neighbors. A small town lawyer who won't let down his neighbors. Genuineness winning over what is false. Fighting for what is right. There are reviewers who disparage these qualities.

A sure hit for anyone who will give it a try."},{"rating":"2","title":"Viewed a while ago on Australian turf - Very Funny","review":"I saw this movie on regular television while traveling in Australia - It's hilarious. The basic plot is about a family that is being forced to move out of its \\"castle\\" because of an airport's expansion. The entire family, especially the father, is very loving and UNsophisticated bunch. The father has no concept of politics and lawyers - he only knows that he shouldn't be forced to move from his home. The way this basic and likable family takes on the government and big business makes for a great movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Castle - Not for Everyone","review":"I understand why some feel this movie gets high ratings for its parody of modern family relations. The previous reviews provide pretty good details of why they think so. But if you like the types of jokes and humour in the movie, be prepared to hear them again, and again and again......I got tired of the repetition 20 minutes into the show. My Australian relations could see the potential draw for watching such a movie, but were not themselves amused by it. If you're thinking of purchasing this movie, rent it first to make sure you like the humour. If you don't like the humour (and I found it tiresome) , you'll be sorry you bought it. The level of acting and general fiming of the movie is not a reason to make the purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY FROM THIS COMPANY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"DO NOT BUY FROM THIS PERSON!!!

However, this is in direct contrast with the actual philosophical purpose of the government -- the protection of property. In that respect, I believed that the movie fulfilled the goal of projecting a very serious problem.However, while its intended projection might be admirable, the execution of this ideal was shoddy, sloppy and incomplete. From the very poor cinematography (I thought this movie was from the 80's if not for the reference to the full monty) to the laughably terrible jokes (no pun intended), this movie, in essence, mocks that which it aims to defend. The movie was too short, and didnt come through in humor or seriousness.

But in fact it is a journal of the physician who attended Rembrandt's ill- first wife Saskia, and then continued in his relationship with Rembrandt. An ancestor of the author of the book, Dr. Van Loon tells us a great deal about the nitty-gritty of life in the Amsterdam of Rembrandt's time. It also gives a portrait of the artist not only in his overwhelming power but in his pathetic poverty- stricken last days. It is not really and exclusively a biography of Rembrandt, but it is an interesting read of the man and his times."},{"rating":"1","title":"This isn't what it says it is","review":"Instead of the Underdark Adventure Guide, this book is a sourcebook for Morningstar, a fantasy campaign setting.

I've used other Cassell's dictionaries before, so I assumed this would be just as good. Unfortunately the Italian portion of the dictionary gives very little information about pronunciation. The author's lame excuse for this is that Italian is \\"almost phonetic\\" -- which is true, but the \\"almost\\" part of that statement is very important. For singers, it is very important to know what vowel to sing. In Italian, the letters E and O may be pronounced either open (as in the English words \\"get\\" and \\"cotton\\") or closed (roughly as in \\"gate\\" or \\"coat\\"). This is not a trivial difference; what's more, there are no 100% effective \\"rules\\" to tell you which version of the vowel to use in any given case.

Some interesting story lines - I dare you was something fun to watch. Creatively directed but can get a little confusing if you only keep forwading to the sex bits. Stories on cheating, breaking up finding new love in old friends had decent plots with semi-good acting.

Nothing else will fit in the case that is suppose to hold the tube assembly (assembly- to put to gather the parts of something. Webster). The catalog says case that holds both tube assembly and mount/tripod. Who wants to take their telescope apart every time the put it in their case? This is different than taking it off a tripod! This is taking it apart! False advertising! Poor service when called Company. Did not care and hung up on me. Was not the companies' problem and she could not fix it.

I read all the terminator novels, including the spin-offs: Rising Storm, Infiltrator, Future War, Terminator Dreams, Terminator Hunt, and the John Connor Chronicles. I also read the original novels based on the movies. The Sarah Connor Chronicles follows the spin off novels very closely, with a few character name alterations. Catherine Weaver is based on Serena and Elisa. Read the extended novels and you will see what I mean. Great television series, great accuracy, great programming! I am sorry to see it was canceled after 2 seasons. Not enough appreciation. I am sure the negative reviews were uninformed because the novels were not read, nor understood. The Sarah Connor Chronicles is a supplement to the extended novels.

He is able to offer virtuoso compositions of a great variety of musical styles on this disc. Not one to take himself too seriously, (too many great guitar players fall into that mode at some point) Koch plays with fire and a great sense of humor (Albert's Back and has joined a death metal band for revenge, and Blind Lemon Pledge...funny stuff).

Worst of all, it's BORING! Absolutely no insight, bizarre stories, or even particularly in-depth commentary on the asylum itself. I'll sum it up for you--author's life was hard. Author gets a job at the mental hospital even though it's kind of weird. Being a nurse's aide was hard. The author becomes a nurse. Some of the staff aren't very nice to the patients. Some of the patients are incontinent. All in all, it's an okay job but the author finally quits because some of the staff aren't very nice to the patients. The end. Skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Danvers State","review":"I was not impressed with this book.

The only reason that this label started is because the owner's dad has a lot of money to throw around...The only reason people buy this stuff is because they are tricked into thinking this stuff is good...Ghostly pays magazines and newspapers to write good reviews about their work. If a magazine writes a bad review of their work, the money that Ghostly gives them stops coming in...

After I had the unit for about 4 months I started having problems. First the screen would turn itself off even though all the other display lights remained on. Then the volume started to turn itself up randomly. I could deal with those two problems, but then the unit did something very strange. One day I went and moved my car without the faceplate on.

FM band reception is poor. My new unit,replacing the Dual 6820, pulls in many more stations clearly. I bought this unit 4 1/2 years ago; the CD player part just crapped out. For comparison, the stock radio in my 98 Prelude lasted 7 years. The faceplate lights are way too bright, objectionable & dangerously so; I'm 62 not 16. Engineering failed to include a headlights on dimmer here, so I used 3 thickness of paper to block the light. Power is barely adequate to drive the stock 6 speaker setup; my new replacement will rattle the windows, for less money than I paid for the Dual.

She asked if she can have my cassette adapter instead because is sounds clearly better than the aux in on this unit. The iPlug is just a mini to RCA adapter; use your own and get rid of one connection.That was the bad news...the good is the price.

When they tuned this 200W amplifier with EQ settings, what kind of music were they listening to - trumpet solos ? There is no mid-range to provide \\"fullness\\". Its all high and low. The EQ settings are of no value, and the Loudness button is a MUST - without it the tinny sound is laughable. When the volume is low, there is not enough Bass & mid-range. When you turn it up the highs and the bass pound your speakers, and your ears, but still no mid-range.Function-wise it is a great deal and many people may think it sounds \\"fine\\".

But the best part of the movie, I think, is Tom Servo's attachment to his creepy girl. I would encourage those not too familiar with MST3K to start with 'Caper'. It lays the ground work for such gems as 'The Gila Monster' \\"The Day the Earth Froze', 'Attack of the Giant Leeches'; all leading up to their magnum opus 'Manos: the Hands of Fate'. Manos is perhaps the worst movie ever made. Suffice to say, the 'monster' in this film has mishappen knees and is named Torgo. Oh he also has his own theme music. Forget the master; Torgo steals the show! But it's best to start with 'Catalina Caper'. The film has a convoluted plot- I use the word loosely.

April 20, 2001 Page 11F","review":"The work that Of Fire presents on their new album is exceptional, and their artistic expression is consummate. The music follows a tradition of technological influence and somber speculation, hinting at influences like Ministry and The Cure. The theme of the CD comments on the role of technology itself in the archaic struggle between good and evil. Albums of this quality are rare, and music with the attention displayed in this recording are even more infrequent. Collection of Air Molecule Movements will be a good addition to the collections of the somber, introspective fans of The Cure, Ministry, and Mazzy Star. The album exudes rare quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Betsy & Camille A true Account","review":"This book is a true account of what happen in Plaquemine Parish. Janice lived it as did many of us.

I am a general contractor, very good with my hands, and this bike has many elements that are out of spec. The pedals would not thread onto the arms. The guard for the chain is plastic and is all kinds of warped. The paint finish is pretty awful. The directions may as well have been written in some dead language, totally useless.

The box was delivered in pristine condition, so I thought there was no way that the bike was damaged on the inside.However, the handbrake level was disassembled and had loose pieces in the box. I was able to retrieve the pieces and reconstruct the handbrake, but if I hadn't been meticulous, this would have been a missing piece.But worst of all, the fork, which came pre-attached to the frame, was bent/tilted. Again, this could not have been damaged from shipping, there was no sign of damage at all. The fork must have been bent from the factory. Now I have to deal with the headache of returning this bike."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bike arrived damaged and missing parts.","review":"The bike arrived damaged.

There are actually THIRTY (30) pages of instructions in tiny type - plus a couple of extra pages thrown in - presumably because of complaints from the public. My wife and I are both college graduates who are reasonably handy, but we are now four hours into trying to decipher the obtuse instructions and if it were up to me I would just take the bike back to Costco.

Even worse, the instructional and encouraging voice-overs are so much louder than the music that the music disappears into the background. Truthfully, I've used it only 3 times since buying it months ago. On the positive side, the instructions are clear and easy to follow.

While this isn't bad, it also means that if you accidentally leave the power switch on, you'll be on your way to the store for more batteries.

Behe uses everyday language so that the laymen can understand, even when he must be technical in describing complex biological processes. He writes with persuasive power against step-by-step evolutionary dogma, showing that there are just some things evolution cannot account for. It must account for everything to be a true history, and the facts of nature prove that it just can't make the grade. The fierce attacks upon his book by evolutionists proves that it carries power enough to get them \\"riled up\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Old theory, new flawed arguments","review":"I don't want to add anything about Behe's reductionnist science since everything has already been said below, but I just want to ask a simple question: Why doesn't any religious reviewer grant God the intelligence to have created evolution.

It is also not the only eye scheme available. There are a few dozen other plans for eyes being used in the world.

Well, that's not terribly surprising since he's a protein chemist, not an evolutionary biologist. Basically he went and wrote a book outside his own field of expertise without doing his homework. He makes a big point out of how there have been absolutely no papers published about huge areas of biochemical evolution, but he's just wrong (see, e.g., responses at http://www.world-of-dawkins.com/box/behe.htm).And even if one was ready to buy his argument that there was a problem with biochemical evolution, what he's proposing is to admit faith-based reasoning into science.

In science theory is a higher level of understanding then facts, because what theories do is explain the facts by uniting them.

He disguises himself as a scientist and at the first sign of trouble (complexity) he bails out looking for a higher power. He has a good understanding of the biochemical processes that are in place, but fails to mention any research on more primitive organisms that could show us how our complex cells evolved. His argument about irreducibly complex is the biggest crap I ever read. Anything can be considered irreducibly complex in the context of what it does. Take the human body.

Unfortunately, it fails because it does not offer a clear alternative.

For example, he claims that the biochemical evidence on the mammalian clotting system was designed. When was it designed? In what animal? The paleontological evidence shows that mammals have been around for 150+ million years. Was the very first mammal imbued with a clotting system by the designer and then the rest of the mammals (humans included) evolved from that? Or is he proposing something else? Flagella have been around for most the beginning of life on earth; when did the designer do that? Before that, were there bacteria without flagella?

Behe was their key to getting intelligent design and creationism on the table as science in the public school system. Regardless of his motives, he is merely a tool for the misguided who believe that evolution is a threat to their eternal souls.

Is it any wonder we don't find ANY fossilized remains of Homo erectus mixed in with dinosaur fossils??If Mr. Behe is so damn smart, instead of trying to pull a rabbit out of his hat all he has to do to pull a rabbit (or any other modern mammal) out of the Cambrian or Jurassic Period then he would be able to turn Darwinism on its head.

As many of the rabid and emotional comments below reveal, adherence to Darwinism is as much a religious position as a rational one. Many Darwinian fundamentalists go absolutely batty when confronted with data that goes against their orthodoxy. And that data is in this book, big time.That's why the bared fangs are out. The very ground of the Darwinists' being is shaking like L.A. in January of 1994. Cracks and fissures are opening up, and Darwinians are falling through them. No wonder they scream! Behe's calm, thoroughly documented tome has changed the course of the debate about origins forever. Irreducibly complex systems, as the book shows, defy naturalistic explanations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Believe it or not","review":"Mr. Behe seems to have a good point in his hands here. He argues that life at a molecular level is simply too complex not to be designed (read \\"created\\"). Complex organs are \\"irreducibly complex\\" also, but Darwinism argues that such complex structures as the higher organs evolved from simpler single-cell structures. Behe tries to show his reader that are no such \\"simpler structures\\" - so someone must have designed them. Well, I'm a Christian and I'm not certain that God has to be proved scientifically. Even if someone can achieve such a thing, I don't know if other people can learn something from it. The late Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges was right. Good points won't make anyone change his mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rests on a single flawed assumption.","review":"Professor Behe's entire argument rests on the assumption that a biological system whose parts are all necessary in its current configuration must all have been developed simultaneously.This simply is not true. There are clear counterexamples in many lines of vertebrate evolution, in which structures that developed for one function have been adapted to other functions, and even some in which structures that once had an essential function persist even though they can be removed without observable harm to the individual. This is true at both the macro level and at the micro level.Behe proposes an interesting hypothesis in this book, but he does not prove it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Proving faith?","review":"In a nutshell:Faith requires belief. Science requires proof.There has yet to be scientific proof of the existence of a god of some sort. It's not in this book, either.

Though an intelligent writer, Behe clearly doesn't want to understand natural selection. His claims that there are complex molecular structures that cannot be reduced into more primitive forms are hollow. Just like opponents of evolutionary science 100 years ago, he misses the point that there is a gradation of usefulness in the structures of living things. And that structure that are strictly speaking \\"useless\\" at one stage in evolution may become useful in combination with new attributes and environments at a later time. Behe would have the reader believe that living things are either perfect or absolutely impossible, but a little common sense and honest reflection shows that the business of survival never has been, nor will it ever be perfect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Closet Creationist idiocy.","review":"Behe does not realize that analogy is not a method of reasoning. His beliefs are clearly creationist, he just wont admit it. Instead he brings back a two-century old argument from design. His examples are few and stretched. Anyone with a background in molecular biology(or just a college education) would laugh at his evidence based on proteins. Its clearly a religious ploy to try and trick people into turning against one of the best proven theories in science. Dont forget, theory is the highest form of scientific truth! While Evolutionary theory will always be revised and improved, the core concepts will remain intact. Behe is trying to get us to believe that the entire foundation of a well proven theory is nonexistent, based on scant evidence and incorrect logic.

Behe's masterpiece that has launched him to fame!","review":"Behe's main point is that \\"irreducibly complex\\" systems could not have been produced by the minute incremental steps that Darwinian evolution requires. Some examples he gives are the human immune system (my favorite chapter), the blot-clotting system, flagella, systems that package and transfer cellular products, as well as others. He goes on to demonstrate that details on how these systems could have evolved are missing from biological journals even though evolution is supposedly a cornerstone of modern biology. His analogies are easy to understand, yet he still packs the book with plenty of biochemical details. This work has been criticized by an evolutionist on the WEB (try searching on ANTIEVOLUTION), but Behe has easily refuted the claims (oddly enough, his detractor seemed to be in awe of Behe's credentials). After reading this book, I agree with Behe that the first cell could have only been created through Intelligent Design."},{"rating":"1","title":"Obsolete the day it was printed","review":"It's time for this book to be recalled. Judge for yourself. Read Finding Darwin's God. Not only does it show how Behe is wrong, it also shows just how many of those who have written reviews here also have failed to do their homework before making unqualified assertions that are simply wrong. Irreducible complexity is like one of Aristotle's ideas about physics. It's fine in theory, but much different if you start looking at physical examples.

Although some of the arguments were well developed (albeit not original), they could have been easily answered by just accepting that evolution is a blind phenomenon and as such, full of design mistakes, as eloquently illustrated in G.William's \\"Plan and purpose in Nature\\". Behe should have read that before writing his book. He should also have consulted with many other authors who have shown that a complete eye could have evolved more than a thousand times since the oldest fossil bearing a complete eye, without having to resort to a plan.Clearly, Behe was a victim to finalism.It was fun reading it, though and I regularly mention it in my classes to enliven the discussion."},{"rating":"1","title":"An arrogant assessment of the powers of \\"Mother Nature.\\"","review":"The author's argument, presented at length, all boils down to the notion that if Professor Behe can't understand how a complex natural process has taken place, it is \\"irreducibly complex\\" and must have required a supernatural hand. This view runs entirely counter to what every genuine working scientist learns: However pretty one's preconceived hypotheses are, they will not be, should they turn out to be incorrect, as pretty as the process that is actually embedded in the natural world. Professor Behe should not only know better as a scientist, but he should, as a practicing Catholic, confess to the sin of arrogance.

He makes many of Dawkins' arguments appear utterly simplistic.

However, once one uncovers the intellectual misrepresentations, dodges and distortions Behe uses to support his point (best demonstrated by a biochmist whose page is easily found if you search for David Ussery), one can only wonder how this book managed to get published in the first place. Also, hard-core Creationists should read Behe a bit more carefully before embracing him, since he states \\"I find the idea of common descent ... fairly convincing, and have no particular reason to doubt it.\\" As appealing as all this may be to those prone to wishful thinking, Behe's emperor has no clothes."},{"rating":"1","title":"a pseudo-scientific view of creation","review":"Darwins Black Box smacks of New Age pseudo science.

It is valid for scientist to look for answers that do not presuppose God. But to assume an answer as to the reality of evolution being not a theory anymore is not scientific.

She reminds me somewhat of Dar Williams (and maybe a little Rikki Lee Jones), but mostly she's in a class by herself. Great voice, phrasing, playing and writing. I love pretty much every track, but \\"Nightwolves\\" is the one I keep going back to -- it's got a nice, spooky groove that really stands out. And \\"Long Time Coming,\\" I think one of maybe two tunes she didn't write, is gorgeous. Definitely worth checking out."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Terri's VERY BEST!!","review":"This is a fantastic CD. Every song has something new to offer. I especially like Night Wolves. The whole CD is truly exceptional!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tough Going","review":"I was attracted to this book because I am an armchair archaeology buff. I managed to read it,however it was tough going. It is not readably written and is clearly aimed at professionals in the field. It focuses narrowly on the archaeological finds from the Bronze age which are primarily weapons. There is little attempt to flesh out the everyday lives of the people of the time. The author is more concerned with documenting every forth word. He doesn't correlate with any of the recent work in other fields such as linquistics or genetics. I was attracted to the cover picture. He eventually reveals that it is a drinking scene.Unfortunately it is cropped so that the steins are obscured.I was frustrated that he never gives any explanation of the garments depicted. There have been finds of ancient fabrics as attested to by Elizabeth W.Barber and her collegues. Women's work doesn't seem to interest Kristiansen.Unless you need it for your PhD.I suggest you give it a pass."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great pictures, terrible lens cap","review":"I've owned this camera for more than a year and have been very impressed with the pictures I've taken. I have some fine close-ups of eagles and whales, taken shortly after I bought it. My biggest disappointment is that the springs in the lens cap break easily--I've broken two and haven't found one in many months to replace it, or I might have broken more. The shutter is also a little slow to respond, so you have to anticipate action shots (a bit hard when you're whale watching). I'm told this is a problems with most/all digital cameras and not unique to this one. I still give 4 stars because of the great pictures, the many options it has for taking photos (more like an SLR than a point-and-shoot) and the 10X optical lens."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great potential,but","review":"The C-700 is a camera I could really like if I could get it repaired. my C-700 is in the shop For the 2nd time.

That is an extra(...).5. ASM - you have to go to the menu to switch between A and SPositive1. 10X optical (never use digital, your software can do that)2. Fairly easy to use3. Good manual settingsI have an old Sony Mavica FD7 and Never get blurry pictures even at 10X zoom. All my picture were easy to take and now my kids use it w/o any difficulty at all.

I previously used the D-460 and was ready to upgrade to something with more resolution. The C-700 has been a joy to learn. The 10x zoom with Olympus' wonderful optical quality lens take great pictures. Be sure to try the auto braketing feature - it's fun and provides additional clarity in low-light conditions. The camera is compact and light and fits nicely in the Tamrac Digital 6 camera bag. I purchased the lens adapter and filter kit with the intention of protecting my lens and have been very happy with this setup."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Digital, tho not Perfect","review":"++++ 10x zoom and light weight were real sellers. Great for hiking, animals, portraits, macro. Amazing to take pics, download, crop or lighten if needed, and pop out prints size desired in minutes. Save $ and aggrevation on film developing. Don't need to feel restricted about picture-taking--easy to delete.---- Slow! If you wanted to take a pic of your dog running, you'll get a pic of his butt! Between time clicked and shutter goes off, dog has turned away. $ saved on developing will be spent on better paper and ink cartridges. You'll need 2 sets rechargeable batteries and 2 memory cards. Each frame you save needs named, ie: rose1, rose2. Had a lot of trouble getting computer to recognize and had to call tech line; was told a way that wasn't in manual. But I'm way past that now. Several instructions in manual were incomplete.I'm a pretty heavy 35mm/telephoto photographer and this is my 1st digital. I do love it, but I still need 35mm for good action shots."},{"rating":"1","title":"10x zoom sharp only in bright light or with tripod","review":"I bought this camera because of the 10x optical zoom, which you just don't find on consumer-quality digital cameras. Alas, now I know why. It's almost impossible to hold the camera still enuf to get a clear picture at maximum zoom unless it's in bright sunlight (quick exposure) or you're using a tripod--quick 10x zoom shots in less than perfect light are almost always a little blurred. No image stabilization like in the nicer video cameras. If I had it to do over again, I would have bought the highest megapixels I could (now there are some that are 4+ megapixels) and a 3x optical zoom. That way, I'd have the sharpest pix, and a reasonable chance of getting a sharp zoomed in shot, even tho it wouldn't be as close as the 10x."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Happy with Purchase","review":"Finally after my 35mm camera was lost in a move I decided to take the plunge into digital. My wife was sold on the 10X zoom, and many reveiwers selected this as the top camera in that category. Since the purchase, it has consistently performed above all my expectations. I can print 8X10 pictures with great detail, or take multiple lower quality pictures to e-mail to family. We just had twins and use this camera every day to update the family. All of our friends and family have been impressed with the quality, ease of use, and versatility of the camera and we have convinced four others to make the same purchase. One reccomendation -- spend the money on the 128 megabyte card. I have never had to worry about a full memory card since we bought the big one.PROS: great picture quality, ease of use, amazing zoom.CON: not the smallest camera on the marketReccomended accessories: rechargable AA batteries, 128 megabyte smartmedia card"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great camera - could be alittle faster","review":"I bought this camera about 10 months ago, as we were expecting a baby. We have used it repeatedly for pictures of the little guy, and it is great to know if you \\"got the shot.\\"Several weeks ago, we tried to take a picture of the three of us using a self-timer...and couldn't find that feature. I never asked anyone, but rather assumed that a camera with all the other capabilities of this camera would have a self timer. Perhaps it does and we just haven't figured it out yet.Anyway, my only wishes for improvement of this camera would be a self=-timer and a faster shot cycle. Often I am waiting for the camera to get ready before I can take the next shot.For the money, we are very pleased with this camera. Go buy one for yourself and see what great pictures you can take."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb Digital Camera","review":"I purchased an Olympus C-700 almost a year ago and I have been very happy with it. The 10X optical zoom is higher than most other digital cameras and comes in handy. The LCD viewfinder gives you a SLR type accuracy for composing pictures. I have found that battery life is very good if I use AA lithiums and avoid use of the LCD screen. It's amazing how good indoor pictures can be WITHOUT a flash as long as you keep a really steady hand. The 1600 x 1200 pixel images produced by this camera is more than enough for personal use."},{"rating":"2","title":"outstanding","review":"for the price and the picture quality outstanding,if you are shaky get a tripod for distance to keep'm sharp.Plenty of features and real easy to use"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice features, terrible pictures","review":"Loved the features this camera offered. It does takes pictures very quickly, but I was disappointed with the picture quality. The pictures seem dark and washed out. My Kodak DC215 takes much better pictures. Maybe I just needed to adjust something, but it doesn't retain your settings after powering off, so I'd have to set it every time. Also, it defaults to medium image quality every time it is powered off - very annoying.

This one touches on that but really has more information on related topics. There are several chapters on basic electronics repair. The writing style is clean, and easy to read. It is not overly technical and should be easily understood by anyone with even a minimal background in electronics. However, the drawings are not very good. Looks like someone is just learning a computer drawing program. It is disappointing that the classic phone is given a not very useful wiring diagram rather than a schematic. Diacs are shown in the circuits as a \\"loop length compensator\\" with no explanation how that works. Very confusing. On the whole though, I would recommend this book.

If it does fall apart in the first year, I'll be upset considering the price.My main complaint is something that is not unique to this sunshade design. I keep my GPS attached to my lower left windshield. Since this is a custom fit shade, that can be an irritation, greater than the crummy other shade designs that don't fit well in the first place.

Not only will those devotees of the country life memoirs find similarities with Thompson, but also touches of Miss Read as well as WB Yeats and Thomas Hardy here.

If u just want a simple game go for Eufa 2004, or even better (and cheaper) Fifa 2004"},{"rating":"1","title":"Winning Eleven 7 wannabe","review":"This game tries to come close to the gameplay of Winning Eleven 7, but it doesn't even come close.Get Winning Eleven 7 if you want to play a true 'FOOTBALL' (and not, its not soccer) game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice idea, but junk.","review":"The snake looks great. My son thinks it is fantastic. However, when it arrived and we opened the box, the eyeballs had already fallen out and were rolling around inside the shipment box. I realized they are not glued or reinforced in any way. This is extremely dangerous as children could potentially swallow them. I hot glued them in myself and they haven't fallen out again. Just a little extra care in the creation of this product would've earned it more stars. But the lack of thought put into a child's toy is very irresponsible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely disappointed","review":"Do not buy this toy. My daughter was so excited when her package arrived, but found a broken snake when she opened it. I emailed the company and they quickly agreed to mail us a new one. However, the second snake was in the same condition (broken in half). After another email, they refunded my credit card. The snake is not packaged properly. I would give 0 stars, but was asked to rate by clicking at least one star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Average - Just Average","review":"While I somewhat agree with the post that some of the reviews for this musical are a bit harsh, I have to also question the five star reviews. Do these people work for the show itself? The music is fair at best - no songs particularly memorable in my opinion, but simply average. Last year's winner for Best Score (\\"Light In The Piazza\\") is much, much better. Even the music for fluff like \\"The Wedding Singer\\" is more memorable.Maybe the show itself is more interesting than some/most of this season's offerings, but aren't these ratings supposed to be for the cd (music) as opposed to the stage production? I believe there are other venues, such as the NY Times, for that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Costumes were Great, Music was Zzzzz","review":"I loved the costuming for the show & the \\"Man In Chair\\" was a riot, but the music was not memorable.

I am not going to say this is the best score to come around in years, but it is enjoyable and fairly fun to listen to, but like most recordings, it is much better in context.Not to say that the CD isn't good. A lot of just fun, hillarious (especially if you have seen the show) songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Escape from reality","review":"If you had the chance to see this show, then when you listen to this recording you will be doing the same thing as \\"Man in Chair\\": reliving the show. From the opening prayer (not heard on the recording-unfortunately) until the end, you can relive every hilarious moment of the show. Everyone who has ever put in a recording of ANY broadway show and acted out scenes or relived the performance in their mind will be able to understand the brilliance of the show. Perhaps those who have given negative reviews of this recording have not seen the show, or don't understand the point. It's a musical for those who love musicals. My best advice, try to see the show. I was lucky enough to win the lottery draw and was able to see the show in the front row. Even if i had sat way in back, it would still make me laugh.

Amazing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"At Least It Was Original","review":"My husband & I recently saw this show as it was one of the few original shows to come out this year. The songs were ok, but nothing really stood out for us.

I wish they did it more the way it is presented on Broadway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major disappointment","review":"I was looking forward to hearing this CD after everything I had read and heard about the production, but I found it a major disappointment. The premise of a fusty old show queen liking a show this bad just didn't work for me. The songs are more TV jingle-like than anything that recalls music from the Roaring '20s. I gave up trying to wade through the synopsis to figure out why Sutton Foster is singing that dull--and LONG!--song about the monkey. Cute is not a substitute for witty--the writers of this show must not know that. Don't waste your money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"As We STUMBLE Along.. Dear god!","review":"The Broadway show was OK, but the score was its weakest point. This CD will bore you to tears. It is sad they only included 12 tracks and left all the other \\"good\\" music/dialogs out (they probably will include all of them in a different CD coming out soon, priced a lot higher). I wish I could say something better, but the music is just boring and repetitive, IMO. I suggest you buy a different Cast Recording, possibly THE PAJAMA GAME, SWEENEY TODD or THE WEDDING SINGER.. all three are much better then this drek."},{"rating":"1","title":"defective item","review":"Unfortunately, this CD was defective - one track skipped.

The music and lyrics have no bite to be satiric and are not funny to be comedic. What is left are songs so desperately trying to evoke a 20s' musical, they sweat. \\"Thoroughly Modern Millie\\" from a few seasons back was also a 20s' musical but didn't try to shove the period setting down our throats and was effortless and charming. \\"Drowsy\\" has been blessed by some of the critics trying to fool the public into thinking they will be having a great time watching this snoozer. This deception won't last for long as Broadway audiences are more savvy than that. Incidentally, Sutton Foster who played the title role in the above-mentioned \\"Millie\\" seems to have poor judgment in choosing roles-the dreadful \\"Little Women\\" and now this.If she keeps appearing in turkeys I may have to invite her over for Thankgiving dinner.The one-star is for the clever booklet accompanying the CD but after that.....BEWARE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun Show, Weak Score","review":"I enjoyed seeing the show earlier this month and, although the performances were fun, I didn't particularly enjoy listening to this cd.

Simply painful to the ears."},{"rating":"2","title":"A near perfect cast album they way they don't make them anymore","review":"Toronto was the birthplace of this delightfully unpretentious musical comedy spoof of 1920s musical comedies that took more than five years to reach the great white way. Somewhere along the way the intimate little show got bigger, brassier and funnier but lost more than half its original score. No matter. The authors won Tony Awards for the show's book and the score, which is a pure delight. The Cd even includes a dropped song by Georgia Engle and showcases Sutton Foster's star performance with just enough of Bob Martin's narration to make take you inside the inside jokes. The humour extends to the CD packaging. The booklet offers some faux vintage ads, a mock up of the original Lp cover of THE DROWSY CHAPERONE, a detailed synopsis, a fascinating behind-the-scenes story and all the lyrics. A delightful package."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasant surprise","review":"I was lucky enough to see this show before it went to Broadway and thought is was one of the most clever musicals I have ever seen. It is a tribute and tongue-in-cheek send up on the old-style musicals. What I like about the CD is the breadth of talent (It highlights all of the different characters) and how each song was interesting unto itself. The CD captures the whole show's heart and soul. It really helps me relive my theatrical experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mixed Emotions","review":"I purchased this cd before seeing the show and just did not understand the hype. The music is fairly bland - though a couple of songs had promise. Finally saw the show & it is cute (esp. the obsessed showtune-loving \\"Man In Chair\\"), but not entirely what I had hoped for. I have listened to the music since, but it simply is better in the context of the show, and even then, only fair. Show: *** 1/2 ; Music: **"},{"rating":"1","title":"alienating","review":"First, the title of the CD is misleading since it is not Komitas who sings, but a student of his. Second, the music may be celebrated by Armenians, but is in fact dull and lackluster: a mixture of opera and folklore, taking the worse sides of both arts. The whole experience is not unpleasant, but in the end I remained quite alienated from this type of music: it rang no bells (which was expected: I bought the CD so as to hear something new), but it did not make me more curious about Armenian music either. The quality of the first track is so poor, that it should have been omitted: even gthe greatest admirers of Komitas will certainly skip the piece anytime they listen to the other ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoroughly enjoyable","review":"Released now for sometime, and considered to be classic among music DVD's. This album just flows......even when tempo and genre dramatically change from one song to another.....one of my favorites. Of course, you have to be a fan of \\"New Age\\", now considered to be \\"modern classical\\". Some of the groups no longer exist, others have gone on and produced better and more mature songs.

Lyssa Royal is able to offer these insights from many years of practice and working with others worldwide.

It blew me away and made singing the works all the more enjoyable! An amazing experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"A definitive John Rutter collection","review":"This CD contains superb performances of some of Rutter's most famous anthems and choral works. I have had the privilege of performing nearly all these works with my church choir because our director is something of a Rutter fanatic. I also had the honor of performing some of his major works, notably his Requiem, while in college. Rutter's compositions have modern conventions but are faithful and respectful to traditional styles as well. The Cambridge Singers are, as usual, wonderful. The \\"Gloria\\" is superb. Some of the other pieces, like the \\"Gaelic Blessing\\" and \\"For the Beauty of the Earth\\" are not as \\"classical\\" as Rutter's major works, and perhaps a little too fluffy for some, but they are nonethless beautifully performed. Recordings by the Cambridge singers are a treasure to own, whether you are a fan of great choral singing or a singer yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Recorded","review":"The music is wonderful, of course, but this is an old recording that needs to be remastered. The sound quality is awful. Look elsewhere for the breadth of expression these pieces deserve. For you Gloria fans, the Wallace Collection with Andrew Lumsden (Stephen Layton, cond.) gives a much better and energetic treatment to this piece."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let's be honest","review":"This stuff is tacky. John Rutter's compositions are notorious among real musicians for being cheap and sentimental. His anthems are the church-music equivalent of the Big Mac, which has sold billions and billions of copies, but which neither nourishes nor satisfies. The music quickly bores the serious musician and leaves him with a tune he wishes he could get out of his head. If you like Rutter's music, go to it; he's produced a bevy of CDs to keep you happy. But don't mistake it for real music. Rutter is an unabashed sellout who's made a pretty penny pandering to people's basest musical tastes."},{"rating":"2","title":"The ultimate compilation of Rutter's best choral music","review":"Much has been said of John Rutter's ability to bring out the best in his choirs...\\"Gloria\\" is no exception. All three movements of the title piece are splendidly performed by the Cambridge Singers, soundly accompanied by a world-class brass choir and organ. A perfect integration of instrument and voice highlights one of Rutter's best sacred works yet, as the composer combines both the reverence and the joy one experiences with the spiritual. Filling out the program is a wide variety of Rutter's single anthems, from the joyous \\"Praise Ye The Lord\\" and \\"All Things Bright and Beautiful\\", to the haunting but beautiful arrangement of \\"God Be In My Head\\", based on the 150th Psalm, and his arrangement of \\"The Lord Is My Shepherd\\", a piece originally released as the centerpiece of his \\"Requiem\\". A wonderful album, \\"Gloria\\" will stir the soul and warm the heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most beautiful music ever created","review":"I believe John Rutter has captured the essence of God's beauty and grace.

When used with the BG10 (I used it as a replacement in a 20 year old cooker frame) it works great -- what a flamethrower! For something coming from China, it's surprisingly well made. The crimping at the ends of the stainless sheathing is perfect. Connections are tight like they should be. I like the way the valve controls the flame. The one that this replaced was always difficult to adjust, but this one takes (I'm approximating) three full turns from Off to Flamethrower which makes setting the power output easy. It's also easy to adjust at very low settings without risking flameout. All in all, they did a good job with this."},{"rating":"1","title":"not delivered as shown","review":"very disappointed that the hose pictured was not what was sent.

Barry Manilow demonstrated that he is a true artist who can do it all; in this movie he is as believable as he is lovable in the role of Tony.

And I'm not a Manilow fan, at least music-wise, although I've always admired his attitude.After seeing this movie again, maybe I should be a fan - I had remembered most of the songs pretty well from one single hearing in 1985. \\"Man Wanted\\" had made a particular impression on me - Annette O'Toole doing that song (in both versions) is one of the most amusing things I've ever seen!And Manilow actually turns in a pretty good acting job.

The only drawback is the fly can be weird to put up, especially if you are short, but i am 5'7 and dont really have much trouble. I can also put it up by myself in about 5 minutes. I fit 2 one year olds with two pack-and-play cribs, a 9 year old, my wife and i with pretty good room left. I have owned eureka tents my whole life, and i do not think i will ever even test out a different brand. If you have a big family, i recommend this tent. Also i havent gotten wet at all and the factory seam sealer is still doing its job. Be sure to stake it down, because it is large and a good gust of wind will flip it like nothing, but ive had it up for 2 weeks at a time without incident. Another quality tent from eureka."},{"rating":"1","title":"still havent received my book","review":"i ordered my book before xmas . its been over one month and still no book. no refund either. its been so long, i dont even care if it comes or not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greate Piano Player","review":"Mr. Rene Urtreger is a fantastic Jazz Piano Player, He play's the Bebop like a Black American it's amazing even the fact that He is a Europian.I recommend to buy this CD it is great music !!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The King of the race of the Elves","review":"This caracter appears only in the Fellowship of the Ring prologue scene fighting Elendil, the Young Elrond and the cursed Isildur.

Its huge! We bought this to go with our Coleman camp stove and we are very happy with it. We have our propane tanks, coleman speckled dinnerware set, camp pots and pans, and there's still lots of room left. We really like that it keeps everything in one place, so you just grab it and go! But it is quite heavy when loaded because the stove goes on the bottom part. So make sure you are in good shape, or have your husband carry it(like I do) So I wouldnt recommend for hiking. Great bag!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Coleman to is very cool","review":"I purchased this tote to carry my new coleman stove and propane skillet. It is great for these 2 items.

I admit when i first seeked the bag out I was very happy with reviews that I had read about it. Having used it once i realze that this bag is not for me. Contrary to many pictures that I found of the bag the sides of the bag are not hard sided making this bag somewhat hard to pack and stack things on top of. I lower compartment is great for the Coleman stove and was one of the main reasons I wanted the bag, but if you do not have one of the largest models of stove it leaves a lot of extra room in the lower compartment. Do not be fooled as I was of this bag. I would much prefer a large tupperware tub than this peice of camping equipment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of room","review":"I liked this Coleman tote, it has lots of room for my Coleman stove and other gear. However I wish the propane bottles fit in the top compartment better. There are small storage pockets around the inside edges and I had to squeeze two tanks of propane in the pockets. I'm not sure if the pockets where meant to hold these or not? If so they should be a bit bigger or offer a means make them tighter like Coleman has on their other grill storage tote.

The author does an outstanding job of showing the emotional consequences of seemingly simple choices. The history of LA in the 50s (I lived it), the blacklist and the movie business all ring true.

Andy Kaufman was never much of wrestler (what kind of a man fights girls only to lose?) True, the film starts a bit slowly, but the pace builds in an elegant way, to its finish, a finish that is not expected. \\"Classy\\" Fred Blassie - the man who added \\"pencil-neck geek\\" to our lexicon - is at his offensive best here. He is a tie to the Golden Age of Wrestling, before Hulk Hogan and the other latecomers. Whether it is puerile comments about \\"broads\\", or demonstrating the fine points of using a pre-moistened towelette, Blassie is a master to see at work. I took my girlfriend, not a wrestling fan, to see this picture, with no explanation. She laughed until her sides hurt. On my next movie night i paln to shoe \\"My Dinner With Andre\\" before the meal, and \\"My Breakfast With Blassie\\" afterwards. Why, O why couldn't Wallace Shawn do some work with Fred Blassie?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic for any Kaufman fan","review":"This movie should please any hardcore Andy fan. At times it is slow, but it makes up for it through the humorous moments like Andy talking about how he should get special treatment because he is a star and when he and Freddy Blassie talk about women. I watched it with non-fans and they thought it was amusing, and you will too folks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"I'm a wrestling fan, a Blassie fan, a Kaufman fan, and agree that My Dinner with Andre could use a good spoof.

It's worth having in your Kaufman collection"},{"rating":"2","title":"Consistently funny all season long!","review":"No sophomore season slump here! Season Two kept the laughs coming week after week. All killer, no filler.There are some priceless slapstick moments throughout, but the standouts include Niles having his words translated from English to Spanish to German to his wife's Bavarian fencing instructor (Niles' rival for Maris' affections in a late-in-the-season episode), and the kitchen distasters in the episode where the Crane brothers open a restaurant. That premise is certainly not an original one in sitcom history, but it gets pulled off with such wit and style that it seems fresh and new.Every episode is delightfully funny.

I wish they had put her in more episodes. The other is Disc 1's the Matchmaker, where Frasier's gay boss thinks that Frasier is romantically interested. And also is under the impression that Frasier's father and brother are also gay.Major compalint: The major complaint I have has to do with Paramount's idiotic navigation. There is no \\"Watch all episodes\\" navigation on the discs, like other TV show DVD have. So when each episode is done you have to click on what episode you want to view next, rather than just watching each one without having to use the clicker. It is aggrivating.

Switching to a pillow like this takes time to adjust the spine to the new dynamics.The pillow is comfortable and holds it's shape.

I have tried many pillows to try to get a good night's sleep since my neck pain prevents me from sleeping all night. I was so excited to get this pillow after reading all the positive reviews. It is great if I were to lay on my back all night, but I don't. It is not comfortable for me if I lay on my side. It is too thick and not soft (but it keeps it shape better because of that).

This pillow has worked wonders to help relive both issues! It helps stabilize my head and it also helps deter me from rolling onto my side and causing further complications.

The first couple nights I received some relief from the pillow, but as I tried to break it in, I found the sides, top and bottom of the pillow very hard. And this was the 'soft' one! It's almost like trying to sleep on the arm of a chair, it's that hard.Silly me, while trying it out, I took off the plastic. That immediately voided my return policy. Now we have two of these and the best I can do is wrap them in plastic and send them to charity.Don't buy these pillows, they don't work.

For me, not waking up with neck pain and a resultant all-day headache several times a week is totally worth the few nights I do have some discomfort from this issue. I put my head on it and immediately feel the tension in my neck ease. I highly, highly recommend this pillow unless you're a very restless sleeper. The real test has been that I commute between cities often, and when I was at my \\"away\\" apartment without this pillow on weekends I was still waking up in terrible pain, so it's not as though I just coincidentally started feeling better at the same time I ordered this.

This works because that indent in front of your heel only serves to collect mud that you track into the house and get yelled at by your wife (i digress..sorry)Bonus is that they look really sharp. On weekends I put on my tool bags and go to work. For the last few weeks I've dusted off my boots on Monday and continue to wear them to my desk job. When they finally get too worn to present at the office, I will buy a second pair just for that."},{"rating":"2","title":"american made boots!!","review":"You can't find a better made boot than this one.I have been in the trades for 25 years and have tried alot of boots out.None have compaired to thorogoods!!(and they are made in america)Quality and american made with pride.I'M SOLD FOR LIFE.

I hadn't listened to it in a long time but after recently playing it again, it holds up as the most comprehensive career boxset ever! It is a shame that Rhino pulled it out of print domestically but it is available as an import. There are a lot of great boxsets out there but in terms of visually stunning artwork and packaging, (mine has the limited 3-D run Alice image) great liner notes and essays, as well as all the hits, including single versions, key album cuts, rare cuts and B-sides, soundtrack songs, and cool collaborations, absolutely nothing comes close to touching The Life And Crimes Of Alice Cooper. Get it either as an import or look for a used domestic release in excellent condition and you won't be disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome alice!","review":"this collection contains both old n modern releases. i've been a mild fan o alice cooper since the late 90's n have no regrets o ever purchasin his tracks. my personal fave is the 4th disc with rockin tracks like the man behind the mask, feed my frankenstein, teenage frankenstein n more hot picks. i would highly recommend this material for all the hair metal rockin fans out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good sound, bad songs","review":"As an Alice Cooper fan for over 25 years, I regarded this box set as a missed opportunity bordering on tragedy. The rarely-heard first two psychedelic albums are bypassed almost entirely, and classic tracks such as \\"Hallowed Be My Name,\\" \\"Second Coming,\\" \\"Halo of Flies,\\" \\"Luney Tune,\\" \\"My Stars,\\" \\"Cold Turk,\\" and \\"Sick Things\\" from the classic LOVE IT TO DEATH, KILLER, and SCHOOL'S OUT, BILLION DOLLAR BABIES period are bypassed in favor of embarrassing '80s and '90s power ballads, presumably because Alice was in a position to negotiate for higher reissue royalties later in his career. Curiously, the liner notes single out \\"Luney Tune\\" and \\"My Stars\\" for praise, but you won't find them here. The fact that the remastered sound on LIFE AND CRIMES is so superior to that of WEA's LOVE IT TO DEATH, KILLER, and SCHOOL'S OUT CDs makes the sparce pickings from these albums that much more lamentable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Sampling Of Alice but wheres the hits?","review":"This box set has a lot of good matieral on it however I was very disappointed to find that only a few of his best hits are included in here and I did not buy it. If you want a sampling of his music over his long career get this but if you want his best hits get The Best Of Alice Cooper: Mascara & Monsters, and Alice Cooper Super Hits (a cheap Compilation if u can find it here on amazon) and save yourself some money."},{"rating":"1","title":"3% brillance, 97% filler","review":"This is yet another example of the Rhino Records 90s ethos - 3% brilliance, 97% filler. After letting their Straight/Bizarre-licensed reissues of Pretties for You and Easy Action, not to mention the wonderful Live at the Whiskey, go out of print after only a matter of months, they now foist upon the public this bloated eyesore of a boxset. About as necessary as fried pork rinds. Avoid it at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why get it?","review":"Who would want to buy this? If you don't know Alice Cooper, why spend the money for a small sampling that doesn't do him justice? If you are a fan, you already have most of this stuff. If you're new to Alice, my advice is to start with Killer, then Billion Dollar Babies, then Love it to Death. Those aren't my favorite albums in order, but it's a good start."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for all rock fans.","review":"The new Alice Cooper box set is not just limited to hard core Alice fans as one might expect. This is a must for all rock and roll fans in general. Alice has been in the Rock world for over thirty years now and listening to this collection you can hear and feel the classic grooves of the early years all the way to the slick proggresion of the late eighties to crunch of the mid-nineties.There is plenty of unreleased tracks for the die-hards but hopefully this will turn new fans on to Alice. As his fans know once you hear him your hooked.The booklet inside tells all the tales of the on stage horrors, but it's the music inside those discs that Alice can stand alone on.Any fan that buys this box will be drawn to it, no doubt."},{"rating":"2","title":"Miracle Grow For Roses","review":"This is an excellent product.

Unfortunately, humor, like clothing, changes with the times. Diller's fast-paced, vaudevillian gags worked well back in the sixties, and even the seventies. But the wisecracking, quick-response stand-up is no longer funny. These performances have great value in the history of humor: but they are just not funny anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor quality.","review":"I ordered two of these clipboards to take orders at an international trade show in New York. We did not open them untilwe got to the convention center and then discovered that one (of the two we ordered) was defective. The clipping mechanism did not open. Very frustrating for a such a high priced item and also quite inconvenient. The slide out calculator was quite handy, but again, for the price of the clipboards everything should have been in working order."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Terrific Resource for Bakers","review":"I've been searching for a great croissant recipe and found it and more in this wonderful book. Sheila Linderman writes clear and detailed instructions in her recipes, but she also provides valuable tips and techniques that give you a foundation for greating your own recipes. So if you're an improvisational cook like me, you can use this book as a guide and reference as you experiment with new ideas. (The croissants, btw, took two days of mixing, rising, rolling, and layering--but they were definitely worth all the effort. When I took them out of the oven and sampled that first, freshly baked, golden brown crescent, I felt like I'd been transported to Paris!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to follow recipes with authentic french results!","review":"The recipes contained in this book resulted in the best pastries, croissants and breads I have ever made.

It only has a short description of curriculum (which is not complete), a short section about facilities, and some other information about admissions and tuition. All this information can be obtained from the school's website and it will be more complete and up to date. If you want information on the best schools to go to for animation go the sites of the big F/X and animation companies like Pixar, Digital Domain, and Rythm + Hues. They have lists of schools that they frequently hire from. I was hoping for some more insight and recommendations for choosing a school based on what your field of interest is and where your talents lie. This book is worth about $5, simply because it can save some time in creating a list of possible schools. When you obtain that list or buy this book there is still a lot of research that you need to do, because this book provides very little additional information."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother. The internet is a better tool.","review":"Don't bother. The internet is better.I purchased this book expecting to get some useful information about 3D animation colleges (since I'm planning to finish getting my BFA soon). While the book does do a decent job in covering tution costs, fees, etc. It lacks in giving the reader useful information about the actual courses offered and what that school's particular cirriculum covers. The book was also missing several (established) art schools that I have located doing my own research on the internet. This book provides nothing more than what a simple search on the internet can provide through such sites as (name)list of schools. A very disappointing book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slayer meets Ozzy meets Megadeath (weird stuff)","review":"This is definitely not your typical metalcore band. It's a pretty good disk if you like the genre, but I dunno about all the exuberant 5 star ratings. You can really see the influence of the above bands, especially in the Megadeath-esque lead riffs and in the between-line breakdowns. The lines that are actually sung are annoying and whiney sounding , but the screaming is dead on. \\"For You\\" and \\"Antithesis\\" are kickass, buying the whole disk is worth it for those two songs. The music as a whole is really intense and pounding but has more of a metal feel than a hardcore one. The lyrics are, umm, pretty pesimistic to say the least. If you're into new hardcore but like the old school metal roots, this disk is for you. If you don't like Megadeath, you'll probably hate it."},{"rating":"2","title":"classy reissue","review":"Petitioning the Empty Sky has been reissued with class. The new artwork is gorgeous. Most importantly, the album sounds revitalized and not dated in the least. The remixing/remastering sounds unbelievably good: crisp and clear and vital. I'd even say the album now sounds just as well produced as Jane Doe.As for the music, I think Converge is one of those bands you either love or hate, and I'm firmly in the latter camp. This is one of their strongest albums, and to hear it enhanced like this is just a joy. (If you liked The Saddest Day before, the new mix will blow your mind!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing piece of work by an amazing band","review":"The only reason I didnt give them 5 stars is because the production is a little distorted which can be annoying at times.

Very good album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Converge - Petitioning the Empty Sky","review":"One of their best in my opinion, true, it does lose a little wind after the first two tracks (the Saddest Day and Forsaken), but over all shows a band focused in their metal influenced hardcore style."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Diaries of Paul Klee","review":"He began this diary over 100 years ago.

I finally bought a full size model (Kitchenaid), and I suggest the same for anyone else looking for a food processor.I have found a use for this one, however. I keep it in the laundry room.

Chadwick crams a lot of information but a lot of information does not necessarily make for a very enjoyable read. The author's plodding writing style, repeating of the same ideas, and the need to present as much detail information as possible is a book more along the lines of a PHD thesis.

And for the most part, their songs very seldom sound old or tired. \\"My Best Freinds Girlfriend\\" and \\"Just What I Needed\\" sound as catchy today, as they did 20 plus years ago. Rest of the songs hold their own, too. Very seldom do debuts sound this tight. Disk two has the orginal demos for this cd, and you can hear that the group, and their sound, are not made up from the producer. The group made their music. The unreleased songs are ok.

I'm sure there are some beginners who would rather spend a year doing research before touching PMC, but I'm not one of them. I wanted to get busy and make something. And this book encourages you to do just that. It keeps the projects simple, suggests tools that most beginners will have around, allows you to play and get better. It even has ways to use PMC at parties and fund-raisers. For someone who hasn't had fun in a long time, and wants to make something without needing a long ramp-up time or a lot of specialized training, get this book and start. You'll be hooked in no time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good for beginners","review":"Having only used PMC once before I purchased this book, I found Precious Metal Clay: Creative Projects for the Beginner to be a good starting point. Most of the projects are simple, and, therefore, helped me build confidence in my creative skills. The book suggested many ideas from everyday life that could be translated into jewelry design--everything from nature to hardware can serve as inspiration when working with PMC.

A sobering series of testimonies of ordinary people desperately seeking reality by escaping from painful and meaningless religious dogmas and rituals. Even though only Muslim persecution was portrayed, I have seen similar persecution used against Christians converting from other religions as well. I would not take the theme as attempting to bring extreme Muslims into a negative light as an attempt to contrast religious inflexibility and intolerance with a desperate search for true purpose and personal meaningfulness to life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confused","review":"Was really Confused by this book, Muslim Know who Jesus is they believe in Him & believe that he is coming back.

Very sad when I read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"True tales of modern-day martyrs","review":"The Costly Call is an anthology of true personal testimonies of Muslims worldwide who found Jesus Christ and converted to Christianity - at a terrible cost. The price for turning away from Islam in nations such as Malaysia, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and others was fines, arrest, imprisonment, physical attacks, attacks on family members, and sometimes even execution. In many nations where Islam is dominant, proselytizing Christianity to Muslims is an illegal offense that can result in the death penalty. These are true tales of modern-day martyrs, each written in vivid first person. An unforgettable collection of true faith tested in ways that those living comfortably in nations with freedom of religion can scarcely imagine. The Costly Call is published in accordance with a non-profit interdenominational organization called The Voice of the Martyrs, dedicated to assisting those persecuted for their Christian faith worldwide."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keep the faith","review":"Twenty, short, easy to follow stories of Muslims around the world, whom once converted to Christianity became subjects of persecution. Fundamentalist Islam dominates many countries. A minority hold on to their faith only to find a costly call. The author tends to pick people with similarities in their stories. Hence I partly question the authenticity of the writings. I don't know if this is coincidence or on purpose. Otherwise I am happy to have read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Challenging and encouraging","review":"This is a great book of stories of former Muslims who now follow Jesus - and some who have not yet chosen to follow.

It covers the flora & fauna of this least know section of the lower 48 in a comprehesive, yet not belabored fashion. Plenty of salient details with a minimum - though adequate - smattering of scientific jargon. Even though I have worked for a public land management agency in the \\"Basin\\" for over 2 decades, I learned much and enhanced my understanding of things I did know.

You see, Ironside's character, Colt Hawker (!), had a bad childhood w/ a drunk dad and a mum who tossed hot grease in dad's face. Now, Hawker hates all women and especially the uppity ones like Grant's character! He attempts to murder her w/ his footlong switchblade, but she has the audacity to survive! Hawker comes after her in the hospital, leading to many deaths and a game of hide 'n' seek between Ironside and Grant ala Halloween 2. I like this one! We even get Linda Purl as a nurse and William Shatner (Incubus, Devil's Reign) as Grant's utterly useless boss! Ironside was born menacing and always gives me the creeps! He's truly sadistic and twisted in VH, and that's a good thing. Lee Grant is strong and likeable in her role.

I do not know how this revised copy ever made it to the DVD market.

If you plan on flying some of the lighter weight Estes rockets such as the Eliminator and Executioner, it'll most likely work fine but if you want to fly Estes kits with the more powerful APCP (composite) rocket motors or larger mid power rockets like the Aerotech kits off this pad, forget about it!!!I personally would recommend the Aerotech Mantis pad over this one. Yes, the Mantis is considerably more expensive, the quality is much better and it will allow you to fly larger rockets off it.By the way, I finished off this Estes E pad by flying a saucer on an Aerotech G339N Warp-9 motor from the pad, sheared the legs right off.

And no instructions to snip it.Theres a plastic socket that you insert in the middle of hte pad and the rod is to be screwed into it and tightened for launch - we cannot get it tight.

The version here is the re-edited 1976 cut, using footage from the 1975 film edited campy with light humour. While this is fine as a film it is not the way it was presented. Notable differences shown here in the DVD is the opening title credits that do not show the full title of the film in favour of the regular ABC TV series. certain camera angles and performance delivery differs as well. The major animated difference is that Wonder Woman deflected bullets in the true pilot film which was replaced with the lasso twirl.As for the DVD - it would be better to get the entire frist season collection rather than this single disc.

You can buy these points on the Wii shop channel if you have a credit card without shipping and handling or wait until you can get them in your local store.If you REALLY REALLY REALLY need a Wii card and none are available to you and you do not have a credit card(Or bank card), try looking somewhere that will charge more around $20 so you aren't literally wasting money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Bag","review":"I got this bag for a 3 inch Celestron Refractor I bought years ago.

While signs of age are clearly present there is still a confidence and professioal swagger that exists within the very core of this band. The sound and picture quailty is exceptional and the program selection which mixes classic purple with new material holds up throughout the entire show. Guitarist Steve Morse is like a shot of adreneline and he looks like a kid in a candy store playing these classic tunes. The added comentaries are revealing and it is apparent that Blackmore's leaving was not met with any tears. A five star performance from one of the originals."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost as good as they ever were....","review":"I've seen these guys live three times - 1984, 1986, and 1998. This DVD was almost as good as the real shows. The only missing element is Ian Gillian's voice - he can't hit those high notes anymore, and his lung power is very obviously fading. Despite all that, he has a rollicking good time, as does Steve Morse. The sound quality (DTS 5.1) cannot compare to the best I've heard (Eagles - Hell Freezes Over), but still, it's well engineered to suit Purple's genre of music - slightly muted highs and a great thumping bass line. \\"Perfect Strangers\\", \\"Lazy\\" and \\"Space Truckin\\" are the highlights. Also nice to hear an old favourite \\"Mary Long\\". But \\"Woman From Tokyo\\" was disappointing - the studio cut was better. The bass and drum solos on \\"Speed King\\" are simply out of this world - as good or better than the great Lord/Blackmore jam on \\"Strange Kind Of Woman\\" from the \\"Made In Japan\\" album.Overall, highly recommended and a must have for any true rock fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"deep purple are the best ever!!","review":"watching this dvd shows that even that the band has changed over the years it still rocks. it's not only the sound that makes you so happy and glad - it's allso the songs and the very tiet preformance. you cann't find anything like it... its siance... deep purple are the profesors of heavy rock ! nobody has ever replaced them. great!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"the deepest purple","review":"This legendery band was my favorite on 70's time. After those long years I have the opportunity to hear and see them again.Big difference on their physical features, but a big experience and the same great music also. All members perform this show greatly: Ian Gillan, Roger Glover, Ian Paice, and the always amazing Keyboardist John Lord, performing with the same power of thirty years ago. Steve Morse, although a new member of the band was entirely in harmony with other members. I still miss Ritchie Blackmore, but in conclusion, the show is extraordinarily bringing to me those old good days live. Excellent DVD, both on picture and 5.1 digital sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT BAND, STILL ROCKS","review":"HAVING BEEN A DEEP PURPLE FAN IN THE SEVENTIES,AND A STEVE MORSE FAN TODAY, I BOUGHT THIS DVD CONCERT. THE RECORDING IS VERY GOOD. THE BAND IS VERY TIGHT, AND ALTHOUGH STEVE MORSE SOUNDS NOTHING LIKE RITCHIE BLACKMORE, HE'S SUCH A GREAT MUSICIAN THAT HE FILLS THE GUITAR SLOT NICELY. IAN'S VOCALS SOUND VERY POWERFUL. THIS BAND STILL PLAYS WITH ALL THE POWER I REMEMBER, WITH NO SLACKING. THE ONLY PROBLEM I HAVE WITH THIS CONCERT IS THAT BEING A SEVENTIES BAND, THEY JUST HAD TO PUT IN A LONG DRUM SOLO. IAN PAICE IS A GREAT, TIGHT DRUMMER. NO NEED FOR A SOLO.

I had greatly enjoyed the previous series and hoped that someone would pick up where Barry Sadler had left off. The setting was OK, but not very well developed and the history of the tribes was lacking. Way too many pages were spent on the sexual goings on of Casca and his three nurses. Some attention was paid to the tactics and strategy used by the tribes but overall it was dismissed as a madman's creation. I hope that the next author who makes a creative stab at writing more on this series can do a more credible job."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will the real Casca please stand-Up!","review":"Synopsis: Casca gets aboard ship, drowns, visits Sub-Saharan Africa and saves city from a madman and the evil European Slavers (did I mention Africa?).Way too long of a book. Not a thing like Sadler's Casca. Lack of action, lack of feeling. Way to much description of dull, uninspiring trivia. The one good thing, it makes some of Sadler's worst prose feel inspired. In short, skip the book unless you have to have everything that has Casca's name on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"WAY OFF THE MARK","review":"Being a long time Casca/Barry Sadler fan, I was quite excited when I saw and bought this one. Oh my! This book is so off the mark from the orginal series is almost made me ill. I must admit I was unable to finish the thing. I will grant you that some of Sadler's work, some of the later books, were not up to the standard of his first four, but they were never the less interesting and readable. This one is not. You would think that the publishers could come up with something better than this to continue the series with. If you are along time Casca fan, you will be quite disappointed with this one...I would recommend you not even read it and certainly don't buy it..borrow it if you must. All in all, a really bad work."},{"rating":"1","title":"A complete waste of money","review":"This was the worst 6 bucks I have ever spent. I had to force myself to finish this, thinking \\"it has to get better\\". After waiting ten years for a new book, this is an incredible disappointment. The author cannot write or tell a story. There's only filler. The author gives complete details about the bathtub, but leaves out little things like when and where the story is taking place or what happens to the Oba at the end of the book, but then again, maybe he did, but I was too bored to notice or care. This series used to contain nonstop action, not this constant introspection. He made Casca sensitive.To the Publisher:1)Pay some real money for an author who can write!2)Hire some editors. Not only were there inconsistancies on the same page, but spelling errors as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good try but just not Sadler type storytelling!","review":"I was thrilled to see a new Casca Book after all these years, but getting halfway thru this book I found myself speedreading thru it just to get it done! Now this guy's writing is good and he captures Casca's mood and his very being greatly, its just a very slow-going storyline. The beginning was real good but as soon as he got a couple of broads - it was dullsville! There just wasn't enough movement, action/adventure like Sadler would give you. This writer ought to write another one but keep it flowing and write the action scenes better. The action seqences were too broad and not personal enough like sadler made them. Casca himself though was well written and was the ever soulful-soldier and you felt sorry for the guy but there was just too much lovestory for me. Sadler's love storylines were some of his best writings but he didn't bog it down. I want to see more Casca but I just dont want to wait for something to happen!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A better writer than Sadler but not a better storyteller","review":"This book was a terrible dissapointment. The author is a skilled writer and has a greater grasp of the English language than Sadler ever did but what he doesn't have is the storytellers gift. This book was dull and uninspired, far too much time was spent describing unimportant details or simply spending page after page describing Casca eating and getting fat or someother sedentary activity. Sadler's books moved with a dynamic energy, never seeming to dally on a point but always rushing forward too some new instance of action or excitment. This book completely lacked that thrill."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasantly surprised","review":"Not the type of book I would usually read, seemed more like a \\"guy\\" book, yet I had decided to give it a chance. I had never read any of the previous books which made some of it confusing and difficult to follow. Soon I came to realize the author was creating a whole world for me to enjoy, the world Casca found himself in and the tortured and anguished world of his mind. The detail some of the previous reviewers found too much, was the same detail that created the whole world around Casca. I could feel his thoughts, wants and desires while at the same time I emersed myself in the adventure he was living. It would have been dissapointing to follow the Eternal Mercenary on a road littered by corpses, something I feel some of the other reviewers found lacking. A terminator Casca is not. He is a complex character who found himself in a critical point in history. There is much more to this book than meets the eye. I look forward to reading it again. The author did great."},{"rating":"1","title":"An insult to Sadler's memory","review":"I really wanted to like this book as I have read all Sadler's Casca books and enjoyed most of them. I never actually finished reading the book, it was so bad.The writer needs a lot more editorial control regarding pace and structure. The whole middle section of the book (where I gave up) has no action - Casca sits around, eats his meals, and that's it. In the first few chapters the author spends a lot of time describing the other people on the boat and I thought these guys would be with Casca throughout the story, but they get killed off by the pirates - what a waste of time.I am surprised that Dengelegi was invited back to do a second book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Return of the Eternal Mercenary","review":"I was extremely excited to find a new Casca novel after so many years. Like most Casca fans, I was saddened and disappointed to hear about the death of Barry Sadler. Mr. Sadler's Casca novels were always welcome reading. He had a wonderful ability to mix history, fiction, and plain old fashioned soldiering that produced many unforgettable stories. I was disappointed, however, with this new story. The author gets bogged down with inane diversions such as the endless baths, and feasting on lizards. And who ever heard of Casca getting fat!! In addition, there is none of the usual Casca language, or dialogue. The author has relegated Casca to a mere spectator for most of the story. I applaud the effort of trying to resurrect the undying soldier, but sincerely hope that the author will study more of Barry Sadler's style and use this to keep the original flavor of the series intact. I hope another story is in the offing, and will see if the old Casca flair is back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Casca: The Defiant","review":"Unlike most casca books, casca seems to be a supporting character in this book. The brotherhood normally could only mean the brotherhood of the lamb....now a different one shows up....whenever the doc has anything to do with experiencing casca's past, usually they meet....and at the end the good doctor finishes by giving the impresion he will write it all down and forward a copy to his old co...dr (col) landries)...was his tie in here out of context or just a way to show the readers that you had read one or two of his books (sadler) and know some of his characters names, but not their motives or how they fit in the grand scheme of the book....please reread the series to get a better feel for casca, how he deals with those of his past, his ways of communicating those stories, and how casca lived....no just a byline headed to an end...but actually what casca does and experiences..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, well.","review":"I've read (and re-read many times) the entire Cascaseries. Mr. Dengali made a valiant effort to continue the series, butfailed to grasp the character. The book was verbose to the extreme, filled with grammatical errors and errors of usage. The editor is at fault for this failing. \\"Taught\\" instead of \\"taut?\\" Please.Perhaps had the editor been familiar with the storyline of the series, Casca would have drowned after the pirate episode. Which not only would have let us bypass several pages, but would have been true to the character.A hard read, a story drawn beyond a viable length, and an indistinct setting, combined to make this book less than I had hoped for.But Paul, don't give up!

It has two Pochacco cartoons on it and two Keroppi cartoons. If you've ever wondered what Pochacco and Keroppi's voices sound like, here's your chance. As the previous reviewer mentioned, this video is very soothing. I often watch it to fall asleep at night and it NEVER fails. One funny thing about this video is all the silly mistakes in it. There's one scene where, in the space of two minutes, the same body of water is referred to as a lake, a pond, and a river. Also, there's a part where Pochacco is sitting on a swing, and the thickness of the branch keeps changing, as well as the number of swings! Pochacco's voice couldn't be cuter, though, and his laugh will crack you up. The humor is quite Japanese, as is one of the stories, in which Pokopon, a bear who plays drums on his stomach, has his belly button stolen by the Cloud People! I found this obscure, but overall the video is really VERY charming."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not too bad but still....","review":"WW III: World in Flames is the 3rd installment of Ian Slater's WW III series, and is the best one so far, even if it is brimming with military innacuracies and errors that in some cases are minor, in others dumb and in others just too blatant to ignore. An example of this is when Slater mentions an \\"A-10 Intruder\\". Uh-huh. The A-10 and the Intruder are 2 completely different aircraft!!! Also innacuracies about the calibre of the Phalanx gun system and the weight of the Sparrow air-to-air missile(in the text it seems to shift from 524 to 514 to 5,000 pounds)and what's this? A Russian ballistic missile submraine weighing in at twenty-five tons?! An F-15 fighter weighs more than that! Use you noggin, Mr. Slater! Still, despite all this the interesting use of an SAS unit was entertaining, and the nuclear aspect at the end are probably what saved this book from being rated a 6 or a 7 by me"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is terrible","review":"Ian Slater knows absolutely nothing about the American military.

The cast is a bunch of nobodies, there are maybe 12 characters during most of the movie, and another 12 for the end. The direction is amateurish, with characters standing around while the camera moves! The script seems to have been made up as they went along, since one scene definately doesn't lead to the other. And the whole thing is cheap, and looks it. Hammer and AIP movies from the 1960s look better, have a better cast, and better script.This 1961 movie is as forgotten as any movie from 1931, because the five minutes of 3-d is the only good thing.This movie was made in canada, if that also matters any."},{"rating":"2","title":"We ran all the way home","review":"My brother and I went to see this in Ithaca, Ny when it was released in the local theater.

The bad lip synching is probably the most entertaining aspect of this game. The main problem is that the game is very linear: you have to end up doing what the script tells you. There is no \\"character development\\" (rank advancement, choosing your crew/ship) and the crew that you do get is very annoying. As \\"captain\\" you are pretty much just a figurehead (my dog could probably run this game) as the other characters run the show. The graphics themselves aren't bad -- if you don't mind looking at people that resemble bobble-heads. Overall there is no grit and throw down action that you would get from the Starfleet command games: which admittedly, is very much in character with the actual ST:TNG (i.e. very watered down, bland... and dumb)."},{"rating":"2","title":"What Star Trek Online should have felt like","review":"This game is a near-flawless blend of command sim and arcade action, and I regret not buying it when it was available in-store. However, it may well still be worth the $40-$80 it's usually shown for on this site, and would have been a far better investment than the \\"lifetime subscription\\" I snagged for Star Trek Online, which went free-to-play in a ridiculously short span of time.The only real advantages STO has over this game is the multiplayer and land combat. But that multiplayer is heavily instanced, and the land combat feels, at least to me, fairly awkward. Bridge Commander mops the floor with STO when it comes to space combat. The hard point damage is awesome and controlling your ship from the bridge point of view is something that I wish they would have considered when making the MMO. The learning curve is in no way hampered by controls, and there are plenty of mods available.If I were to instantly \\"greenlight\\" anything on Steam, it would be this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Starship Shooter, havn't discovered real strategy.","review":"The graphics and play is great!

Although semi close to the Starfleet Command games, it takes those games to a new level of lush 3D vessels, surroundings and space stations. The graphics are, obviously, unsurpassed on the PC; they'll blow you away. The sound is like BEING in the Star Trek universe, with phaser fire, torpedoes and explosions, you'll be back for more. The gameplay/lasting appeal is great, not only is the game extremely innovative and fun, but multiplayer and quick battle scenarios will keep fun coming.

Engineer, divert max power to shields\\" - that sort of thing). And the graphics are very nice, and the story is interesting.BUT, each scenario I played (and I did about the first, oh, 6) has a VERY narrow and constrained success tree - you have to do a precise sequence of actions, in a precise order, to win. I felt like a puppet. There was no room to explore various options, no multiple paths to success - you do A, then B, then C, typically as quickly as possible, and any deviation results in failure :-(.

The entire premise of the bill of rights was to protect civilian authority by having the means to protest and wage war if necessary having just won a revolution!

I would fill the iron with water and start ironing a few minutes later - and find a puddle on the ironing board where the iron had been sitting... leaving barely any water left in the iron for steam.I don't know why everyone gives Rowentas such high reviews - I am not impressed. I tried a friend's Rowenta after this one started leaking and his gave me the same results after a couple months - burning fabrics and leaking all over the place.I'll stick with my late 80s B&D;, thank you very much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this iron!","review":"Iron leaks badly from the heelplate after one use. Rowenta's phone line was also disappointing, they apparently know they are selling junk and are unapologetic. All they will say is \\"send it back at your expense and we'll take care of it in 30 days.\\" After reading Nancy Long's comment here (her replacement iron leaked as badly as the first one) I am hesitant to go through the hassle and expense of shipping this piece of junk back to the service center."},{"rating":"2","title":"great iron","review":"I looked for an iron all over the different retail stores and found nothing impressive.

Also was told this - we do not recommend our customers use memorex, maxell, any generic brands or store named brands e.g. officemax or staples.I found a firmware upgrade that seems to make it work at 8x with the Verbatims.

Is it Robots of Dawn? Hardly, but the notion of a Robot City and all that it implies, and the fact that there is a murder mystery woven in, leads the reader on a path of discovery through this amazing place. There are only a few robots that have inspired me to weep: The robots in \\"Silent Running\\", Robot Clark in \\"Futureworld\\" and Wohler in Robot City, Book 1. There are a few inconsistencies in the series, and the human characters can be the most frustrating of all, but for lack of Asimov himself - and I don't know how any author could possibly wow us with something better than R. Giskard Reventlov - the robots of Robot City are a fascinating bunch, and I'm glad to have made their acquaintance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic piece of reading","review":"Absolutely brilliant, in my humble opinion. I picked it up to read one night in bed, and apart from sleeping & eating, I didn't stop till the next evening. Through Asimov's helpful attitude & guidance, these authors have turned out an excellent read, which I thoroughly enjoyed. I'm potentially worried about diffferent authors doing a story along the same lines, while it allows for changes & invididualism, sometimes reading a series of books means you'll get the same 'writers attitude' whereas with this series you'll encounter a few different 'attitudes'... if this was anything to go by though, I have no concerns. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"simply delightful","review":"a classic asimovian detective sf novel except that the characters have an '80s sensibility. kube-dowell and mcquay are clearly having fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be Chapter 1 instead of Book 1","review":"Extremely lengthy, considering that it takes 250 pages to get to the \\"crime\\", and nothing of importance is revealed after reading 500+ pages. Too many major deviations from the spacer/settler universe, including appeal to deus ex machina type plot devices. Asimov would have hurled.

It is just unfortunate that anyone reading this will probably be seeing it on a television for the first time. \\"Everest was made for the IMAX and has to be seen there to fully appreciate this level of film making. It is an eye-opening, enriching look at this great mountain, finally captured in its true essence for the first time for those who can only dream of climbing it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Mountain, Big Format, Small Film","review":"Imax is a stunning film format, and climbing Everest is an awe-inspiring subject - so how come this film leaves you so cold and conveys so little of the human struggle. The script has all the depth of an exercise bike commercial, and while the climbers rise to 28000ft their insights never rise above the \\"I love to climb, thats why I do it\\" level. The huge irony was that the film was made the year of the biggest tradgedy in the mountains history and you still ended up thinking that you could easily get up to the top on a nice sunday afternoon stroll and be down for supper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was in Nepal in 1996, the year of the disaster on Everest. I met David Brashears and Aracelli Segarra. They are impressive people and what they did in the service of the hapless climbers (putting their expedition on hold to help the rescue efforts, lending their oxygen tanks, etc.) should all by itself have made an incredible story. Beck Weathers' incredible against-all-odds survival and the heroism of the Nepali Air Force chopper pilot who rescued him are in the movie but could have figured larger. In fact, there was so much more that could have been done with this movie that it was almost anticlimactic to watch. Very disappointing, considering the subject. Also, the visuals were by-and-large not as impressive as previous IMAX movies I have seen. If you want to experience a real nail-biting version of the Everest disaster of 1996 you must read Jon Krakauer's excellent and definitive book \\"Into Thin Air.\\" So far, nothing exceeds it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well presented but nothing great!","review":"Forget about owning this DVD. It is not something you will love watching the second time as I didn't find the video or audio so great to enjoy it. It's just a plain simple regular type of documentary that happened to be a true story. I recommend it for viewing it once!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Book is Better","review":"I ordered this DVD thinking that it would overpower me, and make me feel as if I was there. The movie was much too short, and lacked character. I found myself getting bored quickly, and this was coming from someone who read \\"Into Thin Air,\\" in a matter of days. I would advise everyone not to get this DVD, it is very disappointing. The tragedy on the mountain was covered very poorly, and the dialog was rather dull."},{"rating":"2","title":"See it in IMAX first, but video a good substitute","review":"Very good video but better in the IMAX format. If you read \\"Into Thin Air\\" by Krakaur or \\"The Climb\\" by Boukarev (both about the Mt. Everest disaster in the late 90's) you'll enjoy this video shot at the same time. It touches on the disaster and might be better if it went into a bit more detail (of course, that's not the reason for it's production). But it takes the viewer through the Everest climb from beginning to end. After viewing it, I'm anxious to read David Brashear's recent book \\"High Exposure\\" and to view the recent NOVA show \\"Lost on Everest\\" about a team that searches for the remains of George Mallory and attempts to answer the question, \\"Did Mallory really summit first?\\" Bottom line: Good Adventure"},{"rating":"2","title":"IF YOU HAVE A BIG TV... 32\\" OR LARGER... IT's GREAT","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed Jon Krakauer's book \\"Into thin Air\\" and eagerly ordered this video, although (regrettably) I didn't get to see EVEREST in the IMAX theater. The first time I watched it, it was on my 13\\" TV in my bedroom and I enjoyed it, but was much more impressed with it when I later watched it on my bigscreen. I found it to be a thoughtful, tasteful & exciting documentary on what tackiling Everest entails... FOUR STARS... although I'm certain it must have been worthy of 5 Stars in an IMAX theater!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!!!!!","review":"This video is the greatest film for conquering Mount Everest.

Seeing the spirit behind a climb up the world's tallest mountain is incredible.

This is definitely a film that belongs in many collections. Go ahead, buy the thing already!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bafflingly dull -- how was this possible?","review":"After reading \\"Into Thin Air\\" and \\"The Climb\\" and a dozen or more online articles, I remember having watched this film -- Brashears comes across as nothing short of a hero in \\"Into Thin Air\\" -- how, then, is it possible that this film is so dull? The score is intrusive, nearly comically so -- is there a plot?I don't understand how this film could be as... dull as it is. Was it bad editing? I just don't comprehend how this film could be anything less than stellar, yet it is.\\"Hey, guys, we hauled a big camera up Everest. Neat, huh?\\" And that's about it. Something of a disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good film...","review":"Has some great shots of the mountain, you \\"kind of\\" get a feel for how it would be to climb it. You don't really get too attached the characters, but who cares about them, you're watching it for the mountain. A couple things: the movie doesn't make the climb look all that dangerous, and lacks any drama that you might expect to see in a movie about climbing everest (even the part where they talk about the '96 disaster is intentionally played down).The makers of the film seemed to want to give the movie a \\"G\\" rated Disney feeling and do so successfully. I'd recommend it, but due to how short it is relative to others, and the lack of showing the true hardships of the mountain, I'd recommend other Everest videos before this one. My favorite Everest film so far is NGC's \\"50 Years on the Mountain\\" NOT to be confused with Surviving Everest, which is completely awful and a sad waste of money.Happy Arm Chair Climbing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated; very overrated","review":"This film is a disappointment!

If you want to see what Everest looks like, check out the web sites with photos. Even the third grade class site. The shots over the crevasses are clearly thought to be the money shots, but I wasn't taken by them. The areas I wanted to get a better sense of (the balcony, the rocky steps, the Hillary Step. the summit even), I didn't. Most of these shots were movies without much movement, and I didn't get an understanding of where they fit on the mountain. The voice over was vaguely trite, with nothing memorable. The helicopter shots up the approaching valley however, I have not seen anywhere else. I also saw this in an IMAX theatre a year ago, but it did not get my interest in Everest as Into Thin Air has."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Read","review":"You will find yourself flying through the pages of this book.

This movie of course if filled with realism and Liam is a great narrator. It touches on the Everest catastrophe of 1997 and you can see some of the real people involved in that, not cheesy actors as from the other movie. \\"Everest\\" is not the greatest IMAX movie you would ever see, but the realism makes up for it. Better than \\"Vertical Limit\\" for realism, but not the same drama of course."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yet another Everest film, but routine","review":"Filmed depictions of the ascent of Mt. Everest are beginning to pile up like firewood. This one's claim to fame is that it is in the IMAX format. However, I watched it at home on a regular screen, and that renders it very routine compared to some others I've seen. Moreover, this climb coincided with a far more fateful one in which several climbers perished. The people in this film seem to make it to the top like rabbits and then hurry back down with no drama whatsoever. Left unaddressed in this film, and in many Everest films, is the question is why these people risk their lives when this climb has become almost routine? It seems to be a personal goal for most, but the chances of dying are so high as to create questions of sanity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Everest (IMAX)","review":"Don't waste your bucks on this film~ It was not worth viewing.Instead consider buying John Krakauer's Book \\"In to Thin Air\\" A very excellent Read~ and account of events that took place during this fateful climb ~The film is too short, and so much was left out of the film,not even the actual film footage was \\"worth viewing\\"~This Documentary was IMO ~ A rip off~"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sir Edmund Would Not Be Happy","review":"After reading \\"Into Thin Air\\" I decided to give the IMAX version a peek since The IMAX folks were depicted as good citizens.

Unfortunately, this film is amazingly bland and artificial. The movie is \\"peppered\\" with video-game-like graphics. I've honestly seen better ornamentation in corporate PowerPoint presentations. The viewer gets no sense of the drama of what actually occurred (at least 7 people died on Everest while the film was shot). Liam Neeson's narration only heightens the artificial feel of this film. There has been much talk of the frozen bodies still on Everest. You will not find them in this Disney-esque feature. If you're thinking \\"K2\\" or \\"Vertical Limit,\\" you are way off base. Heidi's climb to Grandpapa's chalet in the 1968 classic was more action-packed and realistically staged."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sir Edmund Would Be Sad","review":"After reading \\"Into Thin Air\\", the IMAX version is a huge disappointment.

What I got was a dull narrative, a bunch of scenes that do not belong on 70mm (packing / unpacking / talking on a telephone / assembly-line lunch) and very little footage of the mountain or climbing. Why would I want to see this on DVD or VHS without the benefit of WideScreen footage anyway? I am pretty disappointed with the whole package. I would guess that the camera crew go gun-shy after the tradgedy that claimed 8 lives. As a result, we see the rear of the climbers, mostly, and shots from conservative angles. They said that helicopters had a hard time getting up that high due to the lack of air. What about aeroplane shots? I think this project, derailed by tragedy, should have stayed that way. The result is piecemeal, at best. Some nice deleted scenes, though.I sure sound bitter, don't I?

I bought it because I'd read Jon Krakauer's \\"Into Thin Air\\" and knew that this film purported to cover, in part, the tragedy of the expedition described in Krakauer's book. Well, the film shows basically nothing of that expedition, and mentions it only very lightly.

Yes, the movie is old, the plot is questionable, but this movie is worth watching for something else. There's just something so weird and scary about the bearsuit. The way its swirly, hypnotic eyes look at you, it's almost paralyzing. Out of all the horror movies I've ever seen, this one still gives me the chills.

The common thread is a very evident love for God, their sisters and the world in which they live. To Christians this is a book that challenges our understanding of prayer and community, to those without a faith it is a challenge to see beyond our expectations and prejuduces and discover the transformations faith can make in peoples lives.

When I tried to connect my XBOX 360 to my LCD television I got no signal reported on the TV. I thought my HDMI cable was damaged while I snaked it around the room and that I would have to just clip off the ends. From some research I found out that most HDMI devices like blue ray players and the XBOX 360 only support HDMI cables of about 2-5 meters in length. I decided to give this device a shot but was skeptical since it has no external power source and is the cheapest HDMI booster product around. But with this booster properly connected between the XBOX 360 with a short HDMI and the 15 meter HDMI cable to the TV, it works perfectly!

In his defence of the sovereignty of the individual will, Max Stirner launches a brutal and uncompromising assault on the state, society, religion, the family. Also one of the most potent criticisms of humanism, liberalism and communism put forward, Stirner was one of the first to accurately prophesy the tyranny that communism would engender once established. Stylistically, it ranges from cutting aphoristic precision to opaqueness,self-contradiction and repetition, but nonetheless a profound, stimulating presentation of a highly eccentric position of political thought."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very invigorating and thought-provoking.","review":"This is a book that has been ignored undeservedly for a long time. \\"The most revolutionary book ever written\\" powerfully spurns the use of anything above the self as a means of defining the self. Stirner observes that the egoists -- the sultans, kings, and potentates -- live for their own ends off man's devotion to \\"ghosts\\" embodied in not only religion but also humanism. Stirner refuses to worship external idols and unabashedly asserts himself as the reference point for his life.At times the book becomes long and taxing, but patience definitely pays off.

The principle difficulty arises from the fact that it is impossible to distinguish the words of Hegel from those of Weiss, the editor. No reliable visual cue is provided for the reader, who sometimes finds he has plowed through 5 pages of \\"Hegel\\", only to discover they were actually 5 pages of Weiss! To make matters, worse, sections begin and end in an arbitrary fashion that is completely disorienting. In some cases, it genuinely seems pages have been inadvertently omitted! As a result, this \\"book\\" is unreadable. This is particularly annoying, since even when Hegel is presented clearly, he is challenging. For Harper Torchbooks to have mutilated his work in this grotesquely ill-designed book is a kind of intellectual crime.

Hindsight being 20/20 I should have. Not only did I receive only a singleton the first time, but the replacement sent by Amazon was a singleton as well. After contacting customer service (via email, since I couldn't find a number to talk to a real person) all I got was that this problem was larger than they thought (I'll say) and that I need to return the item for a refund.

Ethan Hawke leans to heavily on Kris Kristofferson's performances not to mention Jeff Tweedy's music. As a matter of fact the only gleaming light in the movie is the music. It is written interestingly enough, but the visuals look like there wasn't enough money in the budget to clean up the cheap video that it was shot on.

Everyone who is anyone in overpraised Independent Film makes an appearance: Steve Zahn, Vincent D' Onofrio, Kevin Corrigan, Frank Whaley, Robert Sean Leonard, Uma Thurman (wearing a silly wig) and Rosario Dawson. Cinematic dinosaurs Kris Kristofferson and Tuesday Weld and also in the mix to assure us that Hawke knows all the right 70s references.

It was so bad I turned it off after an hour of pure unenjoyment. I've seen many bad films but I can usually make it through them, however in this case you couldn't pay me enough to watch any more.One main problem with the film is the fact that it features Kris Kristofferson. I have found his acting bad in the past, but he disappointed me even further in this film. In gut wreching emotional scenes between him and his lover he remains cold, distant, and even. Unfortunatley, this seems to be a style of acting tends to be a trend with all of the entertainers that appeared.I think the film was trying very hard to artsy and lacks any of substance to be considered an art film.

I found it to be a beautiful work of art, very moving, thought provoking, and also realistic and relateable, if thats a word. Some woman from the audience said that she had lived in the Chelsea and she felt that Ethan had really portrayed its atmosphere quite accurately. The best way to describe this film would be with the words Ethan used himself, \\"its a collage of moments\\" throughout a day in the life of several people struggling to live in the Chelsea.

First, the dispensing mechanism seems to prevent more than an inch of tape from being taken at any one time; the spindle that it's located on somehow gets stuck easily. Second, the dental floss tape itself has a terrible feeling of hard plastic, and it not only is incapable of cleaning your teeth well, but is also uncomfortable to use.

Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little big but adjustable","review":"The item pictured is almost exactly what you'll receive in the mail, EXCEPT that there is not adjustable D-ring neck strap. A poorly designed velcro strap is the replacement design. I was going to go to the trouble of moving the velcro to make the neck opening smaller as another reviewer had suggested until my Dad suggested that I just knot the long end of the strap to shorten it (duh!). Problem solved. My little girl feels very \\"big\\" when she's \\"helping\\" in the kitchen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware: Purple is not available!","review":"I really like this product, but when i ordered it on Amazon, the picture of the product is clearly purple and white. I ordered this specific product from Kaplan becuase i was looking for something purple. When the product arrived, it was pink and white. When i called customer service, i was informed that the product does not come in purple...just pink, and that the photo online must be a discoloration of some kind. That is ridiculous. As of 12/21/07, the picutre online is purple and white with no possible way that it could be a pink color image that somehow looks purple. I am dissapointed with the order discription and image Kaplan has online at Amazon, and their customer service response."},{"rating":"1","title":"okay for the money but the chef hat was too small","review":"I bought this for my 2 1/2 year old granddaughter whose daddy is a chef. She likes to emulate her father so I ordered this set, and he wanted her to wear it when he needed to take her along on a catering job.She looked really cute, but the oven mitt was way too big for her little hand and the chef's hat was much too small. Her mom had to snip the seam on the back of the hat just to get it to partially sit on top of her head. An adjustable velco band for the hat would have been better: one size hat definitely does not fit all."},{"rating":"1","title":"brief to the point of being useless","review":"I just finished this book the whole time wondering what I was missing since I didn't understand anything. Then I started Pro Spring by Rob Harrop. Pro Spring is so much better it's like night and day. Also there were too many errors and mistakes in A Developer's Notebook. I can't recommend this book since it's not even useful as a reference."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely dreadful","review":"(Yes, I have the updated version.)This book was a complete waste of money. I was left feeling strongly that the authors understand neither Spring itself nor the \\"heavyweight\\" technologies which they compare it against; many of the statements made about EJB or Struts are simply false.The book does an exceptionally poor job of explaining how the Spring framework should be used. The examples are not at all clear, and the text often appears to be meaningless. I find it hard to believe this book was reviewed at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Safai Tech Books Online has the original printing","review":"After reading these reviews I wasn't going to buy a hard copy of this book not knowing which version I would get. Since I have access to Safari Text Books Online, I thought that this is where it would be easiest for O'Reilly to incorporate the fixes. Sadly, no. You have to click between the page you're on and the errata page (which, if printed, would take 8 pages) to manually incorporate the fixes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do NOT buy this book","review":"I read 14 pages and more than half of codes have errors or typos.I doubt if author understand th contents. He keeps in describing the feeling about programming. he does not explain about what it means, or how it works. Do not buy this book, it is waste of your money and time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oops! Mr Tate did it again","review":"I heard that Spring was the next big thing in Java Web programming, so I purchased this book by O'Reilly. Most of the time I'm pleased with O'Reilly's books. Not this time.This 200page books is virtually useless, full of Mr Tate's personal kayaking experience and little Spring. I instantly remembered \\"Bitter Java\\" from the same author, which was also more like a Sports Illustrated than a computing title. I don't understand why people keep buying Mr Tate's computer books, even though there is more telling about his muscular sport encounters than Java code.It could be just me, who cannot find useful technical tips between kayaking stories, but for sure I'll need another Spring book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Title should be, \\"Austin Extreme Sports Notebook\\"","review":"There's practically more content in this book about Mr. Tate's extreme sports exploits and Austin civic boosterism than there is about Spring. Ended up taking this book back.It's a shame -- Mr. Tate is a good, clear, concise writer. But enough already. The kayaking and mountain biking anectodes serve NO instructive purpose, offer no entertainment value, and are especially out of place in a supposedly brief \\"developer's notebook.\\" Stop trying to find some way to inject into your books that: 1) you're such a total extreme sports stud; and 2) that you think Austin is the best city in the world (even though it hardly is)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully Lyrical Folk Melodies a la Rutter","review":"This is a collection of Irish, Scottish, and English folk songs beautifully caressed by The Cambridge Singers under the masterful direction of John Rutter. He seems to possess an uncanny ability to create a uniquely lush and lyrical sound with a choir.In listening to these songs, I find that they have the capacity to simultaneously evoke feelings of melancholy and joy, and, ultimately leave me to conclude that I have been visited by sheer beauty."},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty ok.","review":"Seems to be doing some good.

From the manual, it needs to be charged for 8 hours for 7 Three-minute uses. When I put it onto the charger, the light is not on as described in the maual. I have no idea if it is charging or not. Have to wait a couple hours to see."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get this Expansion pack","review":"If you like MS's Age of Empires series or you already have EE then by all means get The Art of Conquest. I never even played any of the campaigns - I strictly play multiplayer with my friends and on the net. AOC adds a new element to the civs which was not there in the first release of EE. Each civ. now has \\"special abilities\\"... like Novaya Russia has a nuke, America has a market, Brits have a special demolition unit, etc... this changes the game drastically as you know have a weapon (based on what you pick) that no one else has. Or design your own custom civ and have 2-3 special civ. abilities... There are some new units as well and the new Space Age epoch... which I'm not too crazy about (but then again I dont like anything past WW2-Nuclear). It's worth it if you already like the original EE or just planning to get into RTS games."},{"rating":"2","title":"Expansion Pack Rocks!!!","review":"This expansion pack is \\"beyond words.\\" It has a whole new age, which is the Space Epoch. Plus, it comes with three new campaigns. This is definetely worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good game made even better","review":"As soon as I saw that one of my favorite games (Empire Earth) had an expansion pack I took out Empire Earth and played it for an hour of two to see what they might have added. There could be plenty of things that they added like:-New Civs-Paratroopers-New missions-More upgradesIf you have played and finished at least one of the four campaigns in Empire Earth then you will most likely want to get this game. Even though I haven't played it (or bought it for that matter), this looks like a really cool expansion to a great game. Although I wouldn't go so far as to give 5 stars to a game I don't even have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dickies jacket","review":"Bought it for my wife, for dog walking and the dog park.

It works great--nice heat level and power--light weight--long cord--haven't used the cold shot button so cant comment on it. I would highly recommend this hair dryer. I have medium length thin hair thats curly to wavy in places--straightens great with this hair dryer and my round brush."},{"rating":"1","title":"blow out","review":"I've also purchased two of these dryers. My mistake to not keep the boxes or receipts. The first lasted me a good year in a professional atmosphere. I am now a stay at home mom and have had the second for a year with minimal (twice a week) use. It worked fine one day, the next, the lights turn on but no dryer. I'm very dissapointed as they are expensive. I am looking into a solano as that is what I was trained on and hopefully will be a more approving choice. My opinion, dont waste your money on chi dryers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this dryer!","review":"Love this dryer in every way! I agree with other reviewer, the on/off button in a bad spot, but the way my hair looks and feels after finishing with cool shot setting! wow!

It looked extremely cheap, and when i plugged it in and turned it on, and it would not even get hot. Amazon charged me for returning it too. I would NOT recommend this purchase - its better to spend the extra money on a real one from a reputable retail store."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chi Rocket","review":"Amazon was fantastic about my returning this product!!! However, it has a burning smell for a few seconds every time I turned it on and then had a high pitch squeal. When I did return it, Amazon made the process easy and refunded my money quickly!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sparks fly catches Fire!","review":"This is a horrible company. They are producing dryers they know spark and catch on FIRE! Their dryers are a fire hazard & they know it! They make it difficult to return. Charge for shipping and replacements and you pay to ship FIRE HAZARD back! Then the new one does the same thing that is why you see them at marshalls and TJ maxx! Be vary careful! This is a horrible company and they need to protect consumers against Chi!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"I regret spending so much money on this hairdryer. It stopped working after 10 months. I will never buy a Chi product again."},{"rating":"1","title":"DIED after 6 months, warranty not valid from internet purchase!!!!!@","review":"Piece of crap!!! Worked awesome for 6 months before completely dying. Not advertised is the fact that the warranty doesn't appy to the purchase of this dryer outside of a professional salon. Total waste of a lot of money!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"So Disappointed.","review":"I am a loyal Chi Rocket user and after my first hairdryer died after 4 years of excellent service I didn't think twice about replacing it with the same product. Unfortunately, after only a month of usage the dryer makes a loud buzzing sound and vibrates after being on for over two minutes. It sounds like it's going to explode. It's still working but from the sound it's making it could die any second. My first dryer didn't even sound like this before it died. I contacted Amazon and unfortunately they no longer are carrying the product so cannot offer a replacement. I contacted Farouk and, as others have mentioned, they do not cover any product that was purchased online and warned that there were counterfits being sold through non-authorized outlets. Amazon did say they might be able to offer a partial refund but I can't find any online for this price. Just wanted to warn everyone..."},{"rating":"1","title":"piece of junk!!!!","review":"i bought this blow dryer June 6, 2012. Exchanged it for another one that i received June 26, 2012. The first one made a high pitch noise when turned on. The replacemant just died on me today, November 12, 2012. What the heck?!? this is VERY disappointing considering i paid $150.00 for a blow dryer that I essentially only used June 26th-Septempber 18th. I moved out of state so i have not been working (waiting for my license to transfer states) and it has been stored with the rest of my work tools. I only used it today because i did my little sister's hair. ughhhhh. I guess i will have to go back to using the Paul Mitchell blow dryer i was using before."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it for the low EMF claim","review":"Update: We bought the Bion IPX4 wall-mounted dryer with the motor on the wall, so one can keep the distance and reduce EMF exposure. Unfortunately, it's likely discontinued.Most if not all \\"low EMF\\" claim for dryers is a marketing gimmick. How they do it? \\"Low EMF hair dryers use an elongated tube to route hot air to your hair without placing the motor/heater assembly close to your head.\\"Farouk doesn't even know what EMF is. In its presss release for the launch of its Valentines Day Limited Edition, Farouk spells out EMF as \\"electro-magnetic force\\". Well, that EMF is Einstein's concern, whereas ours is \\"electro-magnetic field\\".It's also utter nonsense that \\"moist heat that dries hair quicker\\". Moisture in the air always slows down water evaporation, that's why we take wet towel out of shower enclosure to dry.So buy a long tube with lower wattage from Target or Walmart, save money, save energy while also saving yourself from EMF exposure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money!, Junk","review":"This products is total junk! I have never taken the time to write a review, but if I can save one person the aggravation I have been through hooray! I have had 2 dryers (chi) and they both lost the ability to get hot, I was lucky the second time I savedtheboxand receipt, took it back they got me another one from the shelf I asked them to plug it in, well it got so hot and smelled like burning plastic, I refused to have my dryer replaced by Chi, and the sales clerk totally agreed with me, she even said all the stylist got rid of theirs for the same reason ! Junk, pay $20 at least it will work and when it doesn't you still are not out a bundle!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after 9 months","review":"AVOID Farouk/CHI at all costs. My dryer stopped working after only 9 months of light use, and they won't accept the 1-year warranty because it was purchased online and not through a salon.I will never buy another Farouk product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great dryer ... for a while","review":"My husband bought me a Chi Rocket dryer in August 2007 for $135, which to me was a fortune for a dryer. It was absolutely wonderful for a little over two years, when it just up and quit on me. When I called Farouk about getting it fixed, I was told they would only fix them for two years after the purchase, and I was about 90 days over that. I can't see ever spending that much for a dryer again, I definitely didn't get $135 use out of it. I guess it's back to Walmart dryers again. The one my husband's using is about four years old and cost $40!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great hair dryer","review":"I was very excited to get this hair dryer! It is somewhat pricey but I would say that it was worth it. My hair does feel smoother when using this dryer rather than my old cheaper ones. The dryer does get very, very hot so don't hold it too close to your wet scalp. Other than that tiny issue I have had no problems. I also like how the cold air option has an on-off switch instead of having to be held down. Overall, the price is definitely worth the results!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great hairdryer!","review":"A little noisier than my last Chi, but definitely is a great dryer. I have thick, course hair and when I am done, it is smooth and dry! Also dries faster than my other dryer, which is important because I have longer, fuller hair!"},{"rating":"2","title":"CHI Dryer","review":"Brought this dryer for my daughter for Christmas but it is now in my dressing room because it dries so quickly and I plan to buy another one :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the Hair Dryer","review":"I love all CHI products including this hair dryer. It's nearly weightless, has a low volumne and dries my hair quickly. The only thing it is missing is styling instructions. I am not a professional but I enjoy using professional products and they never come with instructions."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this hairdryer!","review":"This is by far the best hair dryer I've ever used. I go through a lot of hairdryers, and my hairdresser uses this one and he's had his for a long time and uses it all day, so I'm hoping it stands the test of time. But in regards to the product, it was a great price and shipped within a decent amount of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast and light","review":"The Rocket cut my drying time and I like that it's very light so my arm doesn't get tired when I dry my hair. However, when I read some reviews before purchasing it sounded like this hair dryer would give you \\"super model hair\\" just by using it. Remember: It's just a hair dryer. A good quality hair dryer is just one factor in the overall health and appearance of your hair.I think it's a good value for the money, but haven't owned it long enough to know how reliable it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality, Basic functions, High price","review":"I purchased this dryer to replace a Fhi dryer that had lasted me a good while and was hoping for a good replacement. This was not to be, I was at first disapointed with the minimal control over the heat and blower settings but it did not really end up mattering as the thing totally died within two weeks, thank God Amazon took it back and I did not have to deal with the horrible warrenty. What a waste."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fast and quiet blow dryer","review":"It's fabulous. I use it everyday and everyday I am pleasantly surprised at the speed, gentleness, and quietly way this dryer is. I get so many compliments on my hair. I also use the Chi curling iron."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work","review":"It arrived, I plugged it in....there was a flash, spark...dead. I had already thrown the box away, my mistake. I will say this is my second CHI dryer from Folica...so odds are 50/50 in my scenario about getting a bad one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally Worth it!!","review":"I know over a $100.00 is very expensive for a hair dryer. BUT OMG this is a lifesaver!!! I have EXTREMELY curly and frizzy hair. I hate it. With this dryer I don't even have to use my flat iron and my hair is nice and silky and most of all straight!! I've only had this dryer for a couple of weeks. I know some people have talked about their dryers dying, but so far mine is working great. Love it :o)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken within a year","review":"i took a chance and bought a CHI dryer in july 2008 and it's broken just a little over 8 months later. for a $120+ hair dryer to break within a year, that's poor quality workmanship. it was never dropped, exposed to water, or mistreated in any way. for what it's worth, i wouldn't recommend buying any CHI product to anyone- my CHI flat iron also broke within a year from the date of purchase. what's funny-- if you read the warning labels on the CHI products, the english is very broken. for example, the warning on my dryer read \\"push reset button if not turn on.\\" it begs the question of where are these made and with what quality of products?"},{"rating":"2","title":"WARNING RE: One (1) Year Guarantee/Warranty","review":"I purchased this hair dryer as a Christmas present for my wife. So far, she is happy with it and says that it works good. But I noticed some language in the Owner's Manual that I wanted to warn everyone about. On the last page at the end of the \\"Service\\" section (which is separate from the \\"Guarantee\\" section), the following language appears:\\"The appliance is only under warranty if purchased from a professional salon. The purchase of the appliance will not be guaranteed if purchased through any other outlet including the internet.\\"So be forewarned that if you purchase this product via the internet, the one year warranty will not apply."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything I expected it to be and more.","review":"There are only two settings: high and low. Because I have frizzy hair - I've been taught by my beautician to use less air and more heat. In-other-words: medium air, and high heat. You don't have that option with this hair dryer - because you don't need it. High is high air and high heat; that doesn't frizz your hair. So it really does cut drying time in half. My hair has never looked better and taken less time to do.I had also heard, right after I bought this, that there are fakes being sold on Amazon. So when I got it - I did some research and I can tell you that mine was an authentic Chi."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Gift for your Wife","review":"Had it shipped express for Valentine's Day. Much bigger hit than flowers and/or dinner at her favorite restaurant. Every day when she uses it, she THANKS me again!!! You cannot beat a gift like that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strains at the roadmap analogy","review":"I'm sure there is a great deal of useful information in this book but honestly, it strains so hard to force that information into the roadmap analogy that after a couple of chapters I lost heart. The content is chopped into cute little categories of blocks and streets and signs and rocks and . . . it just gets ridiculous. Personally, I don't want to be amused by the author/editor's cutesy cleverness; I just want to know how to write a television script. There are other books out there that give you the info without making you wade through such a bunch of BS."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ernest Hardy is the the real Notorious F.A.G","review":"That is to say, Free-thinking, Artistic & Gifted with the ability to see nuances that escape most of us. There are few pop culture scribes with bigger nuts. A real Negro with unapologetically low-hanging cojones. Here's to EH's especially funky macadamndamias, almonds, cashews AND pistachios, all of which have much flavor."},{"rating":"2","title":"An absolute TREASURE!","review":"I bought this book in Kauai while visiting my husband's family. It is fabulous! I cannot believe it hasn't become a huge hit with the \\"new generation\\" of natural medicine fans! Maybe they just have not discovered it yet. Now since reading Ms. Gutmanis' book, I have been on a quest for all books on Hawaiian healing or medicine. There are no nicer, happier, more unselfish people anywhere in the world than Hawaii. There must be a reason!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sizzle!","review":"Passion in Wyoming. Tyrell Blaylock came home to find peace---not to wrangle with Celine Lomax, the hot-mouthed firebrand who'd invaded his mountaintop retreat. She would stop at nothing to reclaim her family's land that she believed stolen by the Blaylocks years ago.Tight tale, great passion, spirited characters. Terrific!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is not your Typical book","review":"There is nothing typical in the struggle between two very stubborn and independent people. The sizzling tension between these two characters have you on the edge of your seat watching their growing love for each other play out. The location of the plot incorparates all the local traditions one would see in a small town. The supporting characters keep you smiling with all their sideline antics. The book should definitely be on the buy list."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely","review":"I have a huge collection of Christmas carols, and this classical guitar rendition is tops in my favorites."},{"rating":"1","title":"The scratches and pops and skips before Christmas.","review":"The condition of the master must have been truly pitiful, if they even had the original recording available when they recorded this CD. The quality of this recording is disgraceful. There isn't a selection on this CD that isn't compromised by skips, popping, wobbles, and scratches (on a CD?). Worst $15-bucks I have ever spent. What a waste of wonderful music."},{"rating":"2","title":"fabulous book","review":"What an excellent book--so well researched and comprehensive and so applicable to girls in their 20's. In fact I saw myself in virtually every chapter--I am now 35 and married with 2 kids, and wished this book was availabe when I was in my 20's!! I hope that Ms. Bourland will write go girl guides to people in their 30's, and 40's and am sure that they will sell well. Keep up the good work!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cold Advice","review":"I actually threw this book out after reading it, which is rare for me. I just thought a lot of the advice, such as how to handle old friends and family, seemed a bit cold-hearted. I understand that a person has to look out for herself, but a lot of the advice in this book seemed quite selfish. I would not recommend wasting your time with this book and figure out what's best for you on your own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sandy Vong","review":"I really like this book. I read this book more than 3 times and each time I read it, I get something different out of it. My first time reading this book, I thought there is just a lot of common senses. Then I read it again when I moved out and discover more to this book, whenever I get lost, this book reminds me that it is all about life's ups and downs. I can't wait for her next book to come out."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's just like cliffnotes on life..but far more interesting!","review":"I am so thankful that Julia Borland wrote this book!Every girl in her twentis should read this. It has helped me in my life imenesly. She gave me a wonderful heads up for what is to come during this transition from a young woman to a fully grown woman. I appriciate her honestly and her caring heart. She should be on a stamp!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Read this book! Even if you are no longer in your 20's","review":"Even if your 20's were long ago, you will be heartened and impressed by what our young women are facing and handling today. The initial work of the women's movement brought us a chance to better participate in our culture. Young women today are balancing freedom my generation never had to deal with, with responsibility. This is a heartening and wonderfully encouraging book, full of good advice for ALL ages and BOTH sexes, with humor and personal vignettes on almost every page that make the hard lessons bearable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big Sister-Type Dialogue is Just What I Needed!","review":"I am so glad I found this book when I turned 22. At the time, there was so much \\"stuff\\" going on in my life and Julia Bourland helped me to see that it was all completely normal and it encouraged me to talk to others about my feelings. Her big sister-type role gave words and phrases to the thoughts and feelings I had been experiencing but couldn't quite explain to anyone else. I go back to the book frequently when I need a pick-me-up. I'm getting married in May and just picked up \\"Hitched: The Guide to the First Year of Marriage\\" to prepare me for what to expect. If it's anything like the first book, I know I'll come out of it enlightened!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Helpful info,but...","review":"This book had some great tips in it on jobs, health, and finances. But it was really written for a single woman, who lives in a large city some distance from their parents. There was little to no mention of marriage. The financial suggestions are good for someone in the city, but not a smaller town. Plus, not everyone travels a great distance to see their old friends or parents. I didn't think she had any really info for dealing in that situation. I think she wrote this baseing it on her experience. She could have made it more universal - informative to women who are living in other situations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Merely ok","review":"I thought this book could have been much better. The chapters on dating and jobs are helpful. However, I just can't seem to get past the chapters on body image...To me it felt like the author was trying to say, \\"your gonna get fatter as you get older so you can better accept it now. You'll be even more fatter if you have children, so the sooner you accept this the better\\" Excuse me, but this is supposed to make me feel better about my body?Maybe it would come across better if she said something along the lines of \\"You may find your metabolism slowing down, but thats nothing a little exercise and eating right can't fix\\".I am almost willing to put money on the fact that the author is overweight cause this comes through very much in her writing.That alone just made the book a rotten deal for me.Some parts of the book rang true for me, like examples of how your mind changes as you age. But i really don't think there is much advice worth paying for."},{"rating":"2","title":"The title is not a great one...","review":"If I was the author of this book, I would change the title. It is boring and a little cliche. But, the book itself is a great tool if you have questions about your life in the twenties. I gave the book to two of my friends and they love to read it on the beach and especially if they just got into a fight with their boyfriends and need a little reassurance. Good book, dumb title!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerous advice puts young women's health at risk","review":"This book missed a great opportunity to educate young women about the health risks involved in being sexually active. The author advises living together before marriage but devotes only a few woefully inadequate paragraphs to educating young women about protection from sexually transmitted diseases. Worse yet, the information provided is dangerously incomplete and incorrect, putting the health of young women readers at risk. This book fails to give young women the tools they need to be proactive in protecting their health above all else. Surviving your twenties SAFELY is more critical than surviving your twenties with style."},{"rating":"2","title":"There are no words to express my gratefulness","review":"I read most of the reviews below, and some of them were so right on. This book did acknowledge and answer those questions and emotions I have been feeling lately but not quite able to explain to others. I'm 22, work full-time and go to school full-time, have this new understanding and appreciation for my mom and my girlfriends, etc. Don't get me wrong, I am loving it, but after reading this book - I love it so much more. Words really cannot explain the wonderful feeling I get from reading this book. Go get yours today - you will be thankful!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rutter's Remarkable Choral Capacity","review":"This is another beautiful CD amply demonstrating John Rutter's capacity to achieve a virtually unique choral sound. He seems to be able to obtain a sound from a choir that is at once different and easily recognizable. It has a more lyrical, more ethereal quality to it, particularly with respect to his own compositions, which in this collection, include There Is a Flower, Candlelight Carol, and Nativity Carol.If one is not familiar with John Rutter's work, acquiring this CD, will generate an acquaintance that will soon ripen into a friendship."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best of the best","review":"I,ve been collecting Christmas Music for over 25 Years especially the non-pop genre. This is my desert CD. The Chanticleer and Kings College CDs are very good but this is the summit of quiet meditative music for the season. I always listen to this alone at night and still get thrilled and overwhelmed by it's beauty and sublimity. My favorite track is \\"In the Bleak Mid-Winter\\" simply because of the beauty of the poetry of Rossetti. I always give this as a gift to my friends who enjoy beautiful acapella music.Do yourself a favor and purchase this most beautiful of all Christmas music. I own over 200 Christmas CD'S and this one gets played at least twice a season. The other Rutter Christmas CD's are excellent but not quite in the same class. This is a once in a lifetime album. It is the centerpiece of my own personal celebration of christmastime."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the greatest Christmas albums of its kind.....","review":"This is a mysteriously beautiful album. One striking aspect isn't necessarily which songs Rutter chose, it's the order in which they're performed. There HAD to be some consideration of this because of all the Christmas albums I have, none flows better.Flawlessly performed, expertly interpreted, and touched with just the right amount of emotion and introspection, no other album of English carols comes close to this, and I've had other such albums (the only other one being the LONDON/Willcocks 9 Lessons and Carols from Cambridge) all of which I just dispatched.Being a Music Teacher, I've also used this album on many occasions to have children dance and move to its music (Myn Lying being the most effective). Recorded nearly a quarter century ago, this album will stand the test of time. Absolutely beautiful!Lovely and and captivating in every way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure heaven has been captured in this music! Want to give someone a slice of the beautific vision?","review":"Give them this CD (after you get it for yourself, of course). It is really other-worldly in its resonant beauty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Introduction to an Emerging Region","review":"Alaolmolki has written a great introduction to a part of the world whose strategic importance is becoming clearer as time goes on. The book covers all of the former Soviet \\"-Stans,\\" like Kazakh, Uzbek,Kyrgyz, etc. and provides brief introductory histories on them and their populations. It also covers contenders for regional supremacy which includes the traditional Russia, Iran and Turkey and newer regional players like China and the US. Interestingly, one learns that the goal of US Middle Eastern policy seems more intent on keeping Iran weak and unstable more than anything else. \\"Life After the Soviet Union\\" serves as a good, short-and-sweet introduction to a fascinating (to me, anyway) part of our planet. I read it for personal pleasure and to expand my own knowledge of the area, and though it is a poli-sci text it is very readable. Very much recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aki Takase St Louis Blues ,, awful just awful","review":"First track some of the instruments saturate the speakers, extremely loud compared to other instruments. I guess the Mikes were too close to them. There is not a single track of the 12 on this CD that sound like Jazz, some sound as if they were warming up or tuning thier instruments, except for the the fact that the whole track sounds that way. This aint jazz, I know Jazz and I like jazz for it is my favorite type of music. Aki should be ashamed to have released this CD with her name on it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!!","review":"If you like great flamenco guitar music this one should be ordered today, do not waste another day hesitating. Best cd i bought in the last 4-5 years. And the price is less than 2 packages of cigarretes. Thanks peter pupping."},{"rating":"2","title":"The first HTM album and already a great one","review":"HTM are considered as members of the Canterbury scene, but their music is closer to symph prog than to canterbury. This is a band leaded by Kit Watkins, a keyboardist and flautist that joined Camel after HTM disbanded. The music is almost entirely instrumental (with eyeblinks to Erik Satie or Genesis via fusion �� la Zappa) except two titles. It's a shame that vocals are not featured on all the tunes because they are very good. Nevertheless, the musicians are very gifted and the music very keyboard-oriented. Overall, this is a very pleasant thing to listen to and it's recommended to fans of bands cited above."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Shot Back At Black Juju","review":"B.J.s review almost swayed me,thinking the other reveiews were written by converts and fanboys I almost did not pick this cd up,thankfuly I did.the band is great and sounds much more like a harder National Health than Mr.B would have you belive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as described","review":"The picture and description are not of the same item that is shipped. What arrived were six of the Oral-B Indicator model, a flat brush with no tip or outer bristles."},{"rating":"1","title":"toothbrush","review":"It was not the one I requested. But I kept them anyway. Appearently Oral B has discontinued its crossaction brushes. I cannot locate them anywhere. The tooth brushes are not the ones pictured. The retailer needs to change its picture, since that is what I went by to to purchase this item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong Toothbrush","review":"This is NOT the product advertized. Fortunately, someone else in our household could use these brushes, so we didn't have to go thru a return process."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad for your gums","review":"The extended blue bristles on the sides have a tendency to rip into your gums and cause bleeding. I have excellent dental health, according to my dentist, so I know it's not gum disease. Oral-B generally makes good products but this one is horrible. I recommend the Oral-B Sensitive Soft toothbrush instead. My dentist recommends a soft toothbrush and most commercial soft brushes are still a bit firm. The Oral-B Sensitive is the perfect one and works great for me; I should have never tried out something new."},{"rating":"1","title":"one quarter the bristles of a regular toothbrush","review":"This is the worst toothbrush I have ever used. The size and amount of bristles are about one quarter that of a \\"normal\\" adult sized toothbrush. I feel like I am brushing with a childs toothbrush. These really suck! What a waste of money!Update: 5/23/2011. At least one bristle comes off the brush into my mouth every time I brush with this toothbrush. I've never had this happen with any other toothbrush I have ever used. This product is garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst thing ever made","review":"This product was designed by an artist trying to make an attractive looking toothbrush. It is an absolute joke. The outer bristles are raised about two millimeters above the middle ones- meaning that you have to gnash them into your gums just to make contact between the middle bristles and your teeth. Then there's the beveled white part that sticks waaaaaaay out at the top of the brush that is specially engineered to destroy all the gums in the vicinity of the tooth you are trying to brush. It's like having a squirt gun where 30% of the stream goes where you are trying to shoot, and 70% goes straight into your face. There is no way they could sell this with a clear conscience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very pleased","review":"I thought by having three fans to cool my labtop would be great! My laptop still got hot and the fans out put were very poor. I do not recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grand Opera Libretto","review":"This is a very early but fascinating translation of the French text and is, therefore, very useful in understanding the evolving understanding of this opera."},{"rating":"1","title":"How Sad Can Your Life Be?","review":"Let's get right to the point with this insipid example of cinema sewage - is it worth having your intelligence insulted every few seconds just to get to see a few naked breasts??? If the answer is 'yes', then go for it - you have my deepest sympathies for being so challenged. If the answer is 'no', then cease reading now and find something worthy of your time and cash. If 'American Pie' is the watermark used by the other reviewers to give this swill glowing praise, say no more - it's time to tape the windows and doors, turn the gas on and inhale deeply, hoping your luck is much better in the afterlife than it was here..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reverent and Joyful","review":"I just purchased another copy of the Cambridge Singers Christmas Day in the Morning. During a move, I lost it and was sorely disappointed. My Christmas season cannot be without it. The Cambridge singers, in my opinion, are the best Choral Singers recorded. Under the direction of John Rutter, who composes and/or arranges many of the best old carols as well as his own compositions, directs this choral group in glorious sounds. Rutter's arrangements are truly creative in harmony as well as style. He is able to intertwine their voices as he does the instruments thus producing unusual chords and timing so very pleasing to the ear. I have given this CD as gifts as well. Everyone should treat themselves to this beautiful, reverent, and equally joyful music in anticipation of the coming Christ Child.

But, when the product got to me and i start installing it, I realize that it's too long. I emailed Lund and they informed me that for my truck bed I need part number 99072. I'm highly upset by this and I won't order anything for my truck from here again so I won't get burned like this again."},{"rating":"1","title":"gauging in shipping costs","review":"Takes 12 days to receive an item and $5 for a .99 part? These people are crooks making money on shipping and screwing the customer. I tried to cancel the order when I discovered the shipping cost, but they shipped it anyway. Amazon just watches the whole thing happen and does nothing, that's integrity in todays world?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreasonable Shipping Cost","review":"I have not bought this exact product but needed a new one for my 30-year old blender. I figured amazon.com could come to the rescue but since they don't sell it themselves and bundle shipping costs, this 3rd party supplier seems to charge about $6 shipping / handling per gasket which doesn't make much sense and so I wanted to post this review as a warning. I almost had bought the washers with a bundle of other things before I noticed the extra shipping and handling fees and stopped myself short."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great!","review":"I got this for a vintage futura series. Its 3mm smaller that the circumference of the cap but works just great. Great price, too. I'm so glad I found this. Happiness!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My Waring Blender is Like New Again","review":"This blender is 37 years old. Only thing wrong is the gasket dried out and didn't seal well anymore. This new gasket worked perfectly! For just a few dollars, our blender is ready for the NEXT 37 years!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not fit my Waring blender","review":"If it does not fit all Waring blenders, please make it clear which it does/does not.

It's more grown up than the 2 Series before it, and brings the Stargate Lore to the forefront. The show gets better and better up until the end, and leaves you on the edge of your seat wanting more. I recommend this to any Stargate fan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It\\"s SGU","review":"Sure I was disappointed that they eventually cancelled it but gee folks...it's SGU what's not to love? Watch for yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre episode . . .","review":"When this TV series keeps the action where it should be, i.e. on the Destiny, and in space it is a 4 or 5 star showUnfortunately, this episode spent half the time on earth showing the domestic issues that a couple people had."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"Terrible show. There is a reason they were not allowed to wear any official USAF insignias. Everyone on the ship was whiny and had teenage angst. Should have never been made."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BUY THIS TITLE UNTIL FIXED!","review":"Rated 1 star because of screw-up with file NOT as critique of series or episode see below:Bought the last episode to watch and - guess what - no dialog audio, just music and sound effects. The actors can be seen speaking but no dialog can be heard. All other episodes play normally. Nice way to end 2 seasons worth of story. Amazon-Don't you CRC the the files you sell as a QC measure??Amazon - what's with you lately anyway..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best series since BSG!","review":"This series was awesome! It had everything (action, humor, drama, suspense). It was well written, and had excellent speial effects. It filled the void left by the end of BSG and I'm still disapointed it was cancelled."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great show, cancelled of cousre.","review":"Better the show, the faster the cancel. I think if a show requires the use of your brain for more than five minutes it gets cancelled. TV land is littered with victim TV shows (Jericho, Journeyman and the killed before it's time FireFly). Stargate Universe relies more on cerebral analysis of the crews situation and less on odd looking aliens with weird headgear. Anyone who liked the Battlestar Galatica remake will enjoy this show. Give it a shot."},{"rating":"2","title":"The story arc develops","review":"Too sad they cancelled the series after this season. In season 2, the characters had developed pretty well and I had started liking Wray unlike her previous attempts of taking over the ship forcefully. The ending was sad, really sad! This series should be given more time to develop just like Atlantis. Atlantis first season was YAWN!. Season two of SGA was better, but it took them 5 seasons to become really interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"One of, if not the best episode to date in the series. Action, humor, wit, tech, drama, art, adventure, and oh yea, even a little bit of heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"\\"Great\\". Just checking it out. I don't have any more to say then that. Any more would not help out here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great episode of a great series.","review":"How could sci-fi have killed this series? This episode is extremely suspenseful. The writers seem to have no problem killing off characters so I was holding my breath waiting to see who would not make it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hot Rods to Hell","review":"If your a car nut you will enjoy, I remember watching this tv movie when I was a kid. I thought it was scary but a good movie back in the early 60's. It is corny now, but I hadn't seen it in about 44 years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to believe Dana Andrews sank this low...","review":"Dana Andrews made his mark in 1940s classics like \\"Laura\\" and \\"The Best Years of Our Lives.\\" Two decades later, he was struggling to keep his career alive in low-end \\"B\\" movies like \\"Hot Rods to Hell.\\" Frankly, this movie gives the \\"B\\" label a bad name, because \\"Hot Rods to Hell\\" just plain old-fashioned sucks. The plot is thin, the acting is wooden and the direction and pacing are rock-bottom. At 100 minutes, the movie is at least 10-15 minutes too long. Even worse, it's almost like watching an MGM-produced social engineering movie about youth gone bad and the dangers of driving recklessly.If you're into camp, you'll probably enjoy \\"Hot Rods to Hell\\" on some level. For every other movie viewer, it's a 100-minute sentence in hell."},{"rating":"1","title":"Adults acting childish","review":"Here is Dana Andrews in probably the worst role of his career. In \\"Hot Rods to Hell\\", he plays a moron who gets all huffy about some kids who got a little carried away while having fun. He then proceeds to do his best to annoy them until the confrontation escalates to tragic consequences. Yet somehow the director apparently doesn't think it is his fault.Excuse me. What part of \\"ignore them and they'll get bored and go away\\" did he not understand? This movie makes adults look like idiots. No wonder the 60's turned out the way they did. <Sardonic grin>This film barely managed four stars out of ten at IMDB - just slightly better than \\"Plan 9 from Outer Space\\". I guess I'm not the only one who disliked it.Why did they waste resources and the plastic to put this tripe out on DVD when there are so many other excellent films they still haven't released? How about a Dana Andrews classic like \\"While the City Sleeps\\"? Oh well."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT","review":"Great service and arrived early. Great old movie AND movie of the week.\\" I will use this eller again!!!! This is A MOVIE THAT TAKES YOU BACK IN TIME TO WHEN CALIFORNIA WAS SMALL TWONS IN THE DESERT.\\" Give it a try."},{"rating":"2","title":"A True Classic","review":"I just cannot believe that this masterpiece in movie perfection of standard has been hidden for so long. The story line synergizes the acting and actors to deliver a profound delivery of what can be not only the individual character aspects, but also an insight into the true meaning to life.So many people whom I work with love this movie. We have a Hot Rod to Hell fan club. We go to the site of the road filming at Wilsona Gardens each year in January for a weekend to hold an amateur radio Special Event for each anniversary of release of Hot Rods to Hell, 27 January 1967. This last January we had enough of us to show up (the 40th anniversary) to act scenes from the movie right at the original locations and film them on video. For many others and me this film has been defining our lives since we first experienced it in our early teens, so long ago. This DVD will be a source of happiness, and a treasure in your collection, for many years to come."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thin walls","review":"Wanted to replace a straight section of coolant by-pass hose, but found this hose walls are thinner than the original."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME","review":"I had some Shift boots by harley davidson that i wore for 3 years before these, so they had a high standard to live up to.They met all of my expectations but there was one thing that i wasn't used to at first which was when i first got them they were kind of hard to get on because of the stiff leather and tight ankles. however after 2 weeks of wearing them they come on and off smooth.

Their work at Tufts University is on the cutting edge of studying the benefits of the many phytochemicals in colorful fruits and veggies. Their research and citations are impressive -- these are no diet quacks out to make a buck -- and their message is clearly and persuasively written: Eat a rainbow of deep colored fruits and veggies everyday to take advantage of the virtual pharmacopia of substances provided by them, enhance your health, and help prevent age-related diseases. My children and I have had lots of fun in the produce aisle looking for deep colored new vegetables to try since reading this cutting edge addition to the nutritional field."},{"rating":"1","title":"Malfunctioning Product","review":"This was potentially a really neat buy. Unfortunately, when I first tried the product, it began to smoke and a very unattractive smell (burning plastic) wafted out of the straightener. I have written Revlon and asked for a replacement, however they have not sent a new product or replied at all. Now that I've been waiting a month, I hope they get to my letter and send me a replacement or I'll have to call and request one. I think that this straightener would have been great if it had actually worked...but it unfortunately malfunctioned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Punch Drunk Love meets Crazy Stupid Love","review":"The filmmakers have come up with a wonderful unique story here. I think it's worth your time seeing how one man with anxiety issues deals with his shortcomings in a way I totally can relate to. Plus, it's done with a cinematic flair rarely seen in independent movies with this kind of budget. Think Punch Drunk love meets Crazy Stupid Love. Everyone does a great job here, even the supporting, homeless characters who nearly steal the show."},{"rating":"1","title":"Atrocious!","review":"As a person with social anxiety, I watched this movie because I could possibly relate to it and enjoy it. However, the social anxiety portrayed here in \\"Nerve\\" is completely unrealistic and unremarkable. The main character's anxiety levels fluctuate between psycho and barely anxious. His \\"treatment\\" for social anxiety is also a little unbelievable and makes it seem as though getting through this mental disorder is a cake walk for anyone. The editing in this movie is not so good as well. The film keeps jumping around and leaves the viewer disoriented and confused as to when, where, and what events are happening. However, on a positive note, the actors did a very well job considering the poor writing. The actor that plays as Josh felt alive, vivid, and generally played his part pretty well. Overall, a great idea for a film done rather poorly. Would not recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"A sad let down after much hope!","review":"I have been using this keyboard for several months now. I bought it due to its features, and the rebate offered. I haven't seen the rebate yet. Maybe it takes them over two months to write a check. The action was stiff at first. Now it seems about perfect. The extra function keys don't seem to produce many extra functions. The few that they do produce are great. If I had to do it all over again I probably would choose the new MS Internet keyboard with the extra function keys, and hope that they would work better. In fact after writing this I think that I'll head out tomorrow to do just this. Sorry Digital Research, but a few more days on the drawing table might make this a great product. Your handling of rebates could be improved. To be honest, the lack of a rebate in the mail does leave me a little tainted.
