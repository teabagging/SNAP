Once I got into the workforce and saw the huge amounts of RPG III programs that my company had, I felt a bit dismayed, but Judy has a chapter in the book entitled \\"Maintaining the Past\\", and that chapter helped me out so very much.

It is most directed towards graduate students and researchers but it has a wealth of information for engineers and practicioners who want a higher level of understanding. You can gain as much as you wish from this book both in terms of mathematical theory as well as practical applied information. My only critique would be that there is a large body of work by Dr. R.B. Thompson regarding ultrasonic lamb waves that did not make it into the reference lists. Overall though, the book should become a standard for those working in this industry.

The preset stations are NOT next to the volume, their in the middle of the clump of other buttons, Absolutely STUPID!!!!! Next, you can adjust the brightness of the display on the receiver from the remote from the comfort of your chair but if you want to adjust the bass, treble or balance you have to get up and go to the receiver!!!!

For example, there is no way to preset the FM stations w/o the remote! Lose the remote, or like me get a defective one and many functions are crippled. Also, HK's customer service/technical support sucks. They still have not responded to my fax which complied in all respects to the requirements spelled out on their pre-recorded 800 number -- no humans!Even if it worked, the remote has a very cheap feel -- when the sliding cover is opened it is loose, rattles and feels like it is going to fall offAnother feature I don't like is the freewheeling volume control. To turn the volume way down or up, it takes many spins of the knob. And, since the knob freewheels, there is no easy visual reference as to the volume setting; for this you are dependent on the db display, which goes out shortly after the volume is adjusted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Starts out well, all down hill from there","review":"The blurb on the back of the book is totally misleading.

Even worse is the fact that the author breaks the basic rules of show, not tell, by having the heroine Christabel recall the events after they have already happened rather than lead up to them and then follow through...I say she should have run away with Gussie, or her brother, and dumped Nicholas with his PA Jamie.Totally lacks heat and spice.

I have owned this novel for a while now and have yet to finish it. Shadowplay starts off with a enticing introduction to the intriguing and extremely erotic Christabel. Unfortunatly, after the first few pages, the characters, including Christabel become extremely flat, one sided, and appear to be controlled by some unseen director offstage, as though they were all characters in a bad play. Seriously ladies, don't waste your time, or money on this novel. The Black Lace label is poorly represented with this publication.

The white part of the design looks great, but the little flower looks kinda cheap.

I got it for $5 from an amazon seller and 2. I'm interested in learning about electronic structure calculations. The book seems to be very good at describing setting up the reader for understanding how to do calculations involving bonding , which makes sense given that its a computational chemistry text. The only thing that I'm really having a hard time with is the significant difference in lingo and presentation compared to a physics approach. I feel like this is a common occurance between physics and chemistry; the lack of uniformly treating the topic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't be fooled - not spill-proof","review":"My friend had purchased spill proof bubbles which sounded much like these. I was very disappointed that these are just bubbles in a squeezy container. When you have two 2.5 year olds that means a hand and lap full of bubble liquid.

Not really what I thought I was buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work very well","review":"The bubble bear didn't work very well and I recently threw it out. You squeeze it to push the wand up, but usually the wand would come up with no bubble fluid on it. We would shake it, but it still would come up with nothing on it. I got it to entertain my baby, and he loves bubbles, so time after time without working was frustrating. It worked maybe one out of five times.

It is for good babies who are happy to watch an adult blow bubbles, or for an older child (6 or 7+) who can understand that the bear needs to be squeezed just enough to bring the bubble liquid up but if they keep squeezing then the liquid overflows.

It is AMAZING. So simple too. My hands don't get sticky and I don't have to touch ANYTHING! So awesome. It is easy to use once you get the hang of it. I am not a particular fan of the actual bubble solution (Gymboree's are the best), but you won't have any problems using up what is in there. The bear needs to stay about half-way full to really work well. My cheeks start hurting bc we blow bubbles for so long now. My 6yo son and 2yo daughter love me more now!

For thicker consistency, use milk, soy milk, or (what i use) Silk. It mixes well in a Blender Bottle too. Also, buying from Amazon vs. GNC is a huge difference.

So if you were choosing between vanilla and chocolate with these two... go with chocolate."},{"rating":"2","title":"So far so good, Good taste but mixing needs work","review":"I switched up from Muscle Milk to this. I really did like the taste. It wasn't like downing a milkshake from some ice cream shop but from a whey protein perspective this was top shelf. The only one negative I can say about this, as other reviews have pointed out, it is very hard to mix. I used a regular plastic bottle with a lid and just shook it manually. I still had a tremendous amount of powder that had not dissolved. I kept shaking, no progress. I highly recommend looking into a better mixer or even maybe using a blender. Other than that, this is a great product and am very happy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Item Never Received","review":"This review is directed toward the vendor, Vitamin Grocer.

For getting adequate protein into a cancer patient, this works. Even the chemo-wrecked sense of taste still does like this protein mixed with soy milk and fruits.

It's 23 grams per scoop and it's a very small scoop so you get a lot of use out of each container. I only gave it 4 stars for now because I haven't used it long enough for prominent results."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Tase, Good Protein","review":"I gave this protein powder a 4/5 because it tastes good, has a good amount of protein in it and is a good value. It didn't get 5 stars because the chocolate kind can be a little tricky to mix in. It tends to be a little clumpy and you get globs of it at a time if you dont stir for a long while. the vanilla one had less of a problem with this, but i like the taste of the chocolate powder better. I'm getting a shake mixer, so maybe that will help eliminate the chunks"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"This is a budget friendly protein with a good taste too, as cean be expected from EAS.

I mix it with 2% calcium fortified milk and it's pretty tasty, and there's a lot of protein per serving. Like any protein powder, it has a tough time fully dissolving, but compared to the GNC AMP stuff, it tastes better and it's much cheaper. Personally, I think the claims that GNC makes for AMP are more marketing nonsense than actual clinic research, so I recommend the plain Whey powder."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality","review":"This is by far the best protein price per gram on the market.

However, I needed a cheap, fast way to get protein into my diet for quick breakfasts/snacks. I bought the vanilla and I have to say, this is DELICIOUS. Normally with whey protein you have to doctor it up so you can gag it down, but this stuff is fabulous! I put it in my blender (I don't suggest a shaker for whey protein...ever, it doesn't mix as well) and it froths up and is like a milk shake! Sometimes I put a banana in with the milk and powder but you certainly don't need to. I will be buying this again in bulk and drinking it regularly. If you're going to buy powder, this is the way to go. As good as Muscle Milk."},{"rating":"2","title":"really fun game","review":"I never played the previous versions of this game, the Wii version was the first time I've ever heard of it.

You're playing along and really getting into the flow of the game when someone uses Megastrike. The action stops. The game goes through the same animation cutscene and obnoxious heavy metal riff before getting to the lousy \\"minigame\\" of being a goalie and trying to stop 4 to 6 soccer shots. And it takes so looooong to get past this. Every...single...time. And you can't shut off the feature so you have to be careful not to hit the button combo that causes a Megastrike. Very hard to do. In the end everyone would just groan when it came up and we finally just put it in its box and never played again.We love Maria Golf and Mario Kart and the other wonderful titles but they really blew it on Strikers with the MegaStrike. We sold our Strikers on Amazon for half what we paid for it and were glad to do it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Game is fun, only one big problem though","review":"I like it, but if you're going through the Cup Mode.

With the digital output on this unit, it is easy to make a digital CDR copy of your minidisc of a live recording you have made, so long as you also have a digital optical input on your CD recorder. I found the jog dial easy to use after a little practice. I dislike the fact that line sync recording function from a digital source can only be activated using the remote.

For someone taking a first year dynamics course, this book may not enable you to understand the key principles. The examples are are very poor and do not prepare you to the end of chapter problems. SAVE YOUR MONEY AND DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why is this book still in print?","review":"I don't believe I've ever read a more illogical, poorly organized, overly difficult piece of trash in my life. I'm guessing the only reason my professor used this book is because some of the people in the acknowledgments are affiliated with Penn State. That's probably the only reason anybody uses this book. To anybody who will be required to waste their money on this book, don't even bother reading the sections because they make absolutely no sense and are completely unrelated to the example problems. There is no reason, in my opinion, why a student shouldn't be able to learn and completely understand the material covered in a course soley from reading the textbook. That is clearly not the case with this book, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book ever","review":"Worst book I have ever used in my engineering career.

It keeps your coal contained but it usually not hot enough for my taste and you get flareups real close to your food. If you get the matchlight type charcoal, you can't cook anything until the fire is gone because your grilliput sits too close to the charcoal. That also limits how much charcoal you can put on. I do like the idea of keeping the charcoal contained. Its OK for backpacking and keeping things small but if you are gonna do that, why would you pack charcoal? Or if you are gonna use wood fuel, why not just put the grilliput over the fire on the ground instead of using this bowl. Also the circular bowl means the 4 edges of your grilliput doesn't get heat so you have to put your food in a circular fashion further limiting your cooking area. Its a nice idea though."},{"rating":"2","title":"God rides a Yamaha and is a winner","review":"Cool book, hard to put down once you get started. I found it to be thought provoking and amusing.

This books is so overwritten.

Each step of the creative writing process, from brainstorming to final draft and submissions, is de-mystified and broken down into a series of manageable activities. The most important thing he taught me is that writing, like most things worth doing, is simply a matter of frequent practice. Do the work and the muse will come to you!

Someone compared Paul Brown to Norman Brown - there's no comparison there, Norman is a much better musician and sings in key too. The songwriting is nothing to write home about and that electronic voice effect on Don't Let Me Be Lonely Tonight should feel like pins and needles to James Taylor, who crooned it so softly. Save that stuff for Cher, ok? There's no real swing or groove here, that would require a real drummer (heaven forbid!) I'd rather the guy play solo than use cheap backup like that. Go get some Wes Montgomery, George Benson, Ronny Jordan, or especially Zachary Breaux instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I ordered this CD with much anticipation.

The boredom inhered in the slow movement of the plot and its utterly predictable contours once it started moving. The infuriating aspect of the book lay in the denseness of its heroine. She was so impervious to hints--hints that caused me to figure out what was really going on hundreds of pages before she did--that it made me want to shake her. The heroine was credulous and shallow, and lacked any of the charm that can redeem novels like this even if the plots are contrived and ridiculous.The plot of this book is thin to transparency, and its characterizations are charicatures gone wrong. Everyone in it is shallow beyond belief. In short, do not waste your time and/or money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Done","review":"This is one of the best books I have ever read.

In re-creating and re-imagining events and characters from a watershed period in Indian history, weaving between fact and fiction - the book makes us question the essence of our culture, our values and our philosphy; in short, our inheritance.

I could barely afford to go across town for groceries. A maid? Forget about it. I put the book aside and picked it up many years later and still couldn't relate to it. This book was mostly a \\"live the way I live or you aren't Christian enough!\\" book. No thanks.

If you are a person who studies the Bible daily, belongs to a Bible study group, or wants to set up your own study group, and organize your entire life accordingly ...then there is no better book for you.

Songs from Black Mountain is by far Live's lightest album, but hey, unless your deaf you've noticed Ed Kowalczyk is in a happier place these days, cry baby's that complain about this album because it's not \\"dark\\" enough should probably grow up a little. For those of us that have grown up with the band and can relate to thier progressions, each album feels like more of a soundtrack to that era of our lives than just another record that fades with time.Songs from Black Mountain is a truly inspirational work of art. Buy this album, you won't regret it, especially if you enjoyed Birds of Pray."},{"rating":"2","title":"live rules","review":"I'll have to admit Im very biased because in my eyes live can do no wrong. I am a die hard live fan. This album is propably right where there last album left off. Its not even close to there best. However the albums they made in the early day's are classics. Its hard for bands in there older age to create that same kind of magic. This album has some classic sounding live songs like show, and river bolth solid songs. I wish they would put a couple dark rock songs on there albums still. Ed's gettin soft in his old age, but that's not abad thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like Bon Jovi, a failed attempt to 'grow up'","review":"While the two bands have completely different roots, they've fallen into the same trap. Having great success at writing 'adult' ballads, their default songwriting now *starts* in that mode, forgetting their harder, more emotional rock roots.Doing business that way (business instead of music), a band forgets how to rock. Any attempt to retrace their steps becomes as awkward as Dad \\"hanging out\\" at a pizza party. Dad brought \\"Birds of Pray\\" and SFBM to the party. And while Dad might enjoy grooving to this harmless mellow vanilla sound, the young and young at heart just stare uncomfortably, eventually shuffling on to something cooler, better, and real."},{"rating":"1","title":"LIVE sells out! Too Bad they used to be great!","review":"just the worst main stream attempt Ive ever heared. aweful, nithing like the old albums, not even close it is going straight down to the donation place YUK,YUK do not waste your money"},{"rating":"1","title":"Songs From The Cack Mountain","review":"First of all, I had to give this album 1 star because there is no option to give NO STARS!!When i heard this album, it was the final straw for me! I'll never buy another LIVE album again! The songs may as well be written for some 'Boy Band'- It is literally shocking... What happened Guys? I remember tracks such as Freaks, Ghost, T.B.D, Lightning Crashes, White Discussion and 10,000 Years, and although i dont want Live to stay the same and write in style I like,I believe they have had a great idea of 'lets make a lot of money from this while we still can'!?!The music on this album is simplistic, but not in a good way! I think that its 3 bad albums for LIVE now- I'm just gonna presume they died after 'The Distance to Here'- Even 'TDTH' has bad elements within it...Live- YOU GUYS STINK MAN"},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge dissapointment","review":"The thing I love about LIVE's previous CDs is that every one was completely different from the previous ones. They were always expanding and trying new things, so it was always with great anticipation that I unwrapped each new CD and popped it in the player. Songs from Black Mountain was a huge disappointment. There's nothing new, and every song sounds like every other song, and they're all BLAND. It makes me sad.They did such great work on their previous label and with their previous producers, so I have to wonder why they switched. It's not an improvement. Here's hoping they can find whatever it is that they lost and start making great music again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who is this, it's not the Live I know","review":"When I saw this album on Amazon I wondered why I hadn't heard it on any of the radio stations that usually play Live. So I bought it and found out why. This album is crap. About 4 years ago Ed found God. I personally think that's great but it's had a horrible impact on his music. This album is some wierd cross between adult contemporary and christian rock. Both are fine, they just aren't my thing. It's really sad because Live really used to bring it. Now, well...I'd tell you to see for yourself but don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chunderama","review":"Funny how a settled family life can be one of the worst influences on the music of a rock musician. After he celebrated the subsequent end of his spiritual journey with the upbeat, anthemic hymns of 1999's 'The Distance to Here', Ed Kowalczyk no longer seemed to have anything to offer to fuel the creativity behind Live's music. What remains - and is accentuated most on this effort - are a series of factory-assembled tracks manufactured specifically for the blooming adult-contemporary market. The other band members do their best to work with the material supplied, but nothing on this album has the substance or inspiration of the band's work in the 90s."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great Live album","review":"This is yet another great studio release by these guys. As usual, Ed's awesome songwriting skills are what makes this a great album to listen to. He writes interesting lyrics and sings them with lots of power and emotion. The music is solid too again being led by Ed's tight song arrangements. If you're already a fan of these guys you will definitely like this album. If you're new to these guys then this is a good place to start."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 or 3 decent songs...","review":"thr first 2 albuns by live are good, and secret samadhi got good songs...but SONGS FROM BLACK MOUNTAIN must be the worst album by live...besides 2 or 3 decent songs, the rest of the songs are incredibly mellow with uninspired mellow lyrics...TERRIBLE! The worst album by live..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't believe this is the same band that recorded Secret Samadhi","review":"I'm a completist, and despite warning from knowledgeable critics, I spent $4 on a used copy of this CD. Even at that price, this album is not a bargain. It's like a vapid power ballad producer got ahold of LIVE and put canned material in front of them. There isn't so much as an interesting riff on the album. It's swishy lyrics backed with cookie cutter power ballad music in the verse/chorus/verse/chorus/chorus vein."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointed","review":"What ever happened to live.

Aside from a track or two, this album is boring, generic pop-rock garbage. In fact, listening to this album, I was embarassed to think that this is the same band that released \\"Throwing Copper\\" and \\"Secret Samadhi\\", the former being one of the best rock albums of the 90's and one of my favorite albums of all time.Sorry to say this, but I think I'm done with this band. I forgave them for the abysmal \\"V\\", but never in a million years did I think they'd manage to put out something even worse."},{"rating":"1","title":"La vulgaridad ha llegado hasta los LIVE!","review":"Decepcionante la vuelta de los chicos de Kowalcyk.

Don't buy this album if you expect it to rock like any of their previous albums. It doesn't. I couldn't even make it through the second song and I like all types of music. Wow. I read another review where they hope Live will make another heavy dark album...me too. Although, I sorely doubt it."},{"rating":"1","title":"black indeed","review":"how can one band go from Throwing Copper, one of the greatest albums ever, to this, the massive decline in quality is of epic proportions. so what if you have found a god to call your own, he's bringing you down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Live Does it Again!","review":"I found Songs from Black Mountain to be some of the band's best work ever. The disk contains a good mix of music. From Pop Rock(Mystery, The River, Wings) to hard rock (Night of Nights, Show, Sofia), I highly recommend picking up this CD, you will be entertained."},{"rating":"2","title":"SO VICIOUS","review":"This is the second Arsonists CD, and it is so vicious ...

You can rock Arsonists any day of the week, and this CD isnt any different."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure Hip-Hop","review":"This a album is pure Hip-Hop in a very genuine and raw way. The beats glow with energy, from the second \\"lay low\\" starts it becomes apparent that this is not a boring album. The three M.Cs spit some seriously complex rhymes with an energetic, angry flow. Jise One particularly stands out.The beauty of this album is that it holds an underground vibe without having any corny \\"artsy\\" elements and stays to true to hip-hop themes.If you're not big on the corporate rap garbage of today, but aren't a fan of cheesy toned-down \\"creative\\" rap either, this album should hit the spot."},{"rating":"2","title":"FRESH!","review":"This is one of those rare albums that you can listen to all the way through, with a good balance of hype and mellow tracks.

I loved \\"As the world burns\\" and naturally I went out and bought \\"Date of birth\\". Wasted money I say. The only thing I've heard from any ofthe Arsonists members that's any good since \\"As the world burns\\" is Freestyle's guest appearance on Looptroops cd \\"Modern Day City Symphony\\" so I would rather recommend that instead of this cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"MIA CD please","review":"It came in a very timely manner. However the book came with a CD and if your not sending it, would have been nice to know. Book was more abused than stated as well. Thanks for sending so fast though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Pelican Case","review":"I bought this because the description says that it's a Pelican Case. If you take a look at the dimensions and specs, you can tell that they were pulled from the Pelican 1450 description. This product, on the other hand, is a cheap knock-off brand that doesn't even match the description. Though the price may seem attractive, it is way too much to be paying for a case that doesn't work properly. The foam smells bad and it is very soft so it doesn't hold your belongings in place quite right. I bumped it into a table once and the whole side now has a giant scratch. Definitely wouldn't trust this for protecting my equipment. Get yourself a genuine Pelican 1450 or a Nanuk 920 which will protect your equipment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Real Junk. Good to present it to some one you don't like","review":"I usually do not review any products. I hated it so much that I wanted to review it any way. I do not own exactly the same piece, but own a similar model. It's bulky with cheap looks. You got spend at least 2 to 3 hours to figure out how to set the time.

When the small metal USB connection piece broke off and fell into the hard drive, I called customer service. The Seagate/Maxtor representative bought me through the entire process of replacing my product, and then, as she's collection my credit card information...apparently my warranty has expired. She neglected to mention this until 45 minutes into the conversation.I was transferred to her manager, who essentially told me that there was no way I could get a replacement.My issue is that Seagate is not deeming themselves liable for Maxtor products purchased prior to Seagate buying the company. That is absolutely ludacris.I will never buy another Maxtor/Seagate product, due to the unreliable customer service and faulty products. I urge others to refrain as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't completely back you up...","review":"Just as another reviewer warned, the 'outlet' thingy that you plug your usb cable into easily becomes loose and renders the drive useless.And, as another reviewer mentioned, the software is very clunky.

I recommend purchasing this if you want a secondary drive or need one for unimportant documents-- dont use this one as your only backup or your most important documents.

The best thing in\\"Harris\\" is a very unusual Jamal solo: his introduction to \\"Folklore\\"; first alone, and then as a duet with bassist John Heard. Unusual as it is, it is absolutely unique in his recorded output. Unfortunately, though, this very solo appears severely edited and mutilated on the CD edition of this live recording. Since \\"Folklore\\" is by far the most interesting track on this album, I strongly recommend the vinyl to anybody interested on this great live music. A huge deception for a huge fan.

I later learned that my sister had bought the turntable in 1995 and I was amazed because it lasted for more than 10 years, collecting dust in a closet, and it still plays records as well as it was when my sister had bought it.

There are songs in here from groups as far away as Uruguay, New Zealand, Spain, and Japan!The color, excitement, and sheer creativity of the psychedelic era shines through every track.The influence of British groups like The Who, early Pink Floyd and The Rolling Stones can be heard on the very first tracks, and it's a safe bet that if you enjoy them, you will enjoy this set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Catching up on history","review":"I love Nuggets I & II(Children of Nuggets will be up next to listen to this week).

These volumes have clued me in on how much great music I missed the first time around in the 60's. Most of the songs hold up on their own, and should have been heard more widely on these shores. Between the quality music, and the informative notes, this is a must-hear for lovers of Rock."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very disappointing sequel","review":"I loved the first Nuggets box, but this one blows chunks. These songs were forgotten for a reason. There are maybe a handful of catchy tunes, and the rest are boring as all heck. The type of music is fundamentally different from the first Nuggets, which was mostly hard-rocking garage; I guess you'd describe Nuggets II as psychedelic. Regardless, there's nothing on here remotely comparable to, say, \\"Psychotic Reaction\\" or \\"I Had Too Much to Dream\\" from the first box. Just dull, inspired, tuneless, obscure dreck."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not rock'n'roll","review":"I LOVE Nuggets I. The only reason there is a Nuggets II is because the record company is getting greedy. Nuggets I is a compilation of vinyls and has been a classic for a long time... And people love it because the music is so great. Nuggets II is just another way for them to earn another buck. If you are really interested in garage music, forget about Nuggets II - it's all non-american music (and I'm not american either) but they just don't get it."},{"rating":"1","title":"As dull as the original is essential","review":"The original Nuggets celebrated the democratic spirit of creation and the enotions of lust and anger. This collection dabbles in future stars (of prog, the antithesis of the original's punk) and wifty hobbitry, while never really developing a focus.Sure the Creation and the Easybeats are brilliant, and there are a decent number of fine tracks, but most of this is European b-sides by future ice skating keyboard players. The German stuff isn't even good as a novelty. The one track from Japan shows a route that might have been better explored, ditto one in Portugese (though it doesn't fit even this box's vague direction).Hollywood can produce better and more focussed sequels than this. Shame on Rhino!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A dreadful mess featuring two gems","review":"As if the concept of this project weren't strange enough, the bulk of the artists approach their contributions subjects too literally making this a quite painful listening experience. Particularly guilty are the tracks by Klashnekoff, Scott Walker, Stephen Merritt, & Cody ChesnuTT. What makes this CD so frustrating is that it contains two tracks that are brilliant creative gems by Imogen Heap & Rufus Wainwright. These contributions shine as among those artists best works and are the only reason to give this disc a listen or purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"There are some big indie names on this album and when I read about the Margate Exodus project the music seemed like a promising outgrowth.

I bought it once and hated it, but after reading these glowing reviews and being a fan of their excellent Face Buff, I gave it a second try. Both times, the same experience:It has a light and fresh feel, but it's too thin for me. It's watery, clear, and does not grip the skin. I found it difficult to know where I had applied it, and consequently, I often shaved the same spot several times which caused minor irritation. In other spots, my new blade would hydroplane right over the stubble, again requiring repeat passes. Every time I used this product I'd touch my face later in the day, and find a rough spot that I missed in the morning.Beard Lube isn't for me, but obviously, a lot of folks love the stuff.

Upon mounting the scope on a Crosman 760, the elevation was about 12\\" low and would not move regardless of how many turns in either direction of the adjustment screw.If it would have worked like the other, I would have been happy with it.

No elegant poems of love; no countryside-dreaming; no evocation of the Classics nor references to the past. On the contrary: urban life; the alienation brought aboout by capitalism; the angst of poor urban dwellers; alcohol and drugs. Poetry is no more just the search for beauty through words. Now, it is a vehicle for the expression of the individual. Content is more important than form, and therefore Baudelaire gets rid of the constraints imposed by verse, even free verse, and lets his soul spill out in a not lyrical, but dark manner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Evocative","review":"These prose poems were my first experience with Baudelaire. I didn't know what to expect, but they're pretty good. They are often vague, but even then manage to be evocative.

It ran well for about five minutes, but after that period, it was simply impossible to set a constant speed using the \\"strobodots\\" no matter how hard or often I tried. It seems pretty obvious that there must be some consistent defect in the motor or the control hardware, at least in examples coming to market in the past couple of months. At the very least, Sony's quality control is extremely disappointing for this model. I've arranged to send my unit back for a refund.

I though I got a lemon until I read the previous review."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality belt drive","review":"I thought I would take a risk with this turntable after reading the warnings from the other reviews about the variations in the speed of the belt drive. This causes noticeable changes in the pitch of the recording making it sound like your guitars or singing are out of tune, and is more noticeable towards the end of the record. You can actually see the strobe dots speeding up and slowing down! I have sent mine back to sony for a refund. If it wasnt for this problem, it would have been a good turntable with solid construction and decent sound.I have had good experiences with sony but this is one that isn't one of them.

I have two of these turntables in my home. One is fine and the other suffers from the known issue if having poor motors. The Sony guy said that since mine is out of warranty, they could only offer to exchange it for a refurbished unit at $112. Ha! It is out of warranty by about two months and only has about 3 hours of use on it. It suffers from the inconsistent speed problem that others complain of here. So . . . if you buy one of these -- put LOTS of time on it within the first year and send it back within that time for warranty repair if you have problems.

(Excuse me: it does play records.) I've had some dissatisfaction with Sony products before but this finishes my Sony purchasing.

In order to get the 45 to sound right, I had to put it on 33 and when I tried to play a 33 record it sounded like a 78!! And then the turntable STOPPED rotating completely.

Don't worry, this doesn't keep him on the straight and narrow. There should be enough violence, crime, and sex to keep fans of the genre happy.The writing style could have used some work (or maybe just a better edit).

The way it is written evokes great sympathy and pity in the reader for both the Colonel and his wife, but particuarly the former with his child-like innocence and continuing sense of hope. It is not an inaccurate description of how many lives were (and still are) at the time in Colombia...therefore you realise that there's always someone else worse off than yourself!

I couldn't get it to work with my DSL out of the box. I called tech support (India) and they were no help. I finally connected my old router, downloaded the latest firmware and got it working on my own only to find that performance was horrible. Wireless range and data transfer speeds are sub-par and Internet performance was worse than my previous router. It barely works with my Xbox 360, I had to modify multiple setting just to get my xbox to connect to live. I strongly advise you not to waste your time and money on this product. I replaced my WRT350N with a DLink DGL-4500 and had it up and running perfectly in 5 minutes. Performance, range and internet on the Dlink have all been great.

Even with the DD-WRT firmware the Wireless N wouldn't work. So I had been using all my N devices as G. Used it for 5 years and it finally died. I was copying large video files over the gigabit LAN and the hardware couldn't handle it. I now have an ASUS RT-16N it works perfectly. I had to upgrade the firmware on the ASUS to the latest.

After several months, it finally died and I couldn't get it up anymore, i.e. never able to get to the http admin home page.Luckily, it has 3 years warranty, instead of getting a refurbished one of the same model, Linksys is sending me a refurbished WRT600N which suppose to me more expensive than the WRT350N. Not sure if it is sure but that's what the email said.But I am not so excited about getting the WRT600N either. Based on the review from other people, the WRT600N does not seem to be any better.

After buying nothing but Linksys for my home network and recommending them to countless people, it is time to move on to something else. These people are terrible. The only thing worse than the awful hardware, is the awful support. By the way, if you open it and it doesn't work, they'll make you pay to ship it back to them. That's after weeks of discussions even after it is clear the box isn't working. They finally did send me a new one, to replace the router that failed after three weeks, that was a replacement for the earlier model that only worked 6 - 9 months. The new one didn't even work out of the box, so I am looking for something other than Linksys. By the way, I have a Masters degree in Information Systems, It's not too complicated, it's just poorly made, and poorly supported. and I don't work for a competitor, just an unsatisfied customer."},{"rating":"2","title":"3rd party firmware","review":"Run solid with DD-WRT.

I was looking forward to the external USB storage connection as well as the suppossed speed increase. I provide IT support for a major corporation and I consider myself to be a fairly advanced user. I made every attempt to make this product work with some stability with absolutley no success. Updated firmware, various configurations of Wireless settings etc. From what I can tell the biggest problem is that this product really does not know how to deal with any other wireless networks that might be near by. I get \\"Excellent\\" signal strength, at least that's what the Linksys utility says, but I get only 6 Mbps throughput and the connection drops every few minutes.

Period. Upgrading the firmware will not resolve the issue.If you have folders and files on an existing USB drive and then attach it to the router, they will not appear as they should. Directories will appear as subdirectories of others in cases where they really are not. In other words, directory A will appear beneath directory B even when it is not! It's simply WRONG.Also, it is absolutely impossible to assign read/write permissions for different users to different folders. 75% of the time the router software will not save your changes.

Unfortunately, it didn't take long to realize the author had pretty much wasted the interesting premise through pedestrian (and worse, at times amateurish) writing. All of the characters, except perhaps Father Christmas, are pretty annoying and cliche'ish. Father Christmas is just cliche'ish.

My response to that is, try having some standards for yourself! It's not a question of being or not being a Christian! In my eyes, Edguy has lowered the standards of their music to the nu-metal level, and quite honestly, the band is better than that!

There's even one place where Jesus confesses to being in love with her. He then tells her he can't be with her and she has to live her life without him.

It was a makeshift studio session with his working band of the time that included Emanuel Paul on tenor sax rather than the traditional clarinet player. This was a band that played all kinds of tunes including pop songs of the day and usually played for dancers in taverns and road houses. Louis Nelson would play lead on his trombone while Emanuel Paul played notes all around him. Kid Thomas would pitch stacatto bursts from his trumpet at periodic intervals that would embellish the melody. No other New Orleans band played this way. Kid Thomas was certainly an original and much of his musical output is worth owning. This disc is a must have for Kid Thomas fans and anyone else even remotely interested in great New Orleans jazz."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid CD","review":"The lead singer/guitarist in this band Fred is actually now in the band Taking Back Sunday where he plays guitar and does some back up vocals. However, this band is completely different than Taking Back Sunday. They play an Emo rock that sounds a lot like the old Promise Ring meets pop punk. The vocals are sung very passionately and are rather smooth and laid back at times. Fred is the principle song writer and has a degree in jazz guitar from Temple University in Philadelphia, PA so you can here so Jazz influence in this as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Portability","review":"I bought this camera because of its size. It is a great camera to lug around. However the telephoto/wideangle button is clumsy at best. The one second hesitation on the playback mode is very distracting and annoying. I do not think the quality of the recording is as good as my old dcr-9."},{"rating":"1","title":"Materialism run amok","review":"The author attempts to explain changes in the geopolitical environment through evolution. This explanation is both materialistic in its view of human society and stands unproven by the author. While the author uses the term evolution with abandon, he never explains why evolution is the explanation. Furthermore, he never deals with the moral consequences of essentially accepting social Darwinism as true. The author sees something happening in geopolitics but he can't explain it effectively. Still better off reading Clausewitz."},{"rating":"2","title":"How to Take Out Goliath","review":"How to Take Out Goliath\\"The Sling and the Stone: On War in the 21st Century\\" by Thomas Hammes is an analysis of how the U.S. military has not successfully met the challenge of fourth-generation warfare.

It did return a message that black ink cartridge was installed improperly. Re-installed it several times and still got messages. Friend told me same story (another model) and that it would correct itself. That it did, message is gone. So...so far, so good. If you get a chance to buy it cheap, don't hesitate.

However, the 960C is a different beast. I have tried two 960C HP printers and both are substandard. The first would not feed paper at all. The second folds, rips and otherwise damages paper every few print jobs. It cannot print envelopes at all without jamming. Although the print quality is good, I am returning this printer to the seller. The frustrations of clearing the paper feeder several times each day are not worth it! I advise against purchasing this particular printer."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Printer is better than the last one I had","review":"This is my second HP Deskjet printers and this one beats the pants off of the first one. The color is much better, installing the cartridges is easier etc. I recommand this printer for any home or office user. I was really surprised when the print outs did not smudge like in the old HP660 series.I work with Hewlett-Packard products at work and just bought their HP Pavilion series PC for home use. Had to use their service and they were great even when my old HP 660Cse printer was ready for the trash can. Hewlett-Packard is the best to buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad! Broke first day...","review":"Well, this was pretty ugly. I bought this printer happily for a mere 200 dollars, and hoped it would work fine. I had owned an Hp720c before, and that served me well, untill it toppled off my stand and broke. I soon after bought the Deskjet 960c, setup was a little lengthy, although almost fully automated, everything was just fine. It printed two amazing prints on photo paper. I was overjoyed at the quality and outstanding speed. Next morning, I tried printing a 20 page text document, and it took some time for the printer to process the request, although I use a USB connection; following that, it printed the first 5 pages, ripped the next two, then jammed. I tried using different paper, everything. Still, no luck. I wouldn't buy it if I were you, go for something more reliable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not too happy!","review":"I installed this computer last night (fairly easy) and printed two test pages.

Upgrade from MS OneNote 2007 was quick and smooth. It does what it says it will do, and does it well. It allows the user to define the names of the notebooks and the way each of them is organized. It provides a perfect place to store all the odds and ends that need to be filed, but that don't fit anywhere else. I love the screen clipping feature! I recommend OneNote 2007 without reservation.

Microsoft (as usual) pulled a fast one and dropped Outlook 2007 from the Home Student version of Office, but they added OneNote instead...but don't worry, you can still use Outlook 2003 with it so you get the best of all worlds.Home And Student Version of Office give you a TON more bang for your buck..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, comprehensive review","review":"Got this book, used it in conjunction with the subject study guide from NCEES and a short review class offered by my university, and passed with no problems.

This fact alone, that fact being casinos are BEGGING you to come play at their tables and play blackjack the John Patrick way, should tell you everything you need to know about a John Patrick gambling system.There are many good books in the Amazon listing.

They can handle being outside (ambient moisture, temp, wind, etc...) but aren't meant to be directly in the path of rain or snow.They are only really usable outside if you have large eaves/overhangs under which to place them.The only reason I didn't give this item 1 star is because I probably could have found all this out if I had read the Amazon advertisement enough... and at least they seemed well packaged before I shipped them back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but the LS200 is Better","review":"These speakers (LS400) are pretty good. However, even though they are rated at 100W, and the LS200 at 50W (Both from Audio Source), we believe the LS200 speakers reproduce the audio frequencies more accurately. Both use the same 4\\" polypropylene woofer, but the tweeter arrangement is quite different. This undoubtedly is responsible for the better performance of the LS200. (The LS200 uses a mid-range and a high frequency tweeter as opposed to a single tweeter in the LS400.) The 50W capability of the LS200 should be adequate for most applications.The mounting brackets supplied with both speakers are nothing to brag about, but, the LS400 brackets are made of plastic while the LS200 are at least made of steel.The spring clip wire terminals work well (the same on both). These same clips are used on some much more expensive speakers.These speakers are a good buy but the LS200 speakers are a bargain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very, very cool!","review":"Great sound at a great price.Don't try to push the bass too hard or it will distort.

I am still in dispute with the company as I did not use the product so I cannot make a comment on the product itself but what is being advertised. I gave the product one star because I had to give it something so ignore that part of the review because I did not use it.

After about 1 1/2 years of limited use (I also have a VHS player) the sound quit in the middle of a movie. Actually it was so low that you had to put your ear up to the speaker to hear.

In late December 2002 we watched a movie and the sound cut out to the point that we had to turn up the stereo and T.V. very loud to hear it. Intermittently the sound would come back to full strength, which nearly blew out our speakers. Upon calling tech support they said it was broken and to have service performed. Considering the warranty expired and service will be more than a new player, we will buy a new one. We are not likely to purchase a Toshiba considering we were only able to watch about 15 DVD's before this one broke."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Piece of Junk!","review":"...This unit died after a few months of very minimal use.

It is hooked through an Optimus Receiver to a Zenith TV, I have recorded from an audio CD to a cassette tape (JVC Cassette deck) with great results. The picture is terrific, the sound is excellent, and it has played audio CD's and CD-R's with no problem. I've haven't tried the MP3 or CD-RW in it yet, but suspect there will be no problems. No problems with New, Used or Rented DVD's. The remote has features I probably won't ever use and the basic stuff is easy to figure out (I'm not a big manual reader.) The hook-up was a snap (I just had to remember to switch the TV to Video1 source instead of Ant/Cable.) Nothing to it.

I did not find any significant cost reduction between various retailers, except for \\"gray market\\" lenses. If one purchased a US warranty for these imported lenses, the total cost exceeded that of a new American version. So I opted to buy from Amazon, a trusting vendor and saved on the taxes.The performance of this lens is quite impressive. Just taking simple snapshots, one cannot help but see the extremely sharp imagery. Close ups are very very sharp and because of the VR feature, I was able to take most of my pictures hand held and I suffer from a tremor.On the downside it is large, heavy and pricey, but from what I can tell it is the standard by which all others are compared to. The 200mm Micro (macro) is also quite impressive but unfortunately its cost was a little much."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's all about the glass...","review":"With all of the emphasis on megapixels these day, it is easy to forget that to get good image quality you need good glass. The 105 Micro-Nikkor is about as good as it gets. Like many other photographers, I use this lens for portrait work. A razor sharp lens, the focal length is not too great so that it compresses features, but long enough to let you reach out for a good portrait and easily blur the background. Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb Macro Lens","review":"This excellent MACRO or MICRO or Portrait lens, opens up a field of photo opps that is new to this photographer.Flowers, insects and miniatures, to name a few. The depth of field is close to an inch when needed. The VR makes handheld shots in the field. The two range limiters are helpful.The lens is larger and heavier than I expected, but so is versatility better than I expected."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Features, Fast lens","review":"Very Sharp.

Macro work has a learning curve, which I'm only starting to master.I had read about focus breathing issues with this lens, but have found it to be no issue at all for me. Getting a subject still enough and enough depth of field are far more challenging for me.As a bonus, I find that this lens does great as a medium distance portrait lens, where the VR and f/2.8 aperture really help. This lens is weakest at distance, where sharpness can be a little off, at least in my sample of this lens.Overall, the macro works great, and the medium distance capabilities are a pleasant bonus to this great lens."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice lens","review":"I am new to macro photography. Depth of fields is critical so a tripod helps. Great lens/tool.

IMHO, this lens is an ergonomic nightmare: it is simply way too heavy and fat for a 105mm telephoto. Plus the big bayonet hood makes it look and handle like a 300mm or similar long telephoto.Besides bulk of this lens, I had trouble with focus hunting where it would occasionally rack 2-3 times from infinity to the close limit before finding the focus point. This is unacceptable for a lens at this price point.I returned it because I dreaded carrying this 1.5 lb brick. I really wanted to like it. The images were great, when it focused."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Macro Lens","review":"I got this lens for my kit to take macro photos. I love it. It is also excellent for head shots. This lens holds great color and is super sharp. I am glad to have it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great lens!","review":"I bought this lens a few months ago, and it quickly became my favorite! It takes exceptionally clear close-up photos. I use it for photos of butterflies and bees and other small nature shots; but this lens is also great at landscape shots. I took it to the county fair and got some great action shots of people on rides as well as a really good night shot of the spinning Ferris wheel. This is a truly fantastic lens."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Lens!","review":"This lens is really sweet! I wasn't sure about buying it because of the price, but research on the lens convinced me. I am not disappointed. The auto focus works like a charm, and for tripod shots, like moon shots, I can turn the AF off on the camera body (Nikon D60) and on the lens to take really great shots. One word of caution though, make sure to turn the VR off for tripod work! I also took some really nice shots of my oldest son and some landscape photos with it so far. The lens is sharp, and it makes a great addition to any kit."},{"rating":"2","title":"stunning portrait lens","review":"have had this lens for over a year, using it on a Nikon D80. it's performed extremely well. in very rare cases it's a little slow to focus, specifically in low-light conditions. would buy it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works like a charm","review":"I upgraded from the older Nikon 60mm macro and can see the difference in image quality in the viewfinder.

I have read many, many books on gymnastics and individual gymnasts, but this book I can't even drag myself through. It's nothing more than page after page of scores, no story, nothing. The writing was poor and who needs every score for each competitor? I would not call this book a biography, it's a statistical compilation of Kim's meets. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely boring & dull","review":"I found this book at a used bookstore and I was so disappointed. I am a RABID gymnasics fan, but this book could not hold my attention at all. It basically chugs along, describing meet after meet after meet after MEET...score after score after score...and the writing was contrived. In the back of the book the author lists her sources, which mainly consist of past articles from International Gymnast magazine and televised gymnastic meets. There's nothing new or fun or exciting in here, and you definitely do not get inside Kim Zmeskal's head to see what motivates her. If you were a fan of gymnasics during Kim's career, you already know everything in here already (except for all the painful recitations of numerous scores from numerous meets which the author dutifully reports).

The party of the New Deal and the party that exposed the \`missile gap' and began the Vietnam War. The Party that took down Nixon and finally found victory in 1992.

CD's were shipped mislabeled and don't work right, etc. Tech support has no 800 number and e-mail tech support still hasn't responded to my requests for help. A patch could clear many problems up, but since Mindscape and Broderbund became one company, I don't know when that'll be.

In addition, the online help didn't work. As the software is relatively inexpensive I decided to upgrade to 8.0 Platinum. Well, so far I have been unable to run the 8.0. After installing the software the program starts to launch but then aborts with some invalid page fault error message. So far no response to my request for technical assistance via email.

Readers will get a distorted view of the 101st Airborne Division from this book.It seems as if the author had tried to avoid military service and had a bad experience when he finally got into uniform. He should be grateful that he was selected for a job in the rear rather than being assigned to the engineer battalion, where he would have faced real danger. I lost several friends who were in the 101st at the same time.

In Wetland Riders he's exposed this blatant resource grab for what it really is; a well-coordinated and well-financed assault on the U.S. consumer's right to fisheries resources that belong to us all. From consumer to commercial fisherman to someone who enjoys the ambiance of coastal communities without boardwalks and amusement parks and tee shirt shops, if you have any connection to the seafood industry at all you owe it to yourself to read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Discontinuity","review":"As it rather often happens, Roth alternate in this book wonderful pages (the funeral of the dog) with passages much less substantiated in quality and ideas. Besides, the book reveals the traditional american superficiality as far as communism is concerned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Polemic, the 1950's and the loss of trust","review":"My interest waxed and waned whilst reading this novel which I would describe as a novel of ideas rather than one driven by the interest one has in the fortune of the characters. I did not find it near as enthralling as American Pastoral. It is generally pretty coruscating about all the characters, their motives, delusions, illusions, - but some of its set pieces are rivetting stuff including Nathan's teacher Leo's defence of literature (p218) And the summation of the antagonism between communism (read \\"politics) and literature (p.223). Because it is a novel of ideas, that makes it to me, an example of what the novel is railing against - the absence of thought in media generally or as the narrator Uncle Murray tells Nathan \\"American unthinking that is now everywhere.\\"(p284). Don't not read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"No likeable characters and...","review":"Up until reading this book, the only work of Philip Roth's I had ever read was Goodbye Columbus, when I was in college. I remember liking it very much. That was thirty years ago. Roth appears to have gone downhill severely, if this book is an example of his current writing. I Married a Communist has no characters who are even remotely likeable. The distanced \\"narrator\\", Murray, keeps us at bay with his windy language and constant digressions. Very self-indulgent choices by the author. Everything is asserted, nothing is shown. Enormously disappointing. I am only giving two stars because I actually managed to finish it, and the ending is good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get over Roth","review":"Just because Roth wrote Portnoy's Complaint doesn't mean everything he writes is gold. The prose is tired and stale and the ideas expressed are as inflated as Roth's ego. I Married A Communist is a book for old men to read so that they can go to the country club and appear well-read.

Indeed, each is a classic tragedy (think King Lear), with the life of the protagonist unraveling because of poor personal choices, conventionality, or unmet fears. Certainly, all of these books are brilliant and totally absorbing. But, in a literary way, the story in each is, basically, the torture of the main character. Here is some of my marginalia for \\"I Married a Communist\\", where poor Ira Ringold is destroyed: \\"We've heard Ira's rhetoric before. Yes, it conveys his state of mind. But what about the reader?\\" \\"Helgi is over the top. But this could happen.\\" \\"In her rage, Eve totally misunderstands Ira.\\" \\"Poor Ira. Even the nobodies he has befriended betray him.\\" \\"Roth is unrelenting.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Roth humanizes the tough historical subjects","review":"I admire writers who can take controversial historical and political issues and turn them into human dramas -- giving readers a sense of what made them controversial in the first place.Roth's recent novels may be tough, sometimes angry, in tone, but they show the mark of a master craftsman and the wisdom of a mature artist. \\"I Married a Communist\\" tells only one story about postwar radicalism, but it illumines the issue and helps put a human face on it. This book should be on American history reading lists for high school & college kids who don't get what the McCarthy era was about.By the way -- why do people care that Roth may have used some of this story to settle a score with his ex-wife? I find the book compelling and realistic. I'm not going to censor my enjoyment by condemning the author as a \\"naughty boy.\\" This gives me no particular pleasure. Of course, if it gives you pleasure you might want to read \\"The Human Stain...\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"A BIG letdown.","review":"A devastatingly boring book. I had to force myself to finish it. It gains momentum only in the last 30 pages.

It just doesn't feel very solid overall. You can tell that the code they used has been around for awhile, with band-aids applied with each release, as opposed to just rewriting it.There are many visual artifacts that get left behind when moving notes, etc. I think there are way too many features in this program that bog it down and decrease its feel and efficiency. I had to use this version though, because Cakewalk Apprentice (which I really like) doesn't recognize my midi devices of the sblive in WinXP.It does do a few nice things, like put controllers right along with the piano roll, and gives many options when copying & pasting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the Program for the Inexpensive Cost!!","review":"I purchased Cakewalk HS2002 when it first came out. Yes at first it is confusing but you have to take the time to learn it as in most software you buy. I have a setup of guitar, bass guitar,keyboard all through a mixer to the software. I love it! It is really cool that at such a small price you can do so much and create your own cd's. I did purchase Scott Garrigus's book also for an extensive look into home recording.

I expected a good overview of the development of the bonneville, some in depth footage on the mechanicals, and something about how models changed, something about maintenance and ownership and test ride footage.Instead I got a bunch of middle aged blokes talking about what Bonnies meant to them and how cool it was to now own one. I have no idea what the second half of the DVD included, because I had dropped off before it got that far.So if you want pretty pictures of a couple of bikes, and some old rockers talking about being nostalgic, this is your DVD.If you want something to send you off to sleep after a hard day with a bit of Brit wallpaper, then this is highly recommended.If you want a DVD about the love of british iron, buy BritTown, THAT is an excellent movie.For the money and effort I feel the guys at Classic Bike could have done the subject a lot more justice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Forbidden History","review":"Without the information contained within this book one will never understand how the world has come to arrive at its current dismal state... and why, barring heroic intervention, it will only get worse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Truth","review":"This should be required reading for every high school student in America.

Based upon those avaiable reviews, I thought this would be the best DVD to buy. My husband and I have concluded that perhaps this DVD is meant for cats that are more independent and possibly left alone more often than our cat. Our cat is very active and plays with us for hours every day. She is rarely left alone. She was totally bored with this DVD. In fact, I could not get her to even look at the animals.

The author goes into some detail on the numerous uses the Shetland pony has been put to over the years including the work the pony did on the Islands before it found new employment in coalmines in the 19th century. Profuse illustrations are in black and white throughout but include many fascinating archive photos as well as more recent ones.

Although some of the events may be fictitious, the children, the old house, and the village of Shemlan are all real, as are details like the oak tree with the concrete-filled hollow, the vineyard terraces, the missing stair railing, the fossils, Slanty Rocks, and quartz-rich Crystal Mountain itself. Set in the early part of this (20th) century, the author describes the childhood adventures of herself and of her siblings with village residents and in the surrounding hills. The nostalgic feeling is reinforced by delightful illustrations by Ernest H. Shepard of Winnie-the-Pooh fame. It is sad to note that the house, built by a feudal lord in the 1860s, was severely damaged during the war in the 1980s, and many of the trees were cut."},{"rating":"2","title":"Missions Book \\"Bible\\"","review":"This book is a various articles written by leading Missionaries and scholars.

That should tell you how strongly I feel about this. These batteries are awful. They do not hold their charge at all. I use them in the remotes for my TV's, and I've had to charge them several times in 2 weeks. A regular battery off the racks lasts well over a year (probably longer), and yet I have had to charge these several times already. Complete waste of money for the time and electricity these use.

Although it says the author \\"is an experienced and respected author on Eastern religion and philosophy,\\" his views on Buddhism are quite outdated and don't reflect the developments in Buddhist Studies over the last twenty or thirty years. To dismiss all of the Mahayana tradition as \\"a return to many of the theistic and polytheistic beliefs of earlier societies,\\" as the author does, is something no respected scholar of Buddhism of the last thirty years or so would have done. Likewise, to state \\"only in the Theravada tradition, together with its scion, Zen, that we can be most confident of finding what Buddha originally proclaimed\\" is laughably amateur. No one who knew what they were talking about would make such an unqualified originalist assertion these days, particularly after Schopen.The chapter on Buddhism deals with the subject with which I am most familiar, but it is reasonable to assume that the rest of the book is as dated and fatuous."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened?","review":"Like some other reviewers, I wonder if the middle of this novel got lost somewhere between writer and publisher. The idea itself was fascinating, especially since I just returned from Las Vegas where you can visit several European cities, Egypt, Rome, New York and probably other venues I missed. That part of the book was well done.But what happened to the people? All kinds of interesting characters were introduced and then completely dropped. None of their stories were developed, which was disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful, Dreadful","review":"Barnes is cute, totally lacking in substance. The characters are thin, the plot silly and the writing pretentious. The only good part of this time-wasting novel is that in which Barnes has Samuel Johnson say a number of lines in his own words. Now if we had had much more Johnson and much less Barnes, we'd have had something worthwhile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cynical AND fun AND thought-provoking","review":"This novel puts more than a few interesting ideas on the table (not just the obvious central ones mind you) and then investigates one persons reaction to history and ageing. I found it an increasingly poignant book which spoke to me in a few ways - the downshifter in me anyway...

He has tremendous skill; and its been shown in most of his previous books, especially Flaubert's Parrot.This book, however, is not nearly as creative as 10 1/2 or Parrot. It's a weak soup of postmodernisms and soggy British pride. England is made again on the Isle of Wight; and during the course of this building it becomes chic to emigrate from the dying whale of the original island. Eventually, England returns to a kind of Eden like grace from which to rebuild itself anew."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindle Version Has Typos in Practically Every Paragraph","review":"I agree with many of the other reviewers that the idea for the concept was intriguing and amusing, and that it wasn't executed in a way that I was entirely satisfied with. But my biggest problem was buying this book for my Kindle.There are typos everywhere. I would never hire whoever typed this into its Kindle version as the lowest level data entry clerk, much less a secretary or court reporter. Additionally there needs to be at least one space before the next section of the chapters start as indicated by the 10-15 letters of upper case, but no. And it won't skip from the few chapters or sections to the next. Basically everything that stinks about reading electronically was present in this edition, and what's worse I paid a pretty high price for that."},{"rating":"1","title":"enjoyable,... if only it were written by Aldous Huxley!","review":"I thought the book was witty in some places but I just wish that its themes of reality and class had been treated in a more, um, mature and serious way. I finished it in a few days and donated it to the local library."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Scathing Farce","review":"This is a well-crafted novel that skewers the absurd appropriation of cultural forms (as reflected in popular culture, and politics) by the market-driven forces of global capitalism. Barnes describes a world in which a Disney-esque farce unfolds and eventually appropriates all that is \\"good and propah\\" about the English world, destroying the textured reality of life in the real England. Although Barnes' relatively inept description of personal relationships occasionally slows down the novel, his larger point about the inherent greed and unscrupulous avarice of global capitalism's marketing of hyper-reality comes across very forcefully. His sanguine conclusion, although disappointing to some, seems appropriate when situated in today's world of millennial madness.Overall, an excellent work. Fully recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful","review":"What a wreck of a novel. The premise that a replica of England is more enticing than the actual experience of visiting England is fine. The descriptions of the myths and history of England should have been interesting. Instead the author chose to dull them down and treat them as academia rather than story. The characters in this novel are barely fleshed out. There are glimpses of life in the two main characters, but no one else comes off as remotely human, they are more cartoon characters. I did not care about the well being of any of these characters. There are large stretches of this novel that seemingly take you nowhere. Classic example of a good idea that does not make a good story."},{"rating":"2","title":"My father and I love it.","review":"I sent a Terrain Navigator California Set to my father earlier this year as a gift.

The map prints are clear and provide a UTM grid and lots of reference points. Looking at the maps in 3-D provides a real good sense of the terrain.

After skimming thr' adders & multipliers, I could find very little new info I not knew about. This book should have been titled \\"Introduction to digital arithmetic\\".2)The notation and the figures used in the book are unconventional and hard to follow. I had a tough time to read thr' 5 pages without getting frustated. You have to think hard just to figure out what the authors want to tell.Finally I want to say, if you want to learn about digital arithmetic, better buy Koren.

I can read a question and have no idea what the authors are asking me to find (this isn't a matter of not knowing how). To begin most problems, I have to look at the solutions manual to figure out what it is the authors intended to ask me. If you are a professor considering this book, please, please, please think of your students and find a textbook that is easier to understand!A few other notes:1. Questions refer to figures, tables and samples are sprinkled throughout the chaper without giving a page number. I have seen other books that give a page number - this is much more friendly.2.

It was the hope for change that kept me in this terrible relationship. Once I understood what was being done to me physically and emotionally was really all about him controlling me, I found the courage to leave the relationship.

Unfortunately, Sony has frankly **[been bad]** on one of the most important features of this phone - the battery. They obviously cut corners in this one area to add more trinkets to the phone. Which are great - caller id on the base and the handset, scrolling address book on the handset, speed dial memory, speaker phone, etc.; but, if the battery is dead after using the phone for an hour, then what use is the features! I'm not a phone junkie, in fact I hate being on the phone, but I work at home and end up on some long calls which halfway through get cut off and I have to switch to my corded phone across the house from my office.

The handset of my new phone does not light up so I can see the caller ID screen in a dark or dimly lit room. Even in the daylight, the print is so small I almost have to squint to see who is calling. Why was this feature omitted? Why does the base unit stay lit green all the time like a nite light? It should light up only when there is a call like my old Sony.

The handset display is not illuminated and cannot be read in dim light (this is the only way to review your Caller ID list, the base will not do it). Also I could not put more than 16 numbers into my speed dial making it unusable for accessing voice mail codes.I liked the base keypad and dual display."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not love this phone!","review":"This phone has lots of nifty features but the speaker system is lousy.

Admittedly, the book is an easy read, has a good dose of humor and the author relates well to those in their early to mid-20's (mainly because she's a member of this generation). While the book would be useful to high school students and the occasional completely clueless college student, it offers little to no new information to anyone else. (to give perspective, I'm 23 years old, am a recent college grad and am employed full time) Ulrich simply re-stated well known facts - young adults today are broke, they have too many student loans and too much college debt, etc., etc. - and offered cliche advice. There was nothing in this book that I did not already know, i.e. don't default on student loans, pay of high interest credit cards ASAP, and so on and so on. Overall, not a completely useless read, but you're better off borrowing one from the library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Made me feel better","review":"Book explains some of the reasons why today's recent college grads carry so much more debt than ever before.

I was hoping they would examine all the major types of US coins. Was I ever so wrong. Instead, when I opened the book it resembled a picture book that you would get a 3 yr old. There is very little writing in the book, along with virtually no descriptions. I expected a higher caliber book from the author. I guess what can you expect for $10.00.

I have no doubt that Eileen Franklin's father was guilty of some of Eileen's accusations, but I'm uncertain whether or not he murdered her friend. Eileen seems to have a lot of emotional issues that made me question her credibility, in addition to her constantly changing stories. But her mother, brother and sisters were able to corroborate on the abuse so at least some of what she said must have been true. I was engrossed in the book and had a hard time putting it down. Harry Maclean has done a great job."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant and Compelling!","review":"ONCE UPON A TIME is absolutely gripping, and an example of true crime writing at its insightful best. Maclean is a master of the genre, and the case itself is fascinating. The family dynamics are horrific and tragically true -- and that means people lie to themselves and others with terrible consequences. The man accused of murdering a child was uncouth, unfaithful, disgusting, abusive ..and innocent. This book is important for anyone who thinks our justice system should react like an outraged victim instead of bending over backwards in the assumption of innocence. Even then, emotion and violations of the Constitution can put the wrong people behind bars. For reasons of literary brilliance, coupled with social relevance, I cannot lavish enough praise on ONCE UPON A TIME by Harry Maclean"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Bedtime Story","review":"I found this book to be compelling at first and then just wanted to sleep.

It is better than the first, and Anthony shows real growth as a mystery writer. The characters are becomming more full and complex and we meet Russell's mother (Don't we all know someone like her). It isn't necessary to be gay to enjoy these stories. They are such well written mysteries, they truly stand on their own. But as a Gay reader, it so nice to find a writer who puts the gay aspects of his lead secondary to the mystery.

They have to look for survivors and find out how to defeat the enemy. Obviously, if each ship doesn't find the other, the human race will die.

It is her re-writing of a fascinating period in John Lennon's life that really veres off the \\"highway of objectivity\\". Does Yoko forget that there really are a lot of us who were alive back then, and that we have watched the documentation examined publically, ad nauseum, over the last 30 years? Yes, going to the theater was another donation to the Lennon estate, and a mere drop in the bucket to what I've spent since the 60's for Beatle-related products, but I can't justify another $19.99 for the eventual DVD release. If it were more legitimate, minus the over-the-top \\"Thank you's\\" to Yoko from nearly every producer related to the film, I'd relish another addition to my unendingly increasing collection. But NOT for something that overtly excludes the people and situations from that time that Yoko choses to write off (Sir Paul, Julian, etc)."},{"rating":"2","title":"The U.S. vs. John Lennon","review":"The item took a long time to receive, about over 3-4 weeks.

I do like the look of it, though it is not terribly stable standing on its own--fairly light weight and topples easily. I suppose it is okay for the money, though I've had little ceramic heaters which were half the price that seemed to heat better, but didn't last very long.

This product is basically cheap junk from China and Amazon should be ashamed of themselves for selling it. I am not looking forward to dealing with the complicated and time consuming return process and don't think I will buy anything like this from Amazon again. I would think they would have a little more control over what they sell considering the hassle of returning products to them.

If you are dubbing VHS tapes which have a lot of clips or programs recorded on them the unit will sometimes interpret gaps between the clips/program recordings as signal loss or end of tape and prematurely terminate the dubbing. Because of this I could not use it to copy my VHS collection to DVDs. Instead I had to use a 2nd DVR unit. Also the compression ratio and algorithms used are not as good as the ones used by my 2nd DVR (which is a Philips). The Philips has a LP option for DVD+R DL that allows 6 hrs of recording which is perfect for 6hr VHS tapes. With the Sony unit I had to choose between 5 hrs and 7 hrs plus change and the 7 hrs required to dub a 6hr VHS tape produced inferior video quality compared to the Philips DVR."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid SONY DVD recorder","review":"I bought this recorder to record programs while I'm not home.

What I didn't know was how convoluted and clumsy the instructions were especially for the dvd recording procedure. The vcr parts were pretty straightforward, but the dvd procedures were scattered all over the manual and too often footnoted in ways that seem unnecessary.So, in the course of trying (and I'm still trying) to figure it all out, count on wasting a few disc's as you worm your way through these unnecessarily sometimes unclear and scattered instructions for dvd recording.On the whole, the results of the picture/sound quality of the recordings are very good.

I could not believe it!Bottom-line, do yourself a favor and \\"Stay away\\" from Sony. Once again, \\"Stay away\\" from Sony! I hope they are reading these comments. Terrible product. \\"Stay Away\\". Have I made my point? \\"STAY AWAY from SONY\\" If it were possible I'd give them minus stars. Did you hear that Sony? Minus stars.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to use and unreliable","review":"The audio stop working while under warrenty which was repaird with the price of postage. I bought and excellent Magnavox while waitibg for the repairs. The Sony was difficult to use, directions left a lot to be desired, no comparison to the Magnavox. When the repaired unit was returned I placed in a secondary hardily use role. The audio again went out on a machine that rarely used. A piece of junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Digital tuner has problems","review":"I bought this product because it has a digital tuner. After setup, I found that it did not display properly the digital signal from major networks like CBS and NBC. On my analog 4:3 TV, the image appeared as a small box, surrounded by 4 black bars. There is no way to change this.Also, be warned that it takes almost 40 minutes to scan the analog and digital channels; probably, it missed some. Also, it cannot record closed captioning from a digital channel (this info is buried in the manual).I have no idea how this product works as a VCR or DVD player-recorder. After encountering the above problems during setup, I put it back in the box, to be returned.A sad comment on Sony. I'm surprised this product got so many positive reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Happy","review":"I purchased this combo DVD/VCR player for my exercise tapes, which I use daily, since I have a wide collection of both VHS & DVD's. And I've always liked the user-friendly aspect of Sony products. However, after only 4 months, both DVD & VHS tapes started freezing in the middle of play. Not good when you're right in the middle of your morning work-out.Because of security features Sony now installs in their devices to forestall piracy, only the Sony company can do repairs. So, even though it was still under warranty, I'm required to ship it back to them at my expense. After 3 months, they sent it back, saying it couldn't be repaired, only replaced. Yeah, like I want another one!Instead, I purchased a Pioneer DVD player that doesn't install such security devices. All I want is a reliable, consumer-friendly player. Not one armored for warfare. No more Sony's for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective Sony DVD/VCR unit.","review":"The Sony unit would not put out a color picture, only B&W.; When fast forwarding a VHS tape, the TV screen went blank.Seller is now trying to fix the unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of junk if you want to record tv/play DVDs","review":"Worked great for about 4 months. Then, it refused to finalize recorded discs saying they could not be played or recorded. Then, timer recordings failed, shut itself off in the middle of the 2 hour program. Then, recordings using the record button failed, either stopped recording on its own or wouldn't update disc info properly. Now, even has problems playing purchased discs. If you follow Sony's recommended advice to unplug the unit for one minute and start over, it might work for recording or playing 1-2 discs and than failure again. $114 plus shipping fees isn't worth it to me to fix it. Good it is no longer available new. Don't waste your money and buy it used."},{"rating":"2","title":"DVD VHS Recorder combo by Sony","review":"This is the shi&t.; Made a copy of an old movie onto DVD and it looks as good as the orginal.

It took me hours to discover this. A couple of hours on the Sony tech webchat (two levels of support) and finally referred to telephone support in order to find this out. The recorder can only operate via the satellite receiver's tuner which severely restricts the recording possibilities.I was unable to find this information anywhere in the literature or in the manuals.The \\"built in HD tuner\\" may well work with a cable system, but it was unsatisfactory for my use. The lack of this information upfront is what merits this item a single star."},{"rating":"1","title":"This item sucks","review":"This product does not work with a simple TV set.

My TV doesn't have these connections so it is useless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Guide!","review":"I purchased this map guide back in August for a trip I took to Stockholm in October. The guide was very useful. And I think is much better than the one from another company that I purchased for my trip to Copenhagen.

I will definitely look to purchase from them again for other trips I plan on taking in the future if the books are available."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compact and easy to use","review":"I love Knopf MapGuides.

It is full of practical advise on how to repel despair and replace it with pragmatic and ultimately satisfying outlook on life. Choosing Riding the Roller Coaster, however, was an easy choice, not only because its subject matter is relevent to our times, but also because the author deals with it very effectively. There are a surfeit of self help programs and self help books that try to deal with how to overcome adversity or how to cope with problems or calamity-or even how to achieve happiness. Those books and programs, however, are, for the most part, feeble attempts at dealing with these problems, because they don't get to the heart of the matter: faith in god. The idea found in this book proceed from the premise that faith in god is necessary to solving any problem. I highly recommend this book to any reader who is searching deeply on some of the vexing issue that one confronts in life."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best buy anywhere","review":"I have purchased about a dozen of these speakers over the past 2 years, along with some outdoor ones as well, and it has been the best buy I've ever made on speakers. The sound is incredible and the look is fantastic. Now, we are a family with young children so we don't \\"rock out\\" with loud music so, many factors important to music or sound enthusiasts, were not important to us. What I wanted was something that sounded good, looked good, and was easy to install, and this had it all. The hardest part of installing them was crawling through my attic to pull the wires through. The speakers themselves installed in minutes and look fabulous. Everyone who comes to our home comments on the look and sound. I put 4 speakers in our entertainment room and it gives great stereo sound. If you want something that has good quality, sound, and look, then buy this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Real. Life.

And I can't even use a needle!!","review":"My daughter introduced me to this show and although this isn't my usual topic to write about, I wanted to tell everybody who is interested in fashion to pick up this show. It's basically about a group of 16 up and coming fashion designers who go through a series of tasks given to them by Elle magazine, Banana Republic where they have a certain amount of time to put together an item which is them viewed on a runway by celebrity judges such as Michael Kors. (You try putting a gown together in 2 days)! Each show, one person is illiminated until 3 are left for a full blown fashion show.

But Blackmarr has such an incredible knack for finding meaning in just everyday experiences, what she calls \\"the remarkable and incorruptible process of living from ordinary day to ordinary day.\\" This book worked on many levels for me. It's hilariously funny sometimes, has some great characters, like the stove man and the wasp lady, but it's also intensely spiritual. It has a zen-like acuteness to it. Yet it's a fast, easy reade. There's a great deal in a small space, here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good speakers for the money","review":"We bought four pairs of these to put in the ceilings of our addition.

It is basically made of cereal which is bad for chinchillas. He doesn't like it much and the directions are wrong. It says to keep a stick inside the cage at all times which they will eat it and get fat because of the sugary cereal. I highly highly highly recommend you buy a ten dollar \\"Chinchilla feisty fusion\\" from Forever Feisty chinchilla rescue instead. He LOVES the herbs so much and theyre very healthy for him.

It is informative and really teaches you from ground zero how to meet people and date as painlessly as possible. It is a great book for somebody who is young and just getting started in life or for somebody such as myself who has always been in a relationship. The dumb statements in other reviews for this book about being totaly real with somebody versus accentuating your talents and personality are nuts. Talk Show TV is completely real with its viewers everyday and I wouldn't want to date anybody on anyone of those shows. Please people -- be real with me gradually...and not over the course of an hour with five commercial breaks.I say to those of you who panned this book \\"Get out of denial and into reality -- quit unjustly bashing this book, get some guts and get a date! Any date. I did and I didn't die from the experience.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"little helpful","review":"This book is very little helpful, because it really doesn't tell you more than everybody already knows. Look your best,, be confident,, it really doesn't tell you what everybody looking for someone wants to know,,, when you walk up to someone you are interested in,, WHAT DO YOU SAY?

Are they serious? The rest of the book is similarly ridiculous. It's good for a laugh if nothing else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Complete Idiots Guide to Dating","review":"This is a good resource for beginners dating tips. It covers almost the same material as the dating guide in the \`Dummies' series. Both cover fundamental work (such as self-esteem) and then go into the mechanics of flirting, asking out etc. In other words, for a dating novice or someone who has trouble with successful dating and relationships, this book can be an excellent source of information. Since the material covered by this book and the dummies brand version is essentially the same, just buy the one you feel most comfortable with. The best reason for buying one of these books (Idiots or Dummies guides) is that you don't have to read it from beginning to end to use it effectively. Just pick a chapter or section and read through the tips and try them out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trite and Superficial","review":"There isn't much depth to this gloss. Perhaps the picture of the author on the book's cover, taken as she hosts her radio talk show, gives the best indication of the book's quality: not much is inside that cover that could be considered insightful, thoughtful, or helpful. Just a lot of trite superficialities that do little to explain the intricacies of male/female interaction. For example, the role of eye contact is acknowledged to be \\"powerful,\\" but only three paragraphs are spent on the subject. Don't expect much above the level of the average call-in radio show, or to discover anything you don't already know."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Time and Your Money","review":"I thought I had bought a book about dating, not new-age psycho-babble. Although this Idiot's Guide is not entirely without merrit, it offers nothing out of the ordinary in comparison to other dating books and has many silly components thrown in. The pick-up lines were woeful to say the least and many of the author's ideas were a little too out of left field to handle. A fantastic dating book worth purchasing is Rabbi Shmuley Boteach's \\"Dating Secrets of the Ten Commandments\\". It is a book which makes real sense and gives the reader not only encouragement, but really makes one truly believe that there is a \\"special\\" person just waiting for them."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BUY THIS BOOK ! ! !","review":"i have no idea what world dr. kuriansky lives in. if you do the things the book tells you to do, girls will think you're a major dork, and you will be doomed to failure! the truth of the matter is, dating is a game. and kuriansky does not address any of this game. she even says not to play any of the dating game. well, i learned the hard way...a really really hard way. trust me, dating is a game, which even nice sincere girls will respond to, so buy a book that actually addresses this. i won't suggest any book, because then people might think this review is a fake. but check out the other dating games on amazon.com and read the reviews. and look for books that addresses the dating game. by the way, i'd like to thank you dr. kuriansky, for ruining my recent dating experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"RIPP OFF!!!","review":"What a shock when we received these sheets in the mail!

The characters Theo Buchanan and Dr. Michelle Renard are well defined and the plot is complicated and very believable. The secondard characters are interesting and fully developed.

I tell you if girls were easy as she was; it would be good to be a man!!! On top of that all the internal dialogue with the heroine and hero only proves that they are both the stupidest human beings ever to have a brain.

The storyline looked interesting but to my disappointment I found many holes in this novel along with characters and dialogue a bit too juvenile for my taste. The romance portion of the story was lukewarm and dull and in my opinion not steamy enough. The suspense portion was bland. It took me three weeks to get through this book.

This book, like its contemporary predecessor, reads as if she wrote it while balancing her checkbook. Little humor, little character development, little fun.Ms. Garwood, go back to your roots, take your time with your writing, and quit anticipating your advance checks. With the lousy product that you've been producing recently, they may dry up sooner than you anticipate."},{"rating":"1","title":"My Last...","review":"I'm thinking \\"Mercy\\" may just be the last Garwood book I read...unless someone can recommend one that can change my mind.

This is the first book that I have read outside of her historical novels and it was very disappointing. I will make this very simple;1) There was no chemistry between the hero and heroine.2) The supporting characters were more interesting than the leads, in particular the hero's best friend.3) The love scenes felt forced and there was too much comedy in them.4) The reader feels completely manipulated, like the only reason this book exists is to create aseries for us to follow instead of actually being a satisfying story.5) The end was a welcome relief, something I never look forward to while reading Julie Garwood's novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mercy ! Can I find a guy like Theo ?","review":"Julie Garwood's first effort into Romantic Suspense \\"Heartbreaker\\" was good but this one absolutely sizzled.

I fell in love with Julie Garwood when I read ONE PINK ROSE. When she's writing historicals, she's fantastic but with each of her contemporaries, she falls way short. Because it was Julie, I wanted to give her a chance but struggled to get through the first 3 chapters, hoping she'd redeem herself, but I couldn't stomach it. The premis of the story pulls the reader in, but that's all I can say that's good about this book. I wish she'd go back to writing the historicals and stay away from the suspense.

Do what I did and borrow it from the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"I have to say, it WAS boring...","review":"I love this author and in deference to her I tried to read this book twice but could find little to hold my interest. I did finish it the 2nd time in order to give a fair review and I'm sorry to say, there's no other word for it, it was 'boring.'And why someone with such a lovely name as Michelle would want to be called 'Mike' is beyond me.This book had such potential but fell far short of being interesting, having any sort of intrigue, or conveying any attraction to the characters, which was amazing considering the talent of the author."},{"rating":"1","title":"I COULD NOT FINISH IT............

It's about 4 guys who made a pact to amass millions of dollars until they hit a limit and split it when they retire. It's just that one of them is more clever and brutal than the others. Now back to what I was saying about the dialogue being a bit flaky to me. What I meant was that the main protagonist, a Justice Department attorney who has an FBI agent as a best friend and whose wife died earlier from booze and neglect, was said to not know how to flirt. But from the first few coherent lines that come out of him, he seems like a huge jerk with a huge ego. I have no idea how the female protagonist, a small town girl who has above average IQ and becomes a surgeon, could have fallen in love with anything but a pretty face. I really wish there was more of this book I can comment on, but as you can tell with my seemingly inane critique about the dialogue -- maybe there really isn't much to it at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved It","review":"Dr. Mike is awesome. I look forward to the other stories on the Buchannan clan. I am glad Nick and Lauren where mentioned.

Oh and there is an AWESOME Twist! Hope this helps. Can't wait for the next book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Move for Garwood!","review":"Indeed, Garwood's dabble into contemporary romance suspence fiction was a brilliant move on her part.If Heartbreaker and Mercy are any proof, Garwood has great talent in this genre.This was a great book, wonderfully romantic and enticingly intriguing. Admittedly, the killer was not extremely difficult to figure out. Regardless, the book was excellent still.I had also enjoyed Garwoods previous books, although they are in the historical romance genre. However, if you did enjoy his book, I highly recomment Jayne Ann Krentz and her latest book, Smoke in Mirrors."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of her best","review":"Julie Garwood is a true master of writing.

I can not wait for Julie Garwood's next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mercy","review":"I enjoyed Mercy, it is the best of the contemporary outings Julie Garwood had attempted. Michelle and Theo are a decent couple and their meeting is comical in a good Garwood way. It's a little farfetched that the city boy would be willing to live in the swampy sticks, but his single focus on Michelle makes you go along with it and the town's involvement constantly calling him \\"Coach\\" despite his best efforts to deny the title are also cute. You are introduced to her brother John Paul who is written as such a bad ass it makes his own book that much more of a let down.

This Season went beyond the past 10 season's of how much drama their was. The season starts with an appearance from KeKe Palmer and she did the best job with her work on the show. This season will have the most intense moments starting with Bianca's past which leads Drew into a lot of trouble. This season features 29 episodes which is a lot of dramatic action until the end. This season will have seniors graduating and being done with their year's at Degrassi. Best show ever for all the hard work they put into it and this season was entitled Degrassi Now Or Never which was last summer and ran for 7 weeks. I love Degrassi and it will never get old."},{"rating":"2","title":"I wish they'd publish an update","review":"I'm a big aviation fan and really enjoyed this book.

In reality it is a cheaply made waste of your finances. Not all the parts click into place as they should, even when they are in the right spot. I just let my kids put the parts on without the timer. Once they were finished we put the timer on and waited for parts to fly... and did they ever fly. Luckily my daughter was wearing her glasses, or she would have taken a small plastic blast to the eye. I don't recommend this toy for anyone. There are so many other good, fun Cars toys out there. Don't waste your time on this one!(Amazon deleted all other reviews of this toy. That should tell you something.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"This toy/game is a piece of junk!!!","review":"I read the other bad reviews, but I thought my 3 year old son still would enjoy putting the pieces on the truck. He did, but the pieces do not stay on, even when the timer is turned off. My son found this very frustrating. Then, the third time we got the toy out to play, the timer mechanism broke completely, and unfortunately, this prevents the pieces from being put on the truck at all. This toy is a HUGE disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete Junk","review":"My 3 year old son is a cars fanatic. I thought he would love to play this with me. He loves perfection. But this toy is complete junk. The parts don't snap in and only two of the wheels come off. And they just fall off sadly. It is total and complete junk. There is not a single redeeming quality behind this toy. Don't waste your money. Mattel and Disney should be ashamed for marketing this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Timer too fast","review":"I bought this for my 6 yr old for Christmas. I'm glad I got it cheap because its made cheap. The parts don't go on right and the timer runs so fast that I can't even put the parts on before they fall off. I certainly don't expect any child to put the parts on before the timer runs out. I don't recommend this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"I bought this for my 3.5 year old daughter for Christmas and I was pretty disappointed in it! The parts don't fit well and they don't pop off like they are supposed to when the time is up.

It's a great idea, but just made pretty poorly!"},{"rating":"1","title":"this toy does not work...frustrating!","review":"This toy does not work.

Much to my chagrin, the book did nothing of the kind.Essentially, the book is a long tribute by Andy James to Andy James - Buddhist master, martial arts expert, and fount of wisdom. He details his training under Theravada (Southeast Asian Hinayana Buddhist) masters. He talks in a general way about different types of martial arts. He takes some time out to denigrate other forms of Buddhism.What he doesn't do is talk about the Shaolin temples, the connection between the temples and martial arts, or explain what their legacy might be.As a practicing Buddhist and martial artist, I found this book to be disappointing. Don't bother buying it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoughtful Study, Thoughtful Man","review":"Mr. James has written a well crafted book. I found the autobiographical section extremely interesting, for those of us who shared those historical times we are reminded of its challenges and hopes. It is obvious that he took not only those he quotes later in the book, but his own unique perspective of those times as the lessons to build upon and arrive to become the spiritual master that he is today.I have to agree with one of the other reviewers (but not his assessment of the book), that James leaves us hungry for more of his work......I for one am looking forward to his next book.As an aside, a quick google of his name indicates that he is a diversified individual beyond the martial arts and has spearheaded the building of his own off grid eco retreat! And it appears he now has a blog up and running......"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perspectives worth considering","review":"While not an easy or fast read, the material was researched and appeared thorough.

The only problem is this--if you know so little, you also have no business writing a doctoral dissertation, which means this book isn't for you.Some of the authors' mind-blowing advice: \\"Develop scientific hypotheses,\\" \\"Plan for the unexpected,\\" \\"operationalize your variables,\\" \\"summarize your findings.\\"For undergraduate psychology majors, this book provides a helpful introduction to the basics of research. But this is absolutely NOT the book to write a clear, compelling, innovative dissertation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD!","review":"I love this cd.

Beanie Buddies are like bigger versions of the beanie babies; they're about three times as big and feel more like a stuffed animal than the beanie babies do. I bought this in an attempt to replace my favorite toy from my childhood that I lost about 6 years ago. I was very disappointed to find out that I wasn't actually receiving a replacement for my beloved 'Mushroom' but in fact another stupid beanie baby.

The author is certainly well versed in the rabbinic commentaries on the Genesis text, but her writing style is so disorganized, and her intellectual leaps so large that following her arguments often take more time than they are worth. If you are searching for a contemporary analysis of the first book of the Bible, I would recommend Dennis Shulman's Genius of Genesis. This latter book was time much better spent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rambling and Unfocused","review":"I expected alot from this book, and did, indeed, glean some useful insights. I am sure there is much, however, that I did not get from the work due to it's style. There is no focus in the composition, and most of the time it seems to ramble with no clear direction. The author does not state her thesis and present her supporting evidence; rather, she has an almost stream-of-consciousness approach, pulling in seemingly unrelated materials and ideas, depending upon the reader to make the connections. Her scholarship and love of the material are evident, but the author's style doesn't allow the reader to assimilate nearly enough of what she has to offer."},{"rating":"1","title":"learned but dull","review":"This densely written book gives the patient reader a few of the same insights that one can get from a good Chumash (Torah w/commentary) such as the Artscroll Chumash or the Conservatives' Etz Chaim-- so I would not say it is completely worthless. The difference is that a Chumash is pithier and more clearly written than this book. When I read the Torah portion every week, I sometimes can't put it down (especially in Genesis). By contrast, I found it impossible to keep plowing through this learned but dull, dull, dull tome."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast-Paced action!","review":"If you love a mystery this book is for you!

From the first song to the last the listener will be compelled to enter into the spirit, love and power with which Jeanne plays. A force sweeps the listener along and demands a response.

The works of its ilk are few and far between (Chinese contract law) so I was happy to come upon it. The problem, however, is that due to language barriers, much of what is written is incomprehensible. In a subject such as law where nuance and details are the key, the author/editors dropped the ball. They did little to nothing to render this work usable in any practical manner. As a matter of fact, I cobbled together other options and tried to use this as an overall guide as the author's inability to express what he wished to say with exactitude made the use of this book a liability for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"More perfection from James Taylor","review":"All JT fans need to add this project to their music library.

The last piece, What Happened to Me on my Holiday is narrated by an 11 year old who is hard to understand.

This guy is so bad. Not only is the character in and of itself the most annoying character ever screened, but the voice actor seems to have read: every, single, line, off, a, queue, card. There's no emotion, intensity, or variation in any part of his performance. He could define m-o-n-o-t-o-n-e.Other more minor complaints are many elements of the plot seem to have been placed in there just because the direct thought everybody else would do it, so he should also.

Being American, I didn't have any childhood memories of this show to make me really interested, but the humour was definitely British and Robbie Williams was good as were the other voice talents (all actors I have seen before), but the American version...what a travesty? There is a simple charm to the British version, we Americans can't do charm.

The single LOST IN AMERICA is one of the album's weakest songs and also the reason why I'm not giving it a full five stars. But this is really a great album! Believe me, it is..."},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY STRONG ALBUM","review":"I bought this album back in 94 when it was released and back then i thought that it was a really good record but i didn't play it so often. At that time i wasn't an alice fan, i just thougt he was good. Nowdays i am a huge fan of Alice Cooper and I think that this album is just awsome. I would probably have have cried tears of joy if I'd been such huge fan when it came out. This one really sounds like an updated version of the incredible music he created in the period 75-78. Someone here wrote the \\"welcome to my nightmare of the 90's\\" which i can really agree with. There are a lot of great songs on this album......for example \\"Sideshow\\", \\"Bad place alone\\" \\"you're my temptation\\" and \\"stolen prayer\\". It's very near 5 stars. 4++++"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album but not one of his best","review":"I will have to disagree with other reviews on this album yes it is the best from the 90's for Alice but far from being a Classic. The first two songs are corny almost like he is trying to sound like Department of Youth off of Welcome to my nightmare. From Lost in America and on it is very good so I still give it 4 stars. You're My Temptation is the best song on Album by far."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you like rock of the 90's, you better have this one","review":"One of 10 best hard albums of the 90's, if I can allow myself to sound like a trumpy CNN-style reviewer. This has all the pieces gravely missed by people who play guitar music today: experience, theatrality, taste, attitude, exquisite professionalism, lyrical craft, and even AN IDEA other than that life sucks and we should all die.Alice is at his best, pulling legs all over while sounding like a cross between the Devil himself and Snoopy the Dog. Songcraft is top-notch, with practically half the album worth a place in the general history of rock. The band, studio work and general production is typically Alice-style good; that is outstanding for the rest of us.Feels like going to rock-opera, which is amusing and entertaining without a dime of posing or rock-stardom. In one word, awesome!"},{"rating":"2","title":"fantasticooper!","review":"I do not have the CD but heard a few cuts on Randall Terry Live and can't wait to purchase it.

Doing many of the chestnuts of the Lu Watter's Yerba Buena Jazz Band, he brings his own renditions, similar but different from his colleague, my friend, the late Bob Scobey. In these two CDs, there are a variety of sidemen who brighten up the day--Santo Pecora of New Orleans' fame--and probably one of the best cornet men of all time, Doc Evans, on ten sides (I think). Being live, these sides have more vitality than the usual studio recordings; and are my favorites of the Turk Murphy sides I have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tempted to give five stars...","review":"Martin Mayer has been writing about banking for decades. He has held positions in government, and testified as an expert in various governmental committees. He has known personally many of the people about whom he is writing in this book.His writing style is dense. He often assumes the reader is familiar with banking terms or processes (or can go look them up). If you can get through this, the information he provides is priceless. I came away from reading this book with a variety of insights into banking and the federal reserve that will continue to inform me for years to come. I have read a number of books on the fed, and this is certainly one of the best (along with Greiders)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missed its potential","review":"This book contains a lot of excellent information about the development of the Federal Reserve System with many incidents that I had never heard of.

Lots of fascinating inside stories, but disappointing overall."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading Title","review":"My main problem with this book is that the title really should have been \\"A Detailed History of The Fed.\\" I think I was looking more for what the title implied, a book with a focus almost exclusively on modern times, and concentrating on the relationship between Fed actions and economic reactions. If this is what you, too, are seeking, don't read this book.A secondary problem is that the recitation of Fed history that comprises nearly the entire book is almost unbearably dry.This book's main (only?) good point is its detail. I personally found the amount of detail excessive and boring, but I can't fault the author for completion: the history that this book contains is broad and well-researched."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this politics or economics?","review":"You can learn something from this book, but at a great cost. The writing is very poor and the message is tendentious. Lots of snide remarks about Ronald Reagan. Milton Friedman's name is usually accompanied by a phrase like \\"and his acolytes\\".

The book IS of small size and easily portable, which seems to be the main promise, and it says it includes quick tips (it delivers, some), but also speedy solutions (doesn't deliver, because they don't exist, and most of the explanations and case studies are too short and superficial for anything to be learned from them) and cutting-edge ideas (for one business only).

Look no further then. It's not worth it to get a DualDisc. The idea of a double-sided cd doesn't sound very promising, and from I read, not very good either. If it was a cd/dvd combo where there were two separate discs, you've got something different, but both on one disc? Forget it, pass on this.

Yes it was installed properly and I had the fuse block installed 10cm from the battery and the actual housing for the fuse melted as opposed to simply burning out the fuse...not normal.

I know my wire gauges. This isn't only a rip-off, it's dangerous. If you run a 'real' 1200W RMS through this you're likely to start a fire in your car, somewhere buried, where you ran the wires.

This topic is old news."},{"rating":"1","title":"Traditional Ideas spun for the out-dated dot com generation.","review":"I have found that this book was a weak and uncreative attempt to brand \\"BLUR\\" as a modern innovation of conducting business when it has simply re-spun and devalued traditional business practices into a dot com unsustainable ideal. This book preaches that there is little need for the tangible bottom line for the intangibles of business out weigh the value of the actual assets. That may be partially true; however, what actually happens when that model is embraced is uncontrollable corruption in the market. If you are a beginner in the business world and have trouble reading, you will find a few good business ideas and examples within the double spaced, trivially written text. However, as it was published in 1999 most of the ideas are now a BLUR of the past. There are better books out there.

Add chips to your products!Rather than helping people learn how to think in terms of the new rules we are facing daily, it tells us how to adapt old models, products and services to the new realities.

The main parts of this book were pretty straightforward and sometimes somewhat repetitive - things getting faster, more connected, and knowledge based - For me, the most valuable parts were some of the concepts raised in the chapters themselves. Attention capital, Equities in people, increasing returns, and acceleration in financial statements are a few of the topics mentioned only in couple of pages, but begin trains of thought that could fill volumes. A good read for anyone interested in thinking about opportunities for the next ten years.

The title seems to demand a reading of the book. However, utter disappointment awaits the reader. The book is very poorly written.

Though it is not something that will help you stratgically change your business, sections on how employees will be valued in the future ring true and how companies will have to bend over backwards in the future to really serve the customer.

The authors bore with generally known information that was hip in the early 90ies where it could have been called \\"visionary\\". Today this is just one out of thousands of books that regurgitate what kids learn in school these days.

First of all I am highly skeptical that the author learned these 10 \\"Secrets\\" from the television show. More likely the author just wanted to write a book with some sort of tie in to a popular television show in misguided hopes of making some money.Well guess what, the book is selling for scraps now.

The pros of the book includes the source for reference, a Micro kernel OS design, while what is not really upto the mark is the language tends to be difficult thereby making a tough subject even more tougher, the author's view tends to spill over and are juvenile with cliches like all students are trying to hack systems, etc and does not cover various aspects of OS subsystems.My recomendation would be the book by Abraham Silberschatz, Peter Baer Galvin called \\"Operating System Concepts\\" incase of you are starting off or just want a very easy to read book or consider various approaches."},{"rating":"2","title":"Historically Significant, Simply Complex","review":"The operating system for this book, Minix, is the ancestor to the now wildly popular linux.

Furthermore, even when you're walking or running you not able to see what's in front of you. After a while it gets old and frustrating. However, the game has great graphics and sound. But even with that it still isn't enough to make up for the lack of lasting appeal. Also, the game is pretty hard to play if you don't have a manual or a walk through guide.

I have used many self tanning lotions and this one is very different. Unlike a lotion, it is very runny, like an oil almost. When it gets on your hands while applying, it instantly discolors your skin and you must immediately scrub it off so you won't be left with stained hands. Most tanners when washed right after application do not leave stains on your fingers and hands unless you don't wash them off. It is very hard to apply this product as it is literally like water, which is also the first ingredient listed on the product.

This book was very good, both as the continuing story of Alvin Maker as well as the new story in this book with Arthur Staurt.I really enjoyed the new depth to some of the characters that were introduced in previous books, but were more central to the story in this book. Also, the new characters, such as Arthur Stuart and Mock Berry were very good as well. The only thing I didn't like about this book was there is a point where Alvin has to do something very difficult, and while it is a very clever solution to the problem at hand, it seems like there was a much easier solution available that was not even mentioned. But that was just a minor problem, and didn't detract much from a great story.If you've read Seventh Son and Red Prophet, you should definitely continue the story with this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Maker series drops the ball","review":"This is where the series gets bad. The first half of the book is going along fine, but I cringed every time the plow was mentioned. This was the same feeling I got with the Xenocide ending. The characters come up with something that they can conceive of in their minds, and so the laws of phyisics bend to their conception. So it is with Alvin, who theorizes a ridiculous way to become a real Maker. And because he can conceive of it in his poorly educated mind, this somehow makes it possible. I really enjoyed the first two books in the series, but this one just left a bad aftertaste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let down","review":"Many times while reading this book I felt the urge to just toss it into the trash.

We shall see."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some of the best American fiction in print","review":"Card can hold his own with America's best fiction writers, and this series proves it. A reader below compares the Alvin Maker series to Tolkien's Lord of the Rings series. That's a good starting point, but Card's work is much more humane, and relies much more on human interaction as opposed to magic or fantasy.Underneath all of Card's works is a complex philosophy of individualism, self-determination, and humanism You see it in his creations of Jane in Ender's Game, Peggy here in the Maker series, and Patience in Wyrms. This is, at its core, a philosophy that captures the essence of the American world-view. It's also one that I and many others share, and it's a pleasure to see these themes gently woven into the fabric of all his stories. Card, you are the best. Keep going!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worthy continuation to the series","review":"This third book to the \\"Maker\\" series gets back on track with the tale of Alvin Miller/Smith/Maker. New characters, such as Calvin Planter and Arthur Stuart, are introduced and utilized to good effect, unlike some characters introduced later in the series (such as the annoying Balzac in \\"Alvin Journeyman\\"). Each chapter contains an interesting development, and the book has several nice twists.The only note of caution I have is for the series in general. Card has a way of turning his protagonists into supermen. Think, for example, of Lanik Mueller in \\"Treason,\\" Bean in \\"Ender's Shadow\\" or Jane in \\"Children of the Mind.\\" I don't know whether this is a way for him to wriggle out of plot problems or whether it's his own predilections. Regardless, he begins to do it here as well, and it becomes more pronounced in \\"Alvin Journeyman\\" and \\"Heartfire.\\" That detracts from both the humanity and the believability of the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Free SF Reader","review":"Yet more boring mormon wish-fulfillment fantasy. In this arena, David Gemmell he is not. If that is what you are after, then by all means get it, otherwise something like The Jerusalem Man will be much more appealing.

These soft shoes stay on his feet unlike all the other slippers I've tried for him. The elastic around the ankles keeps the shoes on very well without slipping off his feet. They arenot bulky and are fairly thin, they are made of a leather type material. I believe these shoes stay on because of the thickness...it's just right. And the cute designs you can't beat! Too cute!Robeez: Strongly suggested for all kids especially children w/ CP for when their feet are taking a break from the braces."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for babies and toddlers learning to walk","review":"I bought a pair of these for my 18 month old nephew, and he loves them. My sister bought him the red monkey print ones, but he's outgrowing them, so I decided to go for something that he can wear with dressier clothes. He's been walking for a couple of months now, but his balance is still off. These shoes allow him to walk around without adding weight to his feet. This is great because there's less risk of him tripping, as there is with traditionally bulkier shoes. Plus, they are well-made and extremely durable. I bought a generic pair and my nephew tore those up in a couple of hours, so that's why I turned to the tried and true Robeez. I recommend these for anyone who has kids that are learning to walk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Cute","review":"These shoes are really cute.

You get the first warning when you put it together. The tubes are light plastic that are not rigid and they come loose from the plastic tabs on the feeder bottom and top that are supposed to hold them. The lid does NOT click into the top. It flies off with any breeze at all. The biggest problem is that instead of overlapping the hole in the top, the lid sits down inside it. So it leaks in the rain and there's no place for the rain to go but down into the tubes. The seed becomes a total wet mess and the feeder is impossible to clean. I even tried duct tape to solve the problems with the lid but NO GOOD. The thing is such a mess we are just THROWING OURS AWAY.

When the author isn't quoting or paraphrasing Buffett, he is arthritically connecting Buffett's ideas with strangely incomplete summaries of tangential concepts like Kelly betting or Stern Stewart's EVA and Cost of Capital (the latter concept has been explicitly rejected by Buffett's partner, Charlie Munger). At the end of the day, this book looks like an investor's collection of idealogical lint and Hagstrom seems like an overrated exponent of Buffett's investment strategies. Thoughtful Buffett newbies might have found Hagstrom's previous \\"The Warren Buffett Way\\" only vaguely unsatisfying, but those who have read-up on Buffett in the interim since Hangstrom's last book will find this latest work a muddled and half-baked mess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing but story","review":"This book give you a brief introduction to focus investing and its practitioner like John M.

My son wasn't even being rough with them, we just gently took them off of his head when a small piece of plastic that holds the ear cups to the headband broke off. We ended up having to use duct tape to hold them together for the flight home. What a waste of money! I recommend finding another brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!","review":"I had originally rated this product with 5 stars; however, over the past 3 months I have changed my mind. At first, I loved these headphones because they fit perfectly and were very comfortable for my 2 1/2 year old boy (he does have a large head, so these were great :)). I bought them as a Christmas gift in 2011 to go along with his LeapPad Learning Tablet. Now it is early March 2012 and they are already not functioning properly. The sound is warped and low. They have been well taken of so I know it's not something that we did. I am very disappointed that I bought the highly rated, expensive headphones thinking that they would last. Don't waste your money on these headphones!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fit for toddlers, but others will steal them","review":"At first I thought these earphones were extremely small and would not get too many years of use.

(Kidz gear) They fit me. They are comfortable and I can hear everything really good. That's all.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Comfortable","review":"I bought this headphone for my daughter because she recently got the iPod Touch. The main reason I bought this set opposed to something else is because of the maximum volume control feature. Come to find out, it really doesn't play a role in anything because the volume is controlled mainly on the device, not headphone. The fit is comfortable and I believe safer than regular ear buds. The ability to adjust the size is also excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"These are the best kids headphones","review":"I've tried a bunch of different kid's headphones (Sony, Griffin, Califone) and these are the best ones. They fit well on a wide range of ages and they seem pretty comfortable. They're well made and have stood up to some abuse. Also, the individual volume limiter is much better than the across-the-board approach that other kids headphones take. Thumbs up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love them!","review":"Got these for our toddler (19 months) to use on a long plane ride. She happily wore them and they fit great. Sound quality was good and we had no problems. Looking forward to using them next month on another long trip."},{"rating":"2","title":"Son loves it","review":"Product is a hit with my son (4). He loves having his own headphones to use and they fit quite well on his ears. His parents love that they have a maximum decibal limit and the little builtin volume control on the wire.The wires are the normal smallish headphone wires but the cord is nice and long and the connectors are mounted well on the ends so they should fray there.Overall we are quite happy with them,"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Earphones","review":"I purchased a couple of these headphones for my boys (6 1/2 & 4) to use in the car and with their Leapsters. They seem to be very well made and fit the boys very nicely. I also really like that they come with their own volume controls. We had a small problem with one set - the cord pulled out - but the Kidz Gear bunch were extremely quick in both their response and resolution to the issue!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Young Kids","review":"My 2 1/2 year old deals with sensory overload/ASD symptoms. He is easily overwhelmed when we are out in new or noisy places. These headphones are a life saver for us. He loves music and it is calming for him. These headphones fit him so well and are comfortable for him even with is sensory issues. I just turn on his favorite music on the ipod and pop these on him when he starts getting overwhelmed and on the verge of a meltdown when in a new environment and he is able to remain calm. I love watching him dance and sing to the music when he has these on.I saw some kid headphones at Best Buy and Wal-mart for about $3 less than these are wast tempted to try them but I am so glad I went with these. The cushion around the ears is great for blocking out extra sound and stays on his little head very well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kid's Headphones","review":"If you are looking for headphones to fit the heads of toddlers, these are great.

I was looking for headphones for my 8-year old that fit snuggly on his head and had a manual volume control. I bought these because both feautres were on these headphones.

She had a previous pair of Sony headphones that, while the had great sound quality, were a poor choice for her because of how small her head is. These earphones are great - they fit snug to her head and she doesn't complain at all about them. She did complain about them on the plane because they make such a great seal that her ears didn't pressurize correctly and they bothered her on the descent. Be forewarned - they fit really well and have a bit of a noise-cancelling feature to them - so she hears me even less than normal when I'm talking to her (how convenient for her)!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Long Lasting and Comfortable for the Whole Family","review":"I purchased 3 pairs of these headsets 8 years ago for my children - 18 mos, 3yrs, & 5yrs at the time.They have seen heavy use ever since. Today, I decided that I needed to purchase new pairs as the set that I use 5+hrs/day has stopped working on one side.When I purchased the headsets they were comfortable for all three children and I have found that they are perfect for me also. For some perspective, I am a 6' tall woman with a large bone structure. My husband also finds them to be comfortable although he rarely uses headphones. My children (who range in age from 8 to 14 now) all prefer these headsets to any others still.The three best features are the comfort of the earpieces, the wide range of heads that they fit, and the in-line volume control. 8 years ago ours did not come with the volume limit cable so I cannot speak to that."},{"rating":"2","title":"So glad I found these for my toddler!","review":"These headphones not only fit my 2 year old very well, the adjustable ears have plenty of room so she'll get to use them as she grows. She was so comfortable wearing these headphones and the sound quality was fine. These headphones feel durable, so for the price, it was a great find!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works on the airplane","review":"These are quality headphones they cover the whole ear; we were only able to find earbuds at Best Buy. No problem hearing the video on the airplane which is why we purchased the headphones. Now our 3 year old likes to wear them at home with his little DVD player."},{"rating":"2","title":"great investment","review":"I purchased two pair of headphones for my 3- and 4-year-old children. We have wireless headphones for the dvd player in our van, but my son pulled off the ear padding on both sets. I love the padding on the Kidz Gear b/c they won't come off. Also, the kids have Leapsters, which come with earbuds. However, they have a hard time keeping them in their ears. The Kidz Gear headphones are perfect for this. The only downside is that the headphones have cords. But, that is how they are advertised. The cords are plenty long enough to use in the van, but they do hang down from the dvd player. We just have to remind the kids to be careful with them. Overall, this is a great product, especially for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Needed Some Silence","review":"I purchased these headphones for my 3yr old son. WHAT A GREAT BUY. He loves them. He can put them on without my assistance (unlike the ear buds that came with his iPod Touch). He also used them while on a flight.

The biggest plus for me was that he could put them on by himself (especially while I'm driving)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fits and works very well on my 6 year old","review":"Great size and he loves his new set of head phones. Nothing more I have to say except its definitely worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for kids!","review":"This is the second pair of these headphones that I have purchased. I bought the first ones for my preschool aged child around the winter holidays in 2010. We have been very pleased with their fit, comfort, sound quality, durability, and value. More recently, I bought a second pair for my younger child. My satisfaction with the first pair obviously drove my purchase decision for the second pair. I would recommend these headphones to any parents with young children."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good while it worked","review":"I purchased these headphones in October for my daughter to watch her dvd and play her nintendo ds without disturbing others while we travel. She used them a maximum of four times, after each use the headphones were stored. By April of the following year, she was complaining that the headphones had no sound. Indeed after jiggling the wire the sound came in and then left. I'm back to the drawing board looking for a kid-friendly headphone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Ipad","review":"I purchased these when a family member passed down an ipad to my 2.5 yr old. My son enjoys playing all sorts of learning games and watching shows on netflix on his ipad. I am not one of those parents who lets their kids be babysat by tv or an ipad for any length of time but sometimes it is just what my son needs to occupy him on a long car ride. I bought these specifically for that purpose. I use it in conjuction with the Muvn case and it works beautifully. My son tends to wear these upside down or just around his neck like a dj which is fine with me as long as I don't have to hear tom the cat drink his milk for the upteenth time. I haven't noticed any durability issues and I think the design is perfect for him. I only wish that the overall aesthetics were a bit more juvenile or cute. I also think that the price was pretty reasonable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love these headphones!","review":"I bought these headphones for my 6 year old and 3 year old to use on road trips. They fit great on both of them and are very comfortable as they aren't fidgeting with them at all. I've only had the product for a month but so far so good!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good headphones","review":"These headphones work great. We had a hard time finding some to fit my 5 year old but these do the job. They adjust easily to fit my 1 year old too. The cord is a little long and gets in the way but my kids just use them to listen to music while doing other activities or playing handheld games. I am sure it would be handy that long for movies or something like that though. For $20 they were a great buy and MUCH sturdier than others in that price range. My 1 year old is pretty rough on them and they are holding up nicely. I would definatly buy additional sets when needed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for my 15 month old!","review":"We bought these for a long plane ride with our 15 month old son. They fit his head nicely (with room to grow as he gets bigger). I was surprised that he was able to leave them on as long as he did. I assume that means they are comfortable!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great headphones for little heads","review":"I bought 2 of these, one for my two year old and the other for my 4 year old, to use with a portable DVD device on a plane trip. The size easily adjusts, it does not slide to larger settings once on, and they are very comfortable to wear. The sound is great and they do a decent job of canceling out surrounding sounds. They can handle a bit of stretching by little hands aswell but I am still careful about storing them. I'm sure they would break if stepped on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great headphones for kids","review":"These headphones work great for my four year old. He had ruined a pair of the cheap Wal-Mart headphones after a couple months, so wanting something better I found these on Amazon. Now he's had them for the same amount of time as the cheap ones, and they're still like new. The sound is good from them too. They are too small for me to put on, but they fit my son perfect. For the price I can't imagine a better child sized set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Product","review":"Work very well for my children. Great for on the plane with the loud jet engines.

They are great quality and very kid friendly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality kids headphones","review":"We got these for my son before traveling on a plane, hoping that and a portable DVD player would keep him distracted enough to sit still for a couple hours. It worked! Since then he constantly wants the headphones. He'd probably much prefer watching a small TV w/ headphones then the big one w/out (which is fine by me!). They've held up well to many drops and throws as well. They are also very quiet and I do not fear they can ever be turned up to a volume that can damage fragile ears! The volume control is nice too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Headphones","review":"We bought two pair of these for our children, ages 7 and 2.

Flight home he never took them off.As I mentioned earlier he just a week earlier refused to wear two other cheapo's. Awesome product!

Why on earth would they market these for kids?!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Real American Haunting--Not Fiction","review":"The Bell Witch Haunting closely follows the two real-life, non-fiction, written accounts I recently read. A handful of scenes are those I am not familiar with, but they could have been mentioned in some obscure journals or newspapers of the 1800's, so I'm not going to score the movie down on those conditions. I will say the acting was not top-notch, but as I have mentioned before, the account itself seems to be authentic. A few scenes may startle the viewer, but it is in no way a \\"blood and guts\\" film. For those who are curious about the Bell Witch of Tennessee, this movie is worth watching."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gave me the Collywobbles","review":"I've long been a fan of the Bell Witch Haunting in literature and folklore. Now there is a film about the events that does the tales I have read justice. Don't bother with An American Haunting, they left out and changed way to much of the story for my taste.For a lower budget production, this movie was very well done. You could tell the cast and crew wanted to get the story right. It just goes to show that a big budget and special effects are no match for some ingeniuty and creativity in making a good old scary movie. Kudos to Ric White and the rest who made this delightfuly creepy flick. I will enjoy it for many years to come."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good!","review":"The cover to the book said something like \\"Hagberg now takes his rightful place alongside Tom Clancy and Clive Cussler.\\" Not with this book he doesn't.

If your hoping for good puzzles this game isn't for you, because the puzzles often make no sense at all! After ten minutes of the game I wanted to hunt down the creators of this game and beat them with a golf club. This game would of gotten two stars if it's name was thuggernaut.

David Hass puts in the strongest showing, including the very moving \\"Wherever You Go\\". Most of Marty Haugen's songs are more somber than usual though \\"All You Works of God\\" is an upbeat, welcome addition to the album. So, I don't think this album is as strong as \\"Come and Journey\\", but it's quite a good album anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good","review":"This is a great idea with poor execution. While the arm band idea is great, it constantly moves around and irritates your arm. Further, it gets lousy reception-so the music is always static.

Perhaps they're bitter that they already purchased past editions of ROBOTECH and all of a sudden, this one comes along. In remastering this edition of ROBOTECH, they have created a 5.1 surround sound track, and used the original film masters from Japan (Macross), and have added scenes not found in previous versions of ROBOTECH. Sure, there are a few scenes that are found in MACROSS and not in here, but that's what seperates MACROSS from ROBOTECH. This is the BEST edition you'll ever find on DVD and the one to collect.

There's no other edition better out there!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is Remastered?","review":"Call me a purist but this is not exactly what was advertised. I remember the jaw-dropping original series well and when I heard the DVDs would be available I preordered both Robotech and the original Macross series.Robotech Remastered does not nclude all the scenes which were dropped from the original series and I can live with that. However, the new sound effects are distractingly loud, unnecessary, and inappropriate. For example, a futuristic veritech falling from high altitude does not sound like a diving prop plane and reflex missiles do not sound like whistling backyard fireworks! They certainly did not sound like that in the original airings.I'm planning on selling my copy.

The mystery of the templars, the mystery of Russia. It was a good idea.But the script and the acting was absolutely horrible. Even the car races that they tried to use to liven up the film were not up to snuff.One of the main characters, Wolf, was so Arnold-esk in his early films that I can see him making more action films in the next 5 years. Hopefully with acting lessons under his belt. However one mystery to the film. Wolf's girlfriend. She gets kidnapped, rescued, then is in the click trying to solve the templar mystery and then we never see her again. Probably the last 30 min., she's disappeared. She was kind of a presistant and likable, terciary character, and just disappears.

We went on vacation together, took identical pictures half the time, and the image quality was just SOOOO much better with the Canon. I ditched the Olympus and bought a SD750 later on, and I'm much happier with the focus, color, clarity, and especially low-light shots. Maybe you could do something with the different settings, but for a novice shooting Auto-Olympus vs Auto-Canon, pay the extra money and get the Canon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Camera","review":"Great, camera, easy to use, video feature is wonderful.

It was very easy to learn how to use. The down side is that it sucks the life out of your batterys, but I use it a lot and the movies do not have sound on it. Also it was kind of confusing up loading the pictures on my computer, but with the directions and a help of a friend anyone can do it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that good","review":"The first one only lasted Two Days! Only used once other time in the next month, the next time I tried to use it on vacation that month it was dead again.

The camera has nice features but not if it doesn't turn on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wonderful camera - but it fritzed out within 3 days","review":"I researched several cameras in this price range before buying the Olympus, and was extremely happy with it - until it ceased to function properly (a heavy gold tint to every picture, with horizontal bars across the image) after three days, just as I was beginning to shoot a 50th birthday party for my best friend. I don't feel comfortable buying another, as obviously I have a better chance of getting another lemon. I'll be getting a bulkier but hopefully more durable Canon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice size - too fragile","review":"When i got the camera, I was looking for one that would be a nice small size to fit in my purse so i could take it everywhere. It's great and compact and all.. but i dropped it once and now it has problems. It sometimes shuts itself off with the shutter still out. It takes a lot longer to save and view pictures now. I always had canon cameras before and they survived multiple drops before showing any problems.The good things though... the camera seems to have a pretty good battery life. I was concerned with the big lcd and no regular viewfinder, but i don't have problems with the battery. The pictures are ok, but low light images don't look very good a lot of the time. the image stabilization is a nice feature that i do use often though."},{"rating":"1","title":"so sorry I bought this one","review":"This camera's size is perfect. However, the pictures it takes sure aren't. I have changed the quality of the pictures too and it really doesn't make a difference. If you use the zoom, the picture quality is horrible.

I would say the pictures look like they where taken with a 2MP camera.I just called Olympus for help and the tech mentioned that this model has generated lots of calls and there is nothing they can do to sharpen the quality. They got me over to customer service where they said if I would \\"surrender\\" my FE-190 to Olympus they would sell me a FE-200 at a discounted price of $226.

He seems to have wrote most of this from his stream of consciousness, and I can recal nothing interesting had had to say. I stuck with him because I was shocked that this exalted author could so disappoint, but he was as bad at the end as in the middle. I've calibrated myself on \\"highbrow\\" stuff, and his ain't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunately","review":"It is really the five stars that scare me.....this novel is only so good as you avoid all the others who have done this \\"genre\\" before. By genre I mean the rock and roll novel, the spectacle, and the myths we place upon those persons. Rushdie is about thirty years too late to pick up the mantle of Thomas Pynchon, and it shows: where TP's songs resonate with creativity, Rushdie's are more along the lines for the older Sting/ Will Smith crowd. Something I think is a mistake in the book is thinking music remains the same for all generations, that the enthusiasm is the base element in equal supply throughout. This isn't so--music takes many forms and different guises and means many different things; and it proceeds at a brutally quick pace. Rushdie would have done well to not have studied his U2 buddies so much. The world has passed them by, and what he thinks he encapsulates slips out his fingers as easily as a hand misses a chord."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretentious and Badly Written","review":"I cringed while reading this book and actually flung it across a waiting area at a gate in Heathrow Airport in disgust upon finishing it. (No one was in the way and I did retrieve it - to throw it out properly in a trashcan.) Mr. Rushdie is obviously a brilliant man but he is out of his element writing about rock and roll. I felt embarrassed for him while reading this and I really did want to love it. The language is forced and pretentious; it sounds like it was written by a corporate CEO desperately trying to be cool."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rushdie rips-off Dick","review":"Actually, I haven't read the book, I just wanted to express my dismay at Rushdie ripping off the real life experiences of Philip K. Dick, whose work should be read (not just appropriated):Ormus's twin brother died at birth and communicates to him from \\"the other side\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"not his cup of tea","review":"Good writing and style.

Self-indulgent doesn't even begin to describe it. I actually threw this one against the wall!! It has not yet made its way to the garbage can...instead, I am mailing it to a friend of mine who got three pages farther into the Satanic Verses than did I. It was the last book either one of us was unable to finish, so I can't wait until she calls me to tell me that she got as far as chapter 5 and threw it in the garbage!! Why even pick up Rushdie again, you ask? I guess I just couldn't deny someone who wrote such engrossing, beautiful and compelling works as Midnight's Children and the Moor's Last Sigh another chance. I will not be so foolish again...give it a miss."},{"rating":"1","title":"More cluttered than a Bombay night market","review":"I returned this book to the library barely halfway through. It appeared to be written by a pretentious Classics Ph.D candidate with a thesaurus in one hand and a meerschaum pipe in the other. Rushdie gives you two sentences of plot, then spends an hour waxing philosophical about a multitude of obscure things, which, while interesting on their own, become such a mishmash of misplaced ideas that the whole thing just loses its momentum and the interest of the reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Ground Beneath Her Feet","review":"The book itself is brilliant, Salman Rushdie is a master! However, I was really disappointed at Amazon's delivery. Two pages inside the book were torn apart so that those two half cannot be read at all and the rest of these two pages were completely covered with black marker pen! This was my first and my last order from Amazon. I did not even place a complaint since I was so disappointed that I do not even want to bother myself with that anymore. But again, the book itself is a masterpiece!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Until now, Rushdie was a tease","review":"Until this novel, Salman Rushdie was a tease. Yes, his words are musical and magical, inventive and playful. And yes, his characters are complicated and real.But I knew I was missing half of what he wrote. Who caught the targets of his allusions? Not me. I don't know the Koran (Satanic Verses) or the history of Pakistan (Shame) or India (Midnight's Children).Now he has written something for me. Set in India and London and New York, the references and allusions are all to rock and roll. Elvis, Ike and Tina, Dylan, Madonna and U2 are obvious. Less obvious are David Bowie, David Byrne, and the Clash. But they are all here.And the story is moving, easily the most emotional work he has crafted."},{"rating":"2","title":"For The Fans","review":"It's interesting to see other reviewers contrast Ground Beneath Her Feet with Midnight's Children, as my thoughts ran the same way. While Midnight's Children is Rushdie's best novel, Ground Beneath Her Feet is the most fun. It is not a book for someone who is not a veteran Rushdie reader, as the author's puckish jokes and references to pop culture abound, and would irritate anyone who hasn't learned to love his puns and wordplay. In some ways Ground Beneath Her Feet reminded me of what Kurt Vonnegut said about his Breakfast of Champions: it's a book the author wrote as a gift to himself. Here, Rushdie is riffing and having fun with language. If you don't take it too seriously, it's a great ride. (It's also tremendous fun trying to catch all the fictional characters who are alive in Rushie's alternate reality.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Give this book the attention it demands","review":"These 2 and 3 star reviews are frightening me. This is an incredible book but it seems that people just aren't finding it so. If you read it carefully (this isn't Grisham here) you will find that it ranks up there with MIDNIGHTS CHILDREN or THE MOORS LAST SIGH. Rushdie is arguably our greatest living author, and this book is proof of that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not his best, but well done again.","review":"Bought it the day it was out, started reading it and am still in the 1st quarter of the book. Usually I'm reading books faster, even Rushdi, but here I have the feeling that the story takes its time to really unfold. Rushdi, in the character of Rai, is telling his own story of the last years he had to be in \\"exile\\", but somehow I could not get the clue, yet. The thing with Rushdi's books is that sometimes you have to read them twice or even trice before the point and story really seeps in and becomes clear. Although he is writing in his wonderful fictional, and sarcastic humorous, style again, I would not say that \\"THE GROUND BENEATH HER FEET\\" is his best book, but well done again."},{"rating":"1","title":"love Vina - miss profoundness","review":"I got through and loved Vina. However, The Ground Beneath.. wasn't deep enough to compare to the incredulous Moor. Mr. Rushdie, I believe, does not have an as profound or grown knowledge of the Western culture as no doubt he has of the Indian (like no other). Thus I find the story less convincing and catching (at times I was about to give up). I miss the deep underlying understanding which to me has characterised Mr. Rushdie's phantastic past works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two-dimensional characters, muddled plot","review":"This is a brave attempt at retelling the Orpheus/Eurydice myth in a modern, rock 'n' roll context. And you can't fault Rushdie's skill with words. The puns and allusions fly thick and fast. But he fails to make any of the central characters anything more than cartoonish. Avatars, he'd say. Add to that the problem that the plot wobbles from one improbable event to another. It's hard to swallow the idea that two essentially boring characters -- Ormus and Vina -- could produce the kind of world-shaking music Rushdie credits them with. There's a sneering tone about real stars like the Beatles and Elvis, which many may find annoying. But then, he's always been anti-Western culture, perhaps as much as he has been tagged anti-Moslem. Far too long, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Play 'Free Bird\\"! \\"","review":"I have a great deal of respect for Salman Rushdie's work. I have been a serious student of his novels for several years now. It is thus with regret I must report that his current novel, \\"The Ground Beneath Her Feet\\", is the textual equivalent of a lighter waved in the air. It takes Rushdie over 500 pages to say, in essence, \\"Play 'Free Bird'! Yeeeaaaahh! \\" This is an unfortunate turn of events, to say the least. The novel is undisciplined and self-indulgent, melodramatic and maudlin. It is, in short, a midlife crisis of a book. The story of over-sized, one-dimensional Celebrities, \\"The Ground Beneath Her Feet\\" fails to engage the reader or create any sympathy for its spoilt, unpleasant protagonists. Rushdie's readers have come to expect better. It is to be hoped his next book will be less of a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite disappointing","review":"Rushdie's editor was sleeping on the job...At 575 pages, this is just way too long...rushdie doesn't break any new ground on this one...the writing is tired, the characters flat and reading the entire book is a just a waste of one's time...Absolutely hollow...I guess he peaked with \\" Satanic Verses\\"...since then it's been downhill"},{"rating":"2","title":"He's done it again","review":"Salman Rushdie knows how to tell stories, he knows how to enthrall his readers. The Ground Beneath His Feet is no exception, it's a colourful story about love and music, and it kept me within its magic until the last page of the book. Go ahead, read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"So far so good","review":"So far, I have read the excerpts that were in the New Yorker, and I think the book promises to be vintage Rushdie. I also had the chance today to see him read from the same excerpts at his first public appearance/book-reading in Manhattan. From what I could see, this book is a message from his heart, and he really has been affected by the ideas deep down in the book. It was a pleasure to hear him read, complete with imitations of some of the Mexican characters in the book, and hope all of us are able to see him in person many times over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dazzling language, lame story","review":"The Ground Beneath Her Feet was written during a fairly miserable time for fiction (I can think of few really great novels from the mid 90s). Rushdie, having covered the main territories of his life - India, Pakistan, Immigration in three tour de force novels, and followed it up with the mixed Moors Last Sigh, was clearly in search of a topic. What he produced is a bunging in of a lot of high/low cultural references which was all the rage at the time, a dubious plot based on the Orpheus myth, and a lot - a lot of self indulgent passages on a questionable filigree of cultural canvas that piece together in a colourful riot of a novel, but without much grist to the mill. The characters are a sort of modern Gods Behaving Badly - a similar device used in Melanie Philip's eponymous recent novel of same name. Neither book really swings it for me I'm afraid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"This was an awesome book. It was full of every single thing I have ever obsessed about-India, the US, the Anglophilic South Bombay Scene, foppish 60s London, the Bohemian New York crowd, Love, and Rock music. I think every Indo-American should read it. Only complaint was that the characterization was a bit weak. P.S.

In film, actors like Ben Stiller are routinely - and almost exclusively - paired with blond, WASP leading ladies. This sends the wrong message. It makes Jewish women feel bad about themselves, and gives Jewish men the message that something is wrong with Jewish women.Nimoy's work will not seem \\"Kosher\\" to many.However, my immediate, gut emotional response - was to seeing an attractive, sensual portrayal of a Jewish woman on the cover, even if it was somewhat \\"immodest\\".Does this represent me as a Jewish woman?I sure hope so!Does Fran Drescher?Absolutely NOT.THANK YOU, Mr Nimoy, for a much-needed celebration of Jewish femininity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful work","review":"... this is a beautiful book. It celebrates the sensual and spiritual without the predictable \\"the body is evil\\" ethos that is so sadly common in the Jewish and Christian religions.The body is beautiful, reflective of the beauty of its Creator (if you believe in one), and of the beauty of nature. Leonard Nimoy proves himself to be a suprisingly skilled photographer in capturing the beauty.Nimoy, for so long defined by his portrayal of a fictional character in a television and film series, has shown a different, and appealing, side of himself in this work.

It is broken down sections with a different workout for each day of the week. I didn't really care for the cardio section and I haven't tried the toning segments. Honestly, I think the instructor looks ill and uncoordinated. I would never by another DVD from her again. After doing this once, I haven't touched it. If you are looking for DVDs with cardio and toning I would recommend The Wedding Workout from Women's Health, Shape Magazine's Transforming Workout, 30 Day Shred, or The Firm's Maximum Calorie Burn. The Lotte Berk Method is excellent for just toning and so are Tamilee's DVDs. Don't waste your time or money on this.

You are supposed to do these same workouts over and over. Muscle has \\"memory\\" and will easily adjust to these workouts. The key for me is to stay CHALLENGED.

I cannot believe the negative comments-has anyone else ever done a Denise Austin DVD (I lover her, but c'mon) or even Kathy Smith? I think Leisa is terrifc. My arms are so sore from the upper body workout and I just did it! The pilates workout is basic-but it's not bad.

The Personal Trainer section is great and offers many different combinations of the workouts. The pilates and yoga sessions are energizing and relaxing. The cardio workout is a little complicated at first, but I imagine repitition will help. I love the idea of having a different workout every day of the week. And once I get back to my ideal weight, I will still be able to use the video! I'll be able to use the \\"Take It Easy\\" or \\"Mantenance\\" Programs within the Personal Trainer. I recommend this video to anyone who's bored with walking or stationary workout equipment - I sure was!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is an awful video...","review":"There is no order to the workout. It's actually more comical than physical and the pace doesn't even seem like it's something Leisa is comfortable with. She doesn't initially repeat what the movements are, just refers to the random names she has assigned them. She is generally finsihed with the step before telling you what it is. It's absurd. I don't know how this thing got produced--it's terrible. It's as if it's a SNL skit on aerobics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money OR time!","review":"I work out quite often and use a variety of different DVDs to stay fit. This is the only one that I absolutely cannot follow. I am literally lost within about 5 seconds. She uses very elaborate moves in the cardio section without any demonstration or warning beforehand. Unless you want to be utterly frustrated, I recommend passing on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, Ken, you got that one title wrong...","review":"'cause Kenny, man, you HAVE \\"sold out.\\" Glad to hear you're clean and sober, but what happened? And KID ROCK'S on here! That alone should be a dead give-away to anyone contemplating the purchase of this CD. Stay away, and keep playing the old stuff. Sold this one back at the used CD store already."},{"rating":"1","title":"KWS, play the guitar, let Noah sing","review":"I have been waiting patiently for 5 years for a new KWS album. Live On was a good 4 star album. However, this is not worth buying. KWS is not a good singer, and the 2 stars I gave were for the 2 songs Noah sang on. For a while, I thought KWS was doing Lenny Kravitz cover tunes.As with Johnny Lang's last album, very poor effort - trying to be too commercial and trying to stray from what made them popular. Goood musicianship."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horribly Disappointing","review":"Like many others I had eagerly awaited the release of this album. KWS's first three albums were so fantastic and I expected this one to be at least as good, if not better. Unfortunately, it falls far short of my expectations.There are only two songs on this album that aren't absolute disasters - the two featuring vocals by Noah Hunt. Kenny's vocal talent is mediocre at best and is totally unsuited for the type of music he is trying out on this album. It seems that KWS is searching for himself with this effort. Unfortunately, it seems he has lost himself in the process."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS IS BLOODY BAD","review":"JUST TO SAY THAT THIS STINKS IS NOT ENOUGH.ANYTIME YOU HAVE A TALENT LIKE THIS THAT IS WASTING IT,IT MAKES YOU WANT TO PUKE.THIS DISC IS THAT BAD.KENNY WAS A VERY TALENTED BLUES GUITAR PLAYER ON HIS FIRST THREE CD\`S AND NOW HE IS TRYING TO BE MR POP STAR.I THINK KENNY HAS BEEN WATCHING AMERICAN IDOL TO MUCH BECAUSE HE SOUNDS ALITTLE LIKE CLAY AKINS.COME ON KENNY,PULL YOUR HEAD OUT OF YOUR ASS AND SWALLOW YOUR STINKIN PRIDE AND GO BACK TO WHAT YOU DO BEST,WHICH IS PLAY THE BLUES.THIS CD BLOWS.I JUST WISH I COULD GIVE IT A ZERO STARS ITS THAT BAD.PLEASE DON\`T MAKE THE MISTAKE I DID BY BUYING THIS."},{"rating":"1","title":"a stunning stylistic shift (from blues to lame)","review":"Much like the Dave Mathews Band, The KWS band changed their sound so they would get a broader market share - gone are the funk and the blues.Now they are Britneyfied. This album contains the same boring pop smear that is on every radio station from country to rock to pop. Same lame cliche'd lyrics, same flavorless accompanying music.This is the reason CD sales are crashing. No one wants to pay for the same music they can hear on any radio station at any time of day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Growing Pains","review":"KWS is clearly trying to stretch his wings on this album. He does the majority of the vocals (for the first time) and has definitely diverged from his previous albums' style of SRV and Hendrix styled electric blues guitars.I don't begrudge him, or any artist, the attempt to grow and find his own artistic identity. This attempt, however, was a failure. Rather than being progressive and eclectic, it's scattered and unfocused. He sings a few songs, his (former?) vocalist sings a couple (and makes you wonder why he wasn't allowed to sing them all), he attempts a \\"modern rock\\" sound, tries a ballad or two, has a forgetable duet with Kid Rock, and even throws in instrumental.It's a shame. I was hoping (expecting?) he would be the dominant figure for decades to come in the blues/rock genre. From the sounds of this album, he's specifically (and disappointingly) chosen to defy that expectation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing.","review":"I've read the reviews on Amazon and am relieved to know that I'm not the only disappointed customer. Being a huge KWS fan, this new CD was a complete let down. I listened to it over and over again, hoping it would grow on me. Whoever is singing the vocals sounds like they have a nasal problem. I miss the rock-bluesy sounds of the previous CD's. Kenny, go back to your old style because this new style just isn't YOU and you have a lot of disppointed fans. Sometimes change is not for the best."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"KWS was blazing a trail. The blues rock gunslinger that every fan of the genre was holding as the torch bearer. My chin hit my chest as I heard Lenny Kravitz spewing forth from the speakers. I could've sworn I put the new KWS CD into my dashboard CD player. I popped it out, checked the label and stuck it back in, making sure is was set on CD and not crappy FM formula radio. No, it was KWS. I listened through, a couple of flickers of quality music, few and far between. Most ironically is the title of \\"Ain't Selling Out\\" which could be nothing more than a \\"Please don't hate me\\" plea. Oh, and a Kid Rock guest job, crikey! Next up, Eminem and Jay-Z with Sheryl Crow and Ice T's come-back.Better luck next time, Kenny."},{"rating":"1","title":"abducted by aliens?","review":"I agree with rocker81 that this is a Lenny Kravitz clone cd.Was the real KYS abducted by aliens? Sure it's a good thing to progress in your music but I don't know if this is anything close to that.I had to force myself to listen to the whole disc.Not a \\"fan friendly\\" cd.Maybe I should have been warned by the cover pic? Oh well,I'm sure there is some other aspiring young guitarist out there to fill the void left by KYS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kenny Wane Kravitz?","review":"Big disappointment, KWS is an incredible guitarist, this doesn't show that. Previous discs where KWS mastery of the guitar.. Noah, has the voice, KWS has the strings. Seen KWS live, he blows the roof off the arena, this CD does nothing. This is a letdown departure. Like Hercules, maybe the power was in his hair, he cut it short and lost his way?"},{"rating":"1","title":"What Could of Been","review":"I hate to criticize music, seems to be too many people doing so and its all quite subjective anyway but I was confused as to what direction Kenny is going on this disc. The blues, totally gone and as far as a rock effort goes its not bad. However, Kenny taking over most of the vocals duties from Noah was a serious mistake. Kenny's voice is alright but it lacks that distinction that makes Noah's vocals stand out. I think if he wanted to release a rock album he should of called it by another name because fans of the blues are going to miss out big time on this disc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this Kenny or Lenny?","review":"Dude sounds like Lenny Kravitz on this record... He needs to get Noah Hunt back in the record. It's kinda arrogant of him to misuse Noah in this manner since he's half of what made the band great in the first place.I'm not so surprised that Lenny errr Kenny has made out an album with so much generic stuff. Lets be real folks, like Jonny Lang, Kenny isn't truly a bluesman. He's more of a poser and posers true colors tend to come out sooner or later. Well, it's happend here with Mr.Sheppard.I hope Noah goes a finds a band that can respect his talent and the role he played in making the band good. The only good songs here are Alive and the other two songs sung by Noah."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Place You're In","review":"Very disappointing. I'm glad I didn't waste money purchasing a new CD. Kenny Wayne Sheperd should stick to playing the guitar and leave the singing to Noah Hunt! If Mr. Hunt is not singing on the next CD, I certainly won't buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"kenny Goes Rock/POP","review":"The Place you're in isn't a Blues LP. That being said there are some blues moments. I think Kenny wanted to explore his inner Rock/POP star. If you want a traditional KS blues LP don't buy this one. However I'm giving it 4/5 stars because it is a good rock/pop LP. This is more like a Daughtry album. It is very listenable. But nothing that you go...\\"oh I need to hear that again\\". A lot of KWS are really ticked off...however if you listen to this with KWS playing rock/POP star you'll be much happier"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where Has All The Blues Gone?","review":"A few years back the blues rock scene was smokin' with young and very talented guitarist like, Jonny Lang, Kenny Wayne Shepherd and Mato Naji of Indigenous, they were all doing some great blues rock stuff and getting noticed everywhere. My question is where has all the blues gone? None of these guys play the blues any more, everyone wanted to call all three of these guys the next SRV, but Stevie Ray never sold out the blues he just kept re-inventing it, I still believe there is hope for Mato Naji to get back on the blues track, but I have given up on Jonny Lang and it looks like I can count KWS out as well. If it wasn't for the Blues all three of these cats would have never been discovered! If you want real blues rock then get you a Joe Bonamassa CD you won't be disappointed like I was with this CD. All I have to say to Kenny is remember where you came from!!!The Banditwww.banditbluesradio.com"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"If your looking for what we heard on KWS first couple of recordings you wont find it on this CD. This recording findsKenny doing most of the singing in a more Heavy Metal style,sounding a little like Lenny Kravites.I dont like the stylechange, the guitar is ok in some of the songs, but the hooksand the songs arent very good. Unlike Kenny's first couple ofCD's these song's wont grap you or stay with you and you wont want to hear them again and again."},{"rating":"1","title":"KENNY, KENNY, KENNY, LENNY, LENNY, LENNY...","review":"What a huge letdown...after waiting all of these years for the new KWS we get a poorly done Lenny Kravitz wannabe albumn. Kenny should let Noah do the singing and let himself do the guitar work. Speaking of guitars, this albumn was sub-par for Kenny. I thought that maybe after all of these years he would have gotten much sharper with all of the practice time he has had. Maybe he was visiting with Mr. Brownstone a little too much...I don't know? When people are comparing KWS to SRV, expectations are VERY HIGH. This albumn is by far the worst one he has put out. The only bright spot I could see was the song Noah sang in. Kenny, clean up and go back to your roots...ELECTRIC BLUES!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I too was disappointed in KWS's departure from the unique soulfull bluesy style he once had. This new album impresses me as a B grade alternative music soundalike. My young daughter has dozens of albums that sound like this, except perhaps for the few residual guitar riffs that KWS is still capable of. And Kenny should please, please put Noah back on all the vocals or he should get his own band. He is way too talented to be relegated to 2 tracks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why This?","review":"Yea, if I wanted to hear Lenny Kravitz, I would've bought his albums, oh yea, I did that when he was good about 10 years ago.I saw KWS @ the Silo in Reading, PA in '96 when nobody even heardof him and he was great, the band at that time was really tight.By the way Noah Hunt sounds like he's forcing his lyrics, thereal singer of this band was Corey Sterling. He left KWS to jointhe Chris Aaron band, if you want to hear real Blues Rock, I suggest you check them out.We already have enough \\"pop\\" clones on the radio today. I don't mind a little stylistic change in order to move forward musically, but this, I don't think so. I'll save my money and go see the Los Lonely Boys again.Good luck, Kenny and I'll see you hopefully when you leave this behind, and return to music that comes from the heart. not the wallet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another good album by KWS","review":"This album is much more rock oriented than his previous three and KWS sings lead on the majority of the album. Noah Hunt contributes two GREAT vocal performances and Kid Rock sings on one as well. Kenny's guitar work is excellent throughout and his style has really evolved since Trouble is. While the Place You're In is not as blues oriented as his previous albums, it does contain a couple of blues/rock tracks such as Get It Together and Be Mine. My personal favorites on the album are Believe, Let Go, and The Place You're In. Overall, I liked this album and would recommend it to anyone who likes rock music and great guitar work. Another great artist to check out who I recently discovered is Howard Lee Edwards. His new album is coming out soon and he's got a couple of songs off it on his website www.HowardLeeEdwards.com. Check it out for some more great rock music!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I give him my respect now.","review":"I'll admit that I have always been an SRV fan and when KWS first came about I was looking for someone to fill that void. I just never put him up there with the greats because he didn't take that leap to let his voice be heard along with his fiddle. I know some people just don't have the voice but I think to win over fans you have to take that chance and on this album Kenny did just that. And let me tell you it pays off. He doesn't try to be SRV and that's a good thing because he has his own sound and that deserves so much more respect than if he was trying to be someone else. I know alot of people will be turned off to his new sound but I'm not one of them and before people decide to let this one pass they should really give it a listen. I really think you will appreciate this album much more because of the step he's taken to showcase all of his talents."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why screw up a good thing ...","review":"I was of the impression in music that if you had a good thing going you wouldn't want to mess with it ... Noah Hunt vocals and KWS guitar is some of the best rockin' blues I've ever heard, but Kenny just ain't no vocalist. Not kinda, not even a little bit ... I was extremely disappointed with this album, but it did motivate me to do some emergency research to make sure Noah was still singing - so it served some purpose. Please, take note of the reviews, Kenny - go back to what works and share the road with Noah!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This Stinks!!","review":"KWS has sold out. Kid Rock? Where is Noah?

That is the only reason that Kenny Wayne is so well known. Sure he is a decent player, but when I think of the other young guns out there, Joe Bonamassa comes to mind first , KW is way down the list in talent.This particilar effort is his worst so far, it's like he is trying to go to more of a straight hard rock thing and is getting away from the blues/rock that was on his earlier albums. And he can not sing, sorry KW stick to playing the guitar and let poeple that know how to sing do the singing.Stay away from this album, it is a waste of money, I sold mine at a second hand cd shop for a quarter of what I paid for it and am glad I got that."},{"rating":"1","title":"memo","review":"Memo to the reviewer a few reviews ago:SAMSON was the Bibilical strongman who owed his strength to his hair.Hercules (Heracles) was strong because he was the son of the chief god in ancient Greek mythology, Zeus."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kenny, get back to your roots!","review":"This album is a disappointing departure from the signature, blues rock sound of KWS. Kenny seems to be hunting for a new musical persona, with varied results resembling Lenny Kravitz, pop rock, and progressive rock.Kenny, embrace your destiny. You were born for blues rock. Come home.It's ok to sound like Stevie Ray Vaughan, because he's dead, and someone has to keep making that music we love. And while I do love Lenny, you are not him, and your talent is wasted emulating him.It's time to have your woman leave you again, start churning out the blues, get the soulful Noah Hunt back on the mic, and come home to your millions of loyal fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kenny Wayne who?","review":"What's the deal with this album. Whatever happened to Kenny Wayne Shepherd? Big disappointment. Is that him singing or is somebody making tennis raquets out of cats in the recording studio?

In fact Ledbetter Heights is in the player as I write, replacing Live On. I like his singing but damn what's with the heavy metal noise? I have listened to the cd twice...you know try to give it a chance to grow on me. With the exception of the song that was played on the radio that Kenny sings that prompted me to buy this cd & 2 songs Noah sings I don't care for it at all & probably won't ever listen to it again.

Do not buy this album, it is radio friendly garbage!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Place You're In ~ Kenny Wayne Shepherd","review":"I was disappointed with this CD. I expected it to be the same driving blues sound that had become Kenny Wayne Shepherd's signiture. Instead I found that he has turned to some sort of metal step-child type music. He has matured as is evidenced by the fact that he no longer looks like a Hanson outcast. I expected his music to mature along with him and become a much more grown up version of his flavor of blues, alas it did not. Almost without exception every artist puts out a collection that is not up to par with their usual work. I hope that this collection is his only diversion from what his fans have come to expect from him. Come back Kenny we miss you!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Kenny-Where'd You Go?","review":"Hello? What is this? OK it's not the KWS Band, too bad. As a KWS fan who's traveled as much as 300+ miles to see him, I must admit that I wouldn't go a block to see this! I like so many others was hot to get this after such a long wait. Perhaps Kenny waited too long, like Jonny Lang's Long Time Coming. The only bright spots on the whole cd are \\"Believe\\", and \\"Burdens\\",which are of course Noah Hunt's vocals. Kenny you cannot sing, do what you have to to get Noah back! Where's the blues? And the Kid Rock thing, \\"Spank\\"(cannot call it music) what in the \\"h...\\" is that?! Kenny go back to what you do well. I will have to listen to samples here before I buy any more from you.

I heard a song on the radio, and really enjoyed it. Since then I'd basically forgotten about him...unfortunately.However, I recently ran across a news snippet about his album. I went to his website, and listened to the streams there and that was all it took.I got the CD for Christmas, and it has yet to leave my discman.I suppose if I had been accustomed to his previous work it might be a bit of a shock to me (style-wise), but I love it!I like the other vocalist, but I REALLY like Kenny's voice.Personally, I hope his future releases reflect this same style.

The tremendous blues guitar work that is the halmark of the first three albums is missing as is the stand out vocals of Noah. \\"The Place Your In\\" is solid enough as a basic piece of pop/rock but bears no comparison to earlier albums, Trouble Is or Live On. KWS fans should make sure they listen to this new album before purchase as it is totaly different in style to his previous work. Good luck to Kenny I hope he has commercial success with this album, however its not for me. I'll wait until he serves up the blues again."},{"rating":"1","title":"What did I just listen to?","review":"Can someone please tell me: A)what happend to Noah Hunt, and B) why its no surprise that the two best songs on the album are the ones which feature him on lead vocals?

I love all kinds of music as long as it is good, this CD sad to say is ok. Would I have bought it knowing what I know now?, no.

Even saw him in an incredible concert. To say this album is a disappointment is indeed an understatement.Gone is the hard rocking blues sound, replaced by an almost punk sound on many of the tracks. Kenny is a horrible singer, so hearing Noah's voice on several tracks is indeed refreshing. But those songs that Noah did vocals were not really good ones, so it was almost a waste. Kenny's Guitar playing isn't smooth in this one. It's overamplified and not nearly the sound that made people think of him as Stevie or Jimi's heir. The only good tracks are Alive and Let Go. As the lyrics said in Ain't Sellin' Out, I will ask Kenny \\"What the hell were you thinkin'?\\" Please, go back to your roots."},{"rating":"1","title":"5 years & now this piece of ****?","review":"I didn't even want to buy the album after hearing 4 songs off the kwsband.com website.

He's also singing lead vocals and he's not half-bad but there is really not much here that hasn't been done better by someone else before. There are a couple of tunes \\"Be Mine\\" and \\"The Place You're In\\" that sound like mediocre Lenny Kravitz, \\"Let Go\\" which open with a nice backwards guitar solo and then melts into Steve Winwood on a bad day, \\"Hey, What Do You Say\\" with several guitar solos lifted right off of \\"Freebird\\" and a semi-catchy song called \\"Spank\\" with Kid Rock handling guest vocals.

I was really disapointed with this album, because after buying Ledbetter Heights, then a great Trouble Is....I thought I would never have to worry about his new release, until I pond upon this title which really sucked bad. Im sorry to all of the kenny wayne fans, who are truely influenced by this young texican, who transformed his whole style including his blues playing, no Noah only on two songs, and most of all to all of the blues fans this is hard rock.

However, it's more of a praise on Menahme Begin than an actual biography or full account of his life. Many highlights were touched upon and not dug deep into.Overall, it is a great book as it does praise one of the greatest leaders in Israeli history. I highly recommend it to all who have an interest in history and Israel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Glass Knob Cobalt Blue","review":"The colbalt blue knobs matched my bathroom vessel sink perfect and looks much better than the knobs I replaced that came with the cabinet. I think the glass makes it look more classy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly crafted","review":"I really wanted to like this book. The plot's premise and its characters are intriguing. Unfortunately, I found the book to be marred by the author's clunky writing style. There are too many characters and story lines that are clumsily drawn and that never coalesce. After awhile, it almost became punitive reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not an honest picture of the place, time or people","review":"No, not everyone in Alabama is illiterate. It took a week for me to readthe book. It was easy, boring, but mostly unlikely. The humor of the caricatures(not charactures) made me chuckle at first, then I got angry. Set in the 1950's in Mississippi? Well, perhaps someone could have gotten away with this charade back then, but let us hope we are more intelligent now. Perhaps a short story or two would have helped the writer learn to research her material better."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books I've read this year!","review":"Beautiful language, well drawn characters...my favorite were Even, Joody, Caanan, Grace and Joleb. My suggestion if you find the language difficult, let your eyes skim and the story come to you! Remember your swimming lessons: relax and float, don't thrash or you'll drown!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is work","review":"While I appreciate the author's ability to convey this interesting character study, I find it to be more toil than entertainment. However, I'll probably be a better person for having read it. . .if I live that long."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected from an Oprah book.","review":"Disappointed. I was really looking forward to another one of Oprah's books. This book was too long and boring. Hard as I tried, I could not connect w/ the characters. I was hoping to find out what the slitted pig was all about, but didn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish we were offered a choice of \\"zero stars\\".","review":"Very disappointed that I spent money for this book. It was such a struggle to get through. With all the rereading, it was like reading a 1000 page essay on a subject you know nothing about. When you finish it, you still don't know anything about it, and you're just happy that you don't have to read anymore of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enjoyed it but I'm alittle confused","review":"If someone gets the pig symbolisim I'd be interested in learning how to figure that out. I never get it! I liked the book but it took me a long time to read it. I loved the characters and liked the overall story. I did get lost sometimes. I wonder if it's a book that is better the second time. I wouldn't suggest it to someone who only reads a few books a year I'm afraid they might give up reading. It was a effort but again, I liked the story and I'm committed to finishing books. Enjoyed the ending"},{"rating":"1","title":"Requires diligence to get through.","review":"Thank you. I thought it was just me rereading pages to try to make sense of the whole story. I'm still struggling to get through this book, but, like others, determined to finish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"To be honest, I gave this book to my local library after 250 pages. It was just boring. I don't see how this book made it past the editor's desk. The writing style is confused and disjointed. Many times it didn't make any sense to me. There are too many other good books to read this summer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not For Teens....just an educator's thoughts","review":"While I enjoyed this book, it is not a book for teens. The reason I say this is because, upon doing a search for books for and about teenage African American girls, this selection appeared. Were the girl over 16 and a mature reader, perhaps. But for readers ages 13-16, not a good selection. There are too many scenes of violence, sexuality, and other questionable, adult issues for me to recommend it for the teen audience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Plenty of soul...","review":"I give this novel my highest raiting, and being an avid reader of many Oprah's Book Club books and other novels of many genres I can honestly appreciate it's quality. Melinda Haynes has an amazing writing style and the content overflows with incredible imagination. The reader follows the very distinct and contrasting lives of a handful of individuals, whose lives cross somewhere in the beginning, middle, and end, producing unions that seem surreal in nature, yet inspire hope for what can be natural if society permitted it. Whether one lives by the sea, in the depths of the deep south, or in the plains of middle america, anyone can appreciate this novel, not because of it's reality, but because of its look at human nature and existance on the soul level."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Real Life","review":"It is hard to know how to put my thoughts into writing. I read this book twice one right after the other in the summer of 1999. I am dumbstruck by the skill and complexity Melinda Haynes was able to come up with in her debut novel. I almost want to call her and discuss the book. It is real, funny, warm, loving and heartbreaking. How can one book be all of that? I am now in a book group and am recommending this to them to read. I know that everyone sees things differently so I just hope others find the humor and love between these two races. I am still a bit confused by some issues and hope a group discussion will clear that up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good characters undermined by weak \\"sacrificial lamb\\" plot","review":"A real crash-and-burn novel, the characters are great but the structure is loose. Just as I wondered why Nicolas Sparks ended Message in a Bottle on such a tragic note, I find myself asking Hayne the same question. I see her attempt at restoring those with tragic pasts, but the way in which she accomplishes this just could not happen in 1956. My willing suspension of disbelief could not sustain itself in the final chapters. She covered her tracks to make the loose ends tie together, but the characters were watered-down by then. Incorrect and vague references: \\"dentil\\" when referring to an architectural decoration is incorrectly spelled \\"dental.\\" At the end, I had to read a paragraph three times to understand what \\"her\\" means because of an improper antecedant. Once again, I love her characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother reading this book.....","review":"I really had a hard time reading this book...it was extremely pondorous, and pointless for so long, it was a real struggle to finish it. If I hadn't bought it in hardback, it would be fireplace fodder by now. This is the second Oprah book I have read -- and I really disliked the first one -- and swore I would not read another one. Well, I am renewing that vow --NEVER AGAIN! I think Ms. Winfrey has an extremely odd taste in books. If she wants people to read more, she should stop recommending these types of books!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BOOOOOORING!","review":"I never leave a book unfinished, but I finally threw this one down in disgust the other day.

Wish I'd read the reviews before I wasted my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mother of Pearl","review":"I tried to read this book. I've read other Oprah books and loved them. I felt this book was not worth my time. I put the book down and would try over again, but couldn't finish it. I stopped half through. There was no plot and it moved very slow. The characters didn't impress me. I felt it was a waste of my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, Boring, Boring","review":"I've liked all the other Oprah picks, but this one was the pits.

Im on to the next pick. I am dissapointed. I usually am very excited about a new books out with Oprah's approval. Go on to Tara's Road. I loved that one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rambling. Too many characters to follow! Disjointed.","review":"Oprah never selects books that flow easily and have less drama. Life is difficult, why do we have to read about it! The south needs a break! The author had to take it to the 50's since I felt she was living under a rock otherwise! Move on! Let's see some growth. A friend gave me the book on loan. I was glad I did not buy it! The author needs work! Very cumbersome. Had to keep a notepad handy to record all the characters.I was lost from chapter to chapter. All I can say, I am glad it is over. Not a book for entertainment. Too much work for this reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Alot of obscence language and hard to read","review":"Slow at first, hard to follow along. Surprise ending. Alot of swearing through out this book. Sometimes unsure of who the character is. Hard time following along with the plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time and money","review":"It's amazing when a few people say a book is good, everyone believes them. Mother of Pearl could be readable if some of its glaring flaws were addressed. The author says it's the fifties; but her so-called rural characters speak urban 90's. Her time line is not accurate, and the coarse writing jumps around too much for any kind of flow or plot, if indeed the book had a plot. Back to the keyboard!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This author needs to learn how to construct sentences!","review":"This has certainly been a unique read. I do not know where this author was educated but the writing is very poor. The story, which is one of hope and redempton, can at times hold thereader's interest, however, each sentence is a chore to get through. Not worth the struggle!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Leave it alone","review":"These Oprah books are getting worse with each successive selection. This one is offensively sub-par."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time and Energy","review":"Oprah's books usually don't catch my attention, but since this was a hardcover at two bucks, I figured it might help while away the time this summer. This book is a complete and total MESS. I can't decide which is the most annoying and distracting: the pseudo-dreamlike images, the incredibly stupid names Haynes gives her characters, the time-worn \\"who's the father?\\" plot device, the derivitive southern gothic elements... oh I could go on and on. Usually I like to give a book the benefit of the doubt and keep reading regardless. But why I kept on til the bitter end with this one is beyond me.This book was horrible on so many levels. At two bucks, I got robbed!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"PLOTLESS WONDER","review":"Reading this book seemed an excercize in futility. Although most of the Oprah books I've read have been decent this one seems to have no plot or purpose. I do believe the author has the potential to tell a good story if she would just find an interesting tale to tell. The characters in this book were sporadic and underdeveloped. Most of the time I had no clue as to what was going on, and I consider myself an avid reader. Maybe it's just me, but this book just didn't deliver. I wish her better luck on the next novel because I do believe she is a capable writer if only she could find the right story to tell."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Reader's Guide to Poor Writing...","review":"The reviewer who used the word \\"pretentious\\" summed this one up. This book is nothing if not a long, boring, poorly edited anecdote. We have here an unrealistic portrayal of the South, circa 1956 Mississippi. No characters are fully realized, and cheap symbolism is casually thrown about with little apparent link to anything. The repetition of the phrase \\"You say that true.\\", and the broad use of the term \\"hasn't got a clue\\" (remember, this is 1956 Mississippi) cause the reader to wonder what Martha Levin (the editor)does for a living. Author Haynes needs to pick up a copy of Strunk and White's \\"Elements of Style\\" (available here at Amazon) and get this clue: OMIT NEEDLESS WORDS. How I trudged through the pages of this book and completed it is beyond my understanding. Perhaps I could not believe that these words were actually published."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am totally confused","review":"I bought \\"Mother of Pearl\\" a couple of weeks ago, but only got around to starting it a few days ago. I normally like the books that Oprah chooses for her book club, so I was excited about this one. Well...I just couldn't get into it. I found it extremely confusing, I did not like the writing style. I kept reading, just to see if it would get any better, but it never did grip me. So I finally decided to give up on it, about 1/3 way through. I can only remember doing that with 2 other books."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't bother","review":"I am an Oprah book club aficionado. Love most of them, but once in a while she picks a clunker. This is one of them. I couldn't get into it, didn't enjoy the characters, nothing happened, and it was still confusing. I don't understand how it got such good reviews in the trades. It is impossible to wade through and, ultimately, not worth the effort. IMHO."},{"rating":"1","title":"The book was cumbersome, unrealistic, and full of loose ends","review":"I love to read but this one is going to make me take a break for a while. The characters names were very confusing...Even and Valuable...even Joleb. (how do you like that me using even as a proper noun and adjective in the same sentence) Not until the end of the book did I know whether to pronounce the \\"e\\" long or short in Joleb name. At any rate, please give us something where we don't have to work so hard for our entertainment next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"IS THERE A \\"NO STAR\\" OPTION","review":"I began reading, and got to about page 70 or so and was totally confused.

I would not recommend to anyone unless confusion is there \\"thing\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"hard to follow.","review":"Although it did not take me as long to read as some of the other readers, I often thought \\" Is this the same book that I started?\\" I love stories about the South, but this one was not one that I would recommend. My own book club has chosen it for our next discussion. I don't think it will be a very long one."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT WAS ALL OF THE FUSS ABOUT?","review":"When I first read some of the bad reviews, I wouldn't let myself believe the book could be so bad, especially since I have enjoyed most of the books from Oprah's club. Please ignore the hype, the book is as bad as others have alluded to. The ony reason I finished the book is because its my personal policy, I had to see at what point would it start to make sense. I'm still waiting."},{"rating":"1","title":"An interesting, though disjointed read!","review":"The book was slow moving and somewhat confusing. I had to reread several pages for clarification. The pages overflowed with strange, but interesting characters and their connections were not always clear.Was there symbolism in the dream about a walking, talking, slit pig? That still has me baffled. The end was a shocker, I would never have guessed it.All in all, the book was ok. Ms. Haynes did a good job blending the different southern cultures. A good book of 400 pages usually takes me one week, this one took over a month. This was my first read along with Oprah, I was determined to complete it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This was long winded and dissappointing","review":"I was very dissappointed in oprah this time. Usually her picks are great.This one was long winded, and difficult to follow.At times I skipped several pages as nothing was happening.The book vclearly did not hold my interest."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of my summer reading time!","review":"I found the characters in this story along with their names (Even) a problem. I had to go back and read pages to get a feeling for it! Oprah should have picked a better summer read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so hot for a summer book.","review":"I got 200 pages into this book and donated it to theL.A. County Library. Maybe someone else can finish it. I tried. Ireally did. But I have to say . . re: the Oprah books, I am still reeling from White Oleander. And living in the L.A. area, I am noticing, maybe for the first time, how we are swimming in Oleander bushes/trees (of all colors) and it is a beautiful sight right now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time or your money on this book.","review":"I will tell anyone that will listen not to buy this book! Further, I would suggest not to waste time reading this book when there are so many others that are more worthy of the time it takes to read a novel. The characters never fully \\"evolve\\" and, I found myself wondering the whole time how they would all eventually tie together. The book starts flat and ends the same way. In my opinion, the most amusing character (very small part) was the goat!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If I hadn't been stuck on a plane I wouldn't have read it.","review":"The characters were unreal and the details were untrue. Where on earth did Two Sun live before she dropped into this book? About the time I started liking Joleb, he ends up in the quarters turning on a faucet. I grew up in Mississippi, and if there was a faucet it didn't work after a flood. Research was lacking throughout."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many characters with trite names.","review":"Oh Oprah - where did you find this one? I am glad I borrowed this one from my public library - I would have lamented the waste of cash had I purchased it. Is Melinda a southerner? Did she live in the 50's? Where did she get such affected names for her characters -Valuable and Even? Toni Morrison (known for her \\"naming\\" of characters) she's not."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful reading experience, Melinda Haynes is remarkable","review":"I was thoroughly engrossed in the characters Melinda Haynes brought to my life. She not only is eloquent but manages to convey an earthiness and humananity to each of her characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgustingly difficult to decipher. Not worth your energy","review":"Melinda Haynes wrote an absolutely difficult book to immerse oneself. Characters have grossly unusual names, backgrounds and circumstances. Impossible to tough-out. As an educator, and an avid reader, I closed this miserable book at 300 pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasted time and cash!","review":"It sounds like it would be a good book, and might actually have been, if the author had stuck to any of the dozen or so storylines she started. Interesting ideas wither on the vine as Hayes jumps to something/someone new or more convinient in order to somehow justify one of the most insultingly implausible endings I've come across in quite a while. A total disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Simile Factory","review":"Like a typewriter stuck on one letter, this book is full of similes. As repetitive as a woodpecker working on an old oaken log, this book is full of similes. If you enjoy similes like a dog enjoys scratching his fleas, then you may find this book entertaining.Like a freshman English professor tired of reading excessive adjectives in assignments, I did not.I too stuck it through to the very end, wading through the tedious and verbose prose; probably more because I'm stubborn (and always finish my books) and not due to the fact that I was enjoying the read.The storyline, though sometimes confusing, was above average. It almost begs a sequel. But, like an imperfect movie that gets mediocre reviews, this book needs no continuation.As a fairly frequent reader, I've got one last question:How did this make Oprah's book club?!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It was okay.","review":"I too, found it difficult to read, but once I got three chapters into it, it seemed rather interesting. I thought it was an okay book and the only reason I read it was because of Oprah's book club. The best part of the book was the last 50 pages. Too bad, I had to waste all my time in between."},{"rating":"1","title":"mother of pearl","review":"although I never want to put any writters work down I just couldnt give this book a good review its to wordy the writer of this book describes this way to much and not enough action I wanted to read this book because Oprah gave it such a good review on her show but i just couldnt get into it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as expected","review":"The editor's review made this book sound interesting, but reading it was a chore I abandoned around page 70. The dialogue was difficult to understand as were the characters and all the jumping back and forth. I read for enjoyment not to rattle my brain asking myself, \\"What is that all about?\\" Sorry, Oprah, your recommendation didn't hit the mark for me this time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!","review":"I originally wanted to read this book because it was one of Oprah's book picks and a real favorite of Oprah's. However, after reading the first chapter of this book, I had to put it down. Just because Oprah recommends something, doesn't mean the rest of us are going to like it (although I have to say that this is one of the few Oprah Book Club picks that I didn't enjoy). I just could not get into this story. The names of the characters, the way they talked, and the plot of this story totally turned me off. I know I'm not the only one who feels this way, because I've talked to other people who also intensely disliked the book. It looks good, but once you open it up you'll be convinced otherwise. Don't blow your money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing at best","review":"I really wanted to like this book. When I first started reading, I was quickly drawn to the main character,Valuable. Other characters (Even, Joody) were interesting as well. But, I eventually found the author's prose overbearing to the point of exaustion. The basic story line was a great idea; I just feel as though the book would have been much better had it not been so frothy. I kept finding myself needing to put the book down because I couldn't stomach anymore fluff. In fact, had I not cared for Valuable's character as much as I did, I'd have quit reading this book altogether, without a second thought."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was an incredible disappointment","review":"As an avid reader and a fan of most of Oprah's Book Club selections, I have to admit that I was truly disappointed by Mother of Pearl. The characters really lacked definition and despite the various stages of turmoil each was facing in their lives, I didn't care about any of them or what happened to them. The story lines for each character seemed to go no where -- very slowly. Since the book was so long and drawn out and I didn't much care about any of the characters, I actually stopped reading the book with only about 100 pages left. I have never, ever not finished a book before, no matter how bad -- so that should give you an idea of how awful this one was. If you're looking for a good book along the lines of Oprah's usual picks, try Home is Where the Heart is by Billy Letts, Here on Earth by Alice Hoffman or Black and Blue by Anna Quindlen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bored, cliched, I hated it","review":"I'll be honest, I didn't finish this book. But that's because I was bored by the first page. Having grown up in the south, this was so full of tired cliches I could barely concentrate on the story. Beyond that, call me a prude, but there was way to much gratuitous discussion of nudity (especially in children) to the point that it was distracting and utterly pointless to the plot. The woman by the river was a ridiculous caricature... I mean, I just couldn't take that seriously. And it was depressing. If I want to be depressed, I'd prefer it not be in my free time reading made up stories. Ok, I could go on, but you get the point. So, yes, I hated it."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Author Who Writes Outside the Box","review":"This book was different than anything I've ever read. It was sometimes difficult to understand, but became clearer as you continued. The author has a wonderful style all her own - the fact that a white woman wrote this is astounding. The story has very interesting characters. I thought the \\"accidentally incestuous\\" relationship in the book would have some big climax, but it just faded away. The participants in that relationship never even found out they were related. That was surprising to me, and the book would have been more exciting if something had happened with that."},{"rating":"2","title":"GOOD FIRST NOVEL!","review":"I really liked this book, but found it difficult to get into at the beginning. It was quite confusing, but glad I continued to read it to the end....This novel is set in back country of Mississippi....The main characters are 18 yr old Valuable Korner and 28 yr old Evan Grade...These two characters are intertwined with many other great characters for a surprise ending which shows us a black man bringing up a white child...I don't think that would have happened in the deep south during the 1950's....However overall this was quite a powerful novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully written","review":"This is a vey well-written book. The words and imagry used by Haynes sets the mood and setting very well, and makes you feel like you were actually there, experiencing the story as the characters are experiencing it. It was very enjoyable to read as it was very realistic and had a very interesting plot. I recommend Mother of Pearl very highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"sad, but good","review":"I read this book, because the author is from the town where i attend college now, and a lot of the setting's took place in this town of Hattiesburg. I learned a lot about the town by readin this book. I must say that this was a good book, although i was shocked about some of the things that went on, such as what happened with valuable and jackson. It was sad what happened to valuable, i wasen't expecting that at all. I felt for all the characthers in the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Feel like I wasted my time.","review":"I should have given up on this book early on but I stubbornly stuck with it. The story did get a little better...but I still feel as though I wasted my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst oprah book club selection ever...","review":"I read over 150 pages of this book and it was a struggle all the way. I was thoroughly disappointed with this selection. Impossible to make sense of the characters, the story was boring...and I never finished it.. I figure that reading is suppose to be a pleasurable experience. As I look at the other reviews I can see I am not alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't bother!","review":"i have read most of the oprah picks, and this one is one of the worst. the writing was impossibly wordy,the characters are loosely defined,and i could not follow a plot. i have been a practicing english teacher for 20 years with a master's degree in secondary reading,so i am not a stranger to recognizing quality literature. i loved white oleander and both of wally lamb's books. i hope the next book is better."},{"rating":"1","title":"The story line was heading somewhere but.......","review":"I really tried to like this book. It started off as an intersting story although it was very wordy and hard to follow. The number one problem with this book is that the author leads you to think you are heading to a climax but then bypasses the climax in just about every instance,leaving the reader to find out what happens through the conversations of the other characters. There are too many characters without any character development I saw many influences of other novels such as Flowers in the Attic and Boys Life, but without the story telling ability of those respective authors. This book made me feel like I wasted my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I could pick ZERO stars....","review":"This was the worst Oprah book that I have read! I don't get all the people who gave the book such high marks and were so entranced by it. I am an avid reader, and I always finish any book that I buy, but this book really tested my resolve. I wanted to throw the book in the trash every other chapter. The characters were just okay, and the \\"lyrical prose\\" was tedious and boring. I would never recommend this book to anyone, and I am in complete disbelief that it will be made into a movie. But then again, a screenplay that generously cuts out the wordy nonsense could be a big improvement on the novel. My advice...Wait For The Movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mother of Pearl","review":"AAURRGHH! Will this TEDIOUS story ever end! I have put this book down twice vowing never to pick it up again - and I rarely give up on a book... The author uses far too many rambling metaphors. The story gets completely lost in non-essential information."},{"rating":"1","title":"A chore to read","review":"This was a difficult and sometimes confusing book to read. Nothing really grabbed me and made me want to keep reading. I forced myself to finish the book and was surprised when I discovered the story was better than I thought it would be. I'm not sure I would recommend it to others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oprah's usual historical race pick, dark and uninspiring","review":"To be honest, after reading the first 100 pages I skimmed through the rest to get a feel of the story. Sometimes I wonder why Oprah picks (and recommends) these dark novels, that leave you more depressed then thoughtful. I really wouldn't recommend the book to many, unless depressing story lines really enthrall them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Story refutes Darwn - and doesn't help Creationists, either","review":"Nothing I like better than a complicated story with complex characters that demonstrate some kind of evolution. This was decidedly not one of those stories. Mother of Pearl began with a certain promise. Then suddenly, all of the characters started sounding alike, behaving alike, thinking alike and the story melted into a forced and painfully strained ending. In short, the entire novel DEVOLVED. There was no epiphany, no great moral lesson, not a jot of wisdom. Most of the characters ended up thinking with their genitals rather than their brains. Even Joody Two Sun, who seemed to have the most promise, fades to mediocrity. A very bad soap opera of a novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Book, Somewhat Flawed","review":"I think what makes this book so interesting is the author's acute attention to the inner feelings these characters experience. Sometimes preachy, always commanding, the novel starts off as a confusing enigma and tries its best to unravel itself for the reader. Unfortunately, that only happens sometimes, and in the middleof the book, leaving the beginning and the end on oppositesides of the crossroads. This is a good book, a VERY good book and worthy of all the attention it is recieving. Mrs. Haynes has madea grand effort to glue such complex and various storylines together, but in the end her language gets in the way. This book is far too clunky and leaden to thoroughly entertain; in the end the meaning is there, but difficult to grab from all the pretentious monologue. Perhaps I'll feeldifferent after a second reading. Somewhat highly reccomended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Basically boring and hard to follow.","review":"I have read most of the \\"Oprah\\" books and I must say, \\"What was she thinking?\\" when she added this one. This book has no continuity, is difficult to follow, has little-to-no character development and is, essentially, boring and uninspiring. What an incredible waste of time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time...","review":"Don't waste your time. The story is slow in starting and riddled with trite character names and a wandering story line. It starts to go interesting places then turns around and heads in another direction. The author should thank Oprah. It's the only way anyone would ever bother to read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Now I know why I don't like fiction.","review":"This was my first attempt at reading a Oprah book club selection...I thought I was going to go somewhere in this book but it only made me go around in circles...I wouldn't of purchased it in the first place if I had noticed that the brother was name \\"Even\\" cause a brother will never \\"break even\\" in a book with a white girl named, what else...\\"Valuable\\"...come on...its time for Black folks to tell our own \\"fiction\\" in creatively plain words that we can comprehend, understand and really \\"feel our spirit\\" ...now I know why Oprah is so rich...girlfriend is getting PAID to promote this pseudo-intellectual nonsense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time and Money!","review":"I have read many of Oprah's book club selections. I loved some, and tollerated others. But The Mother of Pearl is unbearable! The language is difficult, and insulting! The characters you should love, you can't understand. The story line shiftes too frequently to comprehend. AND WHAT IS IT ABOUT THE PIGS?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Good Read","review":"Who said reading should be easy? If you want easy go and turn on the television. Sometimes books just don't dish everything up for you on a plate. That is one of the joys of books. Mother Of Pearl is one of those books and one of those books that does it well. A strange storyline, stranger characters and an ending that is flawed but satisfying, Mother Of Pearl shows what an imagination can hold. There are times when the text seems disjointed and perhaps they need to fix up the typos before it is reprinted but besides that Mother Of Pearl is a ripper of a book. A book that challeneges and in doing so evokes wonderful images. A book that sweeps you along much like the creek that soon becomes a river. A book written by an author that is brave in the way she develops her characters and in the way she ends their separate stories. Don't not read it because others say it is bad, give it a go i think some will regret it if they don't."},{"rating":"2","title":"A spellbinding story.....","review":"Absolutely one of the best books I remember reading in a long time. An unbelievable accomplishment for a first novel. I will be waiting impatiently for another book by Melinda Haynes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of Oprah's better picks!!","review":"I guess everyone deserves a chance to tell their story. This book was extremely confusing. It took more time to reread pages and reread pages over and over again. With this book being a summer read, it probably made summer boring for some. There were many instances when I struggled with throwing the book to the side, under the bed, even in the trash. It was almost like I needed an interpreter to help me understand what I was reading. Better luck next time Ms. Haynes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Complicated","review":"I'm sorry I wasted my time and money on this one. Too wordy and very difficult to follow. I had to read and reread severals different times just to try and sort everyone out. I could not even finish the book. Maybe next time Oprah."},{"rating":"1","title":"All the\\"greatest hits\\" of Southern lit but misses the mark.","review":"There is a nagging lack of reality in Haynes characters. I feel as though I have been run through a \\"greatest hits\\" of Southern literature and modern conflict. The setting and characters were not l950's because they were contrived to suit the topics of Y2000 and enjoyed our hind sight. Why must we suffer through endless metaphors in modern fiction? Before she writes again, she should study. Before Oprah recommends a book, she should have her heart in her. It was obvious to me that it wasn't. Lucky for the author perhaps, but not for the reader. If there was a chance to give no stars, I would."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't even get through the first 20 pages","review":"I usally enjoy all of Oprahs choices but this one is very disappointing.

Took forever to get through."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hope you have a lot of time for this one","review":"It will take you forever to get through this novel.Getting through the first 300 pages is like trying to walk through quicksand. The final 100 pages has a riveting storyline. But why did it take the author so long to get everything to come together?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty disappointing. Falls apart quickly.","review":"I love to read and this book started out with high hopes and fascinating characters. So promising! And Oprah said, \\"Stay with it until after the flood!\\" so as I was enjoying the book up to the flood, I thought \\"Wow--if this is the low part of the book, I am really going to enjoy it!\\" But then the story just fell apart. The characters never developed and seemed to just be filling the remainder of the pages with ramblings; their personalities drifting into nothingness. I usually will re-read a book a few months later--this one I have already given away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book which takes concentration to read.","review":"I enjoyed this book very much. I found that once I began to read it I had a hard time putting it down. It is however, not for someone who likes light uncomplicated books which require few thinking skills. Due to the way that the book is written, with a great deal of descriptive language you have to think as you read and get used to the author's style of narration. It is a challenge but a rewarding one which you will feel glad that you undertook when you are finished. The book is unlike any that I have read in a long time and I enjoyed reading something a little deeper than my usual Maeve Binchy, Rosamunde Pilcher fare but I also was glad that I had read reviews by other readers which told me to persevere with the book and not give up too easily."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful!","review":"I am shocked by some of the bad reviews this book received. I thought it was outstanding. It is beautifully written. The characters are diverse, magical and thoughtfully crafted. I loved this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh! Just not worth it.","review":"This book was to say the least, a big challenge to read. I read it, and reread it. I have read most of Oprah's picks, but this one I would have opted not to buy, had I known the confusion it would cause in my mind. (A lot of back tracking was done and that didn't seem to help! Anyone out there understand the pig?) This book is one that will retire at a used book store somewhere. I would not recommend it unless you have a lot of time to study and attempt to figure the sorted mess out. Even watching the Oprah show on the book club discussion did not help me to understand. Get past the flood, Oprah said, and then it is smooth sailing and things will come into place. Not for this reader! I just am amazed that it was published."},{"rating":"1","title":"Haynes Should Go Back to Painting","review":"This has to be one of the worst books to have ever made it on a bestseller list. From this point on I will steer clear of Oprah's BookClub selections. I really should have taken the advise of other reviewer's of this website and not attempted to read this mess. Even with re-reading sections, the book made no sense. When I was at 300 pages I continued to consider tossing it in the trash, which would have been a first since I never quit a book. But now I wish I went with my initial feelings and tossed it out. The characters were not interesting and by the end I could care less what happened to any one of them. Do yourself a favor and don't waste your time. Oprah should get out of the book business and Haynes should return to her first career of painting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very hard to follow","review":"The language in this book is very hard to wade through and the story seems to skip around quite a bit. Overall, it's a confusing read. I have read several books in the Oprah book club, but this by far is the hardest one to get through. If you like complex, winding stories, this might be the book for you. On the other hand, if you like quick, light reads that don't require much thought, skip ahead or better yet, you might just want to skip the Oprah books altogether!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible read","review":"I did something I NEVER do when reading a book. I PUT IT DOWN, and I refused to finish it. It was a tedious story with far too many characters that the author could not sucessfully tie togerther. Not only did I find the writing to be unbearable, it was also full of the worst kind of human suffering. I gave it one star because I had to give it something, and after reading a few of Oprah's picks I have come to the conclusion that they are all the same. They are stories of horrible human suffering, unrealistic circumstances, and just plain horrible reads. I enjoy a good read as much as any avid reader but I cannot comprehend what pleasure anyone could find in this book. So I guess I will chalk this purchase up to poor judgment and toss it in the trash. Sorry, I won't be reading any works by Ms. Haynes and no more Oprah picks for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"EXHAUSTING!","review":"While this book had its lyrical moments, it was an extremely trying read. I can say that it is just good enough to want to finish but there are entire chapters that I hummed through; not necessarily remembering what I had read. In other words, I just desperately wanted to finish and move on to a better novel. I'm not sure that Haynes did the best job at developing some of her characters (such as Canaan and Jackson). It seems there are a lot of unanswered questions about each one concerning what makes them tick.I think the author has talent, but am hoping for a more brilliant attempt next time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"I've been reading the reviews from some other people about this book and am not surprised that some might not enjoy it. But I am writing this before I've even finished reading it; I feel that strongly that this is a wonderful book regardless of whatever the outcome. To be honest, I'm not a big fan of Oprah's book club just because her picks tend to be so full of angst, depression and abuse. Not to say that this one doesn't have those elements in it but, wow, I've been so enthralled I have a hard time getting anything other than reading done. It is not a quick read but in my opinion it's WELL worth the effort. I almost died laughing at the part Joody gives Even his \\"gift\\". I really feel that those who thought the situations were impossible or that it was boring are really missing the point. I think Ms. Haynes has nailed racial tensions and feelings. I say she has done a fabulous job and would definitely recommend this book to any discerning reader. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Argh, I'm only at chapter seven","review":"Oh Oprah, I guess you cannot win them all. I am glad that some others agrees with my opinion on this book. I found it too wordy and difficult to follow at times due to an over abundance of characters. Even was a ridiculous name to choose for a main character as his name is often confused with adjective \\"even\\" in several sentences. Well, I'll continue to slog through this one, but it's not a novel I can't put down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good, but very complicated","review":"It was a good story with a good plot and I enjoyed how it all binded together at the end, but it was very hard to understand and I found myself reading lines over and over to make since of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"the worst book I've read this year","review":"I'm sorry I wasted the money. The characters start shallow and are never developed. It should have been good, but this author doesn't have the ability to make readers believe her story is real. I felt constantly as if I was being fed baloney. Oprah is wrong on this one. Big time."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of pleasure reading time! The worst!","review":"Oprah's choice here of \\"Mother of Pearl\\" almost puts me back to not wanting to follow her recommendations. The character's name Even throws the reader off when the author uses the word as a proper noun and an adjective in the same paragraph. The story tended to be choppy, discontected and often times confusing. And the story itself is begining to get long in the tooth. Sorry, but there are better summer readings out there to enjoy rather than suffer through this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Either you love it or hate it, y'all","review":"Plunk me right down in the hated it, do I only have 2 thumbs-to-vote-this-drivle-down-catagory? An overwritten, over hyped piece of southern fried fiction. E-gad Oprah, what were you thinking to elevate this particular book into the mainstream? Sorry, love you, but this particular work was not ready for publication...and not worthy of your endorcement. Somebody hand me my blue edit pencil...........!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult read","review":"This felt like a reading assignment for a college literature class.

How did this book become Oprah's book club??"},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs a little more polish or a lot less editing","review":"Usually I can whip through an average size novel in two or three days. I found that I had to keep back tracking to find a connection between one thing and another and there were few connections.

I just hope that things pick up."},{"rating":"1","title":"a mishmash of themes with no central purpose.","review":"Because it was an oprah selection I looked forward to reading it. Even when I'd gotten through 2/3 of the book I didn't give up because I was sure it would make sense eventually. well it didn't. I understand the concept of people of different colors becoming caring of one another and I have no argument with that. It could have been done in a way that would have been meaningful instead of confusing and at times a mishmash of ideas, themes, circumstances, as though the author recalled every event she could conjur up and put them together in the pages of one book. The matter of the pigs was completely beyond my comphrehension and I believe anybody else's who read it.Come on Oprah, give us something better next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good example of pretentious literature","review":"This book is one of the worst that I've read! It took me weeks to get through this book (compared to 2-3 days for most books). There is no unifying plot, and the writing is atrocious - the similes and metaphors seem contrived to be original, but convey no meaning. The symbolism too obscure for most readers to understand (e.g. the split pig). Many paragraphs seemed thrown in for no reason. In my opinion, the only part of the book that was interesting was the portrait of the shy, budding relationship between Valuable and Jackson. The book should have ended there. Until the end, it was hard to stay interested in the book, because it was hard to see why there was any point in describing these characters. The character descriptions were not bad, but this book had neither moving plot nor enjoyable prose, and a good book has to have at least one of these to be worthwhile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"Although I read most of the books Oprah has recommened this was the worse of the bunch. The story was slow, too many characters that you cared nothing about. It took me 3 months to read, when I can usually finish a book in a few days. I had to finish it because I usually finish what I start. also I thought the end might make the whole book worthwhile. I was very wrong. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good, but not that good","review":"This book was good, but not as good as the hype has made it out to be. Haynes was very conceited on Oprah and that diminished her and her book in my eyes. The book was very hard to read, but after page 125 it really gets going. If you can stay with it until there good luck, it took me three months. I usually read a book every two to three days. If you are pressed for time to read, read another book because this one is not worth the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard on the eyes? Try your ears instead!","review":"The mannerism of Nana Visitor's reading style on the audio version of this book literally breathes life into these wonderfully, diverse characters. Her intelligent technique of knowing when to ebb and when to flow, and her flawless presentation of each character's personality and \\"voice\\", gives well-earned justice to Ms. Haynes unique writing style.Admittedly, even on audio, there were parts of the first chapter that were so full of metaphor and prose that it took a while to find the rythmic niche... but only momentarily. The story was so intriguing, and Nana so adept in her presentation, that I began to marvel not only at its unfolding tale, but at the way it was read. The story of the relationships between these wonderful, interesting characters... full of diversity, twists, and insight, is one I'll not soon forget."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious","review":"Terribly written--it reads like a soap opera. I would never have finished it if it weren't an assignment for a book club. It was pure tedium to get through it and reads like it's written by a high-school kid. I didn't care about any of the characters and could hardly remember who they were."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't live up to the hype...","review":"After seeing this book on the bestsellers list and being on Oprah's book club I decided to purchase this book and see for myself. It took me longer than usual to read this book and I must say it takes a lot of patients to finish this book. I did enjoy the development of the characters and was most interested in the story of Jackson and Valuable. However, it was tiring about midway through the book and the first chapter made it hard to get interested. The writing style I often found unnecessary and didn't really have much affect on the story. Overall I glad I read the book but wouldn't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't get through it","review":"Alright, this book sounded awesome from the back blurb - and I REALLY tried to get through it, but after reading through almost half way, I couldn't find any developing story line, and no interest at all in the characters!I am a pretty picky book reader, but this has to fall amoung one of my worst.I'll be the first to admit I didn't finish the book - so there may be something I'm missing.

I'm an avid reader; in fact, I'm an attorney whose practice is 90% research, but I can't wade through this tome!

I was not expecting great sound from it but, among other things, but this unit was lacking an acceptable sound quality. The unit claims to have a bass feature to improve the \\"deeper\\" sound, however, you can hardly notice the difference when this feature is engaged. In addition, the MP3 CD's were not always recognized or the unit refused to play MP3's alltogether. Only after totally turning it off would it \\"reset\\" itself and play.Another problem with this boombox is that it takes a few seconds to recognize that CD or MP3 CD is inserted. This is more annoying than a bad function, however.I would not recommend this unit to anyone who is looking for a good quality sound. For its price, however, the unit could be a good value for an entry level system for somebody willing to sacrifice sound for the ability to play MP3's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even worth the time it took to return","review":"I bought this particular item for it's capability to play MP3 discs, it being the first box I have found in a store with that capability. Boy, what a disappointment.The first box I bought home would play about 10 songs on a home recorded MP3 CD-R (ironically enough, a memorex cd-r) then it would stop tracking altogether. When the box was shut off and examined, I found that the CD was actually hot enough to be painful to touch from being played. This is not right.I returned the item, and exchanged it for a new one. This one would not even recognize that a CD had been placed in the player, and would constantly demand that the door be shut. Enough is enough, I'm buying another brand in the future, and recommend that others do so as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Consider something else","review":"I purchased this unit in Dec. 2001 for it's ability to play MP3 files.

I have not had the courtesy of a response to date (11/10/02). Based on Memorex's lack of response I will never purchase another Memorex product again.

I saw the MP3 capability as a way to tie into my regular stereo equipment so that I could leave a single CD in for a party and walk away. Obviously you need some sort of output jack for that.I tried to figure out from the online info whether or not this had such a jack, and finally decided that nobody would be dumb enough to make a boombox at this price point without a headphone jack.

His favorite part of the movie is Frank chasing McQueen and Mater. This game is it!The pieces are small but more detailed than I expected. Frank in particular is ok. The game itself is again better than I expected (I had very low expectations). You move around the board, tipping (collecting) tractors along the way. You roll a dice to see how far to go, one side of the dice causes Frank to wake up, move to another spot. And he'll chase you back to the start if you're in the way.My 3yr old loves it. The there are numbers on the bottom of the tractors that you're supposed to add up.

This story brings us no closer to Alvin learning how to teach others to use their gifts or to build The Crystal City. Much of the book is spent on Alvin stubbornly refusing to defend himself in a protracted jailhouse scene, then a courtroom trial - not in plot or character development. Alvin, an everyman character who started out so likeable, is downright annoying in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Printing Flaws","review":"I enjoyed the book itself, but the physical copy had printing flaws... the ink on several pages was too faint to read.

As I read this series as a whole, I am staring to notice that the individual stories form each book (The war in Red Prophet, the story of Arthur Stuart in Prentice Alvin, and the trial in this book) and the new characters that keep coming along, are starting to overshadow the overall story of Alvin's quest to build the Crystal City.This book started a little slowly, so I thought it might not have been as interesting as the previous books in the series, as often happens once you get this deep into a series. But with the introduction of Verily Cooper and Alvin's trial, the book really picks up the pace. I look forward to re-reading the next book (Heartfire) followed by the The Crystal City, which will hopefully conclude the series.If you've enjoyed the other books in this series, you probably won't be disappointed by this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS is supposed to be the ending?!?!","review":"I loved the first three books in this series, but, how can I put this nicely? This one stinks. This series built up alot of momentum, and I don't mind when the author leaves something to the imagination. But I DO mind when the author leaves the entire ending to the imagination! It was well written, but that's besides the point. Things they talk about through all the books are never resolved. I don't think there's any excuse for this book, except maybe he was having an off day, or a few chapters were lost."},{"rating":"1","title":"Alvin Journeyman is one book too many","review":"Just like a great lawyer may lose an otherwise flawless case by asking one too many questions, or a great boxer may lose his place in history by fighting one too many fights, so too can a great writer ruin a great series by writing one too many books. The first three books in this series weaved a simple yet eloquently told fairytale compelling too all ages. The series should have ended there. Card bowed to the wishes of some of his fans or more likely to the pocketbook of his publisher when he wrote Alvin Journeyman. While I still consider the first three books in the series to be among the greatest science fiction I've ever read, this latest effort is childish and forced. Even that would not be so bad if it were'nt associated with a great body of work. I only completed Alvin Journeyman because of my respect for Card, but I won't be reading any more books in this series.

The problem is, and it's true of the rest of this series and of the Wiggin books subsequent to Ender's Game, is that the main character is just boring. I found that the 'goodies' were just sooo good and the 'bad guys' just so bad that I really had no sympathy for any of them. In fact, by the time I had read about two thirds of my way through I only kept reading out of a sense of obligation, not because there was any real interest in seeing it through. The only thing I really enjoyed was speculating about whether there were really homosexual overtones in the feelings of the lawyer (I can't even remember his name) toward Alvin.

All beaded covers of course will give you more air and less sweat, thats a given. I already had worn out a cheap cover and needed something better. The high back feels a little different but doesn't take long to get used to. Yes, you need to buy a $10 package of little bungee cord to fit your seat like everyone says.Is it a big problem? No, grow up a little, nothing fits everything. HERES THE BIGGEST DRAWBACK... the bottom of the cushion is not wide enough. I have a 32\\" waist. You can't spread your legs without being half off the cushion. They must have used a child seat seat fot their pics. DO yourself a favor and try to find width measurements before you buy. The quality is no different. Spend the extra $5 for the other one if you see it's larger and you'll be happier.

I have white seats and the beads with the dye on them stained the seats. Second you will become and expert in tying this thing to the seat over and over.

Although the seat portion is almost wide enough for me, the overall length is sorely lacking. The five pound test fishing line holding it together really says ZERO about the quality.

We were preparing for a 1,200 mile trip recently and this was a desperate attempt to make the drive tolerable. All NYC taxi drivers use some version of this, but I couldn't buy it on the street corner. To make a long story short, the cushion worked as advertised. Two days of 12 hour driving was far more tolerable with the cushion.If you want to get this, buy it before your long trip and plan to use bungee cords to make it stay in place. Otherwise, you'll end up giving this thing very low ratings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Again, no where to attach it.","review":"Well, against my better judgment, I bought this thinking that the other people that weren't able to attach it just weren't mechanically inclined or good problem solvers. Bad move. The thing seems pretty well built and the beads are nice, but this thing just doesn't appear to have been made for the seat in a vehicle (what exactly it was made for, I'm not sure). It isn't even the correct shape for a car's bucket seat. You can stuff the thin part between your headrest, but it is wider than the pins so you gotta stuff it in there.

It was described as the French Taxi Driver Seat Cover. We enjoyed them and decided to replace them after they wore out. The picture of this product appeared to offer the same item as did the description. Upon arrival the item was visually and physically different from our earlier product. The coverage area was drastically reduced and the beads were smaller and finished at a much reduced quality. The head and neck portion in the image looks smaller then the other area but in reality it is the larger portion. So end effect was we got less product for more money.If someone had not enjoyed the REAL thing before they would not know the difference and would probably find it marginally useable and enjoyable....thus the 2* rating. Otherwise I would have rated it 1*."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty to look at ... but non-functional.","review":"The manufacturer put far more effort in the two outlining rows of dark brown beads than they put into the application of this product. My boyfriend had seat beads years ago, and apparently they eventually fell apart. I surprised him with these for Christmas. He put them on his seat immediately, but he never \\"tied\\" it on as the dinky strings they provided were only about 3\\" long. In addition, not even dinky strings were provided to attach the skinny portion to the seat. Therefore, every time he got out of the car it fell down. Subsequently, it ended up thrown into the back of his SUV, no doubt in disgust and frustration! And there they remain.

The style of this book is totally different from the usual Huxley method. I've never read anything else by Christopher Isherwood. This book starts out boring, and ends boring. That's really the sum of it. The characters are flat and extremely simple. In his early work (say, pre \\"Brave New World\\"), Huxley's characters are an embodiment of one single trait. However, they are always developed well, and their thought processes are complex while remaining within this one trait. This book has the same characterization - Jacob, for example, is moronically kind and simple (think Forrest Gump). There are also the classic evil tricksters, and so on.

Where's 2nd Chapter of Acts, Keith Green, Sandi Patti, The Winans, Twila Paris, Bryan Duncan, or any of the true pioneers of contemporary Christian music?

If you, like me, own all of the Wow cd's, think of this cd like a greatest hits package from an artist that you own all of the albums for - it gives you 2 discs for all of the best music.

If you've ever seen the classic Franco Zeffirelli Metropolitan Opera production which was just revived and given a \\"make over\\" last year, you would see why no other director or scenic designer need apply. Zeffirelli's take on this opera is definitive. Now if only we could get the Met to committ it to video.They only thing the Theatre Toyal de la Monnaire de Brusselles has going for it is a first class Falstaff in Jose Van Dam.

And 3 hours later, I was still trying Puzzle mode! Seriously, these little puzzles with the professor guy trying to get to the bottom of the screen ROCK. You start with really easy puzzles (of course) that only take a few seconds/moves to clear. Then the real fun begins. This game will turn your brain inside out.

The songs are good, but the album doesn't stand on its own like it could/should have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not GOod","review":"Only two songs i like, \\"Lay Me Down and leave the pieces. they are backwoods girls. not fit for singing."},{"rating":"2","title":"New style for Michele.","review":"The more my wife and i lisen to this one the better we like it. It is a new country twist for Michele."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Country-Pop. Easy on the ears (much like Dixie Chicks)","review":"This album is very pleasent to listen too. It has some great tunes you can sing along too (Leave the Peices, and others), and some hilarious lyrics (Crazy People). I would highly recommend it. Overall, it has the kind of country pop vibe you get from the Dixie Chicks. Very enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stand Still, Look Pretty","review":"I liked the Wreckers first attempt at an album. Some of the songs were interesting, but all in all it was a pretty good CD. I do wish they had not broken up so we could have seen what they would have progressed into. Who knows what life will bring for them and us (their fans)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Michelle and Jessica are awesome!","review":"Michelle Branch has produced another excellent album. I'm not usually a fan of country music, but I really enjoy this album. I love how it incorporates Michelle's pop/rock influence along with Jessica's country influence. Their voices sound amazing together which provides beautiful harmony. The Wreckers rock!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing special but could have been","review":"Having heard these young ladies on the radio and finding their harmonies reminiscent of The Kinleys, Dixie Chicks and SheDaisy, I bought the CD with nothing else to recommend it. It's a disappointment on a couple of levels.They have nice voices. Not great voices but nice, pleasant voices and they harmonize well. Not having a great voice can still work okay if there is something to say. On this recording, the material is weak. Very, very weak. Not one song is really interesting or stands out in the vast quagmire of today's country-pop radio playlist. Every song is immaculately produced to sound like everything else deemed worthy of radio airplay.This recording never rises above the level of mediocrity. On that level, it would rank three stars. However, there is obviously some talent here that needs someone or something to kickstart it. That is what is really disappointing and, because it could have been a better recording, I can only give it two-stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Collaboration","review":"Great production, back up musicians definetly pros. Their singing is good (both) so is every musical composition. Michelle has the higher pitch and some song are basically rock while some have a nice country flavor. Very enjoyable album. You'll enjoy every penny spent. You'll get your kick distinguishing between who sings what song, if you do not look at who composed each song. Though being young girls, their music is very matured."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty","review":"Love love love The Wreckers, wish they would get back together and produce another album! These girls have the harmony, pitch and sentiment down perfect."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was so excited and then disappointed....","review":"The first song off of this CD 'leave the pieces when you go' was so awesome that I ran out to buy this CD when it was released. I have to admit that I was a little disappointed. It was really the only good song on it. I loved Michelle Branch and her lyrics were always so touching and true; so well written. The other lyrics on this album are just not up to her standards. If you are the type of person who can listen to music without ever knowing the words to the song, then you will probably love this album. The music itself is pretty good. I just wish a couple of the songs were not on here...#12 Crazy People, esp. This song was horrible!! I'm glad it was almost the last song or I probably wouldn't have listened to the rest of the album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not A Good Country CD","review":"I don't get why pop singers like to randomly make country albums. They aren't usually any good, and this one doesn't change that perception. It doesn't even sound like country accept for about 3 songs. I just thought all the songs sounded similar and like filler. \\"leave the Pieces\\" is the only good one and that is a pop song more than anything. A fiddle thrown in doesn't necessarily morph any song into country."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome music!!!!","review":"This is the best cd of the year. The talent on this cd is unbelievable. Michelle and Jessica's writing has never been better! Their harmonies are so good that sometimes you can hardly tell them apart. Every song makes you want to listen more and more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing...","review":"I love Michelle Branch, I have her debut album (great album, wonderfully done), and her 2nd album (beautiful/gorgeous album, even better then the firsy) so I had some pretty high expectations for this album.It's not necessarily that this album is bad, but it's just nowhere near up to par with Michelle's earlier material. The only saving graces on this album are \\"Tennessee\\" and \\"Lay Me Down\\" (\\"Lay Me Down\\" is an especially beautiful song, if anything, this album is worth it for this song alone). These two tracks are up to par with Michelle's normal standards, which is simply writing a wonderful tune.Michelle is better on her own. Maybe her partner in crime for this group is the faulty part to this album. Whatever it may be, I'm waiting for the next Michelle album."},{"rating":"1","title":"A rather sad dissapointment","review":"I heard the song \\"Leave the Pieces\\" on the radio this morning, so I bought the CD since I liked the song. Other than that one song, I am very dissapointed in the very poor singing abilities of the two singers: their voices are infantile and immature, and the song material is insipid and puerile. This CD will appeal to thirteen-year-old girls, but I doubt an adult will find it worth the cost. A few of the songs are so bad that one might be compelled to believe they were made that way on purpose, as a parody of what can only be call reaking garbage.This is not Country music, which was another dissapointment. At best it can be called \\"pop.\\"I very much recomend that people listen to the CD before they pay for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Michelle Should Go Solo Again","review":"This album is horrible. I am a huge Michelle Branch fan, and to see her waste her talent on a country album like this is disappointing. Michelle Branch and Jessica Harper sound a lot better on their own, but together, they limit each other's lyrical potential. I hope to see a solo album from Michelle soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great cd!","review":"I bought this CD when it came out a few months ago. I was really curious about how it would sound. I was a fan of Michelle Branch before, but didn't know much about Jessica Harp. Together they make some great music! Their voices are very similar, so it makes for great harmonies. The music isn't far from Branch's solo work, but it has a country distinction which is nice. The songs are really emotional and to the point. There isn't one bad song in the bunch! Highlights include \\"Leave The Pieces\\", \\"Rain\\", \\"Lay Me Down\\", \\"Hard To Love You\\", \\"Way Back Home\\", \\"The Good Kind\\" and more. Overall, I have to say at first I wasn't bowled over with this cd, but through repeated listens it has become one of my favorites from 2006!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wreckers do well on their first release","review":"Took some time for this album to get released locally here in the Philippines, but when it did, it was worth the wait. The pop/country tunes of the Wreckers' first album are so enjoyable and easy to listen to. The songwriting is also good...the songs and the artists don't try too hard to please you...they're just what they are, good music. Leave the Pieces pretty much sets the tone for the whole album, and on your first listen, you can easily tell why it became a huge hit in country radio. Some of my favorites are The Good Kind, My Oh My, and Rain. Buy the album, it's good!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Change for Branch","review":"I've had this recording for a couple of weeks and have listened to it a few times. Yet, I find it grows on me as I listen more. I can recommend it, perhaps not as something one would sit and listen to critically, but as good music for relaxing or when you want something in the background.The girls' voices blend well and the production is excellent. The material is good; not great, but still very good.I think this was a good move for Michelle Branch. She's expanded her material and changed musical direction, but this is a good thing. She's maturing as a musician and writer and I look forward to her next offering.It would be well worth the effort to see her live as well. This recording is recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"After buying both, here's the difference.","review":"What do you get in the Limited Edition? Cardboard sleeve that houses the jewel case. The booklet inside has more pictures and pages of the girls, but is in a matte, not glossy finish. The DVD is cute, you get to see Michelle's baby. The extra track is fine, but I prefer the CD ending with 'Crazy people.' The artwork on the CDs is identical with the exception of the listing of the bonus track. And you learn on the DVD that their name comes from them originally calling themsleves the \\"Cass County Homewreckers.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Something we really needed...","review":"The Wreckers and this album in particular is something we really needed in music. Something thats its own sound and with such amazing vocals. Real tangible talent. These two gals can count on me to be a loyal fan if they keep dishin git up like this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally.","review":"Well I am a few days late getting the album, but I picked it up a few days ago... and I forced myself to listen to it because I didn't like what I heard at first, but I knew it would grow on me. And it didn't take long.... I LOVE IT. Fave song on the album for me is \\"Cigarettes.\\" Perfect for any Michelle fan.. and country fan!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wreckers is a WRECK","review":"Okay, I will say firstly that I do like Michelle Branch, but I have no idea who the other lady is. Since I am not an afficionado of either \\"old\\" or \\"new\\" country music, I think that is forgiveable. However be that as it may, I ask you simply this, \\"Where the hell are the prouction values?\\" This CD sounds like it was made in someone's garage or basement, with the most rudimentary tools possible. Was this some sort of afterthought on some engineer's part, or was there any thought at all put into this? The bass drowns out the rest of the music, and the girls seem like they're singing in a closet somewhere. What might have been a really good CD winds up being mediocre at best, due to this travesty of poor workmanship."},{"rating":"2","title":"Canon PSC-55 Leather Camera Case with Strap","review":"This is the second PSC-55 camera case I have owned - the first one fell out of my back pocket as I was shooting some awesome backcountry photos at the edge of a canyon in a wilderness area.

After hearing about this release I was excited, but skeptical. Sure, I've been a Jesse Malin fan since I saw D Generation open for the Ramones in 1995. But I didn't think he was capable of this kind of album. He hooked up with Ryan Adams, who produced and played guitar and keyboards on this album. The results are magnificent. This album is awesome. Kind of reminds me of an early Springsteen record, or the best of Ryan Adams material. You can still tell it's the same guy who wrote the songs in D Generation, but I think he's better now, and I loved his punk material."},{"rating":"1","title":"Go Back To Owning Bars","review":"I guess riding on Ryan Adams' success really does get you somewhere. This cd ... Why? The dude can't sing & the lyrics are stupid & he sings like he is falling asleep. Or he is as bored as me. ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's be done and far better.","review":"Whenever braindead, propaganda pushers such as NME get on a new artists wagon, you can usually be sure its suspect. (ie The Vines) Jesse Malin is no exception.Former lead man for no name punk band tries his hand at folk cum progressive rock. The result: 13 of the poorest attempts to mimic Springsteen styled rock that you'll here this side of Bob Seger. Malin can't sing and the songs are so generic that even supposed wunderkind Ryan Adams couldn't pull them out of the pedestrian street. Which is a wonder really because mimicry is Ryan's specialty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you kidding?","review":"It's amazing how untalented some people can actually be.

The cause of this issue is that Toshiba used a desktop CPU (Intel Pentium III) instead of a mobile CPU in these laptops. Toshiba's solution to the problem is a BIOS update which effectively throttles back the clock speed of the CPU and causes some issues with DVD playback. This defect is also present in the satellite 5505 series laptops."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this computer","review":"This computer has been a disaster. The modem has never worked once.

In the \\"one bad apple...\\" review, the reviewer asserts that the BIOS fixes offered by Toshiba will correct this problem. This is a truth wrapped in falsehood. The BIOS fix WILL prevent this problem from occuring, but it is because it prevents your computer from running at its advertised speed. To say this is a solution is insane. All it suggests is that you should have bought a cheaper, slower computer to begin with. Do NOT confuse the BIOS fix as a real fix. Do not buy this computer. Also, do not buy a Satellite 5005-series or 1900-series. Same deal.

My book club featured \\"Datelines\\" this week and all the gals wished for a bit more \\"meat.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"An influential man's farewell","review":"First anger, then sadness, as I read the musings of a network news anchorman at the dawn of a new millennium. Audrey Hepburn, Elvis, Charles Kuralt and other heroes are gone now, and so is the author's authority and relevance. The man who was upbraided by George Bush in a live TV interview now watches George Junior inexplicably move forward to fill the breach. The man who helped bring down a President finds himself embarrassed by the way a President younger than he brings himself down. There's true pathos in these essays by a man who once influenced Kings, but now worships the lowly Don Imus. Dan Rather bravely admits he has passed the baton to a new generation with standards perhaps lower than his, but with a bare honesty he could never bring himself to achieve. Here, he tries to break loose the network bonds that he inadvertantly helped create.A poignant end to an influential career."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rather disappointing...","review":"The \\"commentaries\\" you hear on the radio are usually bits that are written on deadline, reacting to news stories or events-- spur of the moment stuff to fill time between the denture ads--but they ain't the stuff of literature or books-- at least not stuff you pay good money for. And I did. This ain't Paul Harvey. But what's more frustrating is that even though the book tries to touch on all the demographics-- from Clinton to Elvis... the crackerbarrel philosophin' don't ring true (and neither does the story about his wife almost marrying The King). If Dan wants folks to care about what he thinks about things, next time maybe he ought to maybe think about taking a sabbatical or at least a vacation to sit down at his estate and write something real. What'll they sell us next-- a book of his intros from the Evening News? (and according to the credits, he don't write them, either!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bleh!","review":"Well, if you're really interested in one man's opinion of where we are and where we are going, I suppose you might want to read this book. I made that mistake.Dan Rather shows us all the stereotypical crap that comes from people his age. You know, all about how back in the day... Things were sooo much better. Get over it. Things are different. Who is Dan Rather to say they are worse? Its the age old story about the man who walked 3 miles each way to school, uphill both ways, and probably barefoot too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dan Blather, A Very Strange Man","review":"You don't have to be a Republican to wonder why Dan Rather covered up evidence that President Clinton raped Juanita Broadrick especially since Mr. Rather led the fight against Clarence Thomas for his alleged dirty joke. Either Mr. Rather is a moral monster, who finds a black man's joke to be worse than a white man's rape, or he is a total idiot. Evidence of the latter proposition can be found in this book. There are few paragraphs more than two sentences long. What he has to say is not original and is expressed in a very pedestrian manner. It's amusing for awhile to read the first few lines of one of his \\"essays\\" and then write the rest of the piece yourself. This could be written by a computer which has been programmed on the Dick and Jane series. But even THAT computer would have been offended by the President's rape."},{"rating":"2","title":"A true intellectual","review":"Dan Rather is truly an intellectual, one of a kind and scarce in America's \\"demoralized\\" media. Whether he is a conservative or a liberal, is regardless. What matters is that he approaches every subject with sincerity and broadened perspective. It is a shame that Americans don't recognize this \\"gem of journalism\\" (at its best). Considering their preferences of other newsmakers, we see a great need for morals in the socially underachieved America.As for Datelines and Deadlines, great work Mr.Rather. Please continue with your invaluable work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow and Predictable","review":"With all due respect to a man who has had a great career on television, I frankly am shocked at this \\"book\\". It amazes me how little \\"in touch\\" the author is with the world he has been reporting about all these years.The \\"Love Me Tender\\" Elvis story is corny and just plain silly. The \\"When Their Sixty-four\\" story is not only stupid, it clearly shows that Dan completely missed a generation. By the way, when WAS the last time Bob Dylan revised his thought \\"never trust anyone over thirty\\"? Dan, are you sure it was Dylan who said that?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Spirited but Languorous","review":"Ti-Coca is the main attraction on this disc. He sings in a style that sounds more Hispanic than French in spirit, but that shouldn't be a problem for anyone who likes Caribbean music. (The prominent accordion reminds me of Dominican country music. Could he be from close to the border?) The sound is spirited but languorous, and fun to hear.A bonus is three tracks from Toto Bissainthe, accompanied by crackling, not raucous percussion, who seems to have adopted some of the chanteuse sheen of her adopted France. Two rather unusual sides of Haiti, but worth a listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"great info","review":"Great book for step by step guiding through some of Alaska's towns. Small and very easy to use!

I liked the song though and got the album anyway. If you like on the way down, you will like the album, its an all around good debut.

To those who think he is merely a pretty boy who doesn't know what he's talking about, HE IS NOT. This CD is very deep and it could fill the hearts of people. At first I thought I would never be one of those girls that would go GAGA over him, but when I sampled his music at a local Borders Bookstore it was at the TOP OF MY CHRISTMAS WISHLIST. Currently, it is pretty much the only thing I listen to.RYAN CABRERA is a wonderful artist that writes music that completely comes from the heart, he is a rare find and there aren't many others who sing his type of music. For once there are songs that aren't about shaking what your mama gave you. Ryan Cabrera's music could bring tears to your eyes as long as you have a heart to be touched and ears to listen for music with the value of diamonds and gold."},{"rating":"2","title":"take it all away-ryan cabrera","review":"this cd is so good. i've seen ryan live 3 times, he's an amazing singer/guitarist. he wrote all of the songs on this album. it's a cd that you can listen to all of the songs without skipping any!:)"},{"rating":"2","title":"&quot;Take It All Away&quot;","review":"Ryan Cabrera's Cd &quot;Take It All Away&quot; is awesome.

Ryan Cabrera: not only is he cute, but he has a nice, smooth voice that is easy to listen to. His pop-rock songs are infectious and put a smile on my face after a long day at work or school. On first listen, his songs all seem to be just variations of eachother, but after a few listens, you'll be singing along.It's nothing revolutionary, but the preteen and young teen girls are going to love it.Don't let his immediate association of him with Ashlee Simpson skew your opinion of this CD. He's a lot better at what he does than she is."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Good Stuff","review":"There's no denying the chick-magnet appeal this guy has. What makes it better is the fact that he can actually sing and write and do all the things that the pop stars of teeny bopper world past never did. The only reason I didn't give this five stars is the fact that I bought Gavin Degraw's Chariot Stripped the same day and comparing the two puts Ryan down just a notch. This is definitely the solid major label debut you could have hoped for. Elm Street was a more acoustic album so this one might come as a surprise to his earlier fans. But, all in all, it offers the perfect blend of pop/rock. Tracks like \\"Shame On Me\\" and \\"40 Kinds of Sadness\\" are a departure from his ballad heavy past. Ryan proves that he can serve up an eclectic blend of songs and I promise, if you liked \\"On the Way Down\\" this album won't disappoint. If you're hoping for some sort of groundbreaking album, Gavin Degraw is the better bet, but this is definitely worth the money too."},{"rating":"2","title":"very deep","review":"this cd is very deep and original. hes songs definily seem to have taken effort to do cuz there NOT like every song you hear on the radio. so i recommend this.DRAKE BELL is another artist i recommend because he also writes his music like ryan and i think thats very important in the music industry cuz that means the youre really into being a musciian.

But by midway through the book it became tedious and convuluted. Way too many characters to follow that don't go anywhere and aren't necessary for the good of the book. The science seems solid enough (don't listen to all those self proclaimed scientists [by the way, I'm a microbiologist] who slam it for being innaccurate or not up to their ego driven standards) but didn't really mesh with the character development or--as hard as this seems like it would be--the plot.Overall, a good idea kind of wasted. I didn't hate the book. But I wouldn't recommend. Nonetheless, I wouldn't discourage someone from reading it if they had their heart set on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rushed Finish to a good start","review":"This book has, at its core, one of the greatest premises for a plot I've seen in ages. The prospect of evolution alonside our species. The characters are pretty well defined, with a good pace to keep you reading through the night. However, 3/4s of the way through, the pace drops and the plot starts to lose its grip. The author has sped the ending up to an almost farcical close that has no value compared to the earlier chapters. On the whole however, I'd recommend this to someone who wants to read about what could, eventually, happen to humans on this planet. A must read? No. But a good read nevertheless!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Strong beginning but weak conclusion","review":"Darwin's Radio had a really intriguing start, compelling body, but wimpy conclusion. I really enjoyed the \\"hard science\\" and the conflict between politics vs science, but in the final analysis, the characters were boring and very stereotypical -I am referring specifically to Kaye & Mitch. During most of their dialog with each other, I felt as if I was reading something out of a romance novel instead of SciFi. It's a toss up which was more nauseating...Kaye's transformation from an intelligent, educated, prominent woman of science to a mere breeder, or Mitch's sudden change from anthropologist to a he-man, mr. macho type. Get real, Mr. Bear, people do not surrender their individual identities just because they happen to become parents!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Downer!","review":"I am a recreational, lifelong science fiction fan. I've read fantasy, soft and hard science fiction and can appreciate the way that a good sci-fi writer can sift through worlds or concepts built on a solid scientific concept that continues to spin out to a plausible conclusion through the writer's imagination. I don't have to get the warm fuzzies to enjoy a good read -- that's for cowards. But all that said, I can't remember when I last read a book that left me so depressed and wishing I had left it on the shelf. The Handmaiden's Tale provides a similar strain of story, where women and men become trapped socially, psychically and physically because human reproduction has ceased to function as naturally as nature intended. But while the Handmaiden's Tale was provocative, Darwin's Radio just left me depressed and down. My recommendation: if your prescription for mood elevating drugs has expired, stay away from this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Darwin's Radio","review":"I bought this book because I heard a fascinating discussion of its thesis on NPR. I'm also an avid, and very particular, reader of speculative fiction. I was disappointed. The science, while prodigious, was muddled; the plot was scattershot and badly developed; the characters were introduced intriguingly, then thinned to the level of parchment. The ending seemed as though it had been rushed by a publishing house ravenous for a quick, best-seller buck. I think its only value is to provoke interesting discussions on literate talk shows.

If you're curious, borrow it from the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"a short story in book length","review":"It seems that Amazon rankings work like this: fiction - mostly people that like the book; non-fiction - mostly people that didn't like the book; music - people calling each other names.So to buck the trend - here are my two stars. I really like Greg Bear, especially his \\"Blood Music\\". This book, however, has a clever premise and some decent hard science to it, but on the whole is just plain boring. It may have made a nice short story or novella, but it doesn't work at novel length.The initial find of the iceman is too bizarrely coincidental with the rest of the story. And, anyway, wasn't this same ground better covered by Arthur C. Clarke's 2001?Bear is one of the few authors I will risk a sight-unseen hardback purchase. After this disappointment, I may have to remove him from that category. That's evolution for you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"couldn't get through it...","review":"I'm sorry. I usually like Greg Bear, really enjoyed Eon, and looked forward to this, but this book was obviously intended to be a \\"product\\" as much as a novel. It's inflated with needless chit-chat, dull description and flat characters who really have little to do with the main storyline.I tried to be patient...but he lost me at page 100. (I'm glad I took this one out of the library and didn't spring for it.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Greg Bear's best!","review":"Writing as a fan of Greg Bear and many of his previous books, I have to say that this is not one of his best. The premise of an evolutionarily important retrovirus embedded in our genes that drives a sort of punctutated evolution is interesting, but Bear does not pull it off. His book struggles as an unsuccessful mix of a hard science fiction story about a possible new revelation in biology and a story of a relationship between two of the principal characters in the plot. Furthermore, the decidedly anticlimactic ending left me cold, with only a superficial description of the supposed next stage in human evolution, which didn't even seem that remarkable given the long build-up. Disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read, a little bit manipulative","review":"The story has been done before in science fiction-- what sparks evolution? and what happens to us if a jump begins in our lifetime? Bear uses the characters of a biologist coming off a failed marriage, a disgraced paleontologist, and a government disease specialist to carry the plot that is meant to be an answer to this 'what if'.The approach is fresh, and well-written. My sole complaint was that I felt like he chose a very \\"good scientist/bad scientist\\" approach to members of the government and scientific communities and created an artificial kind of opposition that may have made us like his characters better but weakened the lovely complexity that he'd otherwise achieved. I think he could have respected his readers enough to let us make our own judgements without painting the character actions in such big obvious strokes. It's a common failing, but Bear's a good enough writer that seeing it here disappointed me."},{"rating":"2","title":"punctuated equilibrium, punctuated brilliance","review":"Hard science, fascinating premise and interesting developments combine to make an interesting book that is probably a bit too long and a little long on a human relationship story that is a bit of a snooze. The fundamental premise - a real, live instance of punctuated equilibrium running amok - is fascinating as a concept and convincingly related. However, the real-life drama that runs throughout it is overblown and not that interesting (the love story is unconvincing). I disagree with other reviewers --- the ending is thought-provoking and had me returning to it several times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Darwin's Radio - I couldn't put this book down.","review":"This book engaged me in two ways. First I got to care for the characters and what happened to them. There is a tension throughout the entire book. I never knew what would happen to them until the very last page. Some die, some don't. But what really grabbed me are Bear's thoughts and theories on evolutionary probability. A totally new look at human's development that diverges from Darwin's Theories. Very believable. My wife (who also read the book) and I have had many great conversations on the topic since, thanks to Greg Bear. I highly recommend this book and hope that the story will be continued."},{"rating":"1","title":"Darwins Radio had too much static","review":"Greg Bear is one of the best and most talented science fiction writers of today, but I guess even the greats bomb out occasionally.The concept behind the book is clever and thought provoking. The author thoroughly did his homework. The problem was in the writing. The book was so filled with distracting drivel and unnecessary social dialog that it could have been written by a computer. I felt embarrassment for the author when I read the first sentence -->\\"The flat afternoon sky spread over the black and gray mountains like a stage backdrop, the color of a dog's pale crazy eye.\\" The book reminds me of the movie Stargate; so much unrealized potential.Darwin's Radio wasn't all bad. I gave it two stars. After the the story begins, on page 493, the reader sees the real talent that Mr. Bear was hiding. By skimming over the superfluous dialogs, the reader is introduced to an eye opening view of a bright future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greg Bear does his homework!","review":"As a biologist, I appreciate accuracy in depictions of biological science. The most enjoyable aspect of this book is its comparatively high level of scientific understanding. So many SciFi authors either gloss over or simply bumble through the details, hoping nobody will notice that they don't have a clue. Greg Bear does his homework! Endogenous retroviruses are real, and are becoming a real concern. While the results would certainly not be quite as interesting as those proposed by Bear, this was nonetheless a fascinating romp through contemporary molecular biology. I can't wait for the inevitable sequel!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Toooooooo loooooooooooooong","review":"Way too long. The story Bear tells is just not worth telling at such great length. It starts out as a scientific mystery and devolves into a soap opera. I never liked any of the characters enough to want to spend so much time with them. I only finished the book because I wanted to learn the answer to the evolutionary mystery, but the payoff was disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasted a great theme!","review":"I had never read Greg Bear before. So I was excited and ready for the experience of this writer and, it started out fine. However once he got into the characters it began to fall apart. Especially the diolog between Mitch and Kay was very amateurish. Conversations between the scientists were not realistic. At the top of all this the turn of the events and the agenda (far from science) that the author was trying to sneak in became obvious. What could be an exciting page turner evolved into a \\"can't wait to finish\\" kind of a nuisance. Although it was not waste of my time, it was the waste of an excellent theme by the author. A very interesting subject was being squandered by bad writing and shaky science."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't even finish it...","review":"I rarely abandon a book. No matter how much I dislike it, I can usually justify sticking with it to the end just based on the time already invested. I'm now 350 pages into this one and am calling it quits.Why? It's just become unbearable (hmm, no pun on the author's name intended)! I slogged through chapter after chapter of over-dramatic scientists worrying about stating out loud the only logical conclusion we can draw. I fumbled through the biology lessons (I admit that was always my weakest science). But then the mid-book romance started, and I just can't stomach it.The dialog is so clumsy, unbelievable, and repetitious (\\"can you smell me?\\"), that I think if I ever met these two characters in real life I would run the other direction just to avoid overhearing them talk.Maybe there's some big twist at the end, or some great conclusion, but it will be a long time before I can force myself to find out. What a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mostly mediocre","review":"Takes exciting scary ideas that you COULD fall in love with, and buries them in a long boring, punctuated, slog of paper-mache characters who are either moping or expounding like they're on AM talk radio. I got tired of the author's descriptions of white middle-class America flaking out. I finished it so I could trash it. Sorry it was such a failure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boooooooring","review":"Very talky, slow-moving and WAY too long. The central idea is interesting but not enough to carry a 500+ page book. Much of the action, such as it is, takes place \\"off-camera\\", being reported by characters or summarized briefly instead of being depicted. The collapse of society amidst paranoia about an unknown disease could have made for a gripping thriller but instead it is treated as incidental. The characters are a bit better realized than in some of Bear's previous novels though not by much. On the other hand the flow of thought-provoking ideas which made many of his earlier novels enjoyable seems to have dried up here. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of his best.","review":"Do you remember those really old sf stories where men in white coats endlessly lecture each other about the improbable results of their peculiar experiments? Large indigestible helpings of pseudo-scientific guff, but not much else?This is one of those."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good concept, but writing cannot sustain it.","review":"To put it bluntly, Greg Bear's limitations as a writer hinder this book. If he had cut it down by 100-150 pages, it would've been a focused and thrilling novel. As it stands, the book meanders. The paeans to Democrats and villification of Republicans do not mesh with the theme. The idea behind the book is gripping enough that I finished it, but more from the standpoint of wanting to find out how it ended. If there would've been a two page summary, I would've probably preferred it to the last portion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Starts off like a rocket. Finishes like a cannonball.","review":"Darwin's Radio is the great sci-fi/techno-thriller you always wanted to read -- up to about 2/3 into the book. The at first seemingly complex story is actually a well-tied together tight ball of story lines. Especially if you've kept up on virus-related science and fiction, this is no stretch of the imagination, rather an original innovation. And, where other fiction fails, namely believability of characters and their thoughts and actions, this book succeeds. However, sometimes great writers don't know when to stop -- as in, just end the book with a punch! It occurs to me now that, like Ender's Game, Darwin's Radio could have been two very good, but very different kinds of books. It's too late for that now, but you may want to consider that in your aproach to reading it -- avoid the dissapointment by lowering expectations a few notches."},{"rating":"1","title":"100% plot, no characterization","review":"If you enjoy books where the virus is the most rounded and interesting character, or think people actually speak dialogue like \\"We can't target the LPC messenger RNA in the cytoplasm because our current ribozymes do not recognize the mutated form,\\" (I am not making this up; see p. 268), or enjoy books with 5-page glossaries of scientific terms at the end, this book's for you. The human characters are motiveless, flat, dull, boring, etc. and are just moved on- and off-stage by the author to speak this sort of scientific babble. Snickers at religious people and politicians. The plot is kind of interesting but could have been written on a 3 x 5 card. Not recommended unless you go in for this sort of thing; I do enjoy an occasional science fiction story but not this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Techno Thriller Without End","review":"I \\"read\\" this on a drive from Washington, DC to Detroit, MI and back. (At 15 packed CDs, not much time left to hear anything else, believe me!) Mr. Guidall does everything he can to make this book come to life. He's a real pro. But something this long should have had some kind of point to it, or at least an interesting ending. There's lots of biological and genetic techno talk that you won't need to understand, and weaved around that a pretty pedestrian plot, full of give-aways �?Bear stealing his own thunder (you as a reader are way ahead of the characters most of the time, which is absurd and makes you feel silly). By doing childbirth, perhaps Bear decided to go for both the largely male techno audience and the romance ... audience simultaneously. Who knows? Who cares? Oh, and did I mention it was unconscionably long? If you insist on experiencing this novel, may I recommend it in an abridged form? You won't miss a thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really Bad Science","review":"I normally enjoy Bear's work, but I was dissapointed in Darwin's Radio. Though his character development and writing style are good (if a little longwinded), his use of evolutionary biology is not. He obviously did a great deal of research into molecular biology and immunology and I am surprised that he didn't work harder to achieve a better understanding of evolution. The idea's presented as \\"tomorrow's headlines\\" are not just silly, they're pretty much impossible. Speciation is not a mystery and Bear's use of goal directed evolution is completely at odd's with real science. He throws in terms like punctuated equilibrium and adaptationism, but I don't think he really understands them. Read the book if you want but keep in mind it has a lot more in common with fantasy than sci-fi."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I find it difficult to believe that this and similar horror / thriller stuff was written by the same Greg Bear who authored Eon, Eternity, and Anvil of Stars.All I can figure is he's reached a life stage where he feels a need for mass audience and especially a movie contract or two. The poetic justice is this: beyond the gross-out factor his writing is now just plain bad. Maybe that's part of the recipe for this market."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor story line","review":"I'm going to keep this review short. Just wanted to give a rating so that system is fair, meaning the ratings are not filled with all 5 star people telling you to buy it.The book meanders through needless details that do not contribute anything to the story. Main characters husband commits suicide, big deal. They find neanderthals with speciation, big deal.Read Eon by Bear, it is much better and more imaginative."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"When a book is really, really, really bad I throw it across the room. This book took its maiden flight at 11:00pm on a Saturday night on around page 85. I am going to give this book to my brother Lonnie because he keeps giving me horrible books.

If he doesn't - I figure I owe him anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"A \\"thriller\\" that reads like a textbook","review":"Critics often praise a good nonfiction book by saying, \\"It reads like a novel.\\" Well, here's a novel that reads like a textbook -- and a bad one at that. The book is full of arcane science, with few definitions or explanations. Bear assumes that every reader is an expert in microbiology. Moreover, his ending stinks. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wildly Disjointed (small spoiler warning)","review":"I got this book out of a suggestion from a friend. I started reading it and I loved it, but this book as a whole is highly disjointed, and about 3/4 into the novel it starts making no sense. It's like the story just gets lost and it ends abruptly, then Bear just started typing randomly with no ideas of where the story is going. There was no climax, and the structure seemed to get lost. I give this book 2 stars because the beginning was fascinating as was the whole first half, but the second Kaye and Mitch get together the book takes a slow and tedious dive into obscurity. My recommendation: don't get the book. It's a fascinating premise, and at first you'll be riveted by the interesting characters and storyline, but everything that's good about the novel gets lost in the last 2/3rds of the book"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mitch killed this book","review":"I love books that run with the concept of ancient diseases wreaking havoc on modern man. What killed this book, was the anthropologist, Mitch.

An ancient disease seems to be killing babies before they even have a chance to be born. Mothers and their offspring are being killed by epidemic and if something isn't done soon there may be nobody left alive to bury the bodies.The story seems slow at the start but it is soon flying almost as fast as one can read. Politics, science, evolution and human relationships all mix into a well thought out story. One that Greg Bear leaves open at the end, so you better be ready to get the next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greg Bear does it again","review":"First he wrote Blood Music...a truly great read and now Darwin's Radio. In light of all the news regarding the changing nature of our understanding of human evolution, Bear shows himself to be amazingly prescient.

I used to buy his works on strength that HE wrote it - but I was disappointed this time. Greg has come down a long way since his own nadir of accomplishment in Eon/Eternity days. Here he wants to do a Arthur C Clarke style 'END OF MANKIND as we know it' gambit a la The End of Childhood meets Andromeda Strain, but fails from mishandling of dramatic tension and plot development. His premises are technically brilliant - human evolution encoded into our genes and suddenly progressing explosively. But the reader will be let down by the last 50 pages. The climatic scene is simply not there. No buzz, no high, no intellectual orgasm. Just a bewilderment that \\"Hey is this IT?\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"90% science fact, 10% science fiction","review":"A colleague saw that I was reading Matt Ridley's \\"Genome\\" and recommended that I follow science fact with good science fiction by reading \\"Darwin's Radio\\". Reading \\"Genome\\" turned out to be a perfect primer for \\"Darwin's Radio\\" since it covers most if not all of the esoteric biological concepts that lend to Greg Bear's brilliant story of how the next \\"human upgrade\\" might occur. It's fascinating to know that Human Endogenous Retro-Viruses (HERV) really do exist. The ending to \\"Darwin's Radio\\" seemed to be about three chapters too early or perhaps Mr. Bear plans a sequel. Nonetheless, \\"Darwin's Radio\\" was a very good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Darwin's Radio","review":"A book I could not put down.

I knew what was going on from the time that the bodies were discovered in that cave, and that was very early in the book. The book took no surprising turns and the main protagonist was insufferable.

Period. However, the scientifically faint of heart should not be discouraged. Bear does an exceptional job of explaining complex concepts and applying them to the story's plot.

Those interested in speculative fiction and evolution will be particularly pleased.The innovative plot and suspenseful presentation of the storyline more than make up for some some characters lack of depth. This is an excellent read."},{"rating":"2","title":"I really liked it; exactly what a good sci-fi should do!","review":"My criteria for a good sci-fi book is a piece that exposes me to a totally different concept or idea.

It wasn't just that it was boring and long-winded, it was simply that Mr. Bear is a bad writer. Cliches abound. He seems to enjoy using colors to describe everything! \\"The gray xyz was next to a white abc which had a blue-green exterior and a pinkish lid, etc, etc.\\" The romance between the characters is like something you'd read in a crappy romance novel \\"she stood above the ridge looking strong.

I have read several of Bear's books, and I thought this one might follow suit with excitement, intrigue, suspense, scary critters...SORRY! None of those!I tried really hard to wade through this mishmash of oddly developed characters, a totally unecessary and weak romance between the two primary characters, and a plot that could have been really good. Sadly more time was spent with the science of the theory than the fruition of the theory, resulting in an oddly confused mess that I couldn't even finish.In conclusion I just can't recommend this read if one is searching for that perfect beach book!

Evolution is fascinating & this work took me well beyond my previous thinking. I had the usual model plus a crude \\"catastrophe\\" model of evolution.

But the problem is that when you lay on the authentic molecular biology lingo so thick and detailed, then outlandish but interesting plot handles become just plain silly. Greg Bear makes enough errors in his supposedly sophisticated appreciation of the biotechnology revolution that someone tra plausible scenariined in evolutionary biology haad to shake his head.

Darwin's Radio is a hard science thriller and a real page turner. The subject matter (how evolution may have ocurred) and the science (DNA, viruses, HERV) would be exciting in themselves, but in this case the science wound up in a first class thriller with lots of political intrigue. Although it was perhaps a bit too neat at times, most of the story seemed all too real, like it was from tommorrows headlines (I wish). BTW, although not explicitly stated in this book, there are lot's of problems with Darwin's theory of evolution. This book presents one possible (fictional) explanation. None-the-less, if you are walking around with your head in the clouds saying you believe in Evolution (with a capital E), I recommend doing some research into what we now know are serious issues with Darwin's theories.

Seeing books like Quantico and Dead Lines, I'm beginning to think I've lost the author I used to love.This may very well be his last stab at a hard sci-fi book. And what a stab it was!

I got the basic idea, but a lot of the exposition bogged me down. Still, the explanations for the biology seemed good, and were realistically included, usually in the context of a scientist explaining something to a politician. But since there were a lot of politicians involved, there was a lot of explaining that needed to be done. So, in addition to trying to figure out all the science, one also has to keep track all of the politicians. Between the two, this book was a little overloaded.The premise is a really interesting one, though. What if evolution isn't as gradual as we think? What if it can happen in great leaps.

The following morning there were dead spiders of all sizes plus various other dead bugs scattered around my porches.I live way out in the country with thousands of irritating insects all summer.I really love this stuff, although, I do wish they made it in a concentrated style.

It's like hearing silent comedy music,more jazzed up, like Paul Whiteman. You have to have an acquired taste for this music. If you're into 1920's jazz music & love Paul Whiteman, this one is up your alley. And the booklet goes into details of the Brown Bros. & their legacy. That's why I find it hard to buy a CD & place it in my CD case; I like the case with the booklet!! Recommended for those old jazz enthusiasts or looking for silent movie type music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Godsmack retro","review":"Being from the Boston area I got to LIVE the whole Godsmack fenom. I had this CD and it was almost worn out when I heard the contract signing on WAAF, Boston. Yes, the credits in the liner notes are true, WAAF fans got them there. This is still my favorite Godsmack CD. Right from the start with 'Moon Baby' you can feel you are in for one hell of a ride. The spoken/samples that intro almost every tune add to the track and get you ready for what follows. You will notice that a song from 'Awake' is here, 'Going Down'. I like this raw version so much more. This CD does have 'Whatever' on it, the hidden last track, to close out the run. If you're like me, you will restart this, or set your CD player to repete, because each time it ends you just want more. I promise, you will not be disapointed by this one. If you can get this, and I will NEVER part with mine, GET IT!! Every true Godsmack fan needs this CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"BAND FOR THE YEAR 2000","review":"WELL THERE IS NOT ALOT TO SAY-YOU HAVE TO LISTEN TO THE CD.

Skeptical at first, naturally, I began quickly to appreciate the author's writing style, and his ability of keeping the novel interesting and fluent. From the start, I fell in love with the story's main characters: Herman Schuller, the young Swiss Army corporal, and Angelina Bianci, the fashion model from Milan.

The first one in the entire series that resembles its qualities."},{"rating":"1","title":"You Never Know with Amazon","review":"I ordered the hardcover editions of both Ender's Game and Ender's Shadow. The Ender's Game book was great, but the Ender's Shadow was actually a paperback wrapped in a hardcover. There is a difference... primarily the ease with which one can read the book. Paperbacks are simply smaller print, and to call them one with hardcover, anything other than a paperback (possibly \\"Library Binding\\") is misrepresentation on the part of Amazon. I haven't even read this book yet, but Amazon gets two stars on this one. I may have to go back to buying books at the bookstores."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous book","review":"I just finished re-reading Ender's Game and Ender's Shadow. Ender's Game is a classic, first-rate novel... enthralling and smart. What surprises me each time I read Ender's Shadow is just how much it holds up to, and in some ways surpasses Ender's Game. It is not a sequel, as you probably know, because it covers the same events of Ender's Game from a different viewpoint. And it is oh so good. It is not a book that is in the shadow of any other book... it is its own masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a classic, but pretty darn good","review":"Card returns to the world of his classic Ender's Game from the viewpoint of another character, the small, young Bean. This would seem to be a transparent chance to milk the franchise some more, but the book manages to be impressive. It adds much background to Bean, not just telling the same story from a different viewpoint but going to different times and places to tell a different story. Even when it's the same story, it's interesting to see it from Bean's viewpoint, particularly since he's even more insightful about the situation than Ender and figures out that the battles are for real long before Ender does. It's not quite as strong a book as its predecessor (which is no insult), but remains worthwhile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who would think a sequel, no side-quel could be so good?!?","review":"Orson Scott Card is perhaps the BEST writer of fiction for thoughtful, intelligent people, whether you are 12 or 42. This is a must-read. (AFTER you have read Ender's Game, of course.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read!","review":"You basically know the premise of the book already from the other reviews and have most likely read Ender's Game and loved it (else why are you looking at this book?), so all I can add is this is a great book.I always thought the books after Ender's Game didn't have the same spark and was never to fond of them, (I can't even remember what Xenocide was about!) but I saw this book and when I realized it was taking place at the time of the Formic war when Ender did what he does best, I thought I had better read it. The fact that it takes place from another perspective and sort of gives you a behind the scenes look at Ender's Game makes this an even better read. So quit reading this and read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well then!","review":"I have to say, I didn't think that this book would be any good, since it was going back to the time that Ender's Game took place in, and books that go back like that tend to not be very good, but I forgot that I was dealing with my favorite author, OSC. It was excellent. I actually like Bean better than Ender now.. Heheh... That is all."},{"rating":"2","title":"something not quite there,though","review":"I thought this was an excellent book, and would have given it five stars except for the fact that it is linked so closely to ender's game. ender's game had something I can't put my finger on that made it more vital and gripping. At first I thought it was the fact that several scenes are repeated in this book, but they are given a new twist that fan's of ender's game will surely enjoy. also, and this is kind of rediculous, I almost felt a bit of resentment to card for making ender seem more mortal and fallable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thrilling and Intense","review":"I read Ender's Game in early December when my boyfriend lent me his copy. I loved the book so much that I asked my grandmother for Ender's Shadow for Christmas. This follow-up/parallel for Ender's Game is all I ever expected in a science fiction novel. It's intense at some points, yet touching in others. When Poke is killed I was in tears. When Bean learned that Achilles was in Battle School I wondered why the people had excepted him when the nun told them specifically not to. In many parts of this book, I was crying so hard I couldn't think about anything else. At the end, as in all of Card's books, I was completely satisfied and fully content."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Good, and Has 2 Stars only b/c it reminds me of Ender","review":"Well, I loved Ender's Game so much that I tried to get the magic of reading that book back. Ender's Shadow seemed the logical choice: written by the same author, and basically told in the same timeframe (and I didn't want to read a sequal, b/c so far all sequals have been disappointing). But, alas, this book did not bring back the magic. It seemed that Card wanted to make Bean extremely smart (too smart). This seemed to diminish what Ender had and what Ender had done. I didn't like the whole back story of Bean, and really wasn't interested in him at all. Basically, if you are trying to get that magic of ender's game through this book, then prepare to be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't read this book!","review":"If you're considering reading Ender's Shadow, you've probably just come from reading Ender's Game, which you loved(as it should be loved). If this is at all true, DON'T READ THIS BOOK! Ender's \\"Shadow\\" is the character of Bean... except this Bean has nothing in common with the Bean you've met. In this version, Bean is better, smarter, and more reliable than Ender - Card has to constantly trip over himself to figure out why Bean would have said the original dialog and create reasons why he wasn't put in charge instead. None of it makes any sense, and in the process Ender is torn down, insulted, and made into a mockery of the amazing character we've all fallen in love with. Very rarely does a book make this angry, but (having read this book over 7 years ago) I am still hurt and offended that anyone, least of all his creator, would ever do something so cruel to such a beautiful character. Don't let Ender be destroyed like this - don't read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Makes hash of the original","review":"I thought this book was mediocre, but I thought some things didn't feel quite right. So I checked \\"parallel\\" passages from Ender's Shadow and Ender's Game. That was when I realized that this book makes the original incoherent.A great example: in Ender's Game, there are some passages written from Bean's point of view. I found these passages well-written and quite powerful. There's a serious problem: Bean's internal monologue in Ender's Game is nothing - absolutely nothing - like his internal monologue in Ender's Shadow. Consequently, this book effectively destroys one of the best and most interesting characters in his original novel. There's more in this vein, but there's no point in going on endlessly.Furthermore, Ender's Shadow is chock-full of little comments that obviously have no purpose other than to patch up little holes in the original that pedantic readers complained about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Fantastic","review":"I was required to read this book for my summmer reading. I looked at it and groaned, because I used to think that all science fiction books were stupid and boring. After I read this one, I was really surprised. I finished it in 3 days, because it was so good. After I read this, I read Ender's Game, and that was good, too, but I liked reading the story in Bean's point of view more. This just goes to show that science fiction doesn't have to be boring!! I really loved this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"would give zero stars","review":"What is baffling to me is how fans of the original Ender's Game can like this book. Bean takes credit for many moments when Ender showed his brilliance. What? While I could understand if this were revisionist history - a bitter old Bean trying to relive glory days - I dont believe that is the case here. In the end this (and the subsequent books of the shadow series) seems like an author trying to relive his glory days but in doing so he undercuts the amazing accomplishment that was Ender's Game. I will now completely ignore these shadow books so I can keep rereading the original with the same wonder that I had the first time...and the second...and the third..."},{"rating":"1","title":"It didn't need to be a book.","review":"When I finshed the book I wondered when exactly Mr.Card jumped onto the Financial Bandwagon. I've read a lot of Mr. Card's books, and none of them stank of money like this one. I think we loyal fans were suckered, and that disappoints me. While I considered Ender's Shadow a decent read, it couldn't compare to Ender's Game. Not only that, but Ender's Shadow was unnecassary. I say this because a short story could have sufficed to tell the story that Mr. Card told in this book. I suppose for someone who hasn't read Ender's Game, Ender's Shadow would be an okay read. But as an avid fan, Shadow was a dissapointment. I expected a crisp, new story since it was from a new perspective. Instead it was the same story, just chewed up and regurgitated by Bean. I guess I expected better from Mr. Card. This is the first time he's ever dissapointed me with any piece of his writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bean finds the Amazing Love of Jesus","review":"If you liked Enders Game then this is an interesting sidestory. I did like Enders Game and I did like this book except that is for the drivel about Jesus. A little less Jesus-Freakin' and a little more substance and this book could have been really good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Bad","review":"The Bean books are not as good as Xenocide and Children of the Mind. Those are still by favourites and this book lacks the depth of those two novels, but considering I thought those two books were some of the best books I have ever read in my life it's not too surprising that Card was unable to surpass their complexity. This book fills in some gaps and it is fun. The characterization is good too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ender's Shadow","review":"This novel tells the story of Ender's Game again, but from the point of view of Bean, the younger, smarter, and colder kid from Battle school... but tells his story, how he got to battle school, what his experiences were there, and then to his eventual part to play in the Bugger War. It tells a compleatly diffrent side of the story, and could be read independantly, but not first. Too many of the 'twists' in Ender's Game are sited as points of fact in this one to enjoy it as a follow up.Both novels work beautifuly together, or apart. The plots are diffrent enough, and the story so radicaly diffrent as to both surprise and entice anyone who enjoys Sci-Fi. I recomend following Ender's Game with this novel... to anyone who liked the first."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"I liked Ender's Game very much. I also liked the 3 sequels despite the fact they were radically different - much slower pace and less adventurous. The quartet was ammazingly brilliant, and I was looking forward to the next chapter. Being a parallel book, I was expecting another gem. Unfortunatelly, Major parts of the beginning (before battle school) lack credability and the looooooooong essays capturing Bean's thoughts are simply boring. I would give this book an even lower rating, if it wasn't Ender's Shadow. If I would read it first in the series, I would dump it in the middle."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great point of view!","review":"I am a newfound sc-fi fanatic! I started with Ender's game and read all of the series. I found out about ender's shadow and had to get it. I absolutely love how Orson Scott Card took the same elements of the original ender's game and told it from a sub-character's point of view. I am waiting for the next one, I highly recommend this book, it is easy to read and understand, and you do not have to be a sci-fi freak to see the plot line. It is by far one of my favorit books, of course other than Ender's game. I also loved it so much because Bean was one of my favoirt character's he reminds me of Ender, but they are both two differnt character's so that is why it is such a great book! also read Shadow of the Hegemon! it's great also!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Card's Shadow","review":"Every single time that I put this book down I became excited to see what would happen to Bean. Card once again uses his beautiful style to suck your brain into a void of complete awe. The fact that he, not retells the story of Ender, but takes the same foundation and puts you in the drivers seat of a character that could possibly be as cool as Ender, is amazing. Card has a way with perceptions, and dropping tiny bits of information that either blow up in your face chapters later, or in this case, novels later. I purchased this book as soon as it came out, but it sat on my shelf until I finished the \\"Enders Quartet.\\" As I came to a close with Children of the Mind, I started Ender's Shadow and finished it in an evening. Get this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"AN EXCITING SURPRISE","review":"Sometimes when a series goes on, it tends to become tedious. I was not expecting much after the original Ender series because it was so great I could not imagine anything related even coming close. Surprise, Surprise, Surprise.

Bean is a complicated character that Card expresses with a multidimensional fullness.I can't wait to read Hegemons Shadow."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!","review":"Ender's Shadow is every bit as exciting as Ender's Game! Orson Scott Card seems to weave words into beutiful works of art in this amazing book! I suggest it to anyone who likes a good book. I hope you enjoy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Never read, you will regret it.","review":"This book is awful. It claims to follow the story of Bean in Ender's Game, but instead writes the beloved character out of existence. The contradictions are blatant and aren't trivial facts; they are integral to Bean's character itself. This book not only destroys any chance of identifying with Bean, but if considered canon, will ruin the story of Ender for you as well. Never. Read. This. Book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read Enders Game first! Definitely!","review":"It is certainly possible to read Ender's Shadow first, BUT it will reveal the wonderful suprise ending of Ender's Game. That ending is priceless, and if you already know how things will turn out, Ender's Game has less impact.It would be a shame for such a wonderful sequel to ruin the joy or reading the original."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bean's no Ender","review":"When I saw Ender's Shadow on the shelf I was broke, but thought \\"How can I not buy this book?\\" because Ender's Game was one of the most impactful books in my life.

However, when I began to read it, I discovered pages 311-342 completely omitted and pages 343-374 included twice.This was the May 2002 Starscape Edition, printed in February 2010 in the USA by Offset Paperback Manufacturers, Dallas, Pennsylvania.If you are considering purchasing this book, check which edition it is and the print date on arrival.

Since then Earth has started a Battle School Program to train the brightest young minds in our world to defend the home planet.Bean gets rescued from the streets and a murderous madman by a nun, Sister Carlotta. While taking Battle School admissions tests Bean and Sister Carlotta learn that he's incredibly brilliant. After being launched into space to live in a giant revolving wheel, Battle School, Bean learns that being incredibly smart and incredibly young is not a good recipe for making friends. In battle school Bean learns that a great responsibility is put on his shoulders. The life of the street urchin known only as \\"Bean\\" is fun and exciting life to read about. If you liked Ender's Game you will love Ender's Shadow."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book, but you must read ender's game first ...","review":"this is a most entertaining book, the onlt flaws i see are the fact that it somewhat a complementary book to ender's game, and must be read after reading ender's game, and the fact the unlike ender's game, it leaves quite a place to more sequals to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as good as Ender's Game but well worth a read.","review":"It was a fascinating exercise to review the events of Ender's Game through the eyes of another character. I found the premise of Ender's Shadow to be interesting, but the cool intellectual view of Bean was just not as moving as the tortured emotions of Ender Wiggin. The problem was that both Bean and I knew too much about what was going to happen before it happened, which meant there was very little of the suspense of Ender's Game. I also felt that too many questions and problems about Bean and his future were glossed over or left hanging in favor of a rather improbable \\"happy ending.\\" Perhaps this is because a sequel is intended? Anyway, I think Ender's Game is the better read but Ender's Shadow was a good follow-up."},{"rating":"1","title":"The second star is optimistic","review":"Okay, metaphor time. If \\"Ender's Game\\" and \\"Speaker for the Dead\\" (the two best books in the series) are Star Wars and The Empire Strikes Back, respectively, then \\"Ender's Shadow\\" is The Phantom Menace. Good idea, bad follow-through. The writing is poor, the characters are wooden and not really true to the originals, and worst of all, the main character is so unlikable that one can only hope that he dies soon. The only reason that I gave this book 2 stars is because I hold out the same hope for this series as I do for the rest of the new Star Wars movies. Hopefully, now that the story is set up, the next books will be a vast improvement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Impressive and captivating retelling of the game","review":"I picked this book up in hopes of regaining the sensation I experienced when I read Ender's game, and although you do know the end of the story this time through, it is still captivating.Bean is not a \\"surrogate Ender\\", in fact the story feels very differently when told from his perspective. I really enjoyed the insights into the characters when seen from Bean's perspective.Bean is at times better and worse than Ender and in the end, he is not as good of a General. He may have a higher IQ than even the vaunted Ender Wiggen, but he does not have the leadership, the intuition and the guts that Ender has. Bottom line, Bean is a Longstreet not a Lee.A fascinating tale and very much worth the time and the energy to read. I found it a wonderful complement to Ender's Game and not simply a way for Card to cash in on the same story twice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't ruin your memory of Ender's game with this","review":"As great as Card was with Ender's Game, he's disappointing with this.

There is little suspense of course, already knowing the outcome of the main plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bean, like Alvin, is too perfect to believe.","review":"I really enjoy Orson Scott Card's fiction, especially the Ender's Game series. However, he tends to overload his lead characters with superhuman abilities. In Ender's Shadow, this process happens too fast, and we never can appreciate the development of Bean's personality. We don't get to see him learn and grow the way we did with Ender in the first book. And while, as always, the world Card creates is engrossing in the tiny details, we've seen this one before, and it's not enough to carry the story. I would recommend reading \\"Lost Boys\\" or \\"Saints\\" instead, and saving your money on \\"Ender's Shadow.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth reading","review":"I had to read this book for school and it was torture.

Ender was portrayed as an especially gifted boy.. a one in billion. Card now feels that he has to make Ender look ordinary next to his latest hero. It was a case of 'too good to believe' for me. I love Card's portrayals of special people.. Ender, Alvin.. they're people you would like to be.. or at least have a ton of fun watching grow and learn through challenges. But this book was a step too far. Bean is never really challenged.. it's almost as if he has this magic power that can make any problem go away. The effect is that you end up not caring because you KNOW the magic power will appear on the next page and just wash the problem away. I'd rather go read Ender's Game again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Wonderful Orson Scott Card Book","review":"Many people see this book as just a rewritten version of Ender's Game except from bean's view. That is true in part, but the story tells of bean's past, his thoughts, hopes and wishes. Without reading this book, it would be impossible to understand bean thoroughly.From the first moment I started to read the book, I was astonish. I simply could not believe that bean, such a small child, had come from the streets living as an urchin for the greater part of his life. Questions as to where bean came from, how he came to be in battle school and other thought provoking questions are answered in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another money-maker for Mr. Card","review":"For the last 10 years OSC has come up with all sorts of ways to make money. Now he's mining the Ender saga for all it's worth. ENDER'S SHADOW is well written, fluid ... and boring. All Card is interested in is making money and he'll do anything he can to get people to think he's one of the greatest writers on the planet. All the critics in the SF field are his personal friends and the reviews he gets are \\"non-reviews\\"; they just do backflips in praise of this man's alleged insight into the minds of children. This book will have a number of sequels or other \\"parallel\\" books: ENDER'S TENNIS SHOES, followed by ENDER'S CHRISTMAS followed by ENDER'S ORTHODONTIA and ENDER'S SUMMERTIME ROMANCE. I'm truly sorry I have contributed to Mr. Card's financial status over these years. But, boy, how the man knows how to get rich. EVERYBODY: DO NOT READ ANYTHING WRITTEN BEFORE 1980!

I had better hopes for Ender's Shadow, but found it to be dry, overly analytical, and showed through too much of Card's strong religious background in it's not too subtle overtones. Ender's Game is one of the best books I've read, but unless you really enjoyed its sequels, don't get the 'companion novel'"},{"rating":"2","title":"just as good as Enders Game","review":"This book follows Bean instead of Ender, but it is just as hard and gritty and good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Orson Scott Card does it again","review":"While I don't think this book is as good as Ender's Game (my all-time favorite book) it was still an exciting and thought-provoking story.

Years ago as a teenager I found my first copy of Ender's Game sitting on my mother's dresser- it was the first Card book I'd ever read, and as a consequence of that action I've now read EVERY Card book I've ever found. Three years ago my family adopted two teenagers; my little brother also became a Card fan when he read Ender's Game just a few short months ago. We both knew several months in advance that Shadow was coming out. When it finally did, he called me long-distance from suburban DC to Greensboro, NC to taunt me in that he'd gotten his copy before I got mine. Well, the bookstore where I'd reserved a copy was late in getting it, so I gave up & ordered from Amazon, which provided next day shipping. The following night I returned that call to tell him that he was right, he got his copy first... but I finished reading it first!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Orson Scott Card does it yet again.","review":"To put it very simply, anyone who enjoyed Ender's Game will enjoy this book. As usually Orson Scott Card writes with a level of emotional clarity unmatched in science fiction today. And for those who have not entered Ender's world before get ready to experience a journey from the mean streets to the depths of space with a boy who learns what it means to be a leader. The characters are so real I found myself cheering them and crying with them.

Burned through it once and then read it again. I liked the different perspective from ender's game. Although there where a few things mentioned in this book that you think would have been hard to avoid telling in the previous book. I would have liked to know a few more things at the end of this book. (ie: does Bean and Ender's path's every cross again) Only a few discrepencies from the original but all in all a great book. Go buy it now! Remember the enemy's gate is down!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bean's Game","review":"I just finished reading this book and I must say that it is one of Card's best works. The way it was written, combining the unique characters with amazing backdrops leads to an amazing tale.This book starts where Enders Game began. It starts with Ender's lackie, litle Bean, struggiling to survive on the streats of Rotterdam. Eventually he makes his way to Battle School to meet his opponent and friend, Ender Wiggin.This is a spectacular story that is on my greatest books of all time list. Bean and company finaly hit the big time. I would demand that any fan of science fiction read this astounding novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mixed Emotions","review":"I have been an avid OSC fan for many years. I first read Ender's Game in sixth grade and over the years I have worn the book literally to pieces. When I learned Ender's Shadow was to be released I was very excited. However, the book did not live up to my understandably high expectations. In EG, Ender was presented as a heroic, brilliant, and tragic young boy. It seemed to me that by making Bean even more brilliant than Ender, OSC made Bean the REAL hero. I read Ender's Shadow in two grueling days. In the end, I felt duped, and I felt that Ender had been cheated. The book is worth reading, but read Ender's Game first, it is by far the superior novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"An attack on Ender's Game","review":"Ender's Game became, when I read it, one of my favorite books. This book is OK, alright, acceptable, etc. any middle of the road adjective you could think of and even that, it's only because it's based on a story I liked, in a location I liked, etc.So why not give it 4 or 3 stars?Because it actually seems to try to tear down Ender's Game.All the things you remember about Ender's Game, this book tells you they were actually WRONG!Ender is a smart kid? well NO, turns out he's \\"slow\\" compared to the title character in this book.Ender took a ragtag group of people and made them into a great 'army'? NO, the only reason he did well, was because the title character in this book chose a great army for him.Ender is a good leader? NO again, he only did well because the title character in this book was helping him behind the scenes.I could go on, but you get the gist. This book takes your prized memories of Ender from Ender's Game and tears them down.Extremely disappointing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Shodow of Ender's' Game","review":"Frankly, Ender's Shadow isn't worth reading. Not only does it fail to provide the excitement and innovation of Ender's Game, but also it actually UNDERMINES the value of Ender as a character. I slogged through this book only to discover that throughout this whole saga, Ender had an \\"equal\\", a \\"smarter\\" backup that could have done exactly as well as him. A smaller, more brilliant, genetically engineered non-human who has literally, no flaws except for his stature. We all know that such a character is unexciting. Ender was great because of his tortured nature, his innate humanness, his visible thought process. Bean gives us nothing but ridicule of everyone else's stupidity. If you love Ender, or Ender's Game, do not read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Put the word ENDER in and make some $","review":"I just finished reading Enders Shadow and I have this urge to let my feelings be known...I will keep it short. It seems to me that OSC is just trying to cash in on his largest commercial success with this latest \\"Ender\\" novel. The worst part of about this is that it seems to be working. In ES there are too many times where OSC has to bend the plot points of the original book to fit his new one. We are supposed to believe that Bean was this genius who was REALLY behind a lot of Enders supposed brilliance? I am a purest and a traditionalist and an admitted admirer of Enders Game but ES has changed a lot of how I viewed EG so now I must pretend that this new Ender book (and the inevitable sequels) don't exist and that hurts. By the way, did you know that Wantnot is really the Maker not Alvin!?!?!?!?!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Sequel that eclipses the Original!","review":"Having read and enjoyed Ender's Game thoroughly in 1985, it was with a combination of hope and skepticism that I started Ender's Shadow. My hopes were surpassed. In fact, re-reading Game after having read Shadow made me feel like Shadow was the real original, and the Bean developed there was just making a few cameo appearances in Game. Mr. Card has outdone himself!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Character Growth","review":"I really enjoyed following the Ender story from a new perspective. Seeing Ender through Bean's eyes adds a new dimension to his character. Scottcard also does an excellent job developing Beans character throughout the novel. This growth and development of Bean is something that I tried to keep in mind as I developed Sarah's character inMy Name is Gary. Not only was it well written, but Ender's Shadow was the most enjoyable addition to the Ender universe since the original."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing series","review":"Love this book and the series.

I'm a longtime Card fan, so I loved this book. It's most similar to Ender's Game, which I also loved, but you don't have to have read EG to get Shadow.

I've always loved the book Enders Game and have read it a few times. I was a little bit leary of this book at first...How could it compare to Enders Game?...but it proved to be just as thought provoking and interesting. What I like most about this book is that it told a story set, for the most part, in the same place as Enders Game, but from a completely different view point. This book opens our eyes to another side of humanity...or lack there of. The struggles are to become human, rather than objective about humanity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, But not as good as Ender's Game","review":"I feel in love with Ender's Game as soon as I first read it the entire concept was so perfect. When I heard about Ender's Shadow I got it as soon as it was released, and read it before the night was over. I was frankly disappointed, while Card does suceed in making the opening incredible and I throughly enjoyed Graf I found Bean's later history...disappointing. While in Ender's Game the you got to see Valentine and Peter aswell as Ender in Ender's Shadow Card creates a \\"super\\" human out of Bean. It ruined it for me, some of the moments were good, but the entire brother thing was just a little too much cheese. I was especially disappointed by the ending, half of what made Ender's Game so good was the fact Ender could never return. It was still a great read but not nearly as good as I could have hoped."},{"rating":"2","title":"Card physically brings forth the empathy from within you!","review":"Just when I had finally accepted the fact that my favorite series of books was actually over I happen upon a preview of Ender's Shadow. The giddy feeling I had when I finished reading Ender's Game has thankfully returned! Yet again Card masterfully manages to physically bring forth the empathy and compassion from within you. We are once again allowed to see the world through young and brilliant eyes, this time through Ender's right hand man Bean. Two totally brilliant minds with two totally different starts to life. Both travel down separate paths only to end up at the same destination, the Battle School. Read the preview to Ender's Shadow and come and grow with Bean."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely annoying.","review":"When I first heard Orson Scott Card was writing another book that took place in the Ender's Game universe I was exited, to say the least. After reading the first four chapters of Ender's Shadow, attainable at the official web site of OSC, I ,almost literally, couldn't wait. Now that I've read the novel cover to cover I am thoroughly disappointed. It does not complement Ender's Game, which is my favorite book, it tries to overpower it. Although Ender's Shadow never contradicts Ender's Game, the two books often disagree.Many of the reviews that gave this book five stars were done by people who had read only the first four chapters, which were extremely good. This latest Orson Scott Card novel shows that while OSC's grasp on scientific principles has increased, his knowlage of what makes a great novel has dramaticly decreased."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I didn't read it.","review":"*Spoiler Alert* I wish this book didn't exist. By putting spotlight on Bean, Card painted Ender to be a crumpled incompetent liar. It is a complete wonder that people still followed Ender's command after that. The victory of the last battle in Battle School was Ender's, not Bean's, no matter how Card twisted it to be. What happened was Ender did not throw the match away; he came up with the win condition but let Bean worked on how to deliver it. In this book, Card yanked it all off Ender, twisted it, and gave Bean the full credit, of everything, just to make Bean important enough to have his own book. I find this unacceptable. This book destroys Ender's Game. They cannot go hand in hand. Only one of them can exist.If you already read Ender's Game, I would suggest not to read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book to any SF standard","review":"I was a bit dissapointed when Ender's Shadow came out that it was a parallel novel to Ender's Game, and not the sequel to Children of the Mind as I had secretly wished for for years!But the book turned out to be an intensive reading, incredibly addictive, and in many ways turned out to be much better than the original. OSC's ability to tell the same yet totally different story is amazing. And being able to see behind the set of Ender's story is a unique feeling, close to the feeling you get when watching the Usual Suspects' Director's Commentary on the DVD edition.Now, Orson, please tell us the rest of the Descolada story. We really can't wait any longer..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Card's best book in years!!!!","review":"This is Orson Scott Card's best book in years. I am 11, planning to graduate from high school in 2000, and I always empathized with Ender more than any other character. I liked Speaker for the Dead, Xenocide, and Children of the Mind, but they look at the world through an adult's eyes, instead of the growing, changing child prodigy I knew in Ender's Game. I always thought that Ender grew up too fast, and I wanted more books featuring him as a child. While Ender's Shadow and Bean can neeer fill Ender's shoes in my heart, they can take their place next to him. I think this is Card's best book, other than Ender's Game, and I can't wait to read the full novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Revisited but not improved","review":"I have this problem with Scott Card's children -- they read about 12 years older than they are supposed to be and it's definately the case in this work which revisits Ender Wiggin's childhood but from a very different point of view. In the notes Scott says he was originally going to open this to other authors. I think he should have. It's a not very good sequel that lacks the power of Ender's Game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good, but not his best.","review":"I read Ender's Game and absolutely loved it. I thought that Card's lastest Ender book, Ender's Shadow, would be just as good - it was not. Don't get me wrong, it was excellently written, but Bean was too unbelievably smart. I guess my imagination just couldn't stretch that far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"I gotta say the best way to read this is after you read the rest of the series all the way to Children of the Mind. It's so great to read all of those and then to come back and read Ender's Shadow.

It is hard to say if I like it better than Ender's Game, also by Orson Scott Card. Ender's Shadow is more of a tag along to the first book, it really just shows another point of view in the same situation. In this book it tells of Bean's struggles when he lived in Rotterdam, and because Bean was so little he had to use tactics, which caught the eyes of the battle school recruits. Bean was eyed by the recruits and then was brought up to battle school where he first met Ender. He and Ender became good friends and Bean was Ender's's right hand. It was different from the first book, this book seemed, to me, to have more feeling, deepness, and more realness to it. Ender's seemed to not know how to feel and Bean wore his emotions more on his sleeve, that's why I think I liked Bean better than Ender's sometimes. Bean was a little boy who packed a big punch, so to speak, and he was a little ruffian and I really enjoyed reading this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why Won't They Make It Unabridged?","review":"Ender's Game is my favorite book and Ender's Shadow is one of my favorites. I was real excited to see this audio book and picked it up the first chance I had.The reader does a fantastic job, but there are so many key elements of the novell that are missing. If you haven't read Ender's Shadow, or even worst... haven't read or listened to Ender's Game (the novel, not the short story) then there will be a lot of things you don't understand.I picked this because I loved the novel and thought I might listen to it from time to time (I've read Ender's Game twice and loved listening to the audio book as well) but I wish that they would produce an unabridged version as well.Other than that, I just love this adaption and am glad I've added the audio version to my collection (I spend a lot of time in my car).

This follows the same story, and takes place during the same time period, but it is told from the perspective of Bean, the best soldier in Ender's Dragon Army. It tells of his childhood in a place called Rotterdam, and reveals his true origins. Pick this one up if you can."},{"rating":"2","title":"a remarkable tale","review":"This book is great for the average Sci-Fi fan. It's got your basic setting in a futuristic space station where kids are training to fight an alien invasion. The main character of this book is incredible. He's just a small boy with extraordinary intelligence. It's great to see him overcome many obstacles that are seemingly insurmountable. His hardships may make you cringe and feel sorry for him, but in the end, like all good books, he comes out basically unscathed. I recommend this book along with the rest of the Ender Series; especially because they all tie in together with each other, and they make for a superb story."},{"rating":"2","title":"A parallel book, but...","review":"...it's even better than Ender's Game.

I think in Ender's Shadow, Card really gets into the mind set of a child Bean's age. You might think it immature, but if you really think about it, its just what a child that age would think.

It relates the same events of Ender's Game, but from the point of view of Bean. Ender's Shadow begins when Bean is four years old and barely surviving on the street. It tell of his struggle to survive and then his triumph in being accepted to Battle School. This novel has some new surprises in it. Surprises that I thought were unbelieveable. The book itself is a good read, however, it is not as good as Ender's Game. Some of the revelations are just too much in the sense that you almost feel contempt for Ender and shout to yourself, \\"Why doesn't he see this? Why is he letting himself be manipulated by Bean?\\". At least I did! I just did not accept or want to accept what Card was telling us about Bean. I have been looking forward to this novel for months and I can tell you that I was disappointed!

I'm addressing the AUDIO CD. The male voices are great - easy to understand and hear. The female voice I am surprised that she sounds like she's falling asleep (best way to describe it is that she \\"drones on\\") while she is portraying the main female character. When she switches to other voices as the different characters speak, she sounds fine and has talent to keep those voices consistent with each character. So why is she trying to put us to sleep during the majority of her portion of speaking?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Please end the Ender series!","review":"This book is merely another in a \\"series\\" of examples why some authors should immediately stop writing sequels -- at least while they're still behind.

This book is about a boy named bean and his travels where he meats his brother Nikolia that he meats his in battle school. How he defeats a bully Achilles.It is very good . It is about how he becomes a military genius and helps Ender. Then he goes home to his true parents the Delphikis."},{"rating":"1","title":"You would probably enjoy rereading Ender's Game More","review":"Here is the down and dirty on Ender's Shadow....It is a complete re-hash of Ender's Game told through the eyes of Bean. Card does start the book by imparting previously unknown information about Bean and his life leading up to battle school, but other than that, you would probably enjoy a re-read of Ender's Game more. This book was an absolute snooze to read, one wonders how Card could stand to write it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good job re-writing the same book twice!!!","review":"How Bean got to the streets is a little unbelievable but I found the story with Poke and Achilles very interesting. After that, Card does a wonderful job re-telling the same story without re-telling the same story. It was fun to read eventhough I already knew the outcome."},{"rating":"2","title":"for those that couldn't get enough of Ender's game","review":"While not necessarily in the brilliant category of Ender's Game, Ender's shadow is nonetheless a wonderfully entertaining read.

I was able to put it down a couple of times. Didn't want to, but I was able to, whereas with \\"Ender's Game,\\" I was literally unable to put it down.The book isn't as morally significant as \\"Ender's Game\\", and the character of Bean isn't someone that inspires a great deal of empathy or caring like Ender is, but I'm glad I read it. I plan now to go back and re-read \\"Ender's Game\\" and use the new perspectives that \\"Ender's Shadow\\" provides.One technical \\"flaw\\" (at least, according to my tastes), in the \\"teasers\\" to each chapter (where Card writes conversations between the adults), I was only able to know who the adults were about half the time.

This is the first Cobham album I've heard that eschews the popping-bass funk groove in favor of an all-acoustic, traditional jazz set, with mixed results. This is a quartet with piano, acoustic bass and saxophone playing rather unmemorable riffs over Cobham's powerful drumming. It's worth noting that only two of the selections are written by Cobham; you can tell right away which ones they are. The first time I played this album I heard a lot of things I liked; the next morning, when I played it a second time, it seemed meandering and undistinguished. Go figure. Probably not the best choice for those unfamiliar with Cobham's work, who would probably be best served by checking out his sessions with Miles Davis and John McLaughlin first."},{"rating":"2","title":"A \\"must have\\" for Cobham collectors","review":"For those who love Billy Cobham, it doesn't really matter what he does, \\"we have to have it\\" but with the \\"Nordic\\" release, Billy presents himself in a more acoustic environment that commands a delicacy his listeners may be surprised by. The group and he are presented wonderfully. For more mainstream jazz lovers and us hardcore Billy fans, all will be glad to hear Billy on this recording."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoyed at work","review":"I absolutely LOVE the original Cranium game, so I figured I'd just have to have one for all my silly co-workers to play too.I was hugely disappointed when I found out that the game answers are NOT printed on the back of the card, instead you must log onto the Internet to get answers.What a time consuming annoying thing!Forget it if you don't have Internet access in your office.I think there should be a list of answers to print out somewhere and take with you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cosmo Discontinued - Answers no longer available","review":"Just something to be aware of: when Hasbro bought Cranium earlier this year, they took down [...] website and with it the answers to all the questions. So, while it's still usable, it's a little frustrating that you can no longer get the answers if everyone in your office is stumped.That said, I really like this game and have been through a number of answer packets over the years.

The memory sticks are not the best value in compact digital media (smartmedia flash memory cards are). These sticks also cannot be read directly unless you buy an adapter or use a slow serial interface. Exception being some newer Sony computer systems can read them. I knock off a star from the rating for their omission of i.Link and choosing a more expensive digital storage medium.

Still, this work is threadbare on the facts. For example, they note that he wrote \\"Sharazad\\" (sp?) and they play a 3-minute clip of it, but that's all.Too many docs on entertainers become boring slide lectures. The creators here try to have movement. For example, they show photos of Rimsky's relatives but they move the camera from the wall where they hang to a busy outside scene. Old operas are shown with singing and moving performers.This may keep your interests, but you won't learn much. That's for sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as realistic as it thinks","review":"Sweetwater and Gunslinger are the cllsigns of the crew of an F-14 fighter which was, when this book came out, the US Navy's top interceptor. While two-man aircews should be enough to generate the structure around which can be built a great aviation novel (like \\"Flight of the Intruder\\"), it's wasted here as we watch the two engage in the sort of antics popularized in Top Gun while the top brass watches powerless, and aged admirals watch wishing they could be young nuggets again. Much of the novel is episodic, and not written very well, following the boys as their aircraft carrier charts the expected hostile waters, but we never feel as is we are actually there. The airplanes aren't fully realized, nor are the struggles of becoming a proficient aviator made out well enough to describe the charachters and why their superiors tolerate them. Ditch this book for anything else by Coonts."},{"rating":"1","title":"John Wayne - 10 cowboy legend movie pack","review":"While the price was OK for this product, it has 9 black & white short movies (all under an hour) and one full-length colored movie that was over an hour (McClintock).

The quality looked like VCR copies that had been burned onto a DVD on a home machine, there was no clean-up - I can only stress the poor quality of the video itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Western without blood or bullet holes","review":"It is good only if you consider yourself a real true fan of the genre and/or an admirer of John Wayne.It disappointed me because the storylines are genuinely naive, the dialogs are blunt and colorless, the scenarios are artificial to a point they don't make an effort to conceal the many flops and special de-effects. The actors looked like they were in the very start of their careers, no drama nor truthfulness in their acting, no blood, no violence, no bullet holes.You could really use your money in something more challenging, like cheesecake and popcorn for your next flick."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Book on Everyday Language","review":"This is a book which has a funny approach on everyday language.

I got a chance to see him perform last year in the Chicagoland area and just recently at Fitzgerald's Music Festival. I tell you he blew everyone away. He was by far the best performer that played that night. No one even else came close. He is such a talent. This man can basically do anything with his acoustic guitar. I tell you when you hear him play his guitar you will be amazed. You will sit there in awe. Both his albums (1st and Repair and Mirror) give you a taste of his talent, but nothing beats seeing him perform live. (Both cd's are enhanced so that you can see videos of him performing live.) Trust me, both albums are phenomenal!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Awesome...Do yourself a favor and listen to this!","review":"All the words have been used...Rich Voice, blazing guitar, outstanding rythem.I was fortunate to catch Monte, Chris and Phil on Austin City Limits, otherwise, being here in the mountains of VA I probably would not have heard of him so soon. If you caught the show (ACL) and thought that was good, just wait 'till you hear the CD. The things Monte can do with an old Alvarez acoustic guitar will leave you speechless. This is one of the few CDs in my collection that I wont skip a track or two on.Chris Maresh plays bass here and he is also a world class musician, in my opinion. I will be looking up his compilations. He and drummer Phil Bass lay out an outstanding rythem that will leave your foot patting long after the music has been turned off. \\"Mirror\\" is going to leave a mark on a lot of folks."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is also a Desert Island Disc!","review":"This is one of my all time favorite CDs. I was not a fan of acoustic music when my brother first told me to check out Monte back in '99. Monte's guitar virtuosity bridged that gap for me.I got \\"1st and Repair\\" first, so it is a sentimental favorite, but \\"Mirror\\" is probably his best disc. There are songs on \\"1st and Repair\\" that I'd consider my favorites of Monte's, but \\"Mirror\\" is probably a more consistent release.

It took me almost 5 minutes of just staring before it actually registered that this guy gets all those notes, slaps, thumps and unique sounds out of an acoustic guitar! I HAD to have the CD and I subsequently bought both this one and his earlier recording \\"1st and Repair\\". These are both great recordings, but they actually pale in comparison to his live performances.If you have an appreciation for guitar, acoustic or electric, Monte Montgomery's talent is truly on a level with these greats. Do yourself a favor and buy this, no buy both, CDs and get out to see a live show."},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally Awe Struck!","review":"I bought Monte Montgomery's disc, Mirror, because I was already a satisfied owner of his first disc, 1st and Repair. On this disc, he has done nothing to dispell the notion that he is simply the greatest acoustic guitar player currently living in America.

I especially loved \\"Hoping That You'd Slow Down\\", \\"Mirror\\", \\"I Know You By Heart\\"....why should I go on....... I love them all! \\"When Will I\\" is another tour-de-force, almost as exciting as \\"Love Come's Knockin'\\" from his 1st disc.One question begs an answer: Will the masses ever discover this exceptionally talented artist, or will he remain our little secret?Buy this disc!

Unfortunately, the story usually ends the same way, with the bear dead, but it is nice to read about a few bruins beating the overwhelming odds for a while. Many of the areas where these bears had their careers have since exterminated the grizzly, a fact which did not escape the author in the 1960's. Hubbard was ahead of his time in calling for controls on grizzly hunting and closed seasons, as he saw the looming specter of extinction before many others."},{"rating":"1","title":"I give it a 'D'","review":"I give the graphic novel \\"30 Days of Night\\" a 'D'. It was too short and not enough suspense (it's not scary if you just go straight to the gore) and not enough character development. The artwork was blurry and inconsistent. Because there wasn't enough character development I never sympathized with the characters. In this rare case, I think the movie adaptation was better than the original graphic novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful and Ghastly.","review":"Ben Templesmith has a wonderfully unique style that is both Disgusting and cartoonish at the same time.

The premise alone is chock full of so much potential that it's almost remarkable that is hasn't been done before. While the story is cleanly and briskly plotted, the middle act (the town of Barrow under siege) should have been further fleshed out. Due to its relatively short length, it seems as if the book comes to a somewhat abrupt halt at the end but even with this put aside, the book is still very much worth your reading time with a great storyline and equally remarkable artwork by Ben Templesmith."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Graphic Novel/Comic Book","review":"Normally, I don't read comic books, but I decided I'd give this one a try because I read about it in the July issue of \\"Fangoria.\\"Ben Templesmith has beautifully drawn grim and graphic depictions of vampires. Most of the artwork is kind of abstract, so it sets a great creepy feeling to the book. Steve Niles wrote this so that it reads exactly like a horror movie. If you like horror movies or comic books, then you should pick this up right now and look out for the movie based on this graphic novel/comic book."},{"rating":"1","title":"great art and idea, weak storytelling","review":"After hearing great things about this book from so many people I expected a lot more. The story isn't bad, the book is just too short to tell it (around 80 pages). The characters are pretty one dimensional and I never really cared whether they lived or died. If they would have doubled the length and developed the characters more it might have been worthy of all the praise. As it is, it's pretty dissapointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great concept. Poor art.","review":"It was hard to picture the action at times because the art waspoor. However, the plot was compelling with excellent showsof fear and desperation. Very emotional but a bit rushed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The story is cliche ridden, the characters are flat and the artwork is murky. It's like something put together by talented highschool kids."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring and cliched....","review":"i don't know why this book gets such high ratings. it's just another average horror movie put onto paper. templesmith's art is interesting though.... for about 3 pages. after that, it just gets old. character dialouge is bland and reactions to \\"scary\\" situations are cliche. characters aren't given any depth and the story doesn't really focus on anything in particular. overall it's a boring, anti-climatic read with a cliche plot twist. weak beans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why the hype?","review":"Ok, first of all i love vampires. but this?Steve Niles comes up with an interesting concept here, with a town with 30 days of night, but the actual story reads like a high school short story collection entry. He seemed so wrapped up in the concept that he had no idea how to end the story. You can see how he starts off explaining in a huge info dump at the beginning of the story. This is prime example of the \\"Telling, not showing\\" which goes against most creative writing paradigms. Now, that being said, the story's weakest section is the ending. He just seemed to end it, with many loose ends and plot holes.The artwork was interesting though. I will not go so far as to say i liked it, because it was too obscured and foggy for my taste, but i can understand the artist's intent.This was just a book that was hard to keep in my hands, rather than hard to put down.And now they are making a movie? there is hope for it, but they better not stay exact to the story of this comic book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most Disappointing Book of the Year","review":"The plot is little more than a rehashed \\"Night of the Living Dead,\\" with the main difference ostensibly being that it is supposed to take place over the space of a whole month. Unfortunately, the book is poorly paced and, if not for the title, you would think the story took place over the space of a few hours. Key scenes are glossed over or summarized by the narration, making this read like an excerpt, not a full book,. As for characters, only the sheriff is given a backstory that makes him seem like anything other than \\"vampire fodder.\\" Skip this book and wait for the promised movie. Hopefully, a new scriptwriter will cure the flaws."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looked cool, fell flat","review":"This is one of the few graphic novels that will actually have to have the plot filled out in order for it to be made into a film. It goes by so fast you're left feeling that you've read a synopsis of a much better, larger story. The artwork is dark and interesting but sometimes so murky that I had trouble distinguishing who I was looking at and who was attacking whom. I'm curious to see what the sequel will hold."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Hype is DEAD ON!","review":"I am so happy that I ordered this book. Even living in Chicago I could not find the original comics to \\"30 Days of Night\\" so I jumped at the chance to order the TPB. It is amazing! An awsome story mixed with fantastic art and a couple of cool surprises. Spend the 20 bucks and read this thing over and over. Steve Niles and Ben Templesmith have created a true horror classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great art. Good start.","review":"One of the opening scenes involves a dreary looking police car and its flashing lights. That frame alone is enough to set the stage. I wasn't exactly thrilled with the way faces were treated on some of the subjects. But generally this a great start to a downright scary looking series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some plus, some minue","review":"I got this book with the expectation of being whelmed. That didn't happen. The premise is great, the artwork interesting...but, overall, I was left feeling pretty ho-hum about the whole thing. The story is rushed, in an attempt to create suspense (at least I hope that's the reason); but there isn't any depth to it and, although I don't mind that two of the characters have no apparent meaning in the story development (a lot of time/space is wasted to get on of them in postition to provide the vampires with an alibi), I do mind what happens in the climax when the sherrif finds himself able to destroy the vampires simply because he 'finds his rhythm'. It's difficult to recommend this book. It wasn't bad, it just wasn't that notable either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrid","review":"30 Days of Night? Try 30 minutes... That's how long it took me to read the thing and that's how long I thought the story took in real time. The writing is awful. The first scene with the sun setting made me want to puke because it was obviously trying to get the reader to care about the two main characters, but ends up making you feel indifferent.The plot is just re-hashed Hollywood horror from George Romero to Dracula movies. Scary? Not even close. While the art seems to be well done it does not lend it self to story-telling at all. I was straining my eyes looking at the panels trying figure out what just happened and who it happened to.I heard they were making a movie out of this mess. They would be best advised to pull the plug on it now."},{"rating":"1","title":"is this for 12yr olds??","review":"I was in the library today and happened to notice a book in the young adults section called \\"30 days of night.\\" The library staff person on duty told me the young adults section was for 13-18 yr olds and that this book was targeted toward the 12-14 yr old range. I flipped through the book and was shocked at the level of graphic violence and dialog. I opened to a random page and saw the \\"F\\" word. The scenes of blood and gore were disturbing.I'm 29 yrs old and I like vampire stories in general. I'm not against the library having this book but I was stunned to find that this book was openly available to kids under 17. If the pictures in the book were on film instead of in print it would easily get an R rating.

And this book was on printing but not released yet. I thought \\"...even better, I am going to get the latest advise...\\" When I got the book, I found that Scoblete only wrote the Foreword.The book reminds me one of those yellow Idiot Guides to___ books. Joking around, instead being serious and to the point. And even those guides, after all, give you good information.There is not any advise that would help to play better at slot machines. Not even information about what machines are better, how to play then, no strategies. Nothing.

This guy could be Michael Moore's roommate. Everything about it was a waste of time and not to mention the money. What kind of desperate loser writes a book about playing slot machines to expound tired liberal beliefs. Worse, the slot information is in rehashed \\"duh\\" territory you can find anywhere. All things considered, this could be the worst book ever written about slot playing in the history of gaming. Reading and realizing you spent money for this book is akin to watching your last coin hit two red sevens and a blank."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and informative book","review":"This book by Frank Legato is a fun and informative book about slot machines and Legato's experiences in the casinos of America.

I paid more than that. This is not an honest company."},{"rating":"1","title":"why write a book that doesn't matter","review":"I think that there are so many better books out there, that one would be wasting their time with this piece of flop. This book has no interesting elements and merely serves as a vehicle for Kingsolver to express some of her social and political morals. You can write a newspaper article about Native American abotions and have it say the same exact thing, so why bother writing a whole book? Perhaps because people think you're smart and you get paid to do it. Perhaps because you're too stupid to know any better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stinks worst than a skunk!","review":"I think this book was pretty bad. There was many unrealistic situations and the book was boring. The main conflict in the book is dragged all the way to the end of the book and it is very sloppy how it is 'finished'. I think the only thing this book is good for is being a paperweight, a wedge, and also coaster."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big disappointment...","review":"This book was on my list of required reading for my English class...however, I think it was a huge let-down.

Go to Arizona and let her know yourself, you'll feel better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overdone, trite -- disappointing","review":"The title pretty much says it all. I enjoyed \\"Bean Trees\\" enough that I was pleased to find a sequel. What a disappointment! I found the plot twists unbelievable and most of the characters trite.What really bothered me was the book seemed to be a hymn to political correctness. There seemed to be a representative of virtually every possible type of person, whether their characters were believable or not. I grew truly disgusted with Taylor's brief relationship with the man in the wheelchair -- that seemed especially tokenistic. I have no problem with any of these things in a book, but they have to be woven in to the plot properly, not just pulled out of a hat and arranged.Overall, read \\"Animal Dreams\\" if you want Kingsolver, not this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Historically inaccurate","review":"I was disappointed in the book because of its many historical inacuracies and its distortion of current Cherokee life and culture.Having grown up and lived my whole life (68 years) in Eastern Oklahoma, known many Cherokees, and spent many years studying their history and culture, I found the book full of disappointing stereotypes. I expected better from Kingsolver, especially since the Cherokees are among the most thoroughly researched and written about of the Native Americans.The story should be regarded as simply a fairy tale with no relationship to real life.I give it two stars only because Kingsolver tells a good story even when it is just a fairy tale."},{"rating":"2","title":"great follow-up","review":"Although I found this book to be great alone, it is a better follow-up to The Bean Trees.....Both books make great, easy reads...If you're looking for a book to just get lost in, these are it."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book was very thought provoking and intense.","review":"I am 15 years old. I read both \\"The Bean Trees\\" and it's sequel \\"Pigs in Heaven\\" for a book report for my English class. I am currently working on dialectical journals for both. Barbara Kingsolver sprinkles her text with Kentucky dialect and never slowed the story down. I'm having a hard time trying to figure out the peak of action. Her books aren't exactly action packed, but they do make the reader think about themselves and the world around them. I noticed that her books are very autobiographical. She has interwoven somesome of her life experiences into the stories. I recommend these books to anyone who is interested inNative American studies, or anyone looking for a good read on a rainy day (or any day for that matter)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A strong, sweet story.","review":"I loved this book. The plot was serpentine without beingintricate. I love plot surprises and this book had a fewgood ones. The characters were developed perfectly; vivid,real, and interesting. The story educated me; it showcasedAmerican Indian family values and the hardships ofsingle parenthood.But, the thing I like most is the author'sstyle. Some authors have the gift of turning a phrasethat resonates with the reader on multiple levels.Ms. Kingsolver has that gift and it increased my enjoymenttenfold of her already excellent story.This was the first book by Kingsolver that I have read;I will definitely seek her out in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointed","review":"Pigs in Heaven was the first Kingsolver novel I read, and I was disapointed. Although the first couple chapters pulled me in, the development of the plot and characters seemed contrived, unrealistic and flat. Turtle was an exception -- I thought her interesting and better developed than the other characters. The plot kept me off guard, and didn't seem to flow naturally and the conclusion, although I love happy endings, seemed unrealistic and abrupt."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pigs in Heaven: a full-hearted marvel","review":"Kingsolver is an excellant author!

It was very enjoyable, and I hope that there will be yet another book about Taylor & Turtle."},{"rating":"2","title":"I enjoyed this unique Cherokee perspective on family.","review":"I appreciate the clarity of Ms. Kingsolver's writing. This book raises interesting questions about community and family, and the line that exists, or doesn't exist, between the two."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Heavenly Mother-Daughter Relationship","review":"Pigs in Heaven was an interesting book. At times it was slow, but for the most part Kingsolver was able to keep her readers' attention. Overall, I liked the book. I felt that Taylor and Turtle's relationship was a very solid mother-daughter relationship that I hope to have with my mother one day. I felt that the trust between Alice and Taylor was also a very crucial part of the book. Without that, Taylor may have been on the run forever, while only hurting bot herself and Turtle in doing so. I also found Cash's love of Alice to be something very special, something that Alice seemed to be longing for for more years than I can imagine. This gave me a comfort in knowing that while separated from Taylor, even if for only a few short months a year, that Turtle would be safe and loved unconditionally. In the end, I found Pigs in Heaven to be an excellent example of love and strength that everyone should have the opportunity to experience at least once in a lifetime."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magnificent!","review":"This was a required summer assignment for my junior year of high school, and I enjoyed every minute of it. Taylor and Turtle are memorable characters they remind readers what makes a family: not genes and chromosomes, but the willingness to give 110% to shaping a young life. Barbara Kingsolver is an amazing writer and I predict that her name will be among the greatest in the American literary canon. Everyone should themselves a favor and buy one of her books!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth It","review":"When I began reading the book, I was a feeling a little disappointed that it just couldn't reproduce the perfection of The Bean Trees (admittedly a tough task). But for everyone who fell in love with Taylor and Turtle and wished the Bean Trees would never end, this is a wonderful continuation after all. Kingsolver does introduce a rather mind-boggling number of characters this time around, which slows the novel down in the middle, but I'd advise any reader to stick with it! I've always been interested in Native American families, and the later chapters in particular give a taste of life and people on a reservation that I doubt you could receive anywhere else, short of visiting one--It was magical and satisfying. The development of Alice, Taylor's mother, who was only given brief lines in the last book, was another incredible, enjoyable accomplishment by Kingsolver. If you read The Bean Trees--read Pigs in Heaven."},{"rating":"1","title":"It Could have Been Better-I'm Not Sure about Kingsolver!","review":"After reading this sequel to The Bean Trees, I found it a bit better, but still, it bored me. I just don't think I care for Kingsolver's style of writing.Taylor's daughter Turtle was adopted illegally and the adversary, a female attorney Annawake, wants to contest the adoption, and put Turtle back with her indian blood kin where she feels she belongs.The whole story focuses on this issue, and I just found it monotonous to say the least. There are other more worthwhile books to read for sure!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of precious time...","review":"I agree with the customer who thought this book was under developed and thought the characters were one demensional! I felt so cheated by sticking through with this book. It read like a ridiculous soap opera - with events happening that were so contrived and unrealistic. I even think that the writing was below par - pure dribble."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is better read if your a female","review":"I felt this book was decent for the most part. Being a male reader I had a difficult time reading Kingsolver constantly trash men, which is one of her big themes in this book. Unless your a good interpretive reader, I suggest you skip this one. Kingsolver uses alot of metaphors and unless you are able to connect and understand them you won't get the full aspect of the book. I suggest that only women buy this book, since men will be disgusted with Kingsolvers continuous male bashing. Not only that but this has no plot whatsoever, its all relationship and dialogue, Another words, skip this novel and choose something a little more interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pigs in Heaven not very heavenly","review":"Pigs in Heaven starts out well, but then we get dragged through the emotional mud of 2 women who can't relate to others in a healthy way. As the reader, I couldn't relate to or sympathize with either charachter. Kingsolver deals with Indian American issues as they pertain to adotion and slams everyone from adoptive parents to Mormons in the process! She tries to tie it all together with a happy ending that is far-fetched and just a little too easy. She wants to tackle major social issues and then turn it in to a happily-ever-after and I just didn't buy it. Not one of her better books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unrealistic Characters","review":"I was fairly disappointed by \\"Pigs In Heaven.\\" I was expecting much deeper writing, rather than the simplistic, primative style that Kingsolver adopts for this novel. Furthermore, I found the characters far too ideal; they were very unrealistic. It seemed as though Kingsolver had a very good plot and well drawn characters going for her until she decided to round off the corners and sand everything down. The book also came to a close far too neatly for my taste."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, But Possibly Convenient","review":"I liked this sequel to \\"The Bean Trees\\" very much. I thought Taylor's dilemma was heart-wrenching and that the outcome would be devastating. However, a convenient relationship ends up saving the day. This made me feel good for Taylor, but it also made me feel that such an outcome was contrived for the sake of a satisfying ending. I still give this book 4 stars because the writing is powerful and the dilemma gripping."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reading it was a long but an enjoyable experience.","review":"Barbara Kingsolver's novel, Pigs in Heaven, ia great work that gives people a sense of tribal allegiance, and culture. However, it also shows that being true to the law or one's own culture cancan disturb one's conscience in other situations. This book also expresses how comforting and emotionally healing a family can be. It creates a realistic outlook on how one woman's loyalty to her tribe can threaten the family life of another person. The way Kingsolver makes everything come together, finalizing the book, shows how optimistic she is. Clearly, this book contains interesting situations which keep the reader absorbed in the reading. This is definitely a quality of well written work."},{"rating":"2","title":"deeper than expected","review":"This book is fast and breezy reading, but it makes you think seriously about identity and family. I enjoyed it a lot. However, I did not find the book as emotionally vivid as _The Bean Trees_."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kingsolver books","review":"Found this, and all Kingsolver books, interesting from cover to cover. All completely different. Warning: can't stop reading until the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sequel to 'The Bean Trees'","review":"This book is a sequel to 'The Bean Trees'. It is a good book, not great, but satisfying.Turtle is a young girl and the Cherokee Nation finds out that she's been adopted il-legally by Taylor.The book politicizes about communal/tribal love and rights vs. the rights of adoptiveparents or families of choice. Who decides what is best for a child or shat are the mostimportant values? At one point, the age-old 'Story of Solomon' is brought in.I enjoyed this novel but not as much as 'The Bean Trees'. Taylor, Turtle, Alice and Jaxare well characterized. Annawake, the politicized Cherokee attorney, is never fullydeveloped. She is more a symbol than a person I could empathize with or feel likeI actually knew."},{"rating":"1","title":"Try Another","review":"This is my first Kingsolver novel and frankly, I was not impressed. Though it is well-written, it did not hold my attention. Unrealistic characers, contrived plot, and comical situations made me struggle to finish it. I'll have to try another book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very unrealistic storyline, and downhill from there","review":"With 250+ millions of human beings in the whole US of A, what a fortuitous coincidence that all these people are connected via cousin Sugar. Unbelievable. And then how convenient that Alice and Cash fall for each other! There are supermarket paperback romances with sturdier storylines! I enjoyed the moral questions that Kingsolver raises, but the vehicle to express these issues is quite poor. I think _Animal Dreams_ is a million times better, and _The Poisonwood Bible_ a trillion times better."},{"rating":"2","title":"impressed","review":"The first time I read The Bean Trees I was immediately attached to the young Cherokee, Turtle. I admit that I was hesitant to read Pigs in Heaven. I didn't want to be disappointed. After reading it I was relieved, while it is not as good as The Bean Trees, Pigs in Heaven did not let me down. It kept me attached to Turtle and her interactions and relationships between others. If you have read The Bean Trees and found yourself completely moved by it, I would recommend you to continue your reading through Pigs in Heaven. Nothing is ever as good as the first, but Kingsolver impressed me by writing a sequel that was truly impressive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific read; a must-have for Kingsolver fans","review":"I read this after loving The Poisonwood Bible and Prodigal Summer. Only after finishing it did I learn it was a sequel to The Bean Trees. I enjoyed it as a stand-alone work, so I'm interested to go and get the backstory. They certainly don't need to be read in sequence to be meaningful, though.Kingsolver amazes me with her diverse settings and topics. The first two novels I read were set in Africa and Appalachia, respectively. Here is yet another setting--the southwest, and yet another culture--Native American. She doesn't repeat themes or settings as an author, and I admire her for that.The story is told so well that I mimicked all the emotions of the main character, Taylor. She and I both came to trust one character in the story, and when she betrayed Turtle and Taylor, my heart was ripped right out along with Taylor's.This book has cemented Kingsolver as one of my favorite authors, and I look forward to exploring more of her works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"The story educates about a culture at times often forgotten. The conflict between two cultures is overwhelming and the history of a people, compelling."},{"rating":"1","title":"interesting info on Cherokee Nation but writing labored","review":"the author tried too hard to be a clever writer and it came across as a labored style; the story itself was somewhat unrealistic but I did enjoy learning about the life style of the Cherokee Nation in Oklahoma, especially since I had lived in Atlanta and heard about the Cherokee's forced deportation"},{"rating":"1","title":"An excellent example of a completely over-rated book...","review":"Barbara Kingsolver's book is noble in the fact that she tries to shed light on an important social issue, but it was simplistically written. Metaphors and smilies are beautiful when well written, but Mrs. Kingsolver abuses and misuses them. Its unfortunate that the author wrote this book at the expense of an issue like the Indian Child Welfare Act."},{"rating":"2","title":"A brillinat novel about the West","review":"Barbara Kingsolver is my favorite author (just try her essays) and this is her finest book. Although the story is fiction, Kingsolver delves into some very hard questions for those of us in this country: do we leave children in potential poverty with their culture and family, or do we \\"save\\" them into a new, white culture? Can there be only one answer?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Strayed Charm","review":"His third release on the Numa label, Strange Charm pretty much follows in the tradition of The Fury. Relentless drum programs, swirling synths, silky-smooth female backing vocals, and some well-placed brass and lead guitar. But what a departure from the dark and broody Numan we have come to know and love! Highlights here include the opening track, My Breathing, complete with Middle-Eastern mid-section, and the haunting, percussive ballad, This is love. Considering it was conceived in 1986, it still sounds very contemporary - the ultimate test of any artist s work."},{"rating":"1","title":"reallly crappy scissors","review":"I thought since they were \\"scotch\\" brand scissors they'd be at least acceptable for wrapping presents, instead they stick and are hard to open and close.

Therefore I don't see the need to rehash on that. However, unfortunately, I didn't find this novel as appealing as the others.It took me almost two weeks to finish this book. That was mainly because I couldn't get into it and the first 2/3 of the book was prolonged with empty chattering and had me questioning the purpose of it all. When the plot finally developed towards the end it was rather rushed and the overall tone of the book had sort of a fairy-tale theme - \\"Once upon a time...and they all lived happily ever after\\".I was greatly disappointed with the book. I have read other Christian-based novels by Jacquelin and this is definitely not her best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I was hoping this book would get better but it never did.

But when you add the layers of lessons about love and loss, of releasing assumptions and examining beliefs, of relatives and relationships, of beauty and faith and trust, this is a work which speaks to us us over-and-over again with humor and honesty.Hands-down, this is the best book I've read this year, fact or fiction. As soon as I finish this review, I'm going to purchase copies to give away to friends and family... and I don't do that often. Then, I'm going to read it again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just for cat people","review":"I picked up this book by accident and found it addressed two of the issues that are important to me - relationship with my father and emotional eating. And the author addresses both very well, with care, sensitivity, non judgement and very little self pity. How she comes to terms with her father - for who he is, just a human whom she loves and with a love that is beyond traditional roles and expectations, is truly remarkable and a great practical lesson for those of us struggling with those very human fathers - not abusive, not particularly bad or cruel - and yet selfish, small minded and all said and done, are fathers anyway.I am not a definitely not a cat person but a 20lb furry lovable feline does sound rather tempting - not to mention the life he had with all those holistic treatments and counsellors and stuff. I would not mind that kind of a life myself!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"Great quality, use it every day. It is cute and practical.

Its follows some gay guys as they go to a circuit party in Florida. Its great at showing how some guys live their lives. The best thing I liked about the movie is how it is all \\"real\\" and nothing was staged. It also has great video quality, and great editing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Joy and dark side of circuit parties","review":"\\"When Boys Fly\\" gives you the real, inside look at circuit parties through the eyes of several attendees. It captures the joy and release many feel at the parties while not shying away from those who take things too far. Perhaps too much emphasis was placed on the latter and it ends on a melancholy note but overall it was still excellent. The best look at circuit culture I've seen on film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Play Value!","review":"It was fun to put together (if you can \\"read\\" pictures) and more fun to watch my grandson play with.

I just have two complaints: 1) There is an assumption that heavy kids are heavy because they eat junk food and don't exercise. I'm living with a heavy kid who rarely eats junk food and has always exercised a lot. This message is frustrating, to say the least. 2) The title is a problem. My daughter is already hyper-sensitive about her weight, were I to buy this book (I read it at the library), the title itself would confirm to her that I find her \\"fat.\\" In fact, I would purchase this book, were it not for the title because it is among the best of the books covering the subject, and I've read a number of them. I appreciate the books emphasis on physical fitness. I think a person who is physically fit has a better life and feels better in every way. Parents have an obligation to promote such well being as far as I'm concerned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Starve your kids now so they can be fat later.","review":"Another book that teaches kids that being bigger is a personal defect caused by personal weakness, and too much eating. If you just quit doing 'this' and stop doing 'that' you can be just like the other kids. Complete drivel. A waste of money. Find a book that will teach your children about the value of being different, not one that tries to scare them into starved conformity."},{"rating":"2","title":"great movie","review":"I like the actors, the music, the setting.

I'm not the only one. Do a search on Google (...) and read a ways. It seems hardly anyone is satisfied with this product. Others recommend using Weiman's or Bar Keeper's Friend. On the plus side, it does seem to clean the stainless steel surfaces well if you don't mind the streaking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magic Stainless Steel Magic Wipes","review":"Well, I think this product is great. The way I use it on my stainless steel stove is: 1. After cooking, spray 409 all over stove 2. With a soft wet cloth, wipe off grease, sauce, etc. from cooking 3. Wipe down stainless steel with a wipe 4. Polish with soft dry cloth (I cut up cloth baby diapers) The film the wipe leaves makes cleanup easy the next time you cook. Food will wipe off effortless each time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stainless Steel Magic Wipes","review":"I love this product for my new stainless steel gas stove top. My advice is: #1 You should first wipe stove top with damp sponge and remove cooked on food. After you start using the wipes, food removes easily. #2 Then you should wipe with the stainless steel wipe. #3 Then you should polish with a soft, lent free cloth. I'm very satisfied with the outcome. I give it one star short of being perfect because of the drying out of the wipes in the container after long term storage. I guess I could start putting them in a zip lock bag for long term storage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quick Clix DC-5195 a waste of money","review":"I have one word for the Argus Quick Clix, Horrible. I bought two of these cameras to give to my daughters for Christmas. The camera lists numerous features and that is what enticed me to buy them. I was looking for an inexpensive camera for general use. This camera takes horrible pictures. All of the photos had a blue tinge to them and were fuzzy. When the flash was used it was so strong that there was nothing but white out of the subject. One very irritating feature is that the camera comes on with the flash off. There is no way to change a setting to let it come on with the flash. You have to go through a series of menus to turn it on and then it takes almost 20 seconds for the flash to get ready to use. As stated when it finally does come on and you take a picture, it is so bright that the picture is useless. I would not recommend this camera to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even worth 1 star.","review":"What a pile of junk. Three full seconds pass between pushing the shutter button and when the camera actually takes the picture. If you move at all during that three seconds, the picture is a blurred mess. Even if you don't move, the pictures turn out blurry and dark. And if you use the flash, you get a lovely white picture of nothing. I can't believe they sell this thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Camera trouble","review":"I received this camera for a birthday present and I am not satisfied at all. As others have said, it takes FOREVER in between pictures and it drains through batteries very quickly. I have been having problems with the flash also.

There are much better ones you can get for a bit more money, that won't cause you problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"james nocerino","review":"the camera takes a long time between pictures to regenerate for the next picture.

Excellent quality pictures. Don't complain if there are limitations to this camera, it's less than $80.00, what do you expect? I got one for each of my little brats and am getting one for my technically challenged Mother. I'm thinking of getting some for my cousins who are all kind of clumsy, if you drop this camera, who cares? It's cheap and heck, the SD card can be easily removed and nothing happens to the pictures! Ladies like it because it's small and fits in a purse. I like it becaue it's cheap and I don't have to give my $800 Minolta to my brats who always want to take a picture.I tried the 3195, it was good but it's for children.

In addition, I found his place-setting and contextual storytelling regarding Indian society, the British mercantile economy, and the spice trades around the late 1700s to be exemplary.What I liked best about this book is Taylor's engrossing writing - he has written a compelling narrative, bringing to life each of the many characters encountered in this lost world, and effectively organizing a massive research project to collect it all together.For my money, Caliban's Shore is certainly in the top pantheon for shipwreck/seafaring tales of historical misadventure, and one I would highly recommend to anyone who enjoys this type of non-fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"What strange fate?","review":"Nothing strange here. All but a handful died.While the build-up to the wreck was interesting and well written with lots of colorful background - once the passengers find themselves on land the information dries up, the story telling falters.

Most of the material is the same as the MSDN help (very vague and nonhelpful).In particular I HATE it when books give you a ton of examples and they are all the exact same as the MSDN ones (and wrong to boot).

She calls this monkey P.J. as well and threw fits because she wanted to trade Bubby her pink monkey for the brown monkey. We get quite a kick out of it. So now \\"Skittles\\" stays in Bubby's bed and he has a hay day with him. He chews on the tail and ears just like Sissy does. I would recommend this to anyone. One draw back...The pink monkey we received has the eyes sewn on. This is a fabulous safety feature for small chilren, but the brown one has bead eyes sew in. They seem very secure, but still a potential choking hazard for smaller children if they figure out how to gnaw on them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovey Replacement Buyer Beware","review":"I had two of these on hand in case one got lost. Well...one got lost. I just ordered and received another one last week and IT'S DIFFERENT! If your kid is aware enough to notice, don't think you'll pass this one off as the original one. I checked tags and my original ones are 2002 copyright. This new one is 2009 copyright. The fur is straight and shinier. The eyes are not stitched, they're plastic ovals. Luckily, my little one was ok with the replacement, but I could have had a nightmare situation!"},{"rating":"2","title":"dangles the baby monkey","review":"this is my favourite pluffie, with its sweet cheerful smile and soft cuddly body. i have given this monkey as gifts for friends and relatives, and as baby gifts. no age limit. this toy will delight any recipient."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice looking Camera - terrible pictures","review":"This is a very nice looking camera and as a basic point and shoot (which is what I was looking for) - it has a lot of nice features. Pictures taken with the wide angle lens are pretty good - however, when taking any type of close up picture any slight hand movement will result in a blurry picture and the image stablization feature does not help this. The colors are OK - not great and on an auto setting the flash will go off anytime you are indoors - even in good light , resulting in a washed out photo. You have to manually turn off the flash which is annoying.Also, takes a long time between pressing the button and taking the picture and even longer before it is ready to take the next picture"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice","review":"This is my 3rd Olympus digital camera. I wanted a slimmer version of the great C-740 UltraZoom so I can carry it in my handbag.The optical zoom is only 5x but it has some nice features that are good for novices and more experienced photographers as well. It has an \\"online\\" guide which is great as well as tips for how to use the various settings.My only complaint is the proprietary battery pack - it comes with a recharger but unlike the C-740 UltraZoom, you cannot replace it with regular AA batteries. This is a problem when you travel in remote areas and don't have access to an electrical outlet (was 6 days in the desert in the Middle East) and you can't use regular AA batteries which you can buy at any souk.Otherwise, great little camera."},{"rating":"2","title":"First time digital user","review":"I must say I was shocked and surprised by this camera when I got it out of the box. I had no idea it would be so small. It's like the picture online is life sized. Then again it probably doesn't help me in the fact that I wear a size 15 ring and thus pretty much any thing is dwarfed in my hands.I will be honest having never used a digital camera before outside of my old HP web/digital/video cam I'm impressed. While I always thought the HP took decent shots, my new Olympus buries it in all respects. I'd be worried if it didn't.Despite what other reviewers may say, I like the ease of use for a first time duffer such as myself. I do find though that the image stabiliaztion mode is best to shoot in rather than auto. Don't know if Auto mode uses the image stabiliaztion mode but it doesn't seem like it to me. I get much better shots without it.I'll be going on vacation soon and look forward to shooting a ton of pics and to seeing the results.Hope this helps!"},{"rating":"2","title":"purchased used-reconditioned FE-200 camera","review":"This is my second FE-200 --- like the small size and wide range optical zoom. A friend dropped #1, so this replacement gives me continuity and duplicate charger, battery, and memory stick.

This camera sometimes fails to focus well in macro mode, or I need to improve my technique with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as it should have been","review":"The buttons are too small for a normal prson.

The two Steeleye Span tracks stand out as the only singles that could qualify as \\"strolling music\\". Most of the others are either far too uptempo or just plain annoying. Take Jacqui McShee's take on \\"The House Carpenter\\". He starts with a D cord but then flies into an uptempo tanga number complete with a horn arrangement and background vocals that sound like they were done by that guy who did Garfield's voice. If you want a good folk compilation of laid back singer-songwriters, I recommend \\"A Winter's Soft Gaze\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Game with 3 drawbacks","review":"Pros: This game is the COOLEST online RPG ever made, and the expansion makes it better. For those of you who already have AC, this is worth the cost. If you buy a house u will no longer have any problem switching items from character to character. Plus, only people u put on your guest list will be allowed into your house. Also, AC can get pretty boring once u have finished all the quests. This game has a whole new variety of quests and monsters.cons: this game is way too addictive. Time goes by very fast when u are playing.There is sometimes downtime when u r not able able to playTHE WORST DRAWBACK OF ALL IS LAG. Lag is when u r not able to move in the game, due to too many people playing. If u r lagging in town, sometimes u will get kiked off.

They work great. I have used them to remove a dead tree in my father-in-laws back yard, trim a bottle brush tree in my front yard and used them to cut roots to remove stumps. The best thing is that they last a long time. Almost all this trimming was done with one blade. Much more control using a sawzall than a chain saw. The biggest branch I have cut so far is about 6\\" in diameter and it went thru it like butter. As you can tell, I like these blades."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bosch RP125 Wood Cutting Blades","review":"I used these in my Dewalt cordless reciprosaw to prune some branches that were just a little too big for my loppers, but still too small to justify breaking break out my big chainsaw.They worked great for pruning and cutting up the twenty or so fresh green oak and old dead petrified branches that ranged in size up to about two or maybe three inches max diameter. The first blade out of the pack still seems almost as sharp as when new even after all the cutting I did with it.Just like a regular pruning saw, these blades are extremely sharp with viciously aggressive teeth and I find that with the combined 12-inch blade plus the length of the reciprosaw, you really have to be extra careful how you wield the tool around. At five to a pack, I think they are priced right and a good value. Overall, I'm very pleased with these blades and have no problem recommending them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great, but a bit thick and can get bound up","review":"This is a rough pruning saw blade and its best quality is that it is 12 inches long. You will easily make it through most branches and even the trunks of some medium sized bushes. My only complaint (one star deduction) is that the blade itself is fairly thick which can cause it to get bound up. Of course, the thickness makes it stronger, but that is not always a good thing.The package comes with five identical blades, and the package itself is strong enough to actually store the blades in a tool box without falling apart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Less Expensive, Good Quality","review":"These were less expensive than the Sawzall name-brand and they work amazingly well.

It appears some of these tales are simply exerpts taken from newspaper articles, with few coming from actual persons to whom tales were related. Real tales - with the build up and background creating the ghost story - could be exhilarating and even educational.I am not about to tell anyone else to avoid a book - your likes are not necessarily parallel to mine, nor mine to yours.

It's a wonderful way to make your senses just a little more paranoied. Through this book, Belzer remains funny. Which is what I like about Richard. This book is involved, and some may find it weird or inappropriate, if you can't deal with something that might take away some light form your happy-go-lucky world, don't read it. If you're going to read it, and you find it offensive, it's your own fault, you should know better than to read something that looks like you might be a little shaken by. If you're going to read it, read it because you have some interest in what Belzer is saying, or Belzer himself. I read it becasue I am a fan of his, and wanted to see what he was getting paid to ramble about, and I am very glad I did. It's an informative and really funny book, so if you're not the most content person with the government, this book would probably be a good one for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny stuff!","review":"A great read, very funny.

I Loved reading it, it makes me think that I would really love to sit down and have beer or coffee with the Belz."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasantly surprised","review":"I picked this book up not knowing what to expect. I was slightly familiar with Belzer's stand-up, but hadn't read anything he had written. I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised.I have always been slightly interested in conspiracy theories, but with my interest came a bit of embarrassment. Belzer's humor effectively dissolved my embarrassment. If I started feeling a little ridiculous when I found myself seriously considering an off the wall idea, Belzer's wit would put me at ease. The humor made it easy to tell yourself, \\"I'm not crazy, Belzer is.\\"I can't say that Belzer was able to convince me of anything, but he certainly managed to pique my curiosity. Should I decide to learn more about the theories Belzer presents, I can simply turn to the helpful bibliography of conspiracy books and resources that Belzer recommends.The bottom line - this book is a great blend of conspiracy and humor and I think it could be enjoyed by someone looking for either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bullbleep","review":"A very disappointing excursion into institutional paranoia. The Kennedy junk is particularly unfortunate. Please, other reviewers, read or reread Posner's meticulously researched, documented, and devastating book on the subject. Belzer can not do better than mutterings and innuendo of the grand conspiratorial type, e.g., Oswald's fingerprints on the murder weapon are explained by some unknown FBI agent for an unknown reason pressing his dead hand against it. (How the FBI agent gets the gun out of evidence storage, how he gets it to the corpse, how he gets it back - all this while the hands are still warm enough to print - how he does all this unobserved, and why he would do it since Hoover was the one with goods on JFK, not vicea-versa, are of course questions not addressed, let alone answered - the usual level of performance for this nonsense.)

The first day I could not get it to read right and I was discouraged, but then my 4 year old son wanted to see how it worked and I showed him, and voila, it worked. I figured out that it has to do with how you shake it. It is a gentle backwards-forwards shake with the lense away from you. Everytime now, it shows an answer, clearly. If I shake it up and down, it doesn't work. I tried it with both, and they both work. Everytime.

A ball of plastic that holds liquid would never be damn right to ask questions, infact nobody and no-one can ever or will predict questions.This toy should stay on the shelves when everyone starts to be loyal and by using this hunk-of-[...] gets you dumber every question you answer it.

The original featured 2 plastic halves plastic-welded together then machined to look spherical. That somewhat defeated the illusion of being a real 8-ball. Not that anyone could mistake a 5 inch billiard ball for the real thing. I'm guessing it was done to seal the fluid in. The new one appears to feature an additional lining within the black halves and doesn't need the same welding. The illusion is better preserved, but there's still a very clear seam running through the middle where the halves meet.Just remember not to shake it. Shaking it creates bubbles which get permanently lodged in the lettering."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish it were more accurate","review":"This is a great toy. One complaint I have is that it only seems to be accurate about half the time. Thus, I have stopped using it to make major life decisions.

I can only conclude that the authors picked out the prices at random. The only redeeming point of the book is the listing of RPG material published. But since this book's title states that it is supposed to be an official (according to whom?) price guide, and that this was the primary reason for its publishing, I conclude that this book is a total failure as a price guide that will serve no purpose for the purchaser of old RPG material.

You go into America's greatest casinos and watch the greatest players win money in a game where the house has done everything to get the edge. Well, they can't beat these people! Book is absolutely terrific."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's crappy","review":"I bought this book thinking I could learn how to set the dice. Wrong. It's more about the people the author knows about who win at craps. Save your money and don't buy this book if you want to learn to set the dice. Put it on the pass line instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a book of fiction, no mention of craps strategy","review":"This book is more of an advertisement for Scoblete's other books, his writing buddies other books, and his golden touch craps siminar. This book gives no mention of how the reader can acomplish dice control, which is the reason I bought this book. The book is rather a collection of stories. Scoblete tells of people he met playing craps but he forgets to tell how to play craps. It would not surprise me at all if the characters in the book are made up, especially the Captain, the authors ultimate craps hero. I couldn't even finish this book. It was boring and repeated the same type of uninteresting stories all the way through, and left the reader with no knowledge gained. If you are interested in a good casino book I recomend something by Avery Cardoza or a book published by his company."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Winner","review":"First of all, I really liked the background that Scoblete gives of himself, his athletic career playing against Kareem Abdul Jabbar, and his gambling adventures. The book is a personal story of one man's involvement with the greatest players in the game of craps. He himself is a great player as his diary at the end shows. Yet, there is no arrogance in the writing; the book breezes along. The characters he writes about are all fascinating, I especially loved the Lee brothers who might be making the most money from the game of craps of anyone in the country. This is one great book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Please Please Please save your money!!!","review":"A horrible hyped up infomercial for the authors training classes.

The book is livcely and funny and Scoblete introduces us to about 20 different characters who are all fascinating human beings.The book starts in 1985 with Scoblete and the Captain and goes right up to the present day. The Captain and the Arm were the greatest dice team probably in history and it seems that they won over 10 million dollars during their years of play. Today's greats are composed of Dominator, Howard \\"Rock n Roller\\" Newman, The Lee Brothers, Mr. Finesse and more, men who have dedicated their lives to winning in the casinos at a game they shouldn't be able to get an edge at.The book is really fast moving and it is hard to put down.

It is the best protection when the GPS gets dropped on hard surfaces or in the water. Your GPS will still float! Fits like a wetsuit. Comes with replaceable protective overlay for the display.

There are great characters, with whom you will fall in love or perhaps you will love to hate. It's just a fantastic story, in my humble opinion.As an aside, I was very disappointed by the quality of Disc 1, which plays like a cartoon for some reason, and it became quite distracting.

Even if you can refrain from laughing through half of the episode, you'll STILL have to watch it again because the extremely clever writers have embedded punchlines to jokes that are started LATER in the season! That's right, joke foreshadowing! It's amazing. You won't regret buying this season. It's not as good as the first two, because by this point the show had been canceled by FOX and the writers were taking every jab at the network that they could hurl past the censors.

The first 2 seasons had brilliant writing and performances. Season 2 is my personal favorite. My roommates and I have never laughed so hard. Not to mention the fact that Bateman is a cutie!

It could be that there were different writers, the lack of Henry Winkler, the under use of Jeffery Tambor, the hieghtened absurdity of the David Cross gay jokes, the horrible retard plot or maybe it was never good to begin with and we all just built it up so much we let ourselves down. It's not the latter. I recently saw season 1 again and it's amazing. Season 3 is just bad, bad, bad.

Why?It didn't begin with OJ and unfortunately will not end with his story. Dr. Hutchinson's mountain of research weaves together the compelling stories of OJ, boxer Jack Johnson, Iron Mike Tyson, tennis great Arthur Ashe, superstar Michael Jackson, basketball/baseball's Michael Jordan, and even multi-millionaire Magic Johnson. Is there no escape for a black man accused of improprieties? Dr. Hutchinson contends that neither money, fame, nor professional connects will shield a carefully protected, and long-held pristine reputation once accusations or unfounded rumors begin to fly. Dr. Hutchinson also dissects the disparity between media treatment of blacks and whites, and pinpoints how television news, newspapers, and national magazines add fuel to the smoldering tinderbox."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Book","review":"Absolutely wonderful read definitely worth owning so you can read it over and over again like I have...The way the authors calls one of the main characters by 3 different names might be a tad confusing but it makes it more realistic....not everyone is going to call someone by the same name..Nicknames and such...but if you can ignore the fact that he does then i think you might agree that on entertainment value this book is up there with the Lord of the Rings trilogy"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product for the yoga mat","review":"These wipes smell incredible.

Something that is just not done correctly by anyone else. \\"You Brought Us Here\\" presents that moodiness is a great way. This record has a particular rawness that is perfect for their style.

'Nothing' is by itself a great song- galloping beat and spacey effects. But pornmongers Club 69 only reduce it to standard 'thumpthumpthump' eighties disco mediocrity. Same with the bloated K and D mix. Vikram could have been on to something with their Eastern style instrumentation, but their mix goes nowhere. This disc reminds me of U2's recent attempt at remixes. For such respected artists, U2 could only get C+C Music Factory leftovers, a laughable tossoff from Roni Size, and the wankers from Garbage. Seems only the new metal bands and Reznor can get quality reconstructions these days. Avoid 'Nothing,' and pick up Ray of Light."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"WAY too many Club 69 mixes, in my opinion.

Celestial messengers and helpers multiplied so much so that according to Margolies they were denied a place in the Canon.This book is a gathering of Hebrew and Jewish angels from the Bible to Isaac Singer. It has brief introductions and explanations but is not a deep philosophical work, but rather a work of story and example.How to put it all together in meaning terms is I think left to the reader.

There are any number of lessons to be found and the truest simplicity in it's ultimate message -- stop looking so har.

I was overjoyed to find this available for sale.Between the special guests (like Clapton, Joss Stone, etc.) and his 'dead-on' solid band (which includes young phenom bass player, Tal Wilkenfeld), this is one of the best live performance captures of Jeff's work that I've ever had the privilege of seeing and hearing.

Yes, her techniques are different but they work, and they are very simple. I have been decorating for over 11 years and I always aim for perfection. I also teach cake decorating, and I see how the students struggle with their icing. Well, this solves the icing on the cake problem and any other issues with your decorating. Some of her techniques are different from the traditional ways that I teach my decorating classes, but I will dare to have my 10 year old daughter watch the DVD and use Darci's techniques to decorate a cake. It's that simple, and her icing works to perfection.She is fun to watch and the best part is the price.

First of all, the book is extremely wordy and very complicated to understand. You are given a ton of equations when they talk about a topic but you almost always find no use for the majority of them. I find the later chaptersespecially to be all math oriented and I found fewer and fewer real world problems to help study for the exams which had real world questions. In general, I was very dissapointed with the book.The study guide that accompanes the book is actually fairly decent and succint if not too short and they sometimes dont show important equations"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gem Trials of Utah","review":"This is a great book.

I was transported to Bali and London and caught up in the conflict of the two sisters. Through this the author provided such potential for a riviting plot I eagerly read on, only to be disappointed.

The resolution to their conflicts was anti-climatic, and the decriptive language which originally had painted such vivid pictures became what seemed to be an over use of the author's thesaurus."},{"rating":"2","title":"When The World Was Steady","review":"This was an incredibly well-written book, carefully researched, and filled with rich details which invoked in the reader the feeling of having lived through WWII with the characters in the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I have a lot of Ateco cookie cutters and they have all been shipped in nice containers and store easily.

It is written with a lot of intellectual vigour, Settis' knowledge of the subject is breathtaking, but what is by far the most impressing feature of this book is the author's ability to connect very different fields of academic research: sociology, history, philology. It is an absolute must for all students and scholars of arts, a true example how a detailed analysis of a single painting reveals to us much about the era it was painted in, as well as about the times when its meaning was attempted to be deciphered. We learn here much about the Italian Rennaisance, Giorgione and his contemporaries, but also about centuries which came after -- what they did with his paintings and how they tried to adjust their meanings to their contemporary tastes and preferences. A real diamond."},{"rating":"1","title":"over analyzing and wrong","review":"with all of the analyses offered in the book it is surprising that none of them seem right. this book's redeeming points have nothing to do with the subject. one of these points is learning how to approach a work of art that you know nothing about."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOO SMALL TO BE A GIFT","review":"I bought this heart shaped pendant with a chain for a Valentine's Day gift for one of my daughters who attends college out of town.

One example, under shish kebab (lamb) one of the ingredients is balsamic vinegar. Now this sounds good but don't sell me a book of Simply Armenian recieps when balsamic vinegar as an ingredient is not even in the ethnic cooking picture.

The recipes appear very simple and the ingredients very healthy. (I don't buy cookbooks often now but I wanted to make the five dishes I bought from them at the farmer's market.)

The tray certainly accommodates that many cards and keeps them from spilling out but fails to produce anticipated results.The intention was that the tray would hold the discard pile in a neat stack, preventing less scrupulous players from viewing the cards below the top discard.

I just went off what the professor had taught us in class, as the lecture was more interesting than the book. If I were to write a book, I would want it to be more intriguing than a lecture.

The first 3 chapters deal with posture injuries and overview.chapters 4 and 5 are dedicated to stretching and safe movement.chapter 6 is a short primer on lower back pain.chapters 7,8 and 9 are beginner,intermediate and advanced routines.chapter 10 is more advanced and 11 is theraband routines.chapter 12 is move yourself out of pain.The down side is the large scope of the book.Not what I would call an easy read.Black and white pictures only.The only other book that looks close is Anatomy of Pilates by Physical Mind.I hope to get this one soon.I also own The Pilates body by Siler and a couple others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical","review":"This book is a typical eyes, ears, mouth and nose book it sings a great song but the parts worth reading are extremely similar to a Friedman and Eisen book \\"The Pilates Method of Physical and Mental Conditioning\\" i read ten years ago. I was confused by many of the exercise descriptions in particular the photographic representations. Being a student of Anatomy and Physiology i was concerned about the inaccuracies in the fundamentals of body awareness chapter and Menezes's grading of Basic to Advanced, some basic exercises were well beyond my ability and being a regular walker and yoga student i find this extremely frustrating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Informative yet interesting","review":"As abortion was always an interesting topic to me, the beginning of this book was quite catching, and at first I couldn't put it down, as the author recounts her life in Catherine Booth, a home for expectant mothers. Towards the second half of the book, Shullenberger delves into the more factual part of abortion, it's history and the status of it today. Nearing the end of the book, she also recounts her life up to this point. Although I was not as interested in the factual essence of this book, it was retained fully by me. For those who like real life accounts of situations, in this case abortion, Shullenberger offers a very good view of the situation. I would definitely recommend this book to those serious of learning more on abortion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong Book","review":"They sent me the wrong book. I wanted De Paseo the text book but they sent me the activity book. Also, it took a very long time (2 weeks) for the book to get here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good plot but not so character development","review":"This book has a interesting plot compared to those of its kind. I find it that the effect of having a murder mystery enlightened the normal “fantasy\\" storyline. Although it did have cliché detective parts. The most interesting and best part of the plot was right after Kros and Jarad defeated the half-demon and the Selensya quietness attacked. But I wouldn't say it was perfect. The character development of Kros was somewhat repetitive. For example the book mentioned many times that he felt guilty of some sort. Additionally it was disappointing that there was little part that Sazdek played. Overall I would say that this book was good for its unique plot, but there was room for more character exploration. This book I would recommend, but I would not bring up your hopes up too high, especially for someone outside the card game."},{"rating":"1","title":"used","review":"i'm sure the book is a good read, that's why i ordered it. but, the link i ordered it from said the book was NEW. i just got it today and the book is visably USED! even has the name of the previous owner on the top. if you're really looking for this book, have your local book store order it for you, or get it on your kindle."},{"rating":"1","title":"The pain......","review":"Oh the pain, make it stop. The gameplay here is so repetitive it actually hurts. Basically, you've got Tempest with more colors and better music. Heck, I just spun through the tubes as fast as I could while blasting away without thinking and finished the first several levels. Weak."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Extremely Fun Game","review":"This game is truly one of my favs. I believe that it does get kinda repetitive, but that doesn't really bother me too much with this one. The graphics are good, but what you'll really notice about the game is it's extraordinary visuals and lightning. It's also got the best soundtrack for a video game. Techno doesn't get any better than The Crystal Method.You start out the game choosing between one of four different ships. Not many, but you'll find cool is that you can customize it with virtually any color and then give it a body pattern. There are 30 levels, which is really 15 and then the same 15 again but with greater difficulty.It's a very simple game (travel along the tunnel and shoot bugs), but a very fun game nonetheless. Sometimes the speed can get insanely fast, making it very exciting. However, I never recommend anything, simply because people like different things. So check this one out for yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"psychedelic","review":"if you loved tempest and maybe even tempest X3, you gonna love this...it's a little bit like S.T.U.N.

The bottles are quite large for 20oz, very tall (so make sure they fit under any shelving, etc. The ceramic is not a nice white, sort of a dingy cream. The colors are nothing like what you see in the picture. The vinegar bottle is a deep purple/black color.. and the oil bottle is more a green yellow (not the beige). All in all, pretty disappointing. I ended up returning to purchase the Amethyst bottles and the Frosted Oil bottle instead. Pretty happy with those."},{"rating":"1","title":"only has 4 buttons incompatible with most games","review":"i bought atari classics and this . i was hoping for the old 80's missle command expierence the game ruled . this controller was incompatible. i looked it up very few games actually work with this! booo!"},{"rating":"2","title":"fun toy","review":"This toy is great. My two year old daughter got it for her birthday and it was her favorite gift. As others have mentioned the acordian part is hard for her to do at this point, but it doesn't take away her love of the item. She loves to dance to the music and point at the different characters saying their names. If you can't handle toys that make noise don't get this item as it is very loud. You need to be great at either ignoring the noise or singing along. We have fun with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Toy!","review":"This accordion is just a very cute little toy. My husband plays the accordion and when Jeff plays his, my little one just wants to play along SO bad! I'm glad that they FINALLY came out with this Wiggles toy. It plays \\"Food Man,\\" \\"Wags the Dog, He Likes to Tango,\\" \\"Dorothy the Dinosaur,\\" \\"Lettuce Sing,\\" \\"Where's Jeff,\\" and a couple of others that I can't remember. I wish it play a little easier within the middle, which is the real part of the accordion, put it doesn't detract from the fun of this toy. What a great gift and just in time for Christmas! Grab this one while you can - shop early if you're looking for the Wiggles because they go fast! This one teaches great hand and eye dexterity - the accordion is not exactly the easiest instrument to play. Keep that in mind if you're buying it for a two-year-old. He/she will need some help. Otherwise, it's a lot of fun for my little one."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful transactions","review":"I had a flawless transaction.

I didn't care how much I spent, I just had to have this. Exraordinary vision and mood music that takes you anywhere. I have listened to this over and over and, as with Ray's Etheral Journey, you find yourself completely relaxed! It's perfect. I just loaded it in my iTunes selection and no matter what I'm doing, if it comes on, I stop working and just let the music take me away. If you ever have the opportunity to buy this do so!!! Thanks very much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vulgar, distasteful, dumb","review":"There's no doubt that Popa Chubby has a fair amount of talent, but \\"Booty & The Beast\\" suffers from guitar hero stylings and a lack of taste.

I will order more CHUBBY asap."},{"rating":"2","title":"you need this CD","review":"This is the single most exciting and enjoyable disc I've added to my collection in over 10 years--it's packed full of stand out tunes. If this is the shape of the new New York Blues, the future looks really bright. This disc gives a grade A rhythm section performance--these guys are tight enough to hold water and cut a groove deep enough to swim in. Palace of the King drives like no tomorrow with fabulous Hammond organ work to complement Popa's blistering guitar. Do Anything That You Want Me to Do with its tight bass/guitar/keys unison parts is perfection. I Was Lookin Back is another rhythmic tour de force with surprises around every corner. Stoop Down lays a smooth groove. And Same Old Blues takes a slow blues form and transforms it into something exceedingly powerful. Buy this disc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great blues, songwriting, vocals, etc.","review":"This was my first introduction to Chubby. (I thought this was his debut album?) Diverse music on this CD and lots of stuff that just sticks in her head - very catchy. Great lyrics with Popa. My all-time favorite is \\"Lookin' Back\\". If you're into Blues that's upbeat with a NYC attitude (whether you're a guitarist or a listener!) all of Popa's stuff is a must have. This CD is the best place to start. I read an editor's review on another retail site which said that Popa has a tendency to leans towards vulgar jokes and that he's become a distinctive bluesman against all of the odds. That is just not the case. This guy is unique, very talented, familiar with lots of styles and is very soulful.

As in her other books, Norton follows the events from a single protagonist. In this case, it is a young anthropoligist. As she is a well educated character, the story is told in a sensible way, rather than the disjointed fasion that The Iron Cage is told. I wish I had read Ice Crown before Iron Cage as they take place in the same universe. The things I learned of the backstory in Ice Crown would have been a great help in figuring out what was going on in Iron Cage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Book On The Subject EVER!","review":"My twelve step program sponsor and I read this book and were so impressed we started a Book Study Group to share it with a bunch of women who have issues with food.

Hollis contributes binge eating to a dysfunctional relationship with your mother. Overeating and compulsive eating are complex issues and should not be attributed to any one conclusion. What about those that are fat that never even had a relationship with their mother? It seems to me that the author thought the theory sounded realistic and continued to elaborate on it without any real proof to support it. The book did not help me one bit.

They have some very powerful material, but their production quality in the studio and on the road is still very basic, which is refreshing.

Unfortunately, in the hour it took to get through the book, I became more and more disappointed.The writing style left much to be desired, but I didn't expect a lterary marvel; the recipes left much to be desired, but I didn't expect a cook book.What I did expect was some semblance of accuracy - even in the made up world of \\"Chairman\\" Kaga's Gourmet Academy. For example, if memory serves me correctly, I viewed the four programs with the Ota faction versus Morimoto. In the last Ota faction versus Morimoto battle, the faction FINALLY wins. Unfortunately, in the book we are told just the opposite. In another example, there was a section devoted to Yukio Hattori. The section was highly informative, but Hattori-san's photos were to be found in the section devoted to Asako Kishi.The book is somewhat like \\"Chairman\\" Kaga - bright colors but little substance."},{"rating":"1","title":"MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT!!!","review":"I have watched almost all the episodes of this show on the FOODTV network. This book is small in size and has a lot of nice photos, BUT there are to many photos.

The backgrounds of the Iron Chefs is mentioned very lightly, it fails to go into the depth I was expecting from all the hype this show and book got in the press. All in all not worth the money. If you love this show as I do, you will not love the book. There are a \\"few\\" recipes mentioned in the book. I suggest borrowing it from the library so you can return it when done.

Pat Southern carefully examines the life and career of the great \\"son\\" of Caesar by digging deeper than the image and instead exploring the many factors, and the many possibilites that are neccessary for a complete evaluation.There is much ambiguity surrounding the \\"Princeps\\" and the facts that Roman authors have published about their leader. Southern questions, attacks and clarifies these so called facts while penetrating thru the propaganda in an effort to uncover the real truth and expose the real circumstances surrounding the man.For this reason alone, this book is as much a success as it is a wonderful reading experience. Not only is this book a great biography, but many lessons can be learned by the example Augustus has set in the political and the image making arena."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great travelogue capturing the 'season'","review":"Very readable account of the striper fishing frenzy in the fall at the tip of LI.
