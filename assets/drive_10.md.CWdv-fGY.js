The film starts off with a great idea and the opening scenes show good promise when the crew of a nuclear-armed space station has to react to World War 3. A few months later they have to bail out when an earth-based hacker discovers they might have a load of nukes onboard. Once on ground one of their party falls prey to an unknown predator while the other two have to contend with a gang run by a teenager. The rest of the movie is a bore as it turns into a cheap Mad Max/Road Warrior knock-off.Like many of these films, they all lack the one element that made Mad Max so great, non-stop action.

His characters, as always, are credible and rich. His vivid depiction of the stormy King Richard stands among his best. Richard's Muslim healing sage ever speaks with quiet, fiery wisdom. Predictably, Kenneth the Scot is the true hero -- humble, strong, and bravehearted. Considering that the story is burdened with battles that almost happen, love affairs that never quite consummate, and mystical scenes that never truly resolve, this classic book nevertheless holds the reader captive throughout, and delivers a satisfying ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO Substitute for DSM-IV-R","review":"Although this text may be of assistance to some, it may also be used incorrectly and the criteria set forth in the DSM-IV-R is stringent, complete, and also complex.

He is a modern prophet. Half of the songs on this album involve his belief in God, without trying to convert anyone. He also sings about societal issues. At other times he forces the listener to tears with intense intimate songs about fear (Kleines Lied) and his memory of a dear friend (Abschied Nehmen). His singing is infused with a rare energy; he clearly feels what he sings in every vein of his body, and I assume most listeners will feel the same. This is the best album I have heard in fifteen years. This double album is live, with an incredibly tight, funky and soulful band. Here's someone who raps as tough as any American rapper,and sings as soulful as Marvin Gay.Despite the seriousness and intensity of the lyrics, the general feel of the album is moving, adrenaline boosting and uplifting. Xavier Naidoo is an exception tot he rule that the most fun things aren't good for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spiffy French Software","review":"I've tried several French software packages (and wasted a great deal of money), including Learn French Now!, Instant Immersion French, and others. This software, Smart Start French, is honestly the spiffiest of the lot. Unlike the others, this software gives a comprehensive approach--you do writing, reading, and listening. (And speaking, if you're brave!) Plus, you get a cassette, an audio CD, *and* a CD ROM, plus the grammar workbook thingie. Other software packages seem to overhype themselves and claim they will teach you more than they realistically can. This software, by contrast, is a lot of work precisely because it is comprehensive--but I really think you can learn some French from it. And, it's fun. It's more expensive than other packages, but I honestly think it's worth the extra money. (It's cheaper than a $400 class at the community college in any case.) That's my two centimes' worth."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great supplement","review":"This is a cleverly put-together set of resources for learning French. The games are thoughtful and even fun and the speaking section does recognize words pretty well.The drawback is that while this is excellent, it is an excellent *supplement* to other instruction in French.

Those pages that are directed towards users describe each feature in detail, but don't present them in the context that a project manager would find appealing.

Some color photos, but it definitely could use more, and from a larger range of years. My complaint was that it seemed a \\"puff piece\\", written by someone a little too closely involved with the MAO program -- and therefore lost some objectivity in reporting of some pageant scandals of yore -- and let's face it, those are some of the most fun in a pageant history book.

Gabriel continues his interest in world beats, incorporating African and Middle Eastern sounds into many of the album's songs. To be honest, the album's impact isn't immediately obvious--the true genius lies in the subtle, cascading melodies and gentle rolling rhythms that are gradually discovered. Tracks like \\"Come to Talk to Me, \\"Love to Be Loved\\" and the gorgeous \\"Secret World\\" percolate rather than explode, gradually building to a release. The lyrics are great in the typical Gabriel fashion, and his vocals are perhaps the best of his career.

The guitar work is at times simply stunning--as good as it gets. I'm a big fan of David Wilcox, Jonatha Brooke and Suzanne Vega, and this guy is in good company with these other artists.

With 3 computers on it (1 wired and 2 wireless), it needs to be reset every hour. The signal quality and range on the wireless is about half what its specs say that it should be. If this hadn't been given to me free, I would demand my money back. I would recommend getting a Linksys, or better yet, save your money and get a real Cisco switch. This is a typical example of poor quality end-user junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy range, easy setup","review":"I purchased this router to set up a home network with two wired computers and one wireless laptop. Setup was fairly easy, although there are no good instructions as to how to configure your computer or printers. The range is about 20 feet in my house. After that it gets below 21% and loses its signal. I had to call Belkin customer support for setup help, and the best I can figure, the customer support center is in India. I don't have a problem with that, but one of the guys I talked to said he didn't have a computer with XP on it, only W98. I thought that was bizarre. They were never able to even comprehend what my problem was, but I finally solved it on my own. I would consider another product rather than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very dissapointed","review":"I have had this router for a month and i still can't get it to work .

The only thing that's annoying with wireless routers in general (I've worked with 2 so I know I'm not an expert on this but I've tried to find the solution on other brands websites) is that there doesn't seem to be simple plug and play action but rather you need to renew the ip which is really easy on windows but I haven't figured out how to do it on my mac since I previously had no need to do so.

And it often cuts out when I'm on a call with clients without the beep warning.2) The action on the blue navigation button stinks. I can look up a number in a a phne book and dial it with my own fingers faster than scrolling through the phone's directory. What's the point?3) Performance with a headset is terrible.

So I took the unit back to Circuit City and tried to exchange it. The return guy told me that I had to call Panasonic for an authorization number. Called, talked to Dawn and she said that it was Panasonic's policy to only repair, never exchange defective merchandise. After a period of time I can understand that policy but three months. A 200 dollar phone should work better than that.

But these are small things.The pots and pans hold heat very well and your cooking should improve. Suggest using a PAM product before you add butter or other fats as it makes clean up a breeze. After cooking, soak the pot or pan in hot soapy water and the clean up is easy. Recommend Cameo pot cleaner (non abrassive) for keeping these cooking tools dazzling. And don't forget the sunglasses!

It also features excellent versions of the big hits \\" Angie \\", \\" Wild Horses \\",and \\" Street Fighting Man \\".

Well \\"Stripped\\" just goes to show how far a garage band can improve with a few years' practice. This little outfit is ultra tight - Richards and Woods mesh to perfection and the strength of the Watts/Jones rhythm section must have left Bill Wyman crying into his chip fryer. Jagger's singing is more varied and expressive than in his stadium rock outings and the choice of material is more original than their usual live album stuff. Dead Flowers, Spider and the Fly, Let it Bleed and Slipping Away stand out however there isn't a duff song on the entire album.

So, I went into this book with some preconceived biases. Well, they were all proven wrong.Abramson is an extremely intelligent woman, and an excellent attorney, but her writing, as well as that of Richard Flaste, is quite dry and rather boring. She has some nice stories to tell, but the manner in which she delivers them is undeniably dull.The book clearly had no cogent flow to it whatsoever. The book was somewhat hard to get through, but I read on, hoping it lead to something better.

I'm not a 'collector' type of person so I had to qualms about giving this cd and 2/melt away.I didn't start listening to his music until within the past decade so the chronology and expectations based on reviews and how it follows from a previously released album are irrelevant to the way my impressions are formed, which is nice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Back On His Feet Again","review":"The first three Gabriel solo albums are incredibly diverse and sort staking out his ground. This is perhaps one of his best solo albums in my mind and an excellent follow up to the first which may have had some tentative steps. Here Peter is certainly back on sure footing and seems to know where he is going with his music. For me the music is far more interesting and musically appealing than his newer stuff. Even when he plays some of his older numbers it seems he has lost perspective on it. That being said Flotsam and Jetsam is a highlight though almost any number is right up there with anything he did with Genesis. The live performance of the material really made these songs stand out. Personally I'm not exactly impressed with his World music, but if you want an idea of where Genesis could headed its all here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't get ripped off!!!!!!!","review":"This is just a re-hash of the stereo CD, it's not \\"re-mastered\\" for multi-channel playback. You'd be much happier with Pink Floyd's 30th Anniversary Edition of the album \\"Dark SIde Of The Moon\\" or the Eagles \\"Hotel California\\" or Elton John's \\"Goodbye Yellow Brick Road\\"; these artists took the time and spent the money to do SACD right.

I truly believe he is one of rock music's most gifted artists.Now for the bad news: PG was still searching for his own voice on this second solo effort, and hadn't yet found it. Although II is stylistically more cohesive than the first album, the production by Robert Fripp seems misguided at best, a muddy mess at worst. PG(I) was fun, II is dreary and grating.Maybe the scratching finger nails on the cover was Gabriel's response after listening to the end result!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not For Everyone,But Right For Me.","review":"Indeed,Peter Gabriel is not the sort of artist who makes light pop music,but once you understand where his vision is coming from,you know it some of the most rewarding music you have ever heard. Like David Byrne,he seems to be spouting incomprehensible nonsense,but it is the \\"nonsense\\" of a genius that you have to pay attention to to understand. Of course his first solo records after Genesis were thick and moody, but those same songs performed live (Plays Live,of course) are nothing short of thrilling, like early U-2. U-2,before the self-absorbed pretension set in. Peter Gabriel's studio and live records (yes,at first they were RECORDS-LP's-they go back that far!) compliment one another,get them both to feel the full experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gabriel continues to search for his sound","review":"Listening to the second album sounds an awful lot like listening to a Genesis album, not a Peter Gabriel Genesis album, but a post-Gabriel Genesis album. However, you do hear that distinct Gabriel sound starting to emerge, just a little. I have to admit that I do like this album more than Gabriel's first CD, which I thought was very confused and all over the place. However, this album is not anywhere close to the two masterpieces that were to come (in his 3rd and 4th albums). All in all, I give favorable marks to this album, because it provides a hint of the genius to come. No, there are no singles from this album and it does not really go out of it's way to be commercial."},{"rating":"2","title":"About subtitles","review":"Does anyone knows about the subtitles.if there are any??I need to know if this movie has subtitles in spanishThanks..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute Movie","review":"I saw this movie at the drive-in when it was released, and was surprised to find it available on DVD.

I got this movie since I haven't seen it before, and I liked main actors in it. But whoever directed this piece did a horrible job, acting is below even one star - I couldn't believe that the same actors - Helen Hunt, Sara Jessica Parker and Shannen Doherty did such good jobs on TV and in movies later in their careers. Sarah Jessica looked like she was trying waaaaay to hard, and Helen Hunt and Shannen Doherty were just... horrible. As far as the script goes... well, it was just empty. Somebody compared this movie to a Center Stage - well, I wouldn't, since there is no good choreography here at all - absolutely NOTHING to look at and enjoy.

I can't believe they would even release this on Blu-ray this way as it is seemingly no better than standard DVD or even VHS! I am very disappointed in the product. The movie is a great 80's Flick but I just wish that they had taken a little more care and time to release it the right way.... Do not buy if only upgrading from a previous medium.

No new information here - its no different from what I learned reading Muscle & Fitness Hers magazine. The pictures, especially the cover photo, are totally out of place.

I gave it two stars simply because it gives an alternative to what similar exercises can be done at home if you're not at the gym, or if you don't have access to a gym (while traveling, for example). But even this is not enough. It seems that the book is hastily compiled. I would like to comment also about the models used in the book - personally, the don't have the look of someone working out or anything, with the impractical long coiffed hair and all that, that sometimes hid an essential part of the form during the exercise, like the shoulder. It would be more realistic to dress them as regular gym-goers do - like tying their hair up, for example, instead of having them look as if they're going to a pub. It's just irritating and unappealing.Plus, I agree with what one of the readers said about bad form in the book.

David Denby's writing style is worth reading for its own value and he does an excellent job of taking you to class with him.

The author could not maintain this reader's attention. Many passages from the classics seemed to drone on, peppered with some side-light descriptions of the author's younger \\"college aged\\" classmates. I can see by the number of five star reviews that this book was a hit with many readers. I thought it provided a narrow scope on classic literature. The book I read previous to this book was Harold Bloom's \\"The Western Cannon\\". Harold Bloom gives concrete examples and rules why a book should be considered a classic in Western Literature. This book by David Denby offers a more intuitive approach. I recommend Harold Bloom's book instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good trip back to the classics","review":"Dabbling in a little bit of many masters of western thought, Denby skillfully uses his modern perspective to shed new light on these timeless works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Solipsism At Its Finest","review":"My objection to this book mainly stems from Denby's shallow and misinformed views about Conrad's \\"Heart of Darkness\\" and its two well-spoken critics Chinua Achebe and Edward Said. Denby cannot swallow the truth that Conrad's work is overtly racist and at best fuctions as a limited remonstration against European imperialism.

David Denby's \\"Great Books\\" is one of them. His love of great books is plain, and infectious, but beyond that his fondness for his fellow students at Columbia University, young, quirky, opinionated, bright and full of passion, is an inspiration. I'm sixty-four years old now. I'm a member and organizer of a Great Books group, and find myself going back to Denby's Great Books for inspiration. David Denby is able to move from what he reads to how he lives and back again; when we accomplish that now and then in our group's discussions we understand why we read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so deep","review":"Almost every book that Denby defends so wholeheartedly in this book is worth reading. Still, his exploration of the culture debates seems superficial. He is able to attend these classes and come out with basically the same opinions with which he left, having absorbed nothing of the justifiable rage of groups left out of the \\"core curriculum\\", smugly sure that the books he grew up with are the best that are out there. His dismissal of the liberal students' concern as \\"tragically mistaken\\" seems glib and self-satisfied, and the book is tainted by the bias of its author, whose purpose (to re-educate himself, to find himself) is defeated from the start by his closed-mindedness."},{"rating":"1","title":"propagandist and misogynist","review":"I took up this book with no preconceptions, just positive review from people I knew, as a book that might help me find a way to personally rediscover classic book reading in adulthood.

In addition, the questions in the \\"industry analysis\\" are set by the answer, (that means he already know company A is an airline, company B is a computer manufacturer, then he merely give the financial statements to you, and analyse it as if he doesnt know which company was in which industry), so he must be able find his way to draw his conclusion--that A's statement is A, B's statement is B, no matter how similar the two statements are.

Of the many serial killer books I have read, this one gave me some of the best information on the whys and wherefores of what is a signiture and how can it be identified, and how it differs from an M.O. Keppel is not condscending, like Douglas can be at times, but tries to explain it all. Although, I must say, as with all the Profilers, he has a way of referring back to his one \\"Big Case.\\" There are some decent biography and verbal re-creation of crime scenes, with commentary on how to figure out what's going on in the killer's head."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good investigator, not such a good writer","review":"Keppel is obviously a very intelligent man with vast experience in serial murder investigation, and at the forefront of his field. The book explores some very interesting concepts through the use of many famous investigations. However, Keppel seems to write with a real lack of emotion, which I guess is necessary in his job. Which is why he should stick with that job instead of trying to be a writer. The lack of emotion made it feel like I was reading a calculus textbook. Keppel also seems to repeat himself over and over throughout the different chapters.

Yet in Robert Ressler's book \\"I have Lived in the Monster: Inside the Mind of the World's most notorious Serial Killers\\", Mr. Ressler states that he himself is the one who coined the term. Dr. Keppel also takes great liberties in his discussion of the Picquerism signature.

Where the movie falls short is in the paint-by-numbers Hollywood type story line, and a terrible performance by an actor who plays the crazy redneck brother of Rourkes love interest, who plays the stupid, inbred, trailer park, white trash, bad guy the same way we've seen this type of character played a thousand different times in other movies... only worse.

Books you probably could learn or should learn from are real classic books by Jesse Livermore(speculation legend), or Richard D Wyckoff(Accumulation and distribution theory, millionaire), or Buffeit(A true billionaire).You don't want to learn investing from people whose major is journalism.JC can't survive in this market, he still talks about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worse books on investing I have ever read","review":"Most of what is in this book has been said before. I just love the title. I don't think smart and the Internet era go together too well and the New Economy idea has come and gone. The authors of this book are probably very young and with youth comes inexperience in financial markets. The Street.com is a web site dedicated to financial information(like this book I think), but The Street.com has never made money and the company's stock is a penny stock. The Street's so-called experts write about about making money, but don't you think that if they really knew how to do this they would have made money themselves. Better luck next time. Save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"TheStreet.com Guide to Smart Investing","review":"This is an excellent book for those who wish to become an informed and independent investor. Although I am a long time investor in both stocks and options, I found the material presented to be quite useful. Yes, much of what is presented is \\"known\\", but this book provides an extremely valuable outline for developing the discipline required to be a successful self directed investor.It is definetly not a \\"how to get rich quick in the market\\" book, but rather an orderly presentation of the skills you need to develop and useful techniques that will make you a successful investor. Must read for new but serious investors, very good review for the old hands."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insightful!","review":"If you can make it past the typical James Cramer stock-market cheerleading, The Street.com's guide to investing is well worth a look for novices. Skip over the dated, New Economy hype and get right to the overview of global equity markets, including risk factors, economic indicators and corporate performance measures. Author Dave Kansas does a great job of summarizing these voluminous concepts in a way that's easy to digest and remember. This book reads much better than most of those in the investment field, perhaps because it was written by actual writers, not economic experts fumbling their way through the writing process, or ghostwriters churning out personality-free prose. We from getAbstract highly recommend this book to beginning investors, with a word of warning: The tone of this book is still very much of the optimistic \`90s era, and does not seem to reflect the subsequent market retreat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why Pay For a Paid Advertisement??","review":"The Street.com is just another overhyped dot-com company that couldn't keep its own financial house afloat so why take financial advice from a failure?You also have to wonder whether the 5-star ratings are all supplied by Street.com employees who are trying to look out for their own financial futures and jobs.BTW: The information in this book isn't even original or given in enough depth to do a reader much good.

Where do i start...The magazine is made out of plastic. Some times the nails don't come out at all and other times they go shooting sideways through the chintzy plastic magazine. And it also has a hair trigger magazine release that is situated painfully close to the firing trigger. all it takes is a light bump on the magazine release and it does just that. So expect the whole thing to open up and fall apart on you often. I wound up zip tying the damn thing back just so that I could get through the last project I used it on. The shoe also has issues. It has a thumbscrew adjustment that self adjusts as you work. I can't tell you how thrilled I was to discover this the first time I used it. I've thought about selling it on ebay \\"as is\\" but i don't want to screw someone else with this POS. Buy anything else but this thing or you will regret it.

THIS IS ONE DAY AFTER THE SAME THING HAPPENED TO MY PARTNERS GUN THAT WAS 8 MONTHS OLD!!!! My partners Bostitch Brad Nailer also died after about 3 weeks a couple of months ago, and another partners 15 gauge died a little while back and it was only a few months old.

It performed well for the 4 months I owned it. I purchased the Bostich to replace a Senco that I had many problems with. I especially appreciate the light weight and durability....yes, durability!! The magnesium case and plastic magazine performed without a flaw (although I was a bit skeptical at first).The nails sold here on Amazon have worked quite well.

This gun has fired consistantly for me with no problems at all. I find that the features make this tool easy to work with and make on the job adjustments easy.

It works well the vast majority of the time. I use it weekly, and enjoy it very much.There are two minor annoyances:1. The nailer jams once or twice almost every session of use. That probably averages to one jam every 75 or so shots. The jams are not difficult to clear, but sometimes result in marring my work.2. The tool puts a dent in the wood beside the nail unless I hold it in a particular way. I have looked for the cause and played with the depth adjustment, but to no avail. The problem is minor, but I wish I didn't have to remember to tweak it just right before I pull the trigger.This is the only finish nailer I've ever owned, so I don't know if level of trouble is normal for them.

I've been a carpenter for 40 years. I've been using finish nailers for about 20 years. My last nail gun was a Duo-fast. I finally retired it recently, after 17+ years of service. Since the local lumber yard carries Bostich nails, I went with Bostich. I've had the gun 18 months & the piston rod has broken 3 times. Replacing it myself still cost me $35.00 a pop. Anybody who has trimmed a door or window or installed baseboard, knows it's immpossible not to hit a screw head or sheetrock nail once in a while. Well, everytime I hit one, the piston rod breaks. It breaks in the exact same spot. It appears to made of cast aluminum or something, instead of hardened or stainless steel. I like the gun & am thinking about getting somebody to manufacture a functional rod for me, since Bostich doesn't know how."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good","review":"Heya, great product.

I only want to teach people about nail angles. I usually love Bostitch. I have their crown stapler with the quick change trigger and their F21PL framing nailer (see my review.) They are both awesome. This gun however, uses 28 degree nails, which are only used in Bostitch guns. Therefore, you have to buy more expensive, Bostitch-only nails, which you can't get at every store. Very disappointing. Bostitch finally started building other guns with the common nail angles, but you have to carefully make sure when you buy. They're just behind the times with this one.If you buy a finish nailer, get one with a 30-33 degree angle. They can be bought everywhere, and usually compatible between manufacturing brands. I recommend the Hitachi NT65MA4 finish nailer (see my review)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two in One Day","review":"I was doing some outdoor finish work around the house and decided to rent a finish nailer as my brad nailer was a bit light for the job. Instead of renting I decided to buy the Bostich 15 gauge. Excited to get to work I struggled a little to get the hang of loading the magazine. The magazine is plastic and has a bit of a unique loading procedure. Nothing like my Bostich brad nailer or my rough-in nailer. I finally filled it with nails and went to fire the first round...nothing. Checked the air pressure, hose and fittings. All was OK. Tried for 5 minutes and succeeded in firing maybe 3 nails, one every 15 tries. I took it back to Home D___t and got another one. Same model, same problem except this one fired once every 10 times.

Unfortunately the issues addressed seem to be taken from a purely Western perspective. David McMurray has attempted to transplant himself into a unique culture and draw many conclusions based upon his limited experiences and conversations with a few of the locals in Nador. The style of writing relied on many rambling recollections of scatterred conversaions and absurd assumptions made by McMurray during his stay in Morocco. I would not have even read this book, but it was required for a class that he teaches at Oregon State University. Needless to say, I fell asleep no less than fifteen times while reading the first five chapters of the book.

Michael Carrodus' vocals have an Ian Curtis appeal and fit the songs well. The lyrics and keyboards keep the whole thing firmly ensconced in eighties new wave/goth. Half of these songs would do well on college radio.Their cover of Death In June's \\"Fall Apart\\" breathes new life into the song. \\"Black Roses\\" strikes the best balance among my-woman-is-heartless lyrics, 80s-era synth drums, and Mission UK melodies. \\"Suicide\\" is the standout mood piece, slow and dirgy though the singing and lyrics are weak. If you haven't eaten a bullet after that song, \\"Love Is Colder Than Death\\" is actually a pretty peppy tune.After Carrodus left to seek new heights of obscurity, Ikon went in a more electronic direction. \\"In The Shadow of The Angel\\" is a good introduction, and a solid \\"B\\" in goth pop."},{"rating":"2","title":"Singer crafts mic-cord noose","review":"Ikon is considered 'goth' I guess, and I picked this up years after it appeared, but it's decent enough dark rock. This was the first singer, Michael C, about the most truly depressed man in rock history. Sounding 100% like Ian Curtis, he goes through some lyrics that sound significantly less than anything Curtis penned, and yet the music saves the band again.The production is good, most of the songs have a nice, fat heavy bass, a pounding drum machine (though they used a real drummer sometimes) and a lot of it sounds like a very early, very depressed U2.The guy just finally gets on with it and actually writes a song called 'Suicide'. As if the previous 20 or so songs weren't about how unhappy he is, he just flat tells us. He later split with the band; one wonders why.I think A Moment in Time is a much stronger disc than this, but this is pretty close in sound and tone. The singer is very depressed, yet the music never is--it's actually driving, sometimes...hopeful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why this cd doesn't have more songs?","review":"The mayority of the people assume that IKON took only influences from Joy Division, I think this band worships Dead in June's work.

They seem to have done a tremendous amount of testing, of clubs in particular. And, then they developed a mathematical model to introduce variables that would take a lifetime to replicate by actual imperical testing with (exhausted) golfers. The result is this work, with lots of experimentation and documentation, and quite a few conclusions. However, I don't think this is the book you want to labor through if you are looking for clear and concise explanations and recommendations for your personal club selection or modification. They say you can learn something from every experience. I have to say I learned quite a few things while reading.

In college, I had the opportunity to play and become intimately acquainted with these sonatas. Being partial to 'period' performance, I have always been on the lookout for a good 'historically informed' recording and Breitman and Rivest don't fail to deliver. These are sonatas for fortepiano and violin, not violin sonatas and Breitman and Rivest's approach always keeps that cardinal rule of these pieces in mind. The transparent timbre of the gut-strung violin and fortepiano lend a clarity to these sonatas not often found in a lot of other recordings. The impeccable technique of both artists with the judicious use of vibrato by Rivest adds to that clarity. A wonderful opportunity for those who think they don't like period performances to become aquainted with the practice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helps keep away colds!","review":"A great value for the price (I buy by the case).

This is an telling saga for anyone with a desire for insight into how the Midwest was made. I feel like I understand many of the people in my family (with Midwestern roots) better after reading these books. Of course, it is not the final word on the begining of the Midwest, but is a significant part of the tale of the Midwest also told by Laura Ingalls Wilder, Booth Tarkington, Glenway Wescott, Sterling North, Willa Cather, etc.But even if you don't care how the Midwest came to be, the story of the dreams, struggles, hopes, confrontations of very real human beings will keep you engaged.I was very happy to found these and they delighted me thoroughly as I read them.Though \\"Giants in the Earth\\" stands perfectly on its own, I can hardly imagine stopping there.

If that is what passes for good literature, it is lost on me. I'll go back to reading Dickens and Hemingway. Sorry, but I have read better books everywhere I have gone. This is a deeply depressing and dreary story. That's about all I can say. I just can't like it, no matter how hard I try. Maybe it is for Steinbeck fans?

I mean really, a chapter on \\"Please Don't Squeeze the Shaman\\"? Are you kidding? I do think the author is trying to be fun and playful, but it does not match the subject. Second, it is obviously Paganism through the lens of Wicca. I still struggle to find general books on Paganism that do not talk about the 4 elements, the three aspects of the Goddess, 8 sabbats, and other \\"facts about Paganism\\" that are obviously Wiccan. These are not accurate for those following the Norse or Celtic paths, and presenting it as \\"Pagans do this or that\\" is misleading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very in depth","review":"Good for someone who knows absolutely nothing about paganism in general and has no idea which path they are interested in.

McColman did not give me a wonderful first impression of the religion.

This one has worked out really well for us. It sharpeners new pencils in less than half the time my electric sharpeners do.The only downfall is the \\"vacuum seal\\" doesn't quite work as well as it should. It pops up every 10 or so pencils.

The vacuum works very well as long as you have clean, smooth countertop. But the rubberized base collects lint over time and diminishes the effect of the vacuum. After a while, even when we cleaned the base, it just didn't stick as well as it used to, making it virtually useless. As other posters mentioned, it sharpened unevenly as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"worse than you ought to buy","review":"Like others here, I found that the plastic receptacle on this baby came apart and would NOT go back together. I was fortunate that the sharpener did actually sharpen pencils quite well and it lasted for at least a year if not a little longer. Still, the only reason it held up was that I didn't try to empty it until it was too full to go on any longer; when I did, uh oh.

I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised. The blades are sharp and did an excellent job. It sharpens a hair off center, but not enough to impact the writing tip. Also, I don't see any obvious problems with the way it was built.I've only had it for a few hours, so I can't comment on durability. I'm happy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great sharpener","review":"This is a great sharpener. The vacuum base holds it securely, and the sharpener gives you a great point. I have never had any problem with the blade being one sided and sharpening unevenly. Even though it has only one blade it revolves around the pencil cutting evenly as it goes. If your point still has wood on it to the tip then that means your using crappy pencils that don't have the lead centered in the wood properly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good Enough","review":"I notice the reviews are at both extremes for this item. If you're happy that the thing sharpens your pencils better than the tiny toy things, then it's a 5. If you expected any kind of quality, it's a 1.I lean toward the negative on this one. Only epoxy would give you a reliable adhesion to even the smoothest surface. Two cutters would give the thing much better feel and balance. And yes, it is flimsy and would not last long with someone who was generally rough on things.I think I have one of the \\"yesteryear\\" models in a box somewhere, and I know it was better: metal, two cutters, screw it down to mount it - and you really had something.For a device that you'll keep, probably for a pretty long time, I'd prefer to spend several times the price and get a good 120 volt electric sharpener. If you've used these, you'll never go back."},{"rating":"1","title":"This thing is useless!","review":"This only sharpens the pencil on one side and pops off the table every time I try to use it.

The plastic back of the pencil shavings case began separating and then fell off after sharpening 30 or so pencils. Also the gears do not fit well, the whole unit is wiggly.

Luckily I just purchased this so I will be able to return it."},{"rating":"1","title":"vacuum nice; everything else worthless","review":"Why, oh why, did I think buying a plastic pencil sharpener was a good idea? Oh yes, it was because there was no metal vacuum-mount sharpener on amazon.Plastic breaks easily and quickly. The really sad thing is that after I glued the trashy plastic back together, the metal sharpener assembly broke! Do yourself a favor and buy the good old all-metal sharpener you had in your classroom when you were a kid. They do not break.

Any command from the remote takes 1-2 seconds to initiate.But the main problem for me over the past 2-3 years has been progressively worsening skipping and disk errors. Brand new DVD's simply will not play on this player. Some will play flawlessly, but I have not made it through a single movie without the DVD player freezing or locking up. There are some cases where the player will shut itself off!As of now it will not play 75% of my DVD's, saying \\"disc error\\".

About 3 MOnths ago, it started to take to skipping. It does not happen on all DVDs, but most. Usually it takes about 30-40 Minutes, and then you have to turn the playe off and on to get it to stop if you are lucky. Also, it sometimes does not read DVDs in the tray. Pretty poor in my opinion.That being said, the one positive I will give it is that the Picture is really nice. I don't know that I would buy a Toshiba DVD player again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reliable, good value","review":"I have owned this DVD/CD 5 disc changer for nearly 2 years and used it daily for both DVDs and CDs. No reliability problems with the machine or the remote. It is true that the remote is not very intuitive, and some time needs to be invested in reading the owner's manual. It's also true that automatic disc changing and programming is not speedy. If you master the remote, you rarely have to touch the machine except to change discs, so the \\"cheap button feel\\" mentioned in other reviews becomes a non-issue. I disagree with the few reviews that note poor picture quality. I do agree with most of the other reviewers who approve of the picture quality. It's important to understand that the progressive scan won't help the picture quality unless you also invest in a component video output cable, HD-ready TV, and know how to use the remote to set up the progressive scan feature. The price on this unit makes it a very good value."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Piece of Electronic Equipment I've EVER Purchased!","review":"Just forget it. Don't buy it, period.

I had a Panasonic before and it would hang-up to the point where it was unwatchable on about 40% of the movies I tried watching. This machine has none of those issues.Yes, it is slow to power up...so what, who cares if it takes 10 seconds instead of 5.The on-screen menu is a bit annoying...can't just read things off of the player itself, you have to have the TV on.Bottom line: name brand, good quality, great features, all for [a good price].

I called Toshiba and they said the CD lens probably needs to be replaced, I called an authorized service center and that would cost $150. haha.We had a Sony before that likewise died after about 2 years...From reading reviews, it seems that anywhere from 30-50% of even high-end CD/DVD players won't last more than 2 years.It really is ridiculous."},{"rating":"1","title":"PIece of junk","review":"This is the worse piece of junk.

It also has no USB port. These comments are available in the discussion/comments sections after some reviews, but a lot of people have bought this frame without reading those sections and I thought it was worth stating.

When I called the company that sold the item via Amazon, I was told that the long retired old model was only in brown color and the new model is only in black.

The display is dim and blurry. This frame has taken my 8 megapixel photos and made them look like old grainy photos. The aspect ratio is wrong which means that you are not getting the benefit of a 9\\" screen unless you crop every picture. If you display them straight from the camera, you lose an inch on each side due to the aspect ratio.

I guess its OK but it isn't what I expected it to be. For one thing it didn't come with any instructions or info on how to set up the photo's on the memory card or how to put some of them into it's limited internal memory. I read reviews that said it would show several 100 to 1000's of photos on one 512mg SD card. I cant get it to show more than about 120 photos and only those on the card that are not in a folder and only in one long slide show. I cant get it to show anything in separate folders or sub-folders. As for the mp3 playing I haven't tried that yet.Picture quality is OK and it only takes extra time to load them if they are very large. If you re-size them for the size of the screen they load OK.

Yeah, it's 9 inches diagonal but it's not a usable 9 inches unless you have pictures of tall buildings. There is also a very wide white band between the frame and the LCD to make silly people think it's bigger.You can look at my video and see the difference between the picture on the box and the actual item.And according to the directions, you can only load 14 photos in this thing.For normal photos, you will maybe get a usable 6-1/2 inches out of this, with an ugly blackish-grey band around it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"Bought 1 Item and got some cheap junk..... item was completely different from what was pictured.... picture quality was like garbage!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment when it only displayed pictures once","review":"yes it displayed all of the pictures once, in a wide format that is not very high and is a bit grainy.

Pictures also take a good 5 seconds to show up in the slideshow mode. Other than that, the frame itself is cheap plastic, and there is no USB port, which is a huge bother.

Instead of being a straightforward biography, it seeks to extract the moral lessons from President Washington's life. This technique bears much fruit for thought. Particularly, I was struck by Brookhiser's focus on George Washington as the father of our country and how it speaks to us today-in an age of broken and nonfunctioning families. There are many good lessons to learn from Washington's life in this book. The one thing that keeps me from giving this book five stars is Brookhiser's tendency to slant how he thinks Washington would deal with modern issues (public education for example) in a way that makes them very like Brookhiser's views. However, this happens only a few times and as it is obvious when he is doing so, does not warrant too much concern. I recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok but not for your first Washington biography","review":"The author covers a lot of ground in a very limited number of pages. The result is a lack of a general biographical sketch of Washington. I would agree with other reviews that a more comprehensive biography would be a better choice for a first read on Washington."},{"rating":"2","title":"Founding Father","review":"It is unfortunate that Washington has been reduced to an unsmiling portrait on a one dollar bill, the story that he had wooden teeth, and a fable about him fessing up to chopping down a cherry tree. Here was THE founding father of our country. In an era of great patriots: Jefferson, Madison, Adams, Henry, they chose him to be their leader. It is not unreasonable to state that if it were not for Washington there would be no United States today. Brookhiser successfully examines Washington the icon and gives us insight into Washington the man. Washington's accomplishments are staggering to consider. He had the sagacity to defeat the most powerful military force in his time AND launched a new nation that would endure throughout the ages. This book should be read by every American. In a sense he is a father to us all. I wish the book was larger in scope."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing new","review":"It is puzzling why someone would be motivated to write a book on Washington with nothing new to offer.

Gabriel leaves behind common facts of life (treated sometimes abstractly, as usual), to talk about mental conficts (paranoia, and amnesia, just for mentioning a couple), and politic dimmension. The music is a mixture of new-wave-punk, and the beginning to the experiment with ethnic rythms, which was formally introduced in 'Security'.

But if , like me, you actually want to know how to do centering prayer, then don't bother with this book. It tells you just about everything you could wish to know about the history, benifits, and application of centering prayer (it even tells you how to structure centering prayer retreats and seminars). But unbelievably, within its 254 pages Pennington devotes little more than one page on how to actually do it, and what he does say is vague and interspersed with latin phrases.

The album has a great summertime vibe, high energy, and takes me right back to the Tattoo You era and 1981-82. My only complaint about Still Life is there aren't enough songs - and with a band like the Stones they can't include everything, but there's nothing from the Sticky Fingers/Let It Bleed period. Still Life focuses on, understandably, Ronnie Wood material and some standard classics. I'd love to have Hang Fire, Waiting on a Friend, or Little T&A on this album though. Still Life for me is a must have, and a Stones album I listen to over and over year after year. Classic. Standout tracks include: Under My Thumb, Going to a Go Go, Just My Imagination."},{"rating":"1","title":"Steer clear of this bummer of a live one","review":"This dud of a live album finds the Stones phoning in fairly uninspiring renditions of songs at breakneck speed. Shattered loses its sleazy groove to the double time pace; Let Me Go feels like the throw-away track it was on Emotional Rescue. Only Under My Thumb, grossly underplayed in concert, and Going To a Go-Go are worth the price. Satisfaction sounds a lot better on Flashpoint as does Start Me Up. The must have live Stones albums still are Love You Live and Get Yer Ya Ya's Out. For die hard collectors only."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still Life","review":"Good live album. The CD came in ahead of the stated ship time and in very good condition.

This is definitely not a good place to start if you are just beginning to build or replenish a Stones music collection. This recording just doesn't sound very good. There are several 1981 bootlegs floating around that actually sound better than this commercial release. If you want good live Stones albums, you must get Get Yer Ya Ya's Out and Love You Live. Got Live If You Want It is also fun to listen to because you can really hear and feel the hysteria of their early 1960s UK fans. The Four Flicks DVD set from their 2003 concerts is also better and a good value. If you still have enough money left over to buy this one, you can probably find a lot of secondhand copies or maybe start looking for bootlegs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huh?","review":"How could anyone with even the vaguest idea of what makes the Rolling Stones great award this cd more than a star or two? This disc documents the Stones at their absolute nadir. If you like the idea of hearing the band play enormous stadiums while Jagger is at his preening, self carictured worst, and with Keef and Woody at their most inelegantly shwacked- then this is the album for you. A weird selection of poorly performed tunes. Ack."},{"rating":"2","title":"Right on. Not perfect, but a worthy performance.","review":"This is a great live album. I think Rolling Stone magazine was certainly too picky, and many others are over critical. You can't compare this album to older releases like \\"Ya-Ya's\\" or \\"Love You Live\\" because a lot of the material on this album was contemporary of the time, and sounds great. Highlights are definitely \\"Satisfaction\\" (possibly the BEST version!), \\"Under My Thumb\\", and \\"Start Me Up.\\" The only problem is that the film companion to this album, \\"Let's Spend the Night Together\\" (unfortunately no longer available), has far greater versions of \\"Let Me Go\\" (10x better), and \\"20 Flight Rock\\" than this album's, and the film also has live gems like \\"Hangfire\\", \\"Neighbors\\", and \\"Let it Bleed\\", which should have been included on this album. If you can, try and get the video, because when combined with \\"Still Life\\" you've got a great live Stones set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't listen to the critics","review":"The critics always pan this, don't listen to them. There is nothing profound here just a really good rock concert. Let Me Go is a great, faster improvement over the Emotional Rescue version, Just My Imagination is fabulous and even the golden oldie Time Is On My Side is put forth with ragged passion.This was the last tour that the Stones were confident enough to just go out and play with a few choice sidemen, not a huge posse of background singers and other players to cover up their slips. The magical key to a great Stones song is backup vocals from Keith and we get that here in spades.My only criticism of this record is that it's too short. There were lots of great songs from this tour that should have been included. She's So Cold, Beast of Burden and Let It Bleed come to mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay","review":"A lot of these songs are from the concert they gave that was broadcast live on (now defunct) ON TV. I didn't have ON TV in 1981, but I listened to the simulcast on the radio. But I didn't know it was going to be on when I turned on the radio in my kitchen as I made dinner. I turned on the radio to here \\"Let's Spend the Night Together\\" playing. And I thought, THIS BAND IS DOING A TERRIBLE RENDITION OF A STONES' SONG. I didn't think the band was the Stones!! They sounded too terrible. But then half way through the song, I realized it WAS the Stones. Being a Stones freak, I taped the show, anyway. Then when STILL LIFE came out, I saw it was from the same show. And it had that flacid live feel I'd heard on the radio. Mick's voice sounds NOTHING like his voice on the studio albums. IT SOUNDS LIKE A DIFFERENT, AND NOT VERY GOOD, BAND. The Stones get really sloppy when they play live, and it drives me nuts. I really only like their studio albums. STILL LIFE shows why."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Still Life\\" Paints a Pretty Picture","review":"Back on the 1981 tour, \\"Tattoo You\\" had just been released, and this album chronicles a strong outing by the Stones. And yes, ladies and gentlemen, Mick wore football pants and the Union Jack at the same time...who else has the swagger to pull that off?Anyway, like some folks have said, critics usually say this album isn't worth its salt. I disagree. Listen to the different take on \\"Under My Thumb\\"...it changes from a marimba-laced groove tune to a hard rock classic. What's more, the disc offers a fast-paced, energetic version of \\"Shattered,\\" as well as \\"Goin' to a Go-Go,\\" a Smokey Robinson classic that became a staple of that tour. Too bad we missed out on \\"She's So Cold\\" and got \\"Let Me Go\\" instead.In addition, \\"Start Me Up\\" was truly a new song on this tour, and it shows with the energy and excitement that comes through on this version. At one point, Mick asks the crowd, \\"Are you ready to rock and roll some more?\\"I know I am. Get this one ~LBS"},{"rating":"1","title":"Still Born","review":"A lifeless live CD.

The first time i watched it i was fairly unimpressed, now it is possibly my favorite film of all time.

As usual Cary Grant was superb. Katherine Hepburn was as well. I loved her character because although she was rich, she was down to earth and liked simple things. As with Cary Grant's character and so with her character money did not mean happiness to them.I strongly recommend this to anyone who loves Cary Grant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Holiday","review":"As leading man, Grant was unequalled, the epitome of charm, and Cukor's \\"Holiday\\" finds him in peak form, starring opposite the redoubtable Hepburn in this giddily amusing romantic comedy. Based on Philip Barry's Broadway play, this was the third Grant-Hepburn pairing in as many years, and one of the sauciest, as the young would-be lovers buck the dictates of high society. With excellent supporting work by Lew Ayres as Hepburn's alcoholic brother, and Edward Everett Horton as Grant's bosom friend, \\"Holiday\\" is an antic riff on lives of privilege."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grant and Hepburn's Best Pairing!!","review":"Although probably the least well known, Holiday is Cary Grant and Katharine Hepburn's best movie collaboration. The script has that unmistakable Broadway freshness and Hollywood-free feel about it. Like The Philadelphia Story, Holiday's supporting characters were incredibly inviting and zany! But I found Grant and Hepburn's characters much more appealing and human than \\"Philadelphia\\"! This is one of the best transfers from stage to screen that I have ever seen a story and script make! A must-see for any Grant or Hepburn fan!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Fun","review":"How can you go wrong with Grant and Hepburn? Sophisticated socialite falls for every day Joe while on vacation. Engagement does not go over well with the Park Avenue family though things really get interesting when the new beau meets the sister. A mild commentary on the corruption of money, the movie is also loaded with great lines, high society glam, and an impressive rec room tumbling show. Only complaint, the real romance is saved for the last scene. Recommended for anyone looking for quality, clean, fun with some light romance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Holiday","review":"Holiday really has little to do with the Holiday. It is a fun light hearted movie with characters who are deeply disturbed. It's all about three very rich adult siblings that live with their controlling father. One complies, one lost & confused & one plain intoxicated. Well the compliant one is wanting to marry free spirited Cary Grant (he is innocent yet resolute). Lew Ayers plays the intoxicated brother \\"Ned\\"; very well, I might add. Katherine Hepburn plays the older sister. She loves her siblings very much & she makes you somehow love them too. Katherine Hepburn plays her part almost too well. She is so good in her roll you really can be cought up in her melancholy. Edward Everett Horton & Jean Dixon bring lightheartedness, wimsy & relief to this movie. Cary Grant is delightful. You are sure to enjoy Holiday."},{"rating":"2","title":"very entertaining but a little stagy","review":"This is a film version of a Philip Barry play, and like \\"The Philadelphia Story\\" (which he also wrote, and the film version of which also stars Cary Grant and Katharine Hepburn) this movie has sparkling dialogue, memorable supporting characters, and occasional heavy-handed commentary. But it's very entertaining, and the leads and most of the supporting cast are great. Grant, in particular, manages to give a very effective and human performance in a role that could easily be a plot device, and Edward Everett Horton and Jean Dixon are a total hoot as the very unconventional friends of Grant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awaiting DVD","review":"Saw this great movie again on TCM this week. Now that Bringing Up Baby is finally out on DVD, this one moves to the top of my pining list."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best comedies of all time","review":"They don't make 'em like this anymore, and we're the worse for it.Katharine Hepburn and Cary Grant star in this 1938 comedy directed by George Cukor. Grant plays an idealistic young man, engaged to the daughter of a wealthy New York banker.Will Grant conform and take a position with the bank, or will he stand up for his ideals? Only his fiancee's sister, played by Hepburn, sees things Grant's way, but does he even know she exists? The dialogue is rapid-fire, the comedy is outright hilarious, and the film keeps us guessing about its resolution, right up until the very last frame. Sheer poetry!Holiday rivals Bringing up Baby as one of the best comedies of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"They don't make 'em like they used to","review":"Movies express a vision of how we see ourselves or how we would like to see ourselves in the time they were made. On the surface, Holiday is a lovely fluff comedy with two of the screen's greatest stars. It is very funny. The acrobatic Hepburn and Grant show off delightfully and, for my money, have a better chemistry than Hepburn and Tracy ever had. That said, there are more serious issues, even if they seem somewhat dreamy and hollywoodilistic (so to speak). Lew Ayers as the weak, drink addicted brother, is very touching. Edward Everett Horton and Ruth Donnelly all but steal the scenes they are in, and social-economic issues are dealt with with a deft and subtle hand. A classic screwball comedy, which should be seen in the context of You Can't Take it With You and Mr. Deeds Goes to Town."},{"rating":"2","title":"movie","review":"We love these old movies and our teen grand children can watch them with us.

For those who found it a ponderous bore should avoid \\"Holiday\\" at all costs. \\"Holiday\\" is the more excrutiating of the two films with characters even less interesting. Despite their Herculean efforts to breathe life into this inert material neither Cary Grant nor Katharine Hepburn makes you care much about their characters. The fault lies not only with an uninteresting script but also with the lackluster direction of George Cukor, probably the most overrated director this side of Vincente Minnelli. Yawn!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Communist Clap Trap","review":"This movie is dissappointing from start to finish. The only character in the whole thing who seems to have any sense is Mr. Seton, the old-ish looking 58 year old father of Linda, Julia, and Ned.

Oh, and some somersaults along with bored wealthy folks and the traditional theme of getting married."},{"rating":"2","title":"All time favorite movie","review":"I've owned this film for years, first in VHS, then DVD as soon as it was available. It is quite witty, at times hilarious (the reaction to cousins Seton and Laura Cram arrival in the playroom is priceless!) then melancholic, then uplifting. Plenty of fun too, with Grant & Hepburn showing off their athleticism with acrobatic flair. Many different characters and some unusual messages for a 30's film, with a cast of pros and great Cukor direction. Hepburn and Grant cannot be beat, Lew Ayres is just great, but for me the best of the bunch are Edward Everett Horton and Jean Dixon. A true classic that can be enjoyed time and time again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My All-Time Favorite Movie","review":"Wish I had had the chance to have seen HOLIDAY at one of those huge and majestic cinematic palaces of yesteryear. As soon as I saw it for the first time about 23 years ago on the small screen it fast became my favorite movie of all time. Absolutely underrated, this gem is a joy to see time and again. You'll fall in love with Hepburn and be captivated by the dialogue. Every scene will have you glued to your seat and you'll soon fall under its spell. The theme is timeless and the movie rises above any romantic comedy of then or now. Pure Magic . . . . not to be missed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Family's Struggle","review":"Eisenhart uses a series of poems to tell the story of her mother's life and struggle with Alzheimer's disease.The mother, Viola, was not necessarily an easy woman for her children to deal with, but she lived passionately and expressed herself vividly.After the death of her husband, everything changed. Without his assistence, suddenly she could no longer conceal her memory loss. Gaps in her memory brought rage first, then panic. Her children had to deal with unwarrented suspicion and their own fear about her driving. Ultimately, they persuaded her to go into a nursing home.Eisenhart's tender, perceptive poems, illustrated with family photos, make this book one that any family in a similar situation can relate to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great buy!","review":"Haven't used these yet but they feel great and the price couldn't be beat.

The color is like what's on the screen, and I was happy with both that and the softness. However, within one week of use, a number of little holes have appeared on one end of the sheets and all over, I can see that fuzzy nubby look beginning that appears far later on quality material, including other jersey. It's like a Swiss cheese look and doesn't bode well for the future durability of these sheets.I'm surprised because none of the other reviews indicate such a problem. So maybe it's just mine. But if I were to do it again, I'd go for some sheets at Target or Ross with a slightly higher thread count and close to the same price."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best Buys on Amazon","review":"I bought these in two colors for a Christmas gift for my daughter.

Finding them at an incredible price, I ordered two sets! However, the quality of these jersey sheets were not the excellent quality I had bought several years ago at a wholesale warehouse. We are using them on our queen size bed, and love the feel of the soft jersey, but they do not retain their shape after you toss and turn on them a few times. I don't know how they will respond after they are washed again, but I do miss the heavier knit of my old worn out sheets."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap, and You Get What You Pay For","review":"I bought this sheet set because it looked like a great deal. It wasn't. The sheets are very comfortable, but they developed several small holes after just one washing. The material is so thin that it barely keeps together.

He utilised the best session musos of the time (84' to 85') and recorded the album in a state of the art studio with a producer and engineer who's ears must have been made from gold. It was one of Manu Katche's first big albums showing his expertise in drumming (and still does) and thanks to Peter for introducing Manu to the mainstage of pop music.

This album combines the more recent rock influence of Peter's music with his traditional melancholy. Keep in mind that Peter Gabriel was Genesis before it was gutted out by Phil Collins (a good but unrepentent commercial musician). If you must listen to one of Peter's albums, then try So. Should you like his intensity and his very special way of grabbing your soul, then try Solsbury Hill and then perhaps the early Genesis - pure Peter Gabriel. A great artist. A great man.-Philippe"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Quiet and Introspective CD","review":"This CD was a great commercial success for Peter Gabriel, and may actually be his best CD to date. \\"Sledgehammer\\" became a popular video on MTV. \\"Big Time\\" received a great deal of airplay. \\"Red Rain\\" was played as background theme music on \\"Miami Vice\\". \\"In Your Eyes\\" went on to become one of the most popular and likable love songs of the decade.

The weirdness & bizarre elements that made his first four masterpiece albums so dangerous (and they're all masterpieces with 3 & Security being the peak period)is toned down towards sentimental overstatements like \\"Red Rain\\" & \\"Don't Give Up,\\" infectiously silly but quite shallow hit tracks like \\"Sledgehammer\\" & \\"Big Time\\" ( rather than awesomely nutcase ones like \\"Shock the Monkey\\" & \\"Games Without Frontiers\\") & the album would get only 3 stars if not for great 3 track combination of That Voice Again, In Your Eyes & Mercy Street & the great \\"We Do What We're Told Milgram's 37\\" that comes after the annoying distraction of the loud & funky \\"Big Time.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Peter Gabriel Lost Me Here...","review":"This was a very disappointing album when released and it hasn't grown in stature over the last 20 years for me. \\"Red Rain\\" gets the album off to an incredible start and really faked me out. Metallic percussion returns and adds a high end back to the sound. \\"Sledgehammer\\" is okay for a hit single, but weak for Gabriel. His vocals don't fit with soul music at all. \\"Don't Give Up\\" is an interminable Kate Bush duet that in no way justifies it's 6:30 length! The only other A-class material here is the superb \\"In Your Eyes.\\" It is such a strong song it makes me flabbergasted to think that the awful Roseanna Arquette is the inspiration for it!

Close to it... Edgar Froese was the founder of Tangerine Dream, and here's that fabulous track, worth the entire album.

Twenty years ago, when I first saw him, I had been out of work for six months and was in constant excruciating pain. (Childbirth years later, was by comparison a piece of cake.) His examination was a revelation, and so were his treatments--an intensive therapy program that restored my health and for 20 years has prevented a recurrence.Back pain produced by the muscular-skeletal imbalances that Dr. Michele addresses here are threatening only to quality of life. But as sufferers know too well, what is the value of life if one can barely walk, sit or stand?

Because Eric's isn't available, I replaced it with Sierra's Hoyle Solitaire and Mahjong Tiles, the best I thought available. Boy was I wrong! Sierra's Hoyle Solitaire DOES NOT HAVE FEATURES/OPTIONS that are available on other software (not only Eric's Ultimate):NO \\"AUTOPLAY\\", so every card must be clicked and dragged even when winning is definite;NO \\"RETRY GAME\\" - you get one chance and that's it;NO \\"HINTS\\";\\"UNDO\\" is good for only one play;NO \\"FLYING CARDS\\" option.Do yourself a favor and look elsewhere for a solitaire game and don't make the same mistake I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware this outdated software","review":"This software is designed to run on a monitor at 640x480 resolution. This means that if you are using a relatively new computer (less than 5-6 years old) your resolution is probably greater than 640x480. If so, the game area will not fill your screen, rather it will shrink depending on how high your resolution is. The window you are running in will fill the screen, but Sierra fills the space not used by the shrinking game area with black. My monitor is a couple of years old, but was designed to run at 1280x1024. The actual game area uses about the center 1/3 of the screen. The card backs on the Solitaire are so small I have to strain to read them. I guess you could change your screen resolution before you play and then change it back afterwards, but that makes the game too much trouble for me. It is a shame too, because the games are quite good (probably 4 stars) if you can see them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very Mac OSX-friendly . . .","review":"Not sure how this package of games works on a PC, but is is not very Mac OSX-friendly, from what I can tell. (It is listed as Mac friendly, but I suspect it is probably more PC-oriented.) There are no drop-down menus, and finding instructions for the numerous games - - when there are some - - is not easy, either. The printed materials are virtually useless for this purpose, also. Finally, it seems to be fickle about whether it will let you add players. In short: the CD has dozens of games you can play; but if you are unfamiliar with the game's rules or objects, you wind-up having to try to figure it out for yourself.

They arrive on the ship by means of a matter transmitter (like a teleporting device) because the ship is already so deep into space. Now you know that tragedy will eventually strike, but it's difficult to get around the science to the real reason for the accident. Occasionally Pohl gets too deep into scientific statistics, but then again, some people enjoy that realism. I, however, don't. The flat characters add little to the book. There are lots of conversations between them after the accident, but these are not deep characters; you understand most of them pretty quickly after they are introduced. Although there is a nice dose of suspense, the lack of any interesting plot or characters made this a book I wished I hadn't spent any time on even though I finished in two days.

The biggest critique I have to that it is very formal German; my uncle said about a few of the phrases, \\"Nobody says it that way,\\" but you can't expect a book like this to be too heavy on the slang, which is regional and shifts anyway.

Osborne maintains (I am not far from quoting) that unless a woman gets married, gets pregnant, and has a bunch of kids she will never be satisfied. A woman's place is in the home, a man's is at the office, and apparently realizing this is supposed to let you and your mate in on your true identities and lead to blissful lives. Furthermore (and perhaps worse), Osborne insists on stereotyping males and females in ways that were very offensive to both me and my husband. Example: women like to fight to test whether their husband will dominate them, because in the end they like to be dominated. The further we read, the more disgusted we became. Unless you live on some other planet or possibly in some other time period, this book will only lead to MISunderstanding each other.

I bought this DVD because of them and the glowing reviews. I have to say that I didn't enjoy this one at all for many reasons.I watched the first hour before I gave up on it and did not find one scene to be memorable or engrossing. The characters were all stereotypes with no real development to make them real. Tom Selleck's character lacked all the touches that made his other characters special. The plot was typical cowboy cliches. The soundtrack was loud, extremely dated, and annoying.I could sit and watch all eight hours of Lonesome Dove at one time or a dozen hours of Deadwood. I didn't even bother to finish watching this and I don't feel like I missed anything. If it had been good enough to keep watching, I would have given it two stars.Oh well, back to Quigley Down Under, Crossfire Trail, and Monte Walsh for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who paid these reviewers?","review":"I can not understand these raving reviews. The comparison to Lonesome Dove makes me almost as queasy as this series. The acting by Sam Eliot was over the top. Lifetime relationships were formed and broken in minutes over the most trivial of things. The character played by Tom Selleck loses a wife and is tomcatting in the next five minutes.I did not know whether to laugh or cry with the cardboard characters portrayed by the mother and the dumb blond Selleck fell in love with. The ending was lame and anti climatic. Veteran actors such as Glen Ford/Slim Pickens/John Vernon/etc reduced to Monty Python status. Did these people really see westerns such as Lonesome Dove or Broken Trail or Unforgiven or The Outlaw Josey Wales or The Good,The Bad and the Ugly, just to name a few???

This book was so good I wound up buying a copy for my brother-in-law, a painter, and one copy for a good friend, who does not paint but who wanted to try her hand at handpainting photographs. Both of them loved it! It's an art book, as well as an excellent guide."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor coverage; too much emphasis on details","review":"This book mainly focuses on one type of oil colouring medium (namely Marshall's photo oils) and explains its use in a detailed manner. Illustrations are quite much detailed. In fact, following only the pictures, you already have a rough idea of the method. Reading the whole text however, does not add much on top of it. The book doesn't cover different approaches and techniques and focuses on a particular method of the author. In this sense, if the name of the book was \\"How do I handcolour my photographs using Marshall's Oils\\" it would have been more appropriate. The guidelines given in the book might be useful for some beginners, however they are too much detailed. The author will try to encourage creativity, by giving certain guides which is a big contradiction. Portrait photography and it's colouring is emphasized in this book, which is another limitation."},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautiful and instructive handbook","review":"As an amateur photographer, I found the book beautifully designed and very well written.

Most of what's said in the book you can learn it yourself. Furthermore, it looks like a publicity from Marshall. It asumes that Marshall products are the only way to handpaint photos, and never talks about other oils, watercolors, airbrushes, etc. If you are using Marshalls, the tips on how to mix paints can be very usefull."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not fit 2005 Tiburon GT 5 Speed","review":"This is not a direct replacement for a 2005 Hyundai Tiburon GT 5 speed Manual.

I feel that it is sad that many people feel the need to invent some feat of grand military derry-do to make a good story. If one studies the history of any great event, such as the Normandy invasion, one can find real heros and real acts of heroism that far out shine any fictional event a Hollywood writter might dream up. This event, involving a mere company of British Paras, is one of those actions. Mr. Ambrose did a fine job of telling their story, and hopefully, keeping Major Howard from fading into obscurity, as have other heros, such as Lt.Col Frost, Lt Col Herbert Jones, and countless others."},{"rating":"1","title":"A story in search of an author","review":"My goodness, but here is a terrific bit of history desperately in need of a decent author. Told properly, the final product should be one of those rare books you simply cannot put down. Alas, Professor Ambrose was the one to take up the challenge and what he has wrought is a most amateurish work. His narrative style can be wincingly painful. His is the kind of storytelling I used to read in grade school. At any moment I half-expected Frank and Joe Hardy to appear on the scene. You would be better served by watching THE LONGEST DAY. Darryl F. Zanuck \\"told\\" the story much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent-though some inaccuracies...","review":"Brilliant book- informative, detailed and painstakingly researched. I would also like to share my sadness at John Howard's passing...however, even Ambrose admits that not all the veterans who took part in the action agreed on what happened, but it is said that John Howard himself was not very happy about the amount of inaccuracies there were over the details of what happened that day. However, this should not overcloud the fact that this is a brilliant book and a must read for any historian. Stephen Ambrose has done it again..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy if you like war action !","review":"I had lot of expectations in this book. Unfortunately, the most important fight in the early hourd of D-Day were very little covered. Too much silly episodes, rather than a more comprhensive description of the firefight. On the other hand, you can find a very good introduction of training of company, the glider landing and the first minutes of the combat. After all, after LT. Brotheridge died, nothing more is clear, there is not anymore a storyline, it seemed that the author had to finish the book at a glance."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Heroic Story","review":"I think this book is a very good account of the men who took Pegasus Bridge on June 5th, 1944 on the eve of D-day.

I suffered through an entire book of horrid subplots. Where's the kender humor we all know and love? This book was a complete waste. The heroes were drab, the villains boring, and the entire convoluted basis of the story was not worthwhile. Plus, at the beginning of most chapters, there were confusing nararrator's notes which successfully broke the feel of being with the characters. Additionally, the end was weak and unfulfilling. One more thing...It's incohesive with the rest of the wonderful DragonLance saga. Please, for the sake of your sanity, DO NOT READ THIS BOOK!

It has been a long time since I've read a book that's so without talent and story. It seems to me that it has been written only to bring in some cash for TSR.

Also people have been complaining about the fact that he did not live up to the stories that Tasslehoff told of him. Well Tas like most kender EXAGERATES! Of course he isn't quite as legendary as Tas's tales said he was, they were kender tales. All in all this has the whole package, good story, some gullu dwarves (a little bit more intelligent than the norm, but like before it's nice to see some change.Over come by wanderlust (like all kender) Trapspringer ends up traversing Krynn, falling into company with a couple of gully dwarves and an evil fiend.

There is a 1 year warranty, but who's going to go through the hassle of sending in a [price] phone to get fixed? So I opened it up to see what happened. There was a wire that had come unsoldered, but there was also a ribbon cable that had been cut and repaired with tape during manufacturing.

However, this one has some serious weaknesses apart from the fact that I personally don't like made up kingdoms and princesses. Part of the story is set in Austria and therefore there are some supposedly German parts mixed into the dialogue. However, Ms. Barton should do a little more research to offer correct German. Only because there are Umlaute does not mean that every vowel gets two little dots on top. The question 'How are you\`, when literately translated, asks for a characteristic of a person rather than being a polite formula.

He's happy, the songs are happy. Everything's peachy . . . that is, except the album. When Ashcroft, the undisputed master of melancholic love songs, shows up on other people's records (see The Chemical Brothers' \\"Come With Us\\" or UNKLE's \\"Psyence Fiction\\"), he delivers.

In the case of Point Break however the letterbox format was achieved by cropping the top and bottom off of the vhs scan. So, not only do you not get the full feature film, you don't even get the VHS view of the film. It's claustrophobic. There are scenes in this DVD that don't even makes sense, parts of people's faces are cut off. DO NOT BUY THIS [junk]!!! The picture is sharp, but it's like watching the movie through a keyhole!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Blu-Ray is decent","review":"I'm reviewing the Blu-Ray, not the movie.It's a decent transfer. Looks about as good as you would expect from an early 90s film. Maybe a little better. Sounds good too. Recommended if you like this movie.One thing to note is that this is 2.35:1 widescreen, which is what was shown in theaters. However, since it was shot on non-anamorphic Super 35, it's vertically cropped from the 4:3 TV/VHS version, so although you are seeing what you would have seen in theaters (and I'm guessing what was on the DVD release), and you are seeing a little bit more on the sides, you might notice that the frame is cropped from your VHS copy. But that's not a big deal, and is typical for films shot on Super 35."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thumbs down!!!","review":"Fox Home Video messed up again... Like they did with their European release of Point Break released a year ago. I am a huge Point Break fan and I know this movie by heart.. I know every detail. So when I bought the DVD I thought something was missing, so I dug out my old Point Break on VHS ( 4:3 format )... NOOOO !! WHAT HAVE THEY DONE !!! THOSE INCOMPETENT.... They had actually cut approx. 1/3 of the movie format by adding black lines to make it look like Wide screen enhanced... Again... Like they did with the European version. Do NOT buy this crap!!! If somebody at FOX reads this, Can I please have my money back?"},{"rating":"2","title":"100% Pure Adrenaline","review":"First I have to say, that as a surfer, I am biased. However I LOVED this movie. It is definitely in my top 10 action films of all time. Keanu is, well, Keanu, no better, no worse. Busey is probably better than average here, Swayze doesn't fit the role, but does a decent job with it nonetheless. Lori Petty was beautiful, sexy, and believable as Tyler, and the everpresent B-movie staple, John C. McGinley was great as Harp. Chili Pepper Anthony Kiedis makes a cameo, too.The action sequences were superb, especially the breathtaking skydiving scenes. This movie also has arguably the best two man chase scene in movie history. The plot is fairly original and engaging, and Keanu has a few good one-liners that elicit a chuckle every time. My only real complaint is that this movie is not available on DVD in the US."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't buy the dvd","review":"all the dvd is, is the vhs version with the top and bottom cut off on the screen.i rented the vhs and dvd together one day and found once you get passed the widescreen intro that the vhs version actually shows more of the movie. the dvd is the full screen version with the top and bottom removed!this is ridiculous. go rent it yourself and see."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT Blu-ray Quality - DVD Quality on Blu-ray disc","review":"I LOVE THIS MOVIE!

What was even more ironic, I was charged for the shipping. I will never purchase another dvd and/or cd from you, unless, maybe it is something I just cannot locate in my local area."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did I See The Same Movie?","review":"I'll go out on a limb here as probably the ONLY person who totally loathed this movie. Let's see...it was annoyingly predictable from beginning to end, poorly acted--and that's saying something for Keanu Reeves, and the \\"action\\" sequences, if they can be called that, were uninspiring at best. I'm not sure where all the described adrenalin rushes were coming from, but you'd have to be painfully wound up already to get them from this flick. About the only redeeming thing about his picture(if you're a woman,anyway)is seeing Mr. Reeves looking fairly buff. The only reason I give this a star at all is because you can't get out of the review field without one. This isn't a good \\"bad\\" movie, it's just plain bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terribly Disappointing","review":"This was a horrible movie to say the least. I was greatly disappointed. It was highly immoral and most of the people hardly had any clothes on. Besides that kind of stuff, the movie portrayed the rebellious, thieving bad guys as the good guys. By the end of the movie, you actually started to feel sorry for the bad guys.Not worth anyone's time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad","review":"It wasn't a good movie. It isn't for kids.

I also know Lori Petty can act, but again... she chose not to. Worst dialogue ever, worst portrayal of surfers ever... many, many \\"worst ever\\" trophies go to this movie. If you want to see Keanu in action, watch Constantine, and skip this aweful movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved this Film","review":"This film was fascinating! James Spader characterization was engrossing. Have watched this depiction several times and seem not to get tired of it.

All of which I would recommend highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Historical Pic","review":"This movie starts very slowly, but picks up momentum fast.It is a clear and even moving account of Daniel Ellsberg, and his transformation from a gung-ho military analyst to the foremost opponent of the Vietnam War.It does a great job in making his evolution believable.The acting is good. James Spader is robotic, but that's appropriate to Ellsberg himself. Paul Giamatti is great as his also-evolving colleague. Claire Forlani begins better than she ends; toward the end of the movie she seems to be simply going through the motions--her performance lacks fire and sincerity. The woman who plays Ellsberg's first wife, however, is sensational.Several nice touches:The quick cuts between historical footage and what is happening in the film are seamless and powerful.The scenes in Vietnam are a revelation.The take on Nixon's thugs (Haldeman, Ehrlichman, Mitchell) is astonishing.An informative, powerful film."},{"rating":"2","title":"FROM BOTTOM TO THE TOP","review":"A FEW YEARS AGO I MOVED DOWN TO THE LITTLE LEAGUE LEVEL. THAT FIRST YEAR I LOST ALL MY GAMES. I FELT TERRIBLE. I TAUGHT THE PLAYERS EVERYTHING I COULD ABOUT DEFENSE AND HITTING.

THE FOLLOWING YEAR AND THIS LAST YEAR I MADE IT TO THE CHAMPIONSHIP AFTER COMING IN LAST THAT FIRST YEAR. I'VE PLAYED BASEBALL FOR YEARS AND PITCHED, BUT THIS BOOK ALSO SHOWED ME NOT HOW BUT WHY. THIS IS WHAT MADE THE DIFFERENCE. I UNDERSTOOD WHY AND THEN THEY UNDERSTOOD WHY THE BODY MUST MOVE IN CERTAIN WAYS. HIGHLY RECOMENDED."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Pitching Edge by Tom House","review":"House did not write this book for Little League coaches who want to help their kids. It is loaded with hyper-technical jargon that House does not explain and won't make sense to experienced players and coaches. For example, in a section on how to pitch off a mound, House states, \\"A pitcher must find and keep an upper body spine-to-hip relationship with a constant angle of flex in posting knee at front leg lift, stride and landing -- directing upper body into torso rotation and launch of a baseball.\\" What? His science may be correct, but you won't benefit from this book because House does not translate the science into common sense terms that ballplayers will understand."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book on how to make the most out of your pitching","review":"Tom House covers everything in this book. From strength training to mental training. This is the best book to buy if you are interested in improving Your pitching. The book is a great help for both the pitcher and the coach. I made my league's All-Star team thanks to this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good instruction","review":"I've been coaching my son in his pitching for the last four years now, and this is definitely the best book on technique and skill development I've ever encountered.

I already know the previous work of Moby Grape and I do not need Sam King telling me how good the group is. He is right but redundant. I want to know if there is anaything new on the record that I have not got or heard. From reading the 8 reviewers, I see no mention of any new material. I assume that everything on the record is recycled from the original releases and several previous compilations. A proper review might then begin with: \\"why does anyone need this. The second hand stores have copies of the previous compilations.\\" The next issue is why the record company did not release something new, like the Amsterdam concert. Should record companies be rewarded when they have such conservative release policies. Why buy these songs again? Foolish, right."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Live Up to the Hype","review":"Moby Grape is absolutely the most over-rated group to emerge from the late sixties. What little appeal they might have had is mitigated by the ridiculous claims of their followers, i.e. \\"better first album than the Beatle, Byrds, Stones, Airplane et al\\". At best, this is a highly debatable claim. At worst, it's a complete falsehood (my view).Spence's work on the first two Airplane albums is better than his work with the Grape thanks to the far superior vocals of Marty Balin/Signe Anderson/Grace Slick and the intiguing guitar interplay provided by Casady, Kantner and Kaukonen.I've tried to get into the Grape, several times. But the hype is such a turn off. Particularly when the group fails miserably to live up to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"My fifth favorite Gilliam film that fits into most genres.","review":"This film ranks with me 5th behind the Baron, Brazil, 12 Monkeys, and Fear & Loathing but that doesn't mean I think its bad. Not by any means. I am a loyal Gilliam fan and I never sell out. The casting of Williams was perfect and I loved how Gilliam combined this film into a drama/comedy/fantasy/adventure/romance. The romance element was very unexpected and it worked great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"Williams (Perry) is a homeless genius who lives in a fantasy world of Red Knights and King Arthur. Bridges is Jack, a radio personality whose career is destroyed after a listener acts out his advice. This tragedy brings Jack and his new homeless philosopher and friend together.There are many moments of joy, and heartbreak and romance. Fisher King is a wonderful movie for all to enjoy. Williams as always is brilliant. He will make you laugh, smile, cry and applaud. Bridges holds is own but Mercedes Ruehl is terrific! But the true star is film's message. The film is rated R for scene of nudity. Cover the kid's eyes for a few minutes and let them enjoy the rest of the film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don Quixote: modern day","review":"When a Shock Jock DJ's comments lead to a bar shootout, a chain of circumstances of failure and redemption begin. Jeff Bridges, the DJ, is still reeling three years after the incident when fate causes him to be saved by one of the victims' husband. The husband, played by Robin Williams, went crazy after the incident and is now on a Quixotic search for the holy grail. Through their misadventures they try to find their life again.In my opinion, this was an excellent Bridges movie, slightly reminiscent of his Lebowski character. Also, this was a good, although fairly unheard of, Williams film. I recommend this movie because it's a good mix of humor and seriousness. Also the movie is built with a good group of leading actors. This movie is good for your extensive film collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the very best","review":"Where was the studio's PR department on this one? It's amazing how many people have never heard of this movie when I recommend the video. I'm not going to go on and on raving, but just wanted to include my five star rating to the two other five star ratings already listed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uneven, cutesy in parts, Williams overacts again","review":"Generally unbelievable film about a man's dissolution and redemption. Jeff Bridges does a magnificent job with the material; unfortunately, Robin Williams is miscast as a crazy person (who has gone crazy by an act that was precipitated by Jeff Bridges' character). Williams should have played his part with some degree of complexity, but all that comes out is tics and showiness. What a shame. The script is uneven, in parts very insightful and in other places simply stupid (the dinner with the four main characters is just awful). If a the movie and therefore the script had been shortened by 30 minutes, the movie would have been much better. As it is, the unbelievability overwhelms whatever good points the movie has. Too bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"A few moments of truth amidst a lot of silliness.","review":"This movie has a few poignant lessons borrowed from Arthurian legends and the Don Quixote story--but read the originals instead of wasting time on this slow-moving film that is mostly filler between a few good scenes. By the time the Jeff Bridges character broke into the castle to steal the Grail, I no longer cared if he made it or what would happen if he brought it to Robin Williams.Good performances by Jeff Bridges and Mercedes Rhuel, just wish they'd had better material to work with. Robin Williams plays the type of character we're familiar seeing him do--zany, devil-may-care, society's-opinion-be-damned guy who tries too hard to make you love him."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst movie ever made","review":"The Fisher King is a disappointing myriad of chaotic film sequences, uninspiring characters, and a deliberately meaningless title. It mixes random delusion/fantasy sequences in a pale attempt to feign creativity. Viewers seeking a sensible, straightforward plot will be sorely disappointed. Viewers who prefer creative/fantasy movies will likely be insulted by this poor attempt to fill their needs. The Fisher King's only value is that of a poor abstract painting; people can look at it and pretend to each other that they \\"understand the deeper meaning\\". This film is about as deep as a cookie sheet."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst film i have ever seen","review":"I went to see this film when it was released in England and it was the most boring 2 hours of my life.

The story is a familiar Gilliam theme - treading the fine line between reality and fantasy. What makes this film great is the believability and soul of the story. Gilliam pulls it off brilliantly thanks to a great script and a GREAT cast.Robin Williams and Jeff Bridges along with Mercedes Ruehl and Amanda Plummer gave outstanding performances. Williams is great as always and Bridges is at the top of his craft.Heartwarming, surprising, and unique - if you haven't watched this - get it now. If you have, you'll enjoy watching this story of love again and again."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Modern Day Fairy Tale Classic","review":"One of my absolute favorites, this gem of a film is a comedy, a drama, a romance and a fantasy film all rolled into one. Combined with the twisted & irreverent filmmaking style of Terry Gilliam (\\"12 Monkeys\\" and \\"Time Bandits\\") this film is not for everyone, but for those who like something different and maybe even a little magical, you can't go wrong with this one. Robin Williams and Jeff Bridges are two men from two different worlds, but both lost and in pain. Mercedes Ruehl and Amanda Plummer are the women in their lives. When circumstanes bring them together, they are able to save one another. A sadly overlooked film filled with wonderment and, in the end, joy."},{"rating":"1","title":"POOR LENS!","review":"I purchased this tele converter lens as an add on to my Canon PowerShot S60. Boy was I disappointed. Let me first say that you first have to purchase an adapter to use this lens with my model (S60). Not a big deal since the adapter wasn't too expensive. The bad news is that the lens and adapter do not feel secure. As far as performance....the lens does what is says (brings in the shot 2X). However the images taken with the lens are terrible. The lens feels bulky and leaves a dark spot in the lower right hand corner of all images taken with the lens on. Do not purchase this lens.

I first encountered this work in the early 1960s and have off and on over the years read it again and again. As the author so well puts it \\"The Great American Novel Told Without Words.\\" Ths illustrations are of course pure Gross and there is humor in every frame, from the first to the last. This is certainly a work that proves that a picture is worth a thousand word, although in this case, the pictures cover many more words than the saying goes.

The papers of women like Ida McKinley and Bess Truman have been destroyed by their families. There are no biographies at all of most of the First Ladies. So how in the world can these women be fairly judged when contrasted with modern activist women like Lady Bird, Hillary and Betty Ford? I saw none of this addressed in the text at all. This is ahistorical and does much damage. Also, the role of women is different. And there are no specific duties of a First Lady like there are for a President - so they are all different.

The authors eventually define what they mean by 'insanity' in an appendix but even here there is no mention of differences in diagnostic criteria that have existed in different places at different times and still do exist.

It's the same \\"cooky\\" book my mom had me look through to pick out recipes to make together, only this one doesn't have pages falling out... yet. Many of the recipes are dates and sometimes ingredients aren't as available as they were in the 1960's, but it adds to the fun.

None of the pictures of cookies in the book actually look good to eat.

Before she could walk she would push it along as she crawled. As an early walker, she pulled it behind her, now as a steady walker she pushes it ahead of her, as intended. It's a great, battery-free toy. Dog has solid wood construction with leather ears.

I mean, amazing amazing amazing.... if you missed this album you are missing out on True and Filling food for the soul. This has got to be apart of any Gospel fans collection. I can't say enough about it... the first song I heard by Donald Lawrence was \\"Message for the Saints\\" and I was amazed at the character of the song, what I mean by that is... that blending of different sounds and octaves it was just a really uplifting song and it still has the same power today as it did back then.

Well, we'll let them enjoy their little preteen fantasies, I suppose. But a more mature person such as I will not tolerate fakes like this who only got into the business because they're cute little Backstreet Boys clones. Go ahead and say my review is unhelpful, honey, you know I'm right. And wtf are they doing stealing Play's song?! Those girls at least can sing and don't flash skin.

Like all lousy, didn't-write-their-own-songs boy bands, this one's album cover shows all of their heads impossible to miss. But this time, a generic teenage girl's bed occupies the bottom 5 inches as she dreams exclusively of 1 no-name. While this is a decent attempt to water-down the shock of seeing the 5 boys' disembodied heads, a black space would be much more pleasant to look at."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure ****","review":"First of all I am not under 13. I just didn't want to give out information. I haven't heard this cd, but i have seen them perfrom on Go For It and they are terrible. They cannot dance and their songs are cheesy. If I were u guys, I would listen to S Club's new sound. They songs are way different then before. I never liked them before until \\"Don't Stop Movin'\\" came out and now I love all of their songs. Listen to \\"Alive\\", \\"Don't Stop movin'\\", \\"Dance\\", \\"The Greatest\\" and many more. The S Clubs new sound rocks.

I recomend buying the Dream Street debut CD instead of this soundtrack!"},{"rating":"2","title":"OMG LOVE IT!!!","review":"The songs are great, a must have 4 ds fans.

It was very pro breeder overall. The main reason there are so many wonderful dogs in rescue , is that breeders pop out many pups to make money, but never educate people on the specific needs of these dogs.If you are looking for an ig book, go elsewhere.

I'd only seen him in The Crow, which he was excellent in (and he was accidentally killed when filming of his character's death scene in the final week of production went horribly wrong...some idiot left a real round in the gun, and the actor playing the thug fired it, killing Mr. Lee), and I wanted to see him in another movie. The film has a lot of good one-liners, and plenty of explosive action. As he would show in The Crow, Mr. Lee has really good fighting moves. Mr. Lundgren is also good, but really, see this movie for Mr. Lee's (tragically) penultimate performance in a motion picture. Ms. Carrere is also good in this movie. Was that really her naked as she got into the futon and during the sex scene?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rent it then forget about it","review":"Movie critics often make the mistake of attempting to review martial arts films as serious pieces of work. So naturally they end up trashing the film because 'it' doesn't have the chops (no pun intended). But this 87-minute total rental is worth every penny. Park your brain at the door and enjoy the snappy cliche dialogue which actually has a lot of humour, the superb (for a low-budget American production) martial arts editing, and most of all the looks on the actors faces, most of whom look like they can't believe they did this film for the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"really uncool woman scene","review":"The scene with the woman and the bad guys, just couldn't watch it and, therefore, made the whole movie seem evil."},{"rating":"1","title":"yeah..whatever..doesnt add up","review":"Lee and Lundgren partner up and take down the badguys..Lundgren gets the girl played by Tia CArerre and then kills the badyguy at the end with the help of Brandon Lee.....bad script..bad acting..though Lee gets some few good fight scenes he cant save this one from being a dud....a dud like Lundgren..Lundgren cant act is all im saying..and if you people think so..your all weird in the head...Lee's worst movie..RENT THE CROW DAMNIT!!! or at least The Legacy Of Rage"},{"rating":"1","title":"a very bad film","review":"is the worst film that y watched in my life, is as stupid as his characters and his public."},{"rating":"2","title":"Before The Crow, He was a Cop","review":"This film here was the first Brandon Lee American movie. He had done some limited TV spots and a film in Hong Kong prior to Showdown in Little Tokyo though. For a low-budget film, it's sure to keep both Lee and Lundgren fans enthralled. The fight scenes are well choreographed, and the banter between Lee and Lundgren adds some humor as well. Watching Lee's budding talent, it makes you wonder what would have been had he not died on the set of The Crow. Don't expect the quality of The Crow here, but Showdown in Little Tokyo is definitely worth picking up. It would have been nice if the DVD was offered in widescreen, and if some extras had been thrown in, but the film alone is worth the price of admission."},{"rating":"2","title":"Showdown in Little Tokyo","review":"Talk about a culture-clash. A white American male raised in the samurai ways in Japan, and an adopted Japanese-American male trained in the Californian ways are matched up in the LAPD to bring down the source of a new and deadly drug. Forced to work together,Chris Kenner teaches Johnny Murata about the heritage he scoffs at while Johnny offers quirky remarks and comic timing.

If not, you may want to pass. While the martial arts work is slick, and the dialog is peppered with some good humor, the plot is rather lacking. To top it off, Stephen Glantz (writer) has apparently never actually spoken to a woman, because he certainly can't write for them. Tia Carrere is utterly wasted (yes, even for her skills, this is a waste) in the most unrealistic female character in film. Even her nude scenes are a body double.If your looking for martial arts action you haven't already seen, you could get this one.

It inspires children to be happy through actions based on their own instinct and conscience, rather than absolute direction or authority from others."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you want your kid to end up on welfare read them this book...","review":"The message in this book is reflective of the overall tone of American society these days: \\"Don't have ambition or push yourself, simply settle for what makes you comfortable and you'll be happy.\\" The book blatantly puts a negative spin on the characters in the book that are striving to push themselves outside of their comfort zone and grow in some fashion. I know some of you are thinking \\"hey man, it's a kids book, lighten up\\", but you know as well as I that our kids minds are very malleable at a young age and messages like this can and will shape their worldviews as they grow up. Imagine an entire generation of people who refused to push themselves because it was too hard or too uncomfortable. This nation rose to the top for the very reason that people pushed themselves and took risks that were uncomfortable. My recommendation: if you see this book, burn it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the message I want for my child","review":"The message that we don't need fame or to be the strongest etc. to be happy is a good one, but this book sends a message which is not good. For example, the animal that goes to school spends his whole time memorizig things he doesn't understand, which, yes, is not good but to a child sends the message that school is not good. And then this hedgehog seems to get along knowing about herbs and things without having to work at all, and that more than anything is what's bad about this book. If you want to be good at holistic medicine (like this hedgehog :), you're going to have work for it, and not spend your days laying around in the garden."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misguided attempt at teaching simplicity in life","review":"This book attempts to teach young children about how to lead a simple life but instead tells them its bad to try to improve themselves.

It took me thirty pages to realise that Oxper was an abbreviation for Auxuliary Personnel, and that this meant anderoids. I couldn't figure out the difference between Silvos, Silver Cross and the people wearing silver suits. I eventually figured out that Silvo was an abbreviation for Silver Cross and that they wore blue suits while the Crew, who are not silver cross, wear silver suits from time to time. Confused? Welcome to the club.I eventually got fed up trying to work out silly little enigmas like these, I lost whatever plot there was, failed to identify with any of the characters, and so the book has been dropped, unfinished. This, from me, is a testament to a bad book. I have finished some pretty bad stuff in my day, I am a finisher, and for me not to finish, the book has to stink like a skunk in a farting contest. Peeyouw!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too bad, because the premise was good","review":"I picked this up and read the back and the blurbs and it sounded like it would be interesting, if not a good read. Unfortunately, this book was bad from the first paragraph on. There were so many names and characters just thrown at me, I could hardly tell when the story started to advance. The immediate establishment of the military guys bad, us civillians good, was also irritating, since neither side was able to prove themselves anything other than their labeling. I was so confused after the first sixty pages, I had to give up. The book had gone from confusing to impossible to follow. At that point, I'd already lost interest in the characters, since I could hardly tell what was going on, and could have cared less about their fates."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huh?","review":"I tried really hard but couldn't make it past the first third of this book.

This album, even though it's a recent recording, is way below his usual standards. Dreadful arrangements that were probably meant to recapture a 1960's feel and a terribly flat and uninvolved vocal performance on most of the tracks.On top of that, the CD clocks in at barely half an hour of playing time, most of the selections are in the two-minute range. The only halfway decent rendition here is probably Jim Croce's \\"Time in a Bottle\\" with some nice guitar work. The other eleven tracks drown in female sing-along-choruses and soupy strings that sound as if recorded during a Vegas showroom practise and patched over Glen's uninspried vocals as an afterthought.If you look for moving Glen Campbell ballads check out his work with Jimmy Webb, especially the \\"Reunited\\" album that gives you 75 minutes of some of his best recordings of the 1970's and 1980's - and they even sound a lot better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Edited album from a more complete package 2 CD set","review":"These same 12 songs are on CD #2 of GC's MY HITS AND LOVE SONGS, which has a total of 18 tracks on the new recordings cover tunes, meaning you're missing six tracks if you buy this version of those recordings.

After seeing some positive reviews and seeing that it reached # 1 on the college charts, I decided to risk a dollar on this incredibly bland \\"bookbag rock\\". I should've known better. Inbetween laughable Dave Matthews impersonations and shockingly mediocre Neil Young karaoke, you get his take on \\"what if Trent Reznor accepted Jesus as his personal lord and saviour?\\" on Track 11 \\"Permission\\". With no hooks to speak of, an annoying Christian bent, melodies that recall the worst 70's AM farm radio ever and covering up your inability to create anything even remotely catchy with electronic instrumentation, it all makes me wanna upchuck in my shorts. Damien Rice, Badly Drawn Boy, even Pete Yorn are doing what this guy is attempting to do and can actually DO IT.

I would describe Joseph Arthur as a heady mix between Jeff Buckley and Ryan Adams. He transitions from the elegant, moody introspection of Buckley to the romping alt-country of Adams in a snap without reason or need for apology. He creates rich harmonies through falcetto and intricate bass lines - you'll find yourself singing along with the opening title-track (which will remind you of David Grey), and not stopping until the closing song: \\"You've Been Loved\\". The CD is melancholy and sweet. He's a fantastic lyricist and underrated talent - you won't regret adding this one to your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"There's something about Joseph Arthur...","review":"This is probably my favorite Joseph Arthur album he's the kind of artist I think would be an intresting person to meet. He's also the kind of artist you can listen to at night and dream of places you've never been but plain to, or even just hope to visit. On a subtle summer afternoon you can listen to him and almost take joy in the mosquitos biting. You can even listen to him on a hard rainy day and be happy in the midst of a great depression. This musician, on this album especially, has the ability to mellow out any great feelings of sorrow or ectasy and just make you feel content. And you get your moneys worth with eighteen tracks.And to Vincent, Please, in the future can you refrain from confusing someones beleifs with the quality of their music?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Refreshing Break From Modern Music (and life)","review":"I learned of Joseph Arthur while on the Enjoy Records website, where they had the looped intro of 'Honey and the Moon' playing. The small 15 second clip caught my interest and the next day I purchased a copy of 'Redemtion's Son.' What I got (to my complete surprise) was one of the best records of the year. Joseph Arthur is a brilliant singer/songwriter who has a very broad, hard-to-classify style that doesn't feel over-experimental or conviction lacking. Every song is wonderfully different and hauntingly beautiful. From the Dylan-esque 'Dear Lord' to the smoothe and intellegent 'Favorite Girl.' This is the perfect album for a lazy Sunday afternoon and I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why isn't this guy a household name??????","review":"I first discovered Joseph Arthur a month ago. He was the opening act for R.E.M. They wanted him as their opener so they could see him play live. I figured he has to be pretty good if they like him. First of all he was a one man band. He had a machine that recorded a beat or tune at the beginning then he kept adding to it. He sang and played the guitar along with the songs. It was really good.After doing some research, I come to find out he has four albums out. I just started listening to them, starting with Redemption's son and I think it is a masterpiece. He has a unique quality that is hard to find on any radio station these days. You can listen to it over and overfrom start to finish. Now I wished that I had heard of him before I saw him in concert and I would have appreciated his music a lot more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful, inspiring music.","review":"So many artists struggle to put 10 songs on an album, of which maybe half could be considered decent. Joseph Arthur manages to create 16 for this album and there's not a loser in the bunch.His songs are pure poetry surrounded by swirling layers of gorgeous music - sometimes simplistic folk, other times upbeat rock. But his lyrics carry each one with often times devastating results (in a good way). Tales of love lost and struggles to love are the most common, but they never get tiring due to the diversity of the tracks.For those who do love this album as much as I do, check out Gavin DeGraw as well (his album Chariot is arguably the best of 2003).ebhp"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet Redemption","review":"On his third album, Joseph Arthur takes his songwriting to a whole new level, while also blending in the techniques that made his first two albums so great. His distinctly rugged yet beautiful voice still conveys creative lyrics full of emotion, but this time he layers his voice several times over throughout the album to create ravishing harmonies and provide a more saturated sound. It's almost like a whole choir of Josephs is providing you a personal serenade on every song. As usual, there is very unique instrumentation, fantastic production, and Joseph's very own mesmerizing artwork. Highlights include \\"Honey & The Moon\\", \\"I Would Rather Hide\\", \\"Evidence\\", and \\"You Are The Dark\\". Overall a very impressive addition to Joseph's discography."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy installation","review":"I'm very impressed with the quality of this product. All holes line up perfectly.

After firing the bolts into my block target, the inserts and field points came out of the bolts, and were left inside the target when I went to pull them out. I contacted Horton's customer service department. Horton would not answer e-mail or replace the bolts.

Terrible, Terrible, Terrible. The Grammy's should be ashamed of themselves for being bullied into handing out awards to be \\"politically correct\\". Can you say \\"Milli Vanilli\\"?

I'm a little older but I've not seen or have knowledge of many of the places she has experienced. It is not necessary-she conveys her messages so well that you can understand exactly where she's been. Sympathize if not empathize with her pain-most of us have been there-always trying to fit in-to please someone who is not worthy of our sacrifice-our efforts. She's spiritual, but not preachy she relates \\"religiously\\". She's unafraid of the stigma loving God seems to create among young people. She is in touch with her roots, spiritually as well as socially-she knows where she comes from and celebrates her journey to maturity and enlightenment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why Has L. Hill's Singing Ever Produced Even a Single Fan?","review":"Why indeed? This will never do -- as one critic, Croaker, said of John Keats. Oh that Ms. Hill was an Emily Dickinson or even a Jennie Lind ... Why the toneless sound, chasing vainly after a melodic line and harmonic consistency? Why the baby-talk intonation? Why the absence of simple voice quality? Can anyone distinguish even a single word -- without cribbing it first from album notes? I see her old CDs are a whopping $2.99. Doubtless that is becuz they have been played down to scratches. (Scatches r better!) It is possible to sing greatly without much voice and a one-octave range, but only if you are Billie Holiday.

This is a MUST for any hardcore hip-hop fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lauryn Hill - a true artist of much variety.","review":"In the Miseducation album, Lauryn has shown a great deal of originality in every single aspect of the work. She used the \\"miseducation\\" part of the title extremly well and I especially liked the idea of the \\"classroom scenes\\", they were very creative and the children were discussing an extremly fragile topic as well.

Lauryn speaks of the human experience.","review":"Perhaps no other set of songs has touched what it is to be human-- falling in love, being betrayed by a friend, having your heart broken, retrieving back your soul, and giving it to God. Lauryn raps/sings with her heart, and it resonates with ours. Her sound and message is universal-- it crosses all colors and boundaries.

The depth of artistry inherent in this record is just mind-boggling; and rarely do you hear this much soul poured out in 70 minutes. Many are calling this a landmark album and I agree. The fact that it just won FIVE Grammys should cement that fact.

As a result, there are no real contenders willing to challenge other artists and listeners. While Hill's album has bright moments, the music is dull and repetitive, her vocal range is limited, and she tends to oversimplify situations. When you put this album within the context of current music, it is being lauded because there is no one out there giving Lauryn a challenge for the lyrical title.

Go figure, the committee has poor taste in music. You have to understand that in order to receive a nomination, your album must have sold at least a million copies.Nothing special about this album at all, it sounds just like any other hip hop/R&B album. \\"Doo Wop\\" is incredibly overrated and overplayed, right down to Lauryn's own Busta Rhymes knockoff in the song. \\"To Zion\\" and the title track among others make this album quite a drag.If you want to hear a truly amazing album, check out the latest releases by Leah Andreone, Sprung Monkey...or, better yet, the greatest album in the '90s, \\"Fantastic Planet\\" by Failure.

Easily among the most pointless, meandering music ever committed to CD, and that's saying a LOT! This could be in the dictionary as the definition for \\"bad R&B.\\"Its kind of ironic, given the flap about Hill's supposedly racist remarks, that she has produced one of the \\"whitest\\" albums ever. And I don't mean that racially. I mean it in the sense of whitebread -- dull, tasteless, featureless, all fluff and no nutrition.If you want to hear rap, buy Biggie. If you want to hear devotional music, get an old Bob Marley record, or listen to Curtis Mayfield, or hell even Public Enemy. If you want grooves, there's a million good alternatives. Who needs this?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Puleeeeeeeze!","review":"Bought this cd and listened to it three times trying to see what the fuss was about. I then sold it on e-bay. I would like to know what is so great about this music? It totally escapes me. And I was further unimpressed when Miss Hill went on stage with a Bible in her hands. Why do black singers have to pretend that they are such religious fanatics? Please spare me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best female rap album by far.","review":"Great production, great music, incredibly complex lyrics that match the music and flow of the songs (sometimes rivaling Nas' lyrics on Illmatic).This is by far, still the best hip-hop album created by a woman.I hope Lauryn really did write and produce most of the songs (just to hope she can replicate this effort later).But regardless of whether this is mostly solo or a collaborative work, this is a great piece of art."},{"rating":"2","title":"This album is the bomb-diggaty!!","review":"It's not often that you can buy a CD where you like every single song on it. This is that CD! Each song tells a story that most of us can relate to in one way or another. The lyrics come with the CD so it makes it that much easier to follow and when you read these lyrics you will be blown away. I guarantee it! This CD not only can make you get up and dance but also make you sit down and really think.If you don't have this album, buy it! Support the talented Lauryn Hill and you will experience an artist perform like none before!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lauryn Hill dazzles with her soulful voice","review":"Lauryn Hill receives 5 stars for her new CD. The lyrics are really fantastic and reflect many thoughts and opinions of young adults in modern life. She is right on in her song \\"Doo Wop (That Thing).\\" I love her deep, soulful voice, it really touches a chord in my heart.

For example, in the song\\" Doo Wop, That Thing,\\" she's basically dissing women that have \\"hair weaves like Europeans.\\" But if you notice her hair in the video- guess what? She's wearing a hair weave too, or else a bad wig. I can't tell. In the song \\"Superstar\\", she's dissing rappers who sample 70's music. But what's that in the background of the song? A retread of the Doors' \\"Light my Fire\\"! Somehow when I was listening to \\"Superstar,\\" the words \\"KILLING ME SOFTLY WITH HIS SONG\\" took on a great deal of significance. And her rapping is obviously jocking Lil Kim's style (without the cussing, of course) I could have sworn I heard the line \\"It's all About the Benjamins.\\" Look, she's a good singer and all, but on this album she's overly opinionated to the point where I didn't really like this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"I will save you the trouble of buying it and returning it","review":"I buy about 3 or 4 cd's per week so when I heard about this one I wanted to get it.

Otherwise, it's just one long boring sermon, exalting Ms Hill's views and beliefs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lauryn is a blessed and talented woman","review":"Anyone with anything negative to say about Lauryn or her music don't know what she is about and need to go elsewhere with the negativity. She is an outrageously talented, God-fearing woman who is getting her positive messages out to those who want and need to hear them. God has Lauryn's back and when He's got it, nothing negative is going to affect her. Lauryn is not a racist and has said so. Having pride in one's race is not a crime and her music is here to uplift. As a listener, you have to be in the midset that Lauryn is in to really understand and appreciate her music. The album is excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Innovative, clever synopsis of the real issues","review":"Supported with catchy tunes, the lyrics combined with that soulful sound that caught our attention in Sister Act 2, Hill delievers the goods! No half-hearted statements on this album, Hill tells it how it is, plain and simple, no if's and but's. The title ' The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill' says it all doesn't it? Pretty damn clever for a miseducated mother of one. Wow.."},{"rating":"2","title":"ONE OF THE BEST CDS OF 99","review":"WHEN I LISTENED TO THIS MUSIC FOR THE FIRST TIME IT WAS REALLY A SURPRISE.

I am a big fan, I have her on my screen saver because I think she is very beautiful too. But her music and \\"alternative style\\", if I may, is very attractive mentally and spiritually. She has awakened the desire for meaningful music in thousands of people. She deserved her award and i wish her much success in her endeavors. I also pray to God that in her youth (because she is quite young) that she does not stray from what she is doing because I know that it is easy to get strung out or side tracked when you get to where she is."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm sorry...but it's overrated.","review":"My sister bought this CD and said it was great. My mother wanted this CD, so I bought it for her. I heard my mother playing it, but couldn't figure out what was so great about it. Give it another chance, I said. I stole the CD from my brother and listened to it all the way through...I was not impressed. Yes, Lauryn is beautiful and has a beautiful voice, but I for one, do not like her talking through some of the songs. For example in \\"Ex-Factor\\" which is a great song (I can't get it out of my head), but is that \\"yo yo\\" necessary in the background? I also like \\"To Zion\\". \\"That Thing\\" is nice, but overplayed. This album didn't change my life or anything. I'm glad I borrowed my brother's CD, because I would've felt that I wasted $12 or $13 on an extra copy for myself. Two stars, one each for Ex-Factor and To Zion."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the best album of the year","review":"I recomend this album to anybody. Usually this type of hip-hop isn't my fav. but after hearing this album, I totally changed my mind. She is the best artist of the late 90's, and everyone should own AT LEAST one copy of this C.D. The lyrics flow through the songs, and they seem to be perfectly written. Please buy this album, you will thank yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"This CD is okay.","review":"This CD isn't worth the hype it has been given. It's okay but that's it. Just okay.

How could a RACIST that takes other people's music win 5 Grammies? It must be the 90's and the political and liberal agenda at work.

Lauren Hill's lyrics flow like water and the beats are hypnotic without dulling the senses. Her ability to switch from singing to rhyming is unique and seamless. The woman clearly is about business because she let her album drop with no mistakes in her \\"sound\\" or style!! I wouldn't be surprised if she stepped out on her own permanently (listen to \\"Lost Ones\\", and \\"Forgive them Father\\"-- she is TALKING to someone REAL CLOSE to her). This is beyond the limits of \\"hip hop\\" and 'R & B\\", this is soul for the '90s. While KIm, Foxy, Mya and whoever else is out there posin', Ms. Hill is getting the job done!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"It's a great album! Rap, hip-hop, soulful R&B all wrapped into one. She definitely has a soulful and powerful voice. A MUST to buy album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best CD of the Fall","review":"When I first bought this CD I knew I loved her first single, but I wasn't so sure if I liked all the tracks, once I started listening I realized the Lauryn Hill had done it again, her music is SWEET its a combonation of ethnic, r&b, rap, gospel and pop music all rolled into one. I think the Fugees should do another CD all together because Pras, Wy Clef and Lauryn Hill are such original and wonderful artists."},{"rating":"2","title":"Class Is DEFINATELY In Session!!","review":"I liked Lauryn Hill so much in The Fugees, I had to get her first solo album. I was blown away after one listening! This album showcases her rap skills and wonderful singing vioce. Even the interludes between songs are bearable!! Of course \\"Doo Wop (That Thing)\\" is one of my favorites, where she shows off both of her talents. The harmonies are incredible!! Other faves include \\"Ex-Factor\\", \\"I Used To Love Him\\" (a duet with Mary J. Blige), and \\"Final Hour\\". The two I did not enjoy were \\"Superstar\\" and her duet with D'Angelo, \\"Nothing Even Matters\\"(\\"NEM\\" is just too long!!). This CD is a must for anyone who likes hip-hop, R&B, and/or (light) rap. Get your \\"(Mis-)Education\\" from Lauryn, and it will be tuition well-spent!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Master Piece","review":"Every song is incredibly perfect.Be sure that you will active the repeat choice on your cdplayer. You will love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Es un álbum excepcional","review":"Al escuchar este CD por primera ocasión me interesó mucho la calidad del mismo pero después de varias canciones me pareció algo poco inovador.Sin embargo,el mérito del álbum se sostiene por la excelente calidad de (no muchas) canciones.En realidad llegarás a pensar que Lauryn Hill es una genio de la música por su capacidad de hacer majestuosas canciones.Para mí es de mis mejores álbums,y vale mucho la pena,porque aunque la calidad del mismo merma un poco en parte del disco,brilla como un quásar en las canciones buenas.Muy recomendable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific!","review":"All around a great CD, especially in this day and age where so many one-hit wonders somehow manage to put together an entire CD with the remaining songs being garbage.

Talk about soulful!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not that good. grossly over-rated.","review":"i mean it wasnt that good sounds not unlike anything we havent heard before. whats the big deal.

She is a beautiful person inside and out and I cannot wait for her next album."},{"rating":"1","title":"She's no Sade","review":"If Sade weren't a recluse, there wouldn't be room or need for this repetitive and tired album by Lauryn Hill. Nothing new here, nothing honest. It's all a creation, and it's pretty annoying.Give me music that isn't so safe."},{"rating":"1","title":"This album is an ill fated attempt at hip hop honesty.","review":"Although I am not denying Ms. Hill's obvious talent, it seems as though this album falls short in the Hip Hop genre. This is more of a womens ballad that is clearly not intended for the hard core hip hop fan. I has anticipated some hard core cuts on the joint but was truly disappointed. R&B fans should really like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lauryn is queen Of The Hill","review":"Luaryn Hill has suceedded in fusing hip-hop with mainstream pop such that hip-hop music is given so much regonition these days.

I knew this from her days with The Fugees, and that's why I bought The Miseducation Of Lauryn Hill the day it came out. She can sing and rap, which no female does, and which no man can do as well as L-Boogie. 'Ex-Factor', 'Final Hour' & 'Doo Wop' are the best songs on the album. A must must must buy for n-e-1"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lauryn sings from the soul.","review":"One thing I love about \\"The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill\\" is that you connect with th artist. You're not just listening, you're feeling. \\"Zion\\" is my favorite song on there; she pours her heart into that one. A must buy!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The entire album was well written and produced by Lauryn.","review":"I throughly enjoyed each track on the album. Each song gave the listener a look into Lauryn's soul into her life. The two songs that I loved the most were \\"Zion\\" and \\"Nothing Even Matters\\". Her duet with D'Angelo was wonderful. The vocal arrangement was beautiful along with that wonderful harmony they had with one another.The album is and will always be one of my favorites.

The songs run the gamut of emotions--from intense love to bitterness. Finally, the last two songs just bring it all back to love. I love the spiritual allusions in the songs. Buy this CD. You won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!!! Thought-Provoking with a head noddin beat.","review":"Lauryn's CD is awesome. She proves that a woman can be both beautiful on the outside and on the inside. Her lyrics are thought-provoking.

Bottom line, save your money or spend it elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Makes me want to throw up","review":"I truly can't understand WHY people can actually enjoy that stuff. I know that she's a talented singer, but the songs that she sings are really bad! Why can't she sing a melody instead of rapping on and on? She was much better when she was in \\"Sister Act2\\". My apologies to the people who enjoyed the CD. Thank you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!!!!!!!!!!!!!1","review":"I was really excited about getting this c.d. \\"Doo Wop\\" has been one of my favorites songs recently, but when I listened to this album I about died!!! It was soooo boring. I don't see why everyone is so \\"excited\\" about this c.d. \\"Ex=Factor\\" is the only other song I would consider okay.

Overall, it's a waste of $15."},{"rating":"1","title":"a boring and insipid mess","review":"I find it somewhat interesting that every review for this album is to the extreme, either one star or five stars with very few in the middle. That should tell you something about mainstream MTV-glorified music"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is why we have Insane Asylums!!","review":"The CD was a bore. It is has been done over, and over again. It is time to get original and stop the xeroxing of music. I was hoping she would be different but I had to spend 15.00 to find out she was not. I'm still trying to figure out why she got 5 Grammys, and then it hit me. It was a rerun of the last 4 Grammy shows, because the same music keeps winning over and over.

Her music is great to relax with and enjoy.

I LOVE this album and would highly recommend it to everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tiresome and annoying","review":"This, like most rap, is cliche drivel. It is \\"audio entertainment\\" for people who either 1) don't like actual music 2)who don't know better. Very unlikely to stand the test of time.

Lauryn Hill's image is great, but her music is below mediocre. And it's boring. Just because you have a positive message doesn't make you a good musician. There is no funk. The beats suck. That Thing is one of the most irritating songs I've ever heard. Seriously, people... You need to think for yourselves. This album is all hype and no substance. Oh, and comparing her to Marvin Gaye is just a crime. The Fugees are great, but don't be mislead. If you value funk at all, don't buy this CD.

Now I know it's not the most original or most well done album I ever listend to. But some of the songs (like ex-factor) just makes me wanna listen to it forever. I don't know why everyone keeps bugging so much about originality, if someone makes a great album with great songs, let it just rest at that!? The miseducation of Lauryn Hill is definitly a very good album, and I recomend it to anyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill","review":"For far too long we've awaited the debut of Mama Zion, Ms. L-Boogie herself, and what a wonderful reward patience brings, this album is superb. She has expertly blended all the elements of a true hip-hop album to create the female rap album creme de la creme. From beginning to end, it's non-stop ear appetizing. I flipped when I heard the heart wrenching and soul identifying song \\"Miseducation of L.Hill\\" or the vibrating reggae song \\"Forgive Them Father\\". Lauryn wonderfully combines poetry, dope beats and (like 2Pac her Gemini male twin R.I.P.), music we can identify with from the heart. Anyone can feel this album deeply from the children to the elders of our community, ThanQ Ms. Hill, We love you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST","review":"How can you have anything but positive comments for Ms. Hill's first cd without the Fugees? After the first time I listened to it, I knew this was going on permanent status on my CD player.

She's a powerful woman and this is a great CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"3rd copy","review":"I love this album, brings back great memories.

I find the album is immediately likable, but only two of her songs can withstand repeated listenings. As a hip-hop junkie, I still like the first track, filled with clever (albeit a bit soft) battle rhymes. And as a hip-hop junkie, that's all I like. The rest is a bad mix of hip-hop and R&B, which seem to be mixed just for the sake of mixing hip-hop and R&B. The results are songs like Ex-Factor, an otherwise perfectly lovely song if it were not for the ultra annoying \\"yo yo yo yo yo\\" background Lauryn insists on putting in.Oh well. I was looking forward for Lauryn to blaze the trail for the new generation of female hip-hoppers. Now instead of creating an exquisite hip-hop album, she made a sophmoric R&B album that is embraced by pop fans one month and totally forgotten the next."},{"rating":"1","title":"lastest craze","review":"Can we say pet rock?

Naturally beautiful, sings AND raps, writes, directs AND produces...she is the complete package and proves it on this cd! You want to listen to it for the sheer beauty and strength of it, you have to listen to it for the lessons she teaches. We waited a long time for baby girl to do it on her own and it is more than worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill\\"--Well Worth your $12.58","review":"The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill was well worth my $12.58 because it featured great production, interesting lyrics, and soothing as well as \\"make you want to get up and dance\\" beats and melodies. The tracks on this album showcased a variety of styles which blended seamlessly to showcase this talented artist's repertoire. If you're looking for hip-hop and R&B with interesting, positive lyrics, as I was, I think that this is definitely a cd to add to your collection. The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill stands out as one of the best hip-hop albums of the year."},{"rating":"2","title":"being educated by Lauryn Hill","review":"The miseducation of Lauryn Hill is just the opposite of the messages she is putting out,the title should read, being educated by ms. Hill. every track on the album has a soulfull message you can understand and relate to if not in evry song but in at least one. Yes i agree that the album has a great beat, however if you dont listen to the lyrics you can't enjoy the album. Example doo wop(that thing)and Zion etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"ONE of the BEST ALBUMS of THE YEAR.....","review":"Lauryn Hill's album The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill is the one of the best albums of the year. It is definitly a classic. With songs like \\"Ex-Factor\\", and \\"When it hurts so bad\\" give the album the positive vibe. Mary J. Blige guest stars on \\"I used to love him\\" and puts her stamp of perfection on it. D'Angleo lends his voice on \\"Nothing else matters\\" with his soulfull harmony. Rap tracks on the album are also ascend Lauryn to be one of the most gifted female lyricist. If fact one of the best mc's around. Songs like \\"Final Hour\\", \\"Do Wop\\"(That thing), and \\"Lost ones\\" are a shinning example. But Hill gives her best performance with the last two track that are hidden within the cd(\\"Can't take my eys off you\\" & \\"Tell him\\").Ms Hill is certainly giving a new vibe to the hip-hop & r&b area. I only wish their was more."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is all recycled trash stolen from other musicians.","review":"She needs to get her own material and stop copying the reggae lines and phrases from Jamaican musicians.She is embarassingly un-original and put quite simply : a cornball. she tries (with nauseating effect) to be politically correct in every lyric. A word of advice: relax and try to discover yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"it's okay but no classic","review":"she is a good artist for these times but she is overrated and stated.a few good songs but the music sounds all the same.it ain't no thriller,songs in the key of life,what's going on,sparkle,superfly.to be more blunt&honest it's not as good as wycliff's disc.he tried to something different at least.l-hill to me is a better producer than artist."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Love Lauryn,But this Album is Overrated!","review":"I love Lauryn Hill, really I do. I especially loved her song, \\"The Sweetest Thing\\" on the Love Jones soundtrack, so when I heard all the hype about her new album, I wasn't surprised. She has a powerful voice.....BUT this album is not for her. She only has, like two good songs (Ex-factor and Mahogany-the hidden track) but even those songs are just GOOD not GREAT. This album is highly overrated and was a huge disappointment. How she has won all those awards with this album is a pure mystery to me. Her voice is amazing, but the songs on this album just were not for her. I am so sorry I bought this and it pains me so much to remember that I didn't buy it on sale! Don't believe the hype, this album is not all that. Period."},{"rating":"1","title":"A damn shame.","review":"I don't know why this gets all that attention. The CD, to be quite honest, didn't do anything for me. The only song that was that good was the Roberta Flack wannabe \\"Ex-Factor\\". I think Lauryn tries too hard to sound like Roberta. I mean, this album and Lauryn herself got nominees that didn't apply to her. She's nominated for best rap solo on \\"Lost Ones\\", which was never released as a single. If they wanna play like that, why didn't they ever nominate the Dogg Pound's \\"Smooth\\", which was a masterful performance."},{"rating":"1","title":"My ignorance","review":"I bought this cd because of the multiple Grammy nominations. I suppose my ignorance is that I don't know the meaning of \\"hip-hop\\". It is all rap! I hated it."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the best CD that i have ever had.","review":"This CD is awesome!! I listen to it everyday and love every song on it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lauren Hill's lyrics are words of wisdom and experience.","review":"Instead of the common lyrics written by most artists, like lost love and how because they got dumped they hate the opposite sex, Lauren Hill promotes real experiences that people face and decisions that people are too often afraid of. Her dedication to Zion and God is awesome. \\"I've never been in love like this before\\" pinpoints the love of a mother to her child. I admire her for listening to her heart instead of what society thought was right."},{"rating":"2","title":"Miss Lauryn Hill has the sounds to go with her lovely voice.","review":"Miss Lauryn Hill is a very talented young lady.

One of the greatest albums ever!","review":"Every song on the album made me want to play it again. Not only are the words fun to sing but they also have lots of meaning. Ms. Hill put her all into this album and many of us are appreciating her work. This is now my favorite album and I love those \\"thangs\\" Ms. Hill did. Thank you!!

If you haven't already-- buy it!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lauryn is the best ever!!!!","review":"Go, Lauryn. Go, Lauryn. Lauryn is the best. She's only 23 years old making it big. I'm very proud of her. Her album is the best. The songs I can just relate to. I have to hear her album every single day. I have one album for my inside stereo and one for my car stereo. This is how much I love this C.D. Great job! I commend her a great deal. Lauryn, keep bringing the music!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sooo Bittersweet","review":"I bought this album when it first came out and listened to it like crazy. I remember her singing \\"Zion\\" at the grammys and crying it was so beautiful. I say it's bittersweet because obviously it's about love and heartache and breakup's and makeups. But also because this was her only ablum for a few years until she came out with that Unplugged album which was even more deep and dark and sad, but great. I love her music , you can tell what she's going through with every track. All around great investment."},{"rating":"2","title":"A decade later...","review":"\\"The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill\\" still sounds as fresh and new in 2008 as it did when it was released in 1998. It's hard to believe that its been ten years since this masterpiece was released. The songs are timeless. \\"Ex-Factor,\\" \\"Doo Wop (That Thing),\\" \\"I Used To Love Him,\\" \\"Lost Ones,\\" \\"Everything Is Everything,\\" \\"To Zion,\\" and all the rest are classics. I bet in 2028 somebody, somewhere will still be rocking this CD. I'm still hoping for another Lauryn masterpiece. I know she's had her issues through the years since this Grammy-winning darling was released, but her talent is timeless. They don't make 'em like her anymore. I think she has another one in her. If she ever does decide to comeback, she has one fan that will be patiently waiting for her new \\"Miseducation!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"It's okay, but...","review":"After all the Press and the 5 times Grammy winning, I must say that This CD only is a ornament for my CD-Collection. It doesn't grow on me at all! There are a few nice songs on it, but that's all! All the Rest I skip away! Sorry, but I don't think to buy something more from her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deeply missed!","review":"There are very few artists today who can educate with their lyrics. Lauren Hill was able to speak to many differnt genres. She gave a me a sense of self worth that I didn't learn at home. The children of today need a \\"Miss Hill\\" to help educate them where parents and school fail. Your music is missed Miss Hill!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lauryn Hill:Singer/Songwriter/Music Genius","review":"Lauryn Hill's solo debut is arguably one of the greatest R&B albums in history,talking about all subjects of life,also deservingly winning 5 Grammies.From social issues(\\"Everything IS Everything\\"),to not loving a man anymore(\\"I Used To Love Him(featuring Queen Of Hip Hop/Soul Mary J.Blige)\\"),and also NOT being able to leave a relationship(\\"Ex-Factor\\").All 3 subjects are sung with perfection,and so is every other song on this gold mine of an album,the true highlights being \\"Doo Wop(That Thing)\\",the remake of \\"Can't Take My Eyes Off Of You\\",and \\"Ex-Factor\\".This album also gave us real music lovers relief that the genre we all love/hate called hip-hop still actually had organic talent out there.There are no obvious flaws showing here,except for the almost pointless clas interludes about love,but that small flaw is overshadowed by the remarkable songs.Ms.Hill put an amazing effort on this album,and it will be remembered by music lovers 10 years from now."},{"rating":"2","title":"PERFECT !!!!","review":"The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill is one of the greatest albulms ever made. She practically touched on every part of human emotion. My favorite song is the one \\"to Zion\\" a beautiful song about Lauryn choosing her child over the lifestyles of fame, having her baby ignoring what people thought. The choir coming in and giving her back-up was excellent it was just beautiful, spiritual if you will. I also like \\"doo woop (that thing)\\" her first single off the album a nice upbeat song with the drums, horns, Lauryn's beautiful voice, that was perfect too. Another one of my favorite songs was \\"Nothing Even Matters\\" her duet with D'Angelo very pretty and soulful, one of my favorite songs period. I could go on and on about every track but then I'd ruin the experience for you. Go out and buy it it's an excellent work of art."},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly miseducated","review":"I hope this artist gets beyond simple expression and learns to create music.We shouldn't suffer for her \\"art.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything is awesome","review":"very good cd with other artist like santana and mary j blige on it. definately buy this cd cuz u'll love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"laurin hill takes a second seat to Celine Dion","review":"Celine Dion has put out the most memorable and sold CD of the 90's, states Billboard magazine but laurin hill should try to learn from superiors like Celine when it comes to making a Cd. i don't like hip hop and this didn't do any better. i recommend to buy Celine cd instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"This album is not for everyone","review":"I found this to be an exercise in unpleasant listening, musically, not lyrically. Just because you like soul or r&b doesn't mean this album is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"lauryn hill your cd is top choice in my selector","review":"this album was long time coming. I enjoy the Fugees as a group; however, Lauryn your music is very moving. The album is very soulful. It is the kind of music that is for everyone and will be an all-time favorite. I was surprised to see you as a guest on the Rosie O'donnell show. I know music is universal but, to be featured on her show and to have her boast that much about your album, you know that cd is hot. I really like the interludes with the kids. Very amusing and uplifting. The lyrics are to the point and very specific about relationships, feelings, and everything else going on with the youth. I'm going to end this with just saying one word: HOT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Alone but stronger than before.","review":"Lauryn seems to have come of own from this first solo album. Although many may not agree with Lauryn Hills views expressed on MTV, they all agree Lauryn Hill's got soul. Hill's voice seems to have gotten stronger with a wider vocabulary of vocal talents, the soulfull sweet chart topping remake of \\"Your just to good to be true\\" To the boppy \\"That thing \\". Lauryn Hill is a voice to be reckoned with a women going places and definantly a name to look out for."},{"rating":"2","title":"ITS THE BEST OF THE BEST!!!","review":"lauryn is an amazing woman in our world today she is talented and a power house!

This cd has helped me through some hard times and it has given me new hope. I can liston to it a 100 times and I don't get bored. It's a good balance between mellow songs(like Ex-factor) and upbeat ones (like Doo Wop). Lauryn Hill has found the right ballance between appealing to a persons mind and their emotions. Every song on this album could be released as a single, in my opinion. I recommend this album to everybody."},{"rating":"2","title":"This cd is awesome!!!!!","review":"Lauren Hill is great. One of the best cd's I've listened to in a while. Her charcter is outstanding too. I thought what she said at the Grammy's was wonderful. Not since U2 has a musical act been this great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good music but way over hyped.","review":"Lauryn Hill has produced the most memorable album of the 90's, an album which scope talks about love in its truest forms as well as the pains and joys that come with love. That being said, I believe this album is a kin to \\"the Phantom Menace,\\" so over hyped it could not live up to it. It is a good album, but it merely puts fresh spins on old styles. It adds nothing to them. It has more substance than the average hip-hop or R&B album, but its not the be all and end all of hip-hop or R& B music. Lauryn proves that she is a true student of music and has given a complete package, but this album's true brilliance is being smothered by expectations it can't live up to. This album smacks around anything that the material girl has produced, but Lauryn has a long ways to go before she can be considered in the same breath as Aretha Franklin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Something was bugging me about this CD.","review":"I couldn't figure out what. But then it came to me. She is copying Bob Marley. I see it clearly now: the lyrics, music, even the hair style. Then I realized she named a son zion. The sentiments of the Rastafarian people of Jamaica copied down to the \\"T\\". Maybe she can fool middle America, but the people who listen to \\"World Music\\" know better. We've been exposed to this music years before. I gave her 2 stars for re-packaging and marketing the music to the general public of America who maybe haven't heard \\"world music\\" before."},{"rating":"2","title":"The queen of rap\\\\hip-hop","review":"Lauryn Hill is a wonderful artist no matter what other people may say. When I first got the cd, I listened to the cd everyday. Usually when I get cd's they don't hit me well as being good,but with Lauryn's cd I only had to here the first track and I was hooked. Yes, it's true some tracks could have been left off the album. All and all it is a fine quality. Just see how many awards she's got from it. She has proven herself as a solo artist in a male dominated industry."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS CD IS THE BEST IVE HEARD IN A VERY LONG TIME","review":"LAUREN HILL IS EXTREMELY TALENTED.

YOU DONT GET THAT VERY MUCH THESE DAYS."},{"rating":"2","title":"Miseducation indeed","review":"This CD never gets old. Lauryn was in rare form and seemingly at the peak of her creativity. I don't know what happened but I'm waiting for the genius of songwriting ability to return. Though I've never thought much of her as \\"Live\\" performer, she definitely is the bomb in the studio. Great CD. Highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply the best!","review":"Lauryn is one of the greatest artist of our time and this is one of the best soul albums ever!Basically every single song is top-notch and enjoyable.

Buy this wonderful classic today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gurl, we're so happy U became a momma","review":"Contrary to popular opinion, it's not all about the benjamins, baby. Lauryn, sweet Lauryn, has released a work of art so fresh, so unique, so different than what is heard currently on urban radio. Sadly, much of it probably won't ever garner air play. But the female Fugees vocalist proves she's not only a prolific song writer, but music arranger and producer. Just listen to \\"When it Hurts So Bad,\\" not to mention, \\"Doo Wop.\\" \\"To Zion,\\" I believe is the best track, since it deals with a mother's confusion and indecision about whether to keep a child. Her soaring vocals on that track are enuff to get you in church on Sunday morning. But, hey! I am a sentimental, ole, fool. Bottom line: this is a disc well-worth adding to your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"WAY TO GO LAURIN, THIS CD IS THE BOMB!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"THIS IS THE BEST CD THAT I HAVE EVER HEARD IN A LONG TIME AND IT CAN RELATE TO ANY AND EVERY SITUATION BECAUSE IN THIS CD LAURIN IS SPEAKING OF HER LIFE, AND SOME OF HER SONGS RELATES TO MANY OF THE SITUATIONS THAT ARE GOING ON IN OTHER PEOPLE'S LIVES."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lauryn Hill is the undisputed Queen of Hip-Hop!!!","review":"Lauryn sings with a maturity and depth that belie her years.

As a dancer, I find that many of the women that I work with feel the same way. It is certainly one of our favorites, especially \\"Ex-Factor\\" and \\"Zion\\". Ms. Hill seems to be s strong, intelligent, young woman who speaks up for herself and promotes solidarity both within and between the genders. I found the music soothing and her voice soulful and intoxicating, like a lyrical Toni Morrison."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best C.D. Ever!!!!","review":"Lauryn Hill's c.d. is awesome.

It was probably overrated, and I think a lot of people let that get in the way of their listening. They didn't WANT to like it because it has received so many accolades. But just because you didn't like it, that doesn't mean that it's horrible. If you think the album is terrible just because you didn't like it, that's rather self-centered, don't you think? I don't think there is really good music and bad music. There is just music that is enjoyed by more people than other music. And Lauryn Hill's album was enjoyed by a lot of people."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stevie Wonder Revisted","review":"If Stevie Wonder were a 20-something female - this is what he would sound like.

But someone needs to balance all the 5-star reviews...Face it, any CD that USA Today and People magazine rave about has to be pretty lame. I tried to like this CD, but it's a bunch of bland, faceless soul singing combined with a small helping of very average rap.It's a plus that folks are looking for women rappers, and willing to support them. But Lauren Hill is vastly overrated.Wanna hear the real thing? Check out The Coup. Good rapping, great lyrics."},{"rating":"1","title":"This CD does not reflect Lauryn's talent","review":"I am the first to admit that Lauryn Hill has a very beautiful voice, but she did not show it on this CD. None of the songs caught my attention except \\"Can't take my eyes off you.\\" That was the only song that truly captured the beauty of Lauryn's voice. In my opinion, Lauryn should stay away from the rap and stick to more ballads."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nuttin' new here","review":"Although you could never say that this album is a complete wash, it never even got close to tickling my mind, catching me off guard with a fresh, unexpected turn of melody or riddim or sound splash.

Her new single \\"That Thing, That Thing, That Things,\\" surprisingly has sexual overtones. What thing could that be? But the album is excellent, bringing hip-hop into mainstream pop. Hip-Hop is finally becoming widely known and emerging into the mainstream. As a result we will benefit from more pop/mainstream albums from Lauryn Hill and pop/mainstream albums from other Hip-Hop artists. Good Going Lauryn Hill!

The truth of her words devour you, the intense beats hypnotize you, and the message changes your perspective--or gives you perspective if you'd lacked it before witnessing the harmonic therapy of Lauryn Hill. \\"To Zion\\" sounds like an African chant praising the birth of a savior. Hill defines birth and the feeling of motherhood as no one else has. The imagery of the lyrics leave me believing in the strength of Mary and the life of her son, in the possibility of heaven, God, liberation, love, and spirits.

I was captivated by her sweet voice laying down deep, thought provoking lyrics. I have always enjoyed her flava in any song, and was anxiously awaiting the release of this album. I had no idea that Zion and ex-facto, among others, would be so riveting that I would not want to hear any other music but her's since it's release. If you have it, groove it. Recommend it! If you don't have it, GET IT! I LOVED IT!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate to say it, but...","review":"This is one overatted album! The lyrcial content is nice. Very pleasent. A real upper, but nothing new or innovative. To say that she put so much of her soul into it is a joke! Most of the time it's just stuff like Superstar where Lauryn bitches about how fly she thinks it is. That's no soul. That's arrogance! Some tracks almost make it. I do think of Forgive Them Father quite often. I alos like her vocals but they are so constrained by lay-overs like in Ex-Factor. She should only be singing one line at a time. It sounds more natural. There is a few good bouncy doo-wop songs, but that's about all this album offers. It is no classic and will not be remembered as fondly 10 years from now as it is today. Peechy album, but there is quite a few others I would take to a desert island. I give it 2 and 1/2 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great start for Miss Hill","review":"As her first solo album, I think that Lauryn Hill did an excellent job of catching the audience.

If you want to fill out your character so she isn't just a big, clumsy, not-so-bright, oaf, this Kithbook is a must. With new troll only merits/flaws and weapons and treasure, you'll have the tools to make your troll more realistic and unique. Included is a fairly detailed outline of Troll history since before the Shattering along with what the Trolls really think of the other kiths from both a Seelie and Unseelie perspective.

While it gives us a decided flavor of Charles Dicken's rich characterizations, it leaves some important characters behind. This is necessary, in part, due to the enormous length of the original work. Still, when I used it in my English classes, it helped high school students with learning disabilities to visualize the historical climate and serves as a springboard for reading chapters from the novel and discussion. Student comments were positive for overall enjoyment of the movie. For those interested in the actors, the cast is not only recognizable, but accomplished. You will be delighted at some of the portrayals!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better Than Harry Potter","review":"Much better than Harry Potter and a great way to introduce a classic- with an actor a child can associate with.

Why? because they are the same people. Aunt betsey is as good as an Actress in her days of David Copperfield as when she was Professor McGonagall, David may be a little older in Harry Potter, but he still has the talent (and his winking in one eye) and as you would know, the evil wicked Mrs Murdstone is the lovely witch who teaches Harry to fly - Madam Hooch.i would reccomend this movie to anyone whol likes a bit of everything.."},{"rating":"1","title":"DEFECTIVE!","review":"Sadly, the BBC sent out more than one of these in a defective format!

It was so visual and captivating that she watched the whole 90 minutes in one go, even though she originally had said that she was only going to watch 30 minutes of it. I hope she will read the book in due time. I saw Part II by myself (I didn't let my daughter see it because I think she is too young to relate to it much).

The BBC has done just a wonderful job of reproducing many of these works in recent years, but I thought I would give this one a try since it was at a discounted rate on Amazon. It was just plain unengaging. The characters were difficult to relate to with the exception of the young David Copperfield, his mother, and Piggoty. I found the whole thing to be more of a depressing adaptation instead of the triumphal tale of overcoming a difficult past.

This movie impressively shows how love can overcome the trials and tribulations of adolescents. The supporting cast helped add to this feeling to, with Nichole Kidman providing a realistic but hopeful outlook to support Thandiwe in the decisions she was making. The line that made the movie complete was when Danny was sitting in his room and he thought \\"sending love I suppose, the word we never used because I guess we were to cool for that\\". This movie is very beautiful and if it wasn't for the abrupt ending would definitely deserve a five star rating, but that's what makes the movie so incredible. It has the ability of showing the hard realities of love, that sometimes unexpected things occur and it's how you deal with that, that determines just how deeply you feel."},{"rating":"1","title":"flirting","review":"Copy of Flirting sent to me was on incorrect zone and will not play.It was on zone 1, I amm on zone 4"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love Flirting","review":"I love this movie.

I was eager to learn more about him and his travels. The subtitle promised details of his \\"last journey\\", which, it turns out, he never made. Instead, I was bored with insipid details of the author's attempts to arrange a trip to the USSR and other assorted junk. It did not even spend much time on Tuva itself, but on unrelated trivia. It was apparent that the author was immensely more interested in the trip than Feynman, and that even he wasn't interested enough to stay at it to fruition. The author trades on the Feynman name to shamelessly promote the book and con the reader into plodding through endless drivel. Don't bother."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great story, though it loses its steam","review":"I would never had read this book had I not recently had the chance to see Huun Huur Tu, a throat-singing voice from Tuva. But now that I am fascinated by this little-known, remote area along the Russian-Mongolian border, I found this book very entertaining. It chronicles the enormous challege of trying to visit such a remote land in the days before Glasnost and a fascinating cast of characters at its heart.I think my only complaint is that the book loses steam at the end, which I guess is understandable, given the fate of its main protagonist. But overall, it is a wonderful testament to a group of brilliant folks, who spend years trying to follow through on a quest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing.","review":"I bought this book because I enjoy reading about Richard Feynman. I did not enjoy this book, although I really wanted to. Not only is this tale only peripherally about Richard Feynman, it turned out to be an amateurish, dull, and plodding recounting of an apparently frivolous goal turned obsession. The writing was lifeless and tedious. Although I got through the whole book, I found myself wondering why I bothered. If anyone wants my copy, e-mail me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get to the point, will you Ralph?","review":"This book feels very outdated and with only one immediate purpose, to stroke the ego of Richard Feynman. Leighton uses his time and space to write an homage to Feynman that is not that interesting. In fact, only in the last 40 pages do we learn anything about Tuva.

A journey worth taking.","review":"Having the priviledge of seeing the play QED catalyzed my purchase of this wonderful book. This is no ordinary journey by no ordinary genius(es). It is a hilarious example of persistance required to learn all there is to know (without the aid of the Internet!) about an inaccessible culture, and then secure permission to travel to a dream-like land. This easy to read book makes me want to pick an obscure topic and make it my own hobby.My only disappointment is that the narrative lacked information about Professor Feynman's more personal trials and thoughts during this demanding period of his life. There were many chapters that rarely mentioned Feynman as the \\"journey\\" continued.

Its true enough that there are people who enjoy the pre-recorded covers included in the soundtrack. Nevertheless, the magnitude of original score's beauty renders the release of the songs only as utterly ridiculous. If I could have given this monstrosity a negative star rating I would have.

But, perhaps the steal of the record is a great Public Enemy song for enthusiasts and casual fans alike, \\"Bring the Noise\\" might have you coming back for more.

The intriguing, if somewhat cliche, storyline does little to disguise the blemishes and flaws in this movie. The major downfalls are the awkward and choppy scriptwriting and directing.In general, the character progression is unbelievable, exhibiting little to no natural transition from emotion to emotion during pivotal scenes. On the other hand, the acting is decent, but also suffers from the poor writing and direction. As the product of this, you end up with a movie that you don't want to watch but you want to know what happens at the end.I would NOT recommend this film unless you have an affinity for bad southern gothics or a vested interest in Gale Harold's career.DO NOT watch this movie if you're looking for gay or lesbian characters; it only touches upon gay themes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"I just loved this book.

Lanegan furthers his bid to be the heir to Tom Waits' misanthropic, sycophantic mantle while pushing his songwriting in new directions. The restlessness evident on his recent solo recordings and work with artists as diverse as PJ Harvey, QOTSA and Greg Dulli finds another paving stone to push off of with UK production team Soulsavers. Murky cobwebs of soundscapes perfectly underpin stories of loss, regret, and religious ambivalence. The drawback of the album is, despite savvy cover choices (Neil Young's \\"Through My Sails,\\" The Rolling Stones' \\"No Expectations,\\" and Lanegan's own \\"Kingdoms of Rain\\"), Lanegan veers dangerously close to becoming a song stylist. Gritty metaphor and resolute, forward momentum has always been the singer's strength, falling back on hoary chestnuts threatens to be his downfall."},{"rating":"2","title":"clipper head","review":"This clipper head is great for roaching a saddle mules main makes nice even cuts and stays sharp.

Even when the book did resort to technique, the author used terminology not applicable to beginners and then did not bother to enlighten readers with an explanation nor with a glossary of definitions.

He displays his maturity though calm music, meaningful lyrics, and 3 monologues. The monologues are \\"No Sh*#t\\", \\"Afraid to Get Close\\", and \\"She Called Me Daddy\\". Iggy Pop's music has always showed great emotion, whether it is anger, desperation, or sadness, there's plenty of it here. \\"Avenue B\\" is probably my favorite song on here. \\"Motorcycle\\" and \\"Corruption\\" are other notable tracks. This probably isn't Iggy's best of the 90's (American Caesar is pretty good...) but it's still up there as one of the best albums he has ever recorded."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of his best","review":"It only took a couple listens before I began wishing I could \\"delete\\" the monologues on this record. The songs are all quite strong, however. While they are superficially unusual in form, their topicality is straight down the middle Iggy. By which I mean that for what this stuff is, it's as good as it gets."},{"rating":"2","title":"Emotional","review":"This album tore my heart out and fed it to a bunch of wild dogs. It was an amazing experience. This album has some weak points but overall it is one of his best albums ever. Iggy opens himself up completly and I thank him for it wherever he is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dead End Street","review":"It should not come as a surprise to long-time fans that Iggy Pop veered into a spoken word setting, since his gigs over the many years would find him dipping into Beat Generation-inspired gritty prose between songs.But besides the semi-autobiographical title track and a surprising solid cover of the rock-n-roll classic Shakin' All Over, Pop seemingly does not have the motivation or lyrical focus for this style of performance art. Produced by Don Was, the album had one single - Corruption - but it ultimately fails to be that open door into Pop's psyche after living on the edge for nearly a lifetime; simply, a failed psychophysical experiment where the bulk of the 13 tracks sputter down a dead end street."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a HUGE let-down!","review":"I'm not a diehard Iggy fan, although I think his decade-old \\"Brick By Brick,\\" also produced by Don Was, is one of the bext albums ever recorded by ANYONE. Iggy always seemed to me like an unguided missile whose raw power required a solid producer like Was to focus and concentrate. So I was really hoping for this one. WRONG! About a third of the cuts are (blessedly short) self-revealing personal monologues about whatever. BORING and who cares!! MMW are a terrible match for Iggy, I'm afraid. I'm surprised Was let this out of the building. Ten years haven't been kind to the WAS-Iggy equation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Iggy's on a downward spiral","review":"As a lifelong Iggy fan that owns everything he has ever recorded, it's unfortunate to report that the great one is on a downward spiral. Avenue B is a boring, agonizingly unimaginative disc that sees his creativity burnt out. Even the songs with some potential... like Nazi Girlfriend... are executed with very little flair. I have played the disc repeatedly for years with the hopes of finding something worth remembering... and it still falls flat. Even the single, Corruption, sounds like a bad Zombie Birdhouse out-take. The downward spiral continued with Beat 'Em Up... an energetic rock album with more power... but with embarrasingly bad lyrics from one of rock's greatest poet lyricists. For golden Iggy... check out Raw Power from the Stooges era, Lust For Life, The Idiot, New Values... or for more recent solid Iggy, check out American Caesar... his last great album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry Iggy","review":"Sometimes Iggy gets lazy and this is one of those times. Sounds like he read from his diary and then the record company, in desperation, found someone to back him up. The cover of the Pirates' \\"Shakin' All Over\\" is classic. I don't have the import version listed here with the live Paris shows. But remember, Parisians love Jerry Lewis too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting look at the human circulatory system","review":"This half-hour Moody Science Classic DVD is about the human circulatory system, the \\"red river of life\\" being the bloodstream. There are a lot of useful diagrams, illustrations, etc to explain how it works. In the end, they hook up an actual human heart (donated to science) to a machine to show the differing effects of higher and lower blood pressures, etc. It was pretty interesting.This was narrated by Dr. Irwin Moon, who is a very engaging narrator. At the end, he ties in a nice brief Bible lesson. Being produced several decades ago, the cinematography is rather dated, and not as flashy as the typical production today. Still, my elementary-aged children have enjoyed watching the DVDs in these series, and frequently ask to watch another one. However, children who are used to watching lots of modern-day television and videos may not be as enthused. Still, I'd recommend the series to Christian homeschooling families."},{"rating":"2","title":"NPR has the best programming","review":"There is no other radio station that has better programming than NPR. The creativity, humour and complexity of their stories gives them a head up on all other media outlets. This CD is poignant, funny and interesting. The stories really do hold you in the car and in your driveway. There were times where we had to pullover because the story was so funny. In other situations there was not a dry eye in the car. I highly reccomend this CD. Although, \\"Driveway Moments 2\\" 2005 is not nearly as good. In fact I was completley dissapointed in the sequal."},{"rating":"1","title":"These stories weren't the kind that I would sit in my car to hear","review":"I listen to NPR quite a bit and was excited when I ordered this CD. However, none of the stories on it were so interesting as to make me sit in the car and wait to hear the end. I think one of the \\"This American Life\\" CD's would have been a better choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"couldn't wait to get in the car!","review":"I live in a foreign country, and always missed hearing NPR on a daily basis. But now, I love having this in the car, the whole family does. It's also great to have it so that you can hear it again and again. I find that sometimes the second time around is even better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"between the fence and the universe","review":"This is a solid EP. Criticizm towards Kevin Max regarding whether or not he's still a Christian, and towards his music is ridiculous to me. The beauty of Kevin's music is that he doesn't put his message right out there in the open.DC Talk breaking up was the best thing that ever happened to Kevin Max. TobyMac is a travesty to music and christianity. And tait is mediocre at best. Kevin Max plays real music. He plays with real emotion and sings about real life things. If you're a christian who can't handle that, then please go listen to Toby Mac talk about what a huge party christianity is.We should all be thanking people like kevin max for bringing some legitimacy back into Christian music, not bashing him for doing so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is KMAX still a Christian","review":"I've wondered for the last several years whether KMAX was a Christian. His interviews and songs being the source of this curiousity. In regards to his latest, I'd read the lyrics before purchasing this album. It's ok to \\"go out of the box\\" but don't leave the Faith while doing so. lilmacumd@yahoo.com"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Love Love EFO !","review":"Eddie From Ohio is absolutely my favorite band. I've seen them live 7 times to date and was present at the Wolf Trap show that was taped for this album. For anyone who has not experienced EFO yet, this is the CD for you. It features all of favorite songs from Quick and a few of the older staples you can't help but sing along to. My favorite track is \\"Operator.\\" The only thing that would make me think more highly of this album would be if they'd put the live band banter on. This group is hilarious and interacts on stage so well together. Everyone I have played their music for loves it - check it out today."},{"rating":"1","title":"very poorly mastered off the vinyl","review":"I'm not categorically against mastering cd's off the vinyl. I understand sometime it's the only option available; however, I have a hard time believing this is the best they could do. Plenty of hiss and crackle and the muffled sound found on vinyl that was poorly pressed in the first place. If you have acess to a vinyl copy, save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another heavy hitter!","review":"\\"The Honeydripper\\" was Roosevelt Sykes' nickname and a fitting name for this wonderful album. Things open on a high note with 'Miss Ida B.' There are a few heavy tunes like 'I Hate To Be Alone' and 'Mislead Mother' which explores marital infidelity. Things lighten up with 'Jailbait' and 'Satellite Baby.' Ya gotta love an ol' Blues song based around Sputnik. 'Yes, Lawd' is a slow Blues instrumental that invites the guys to open up and improvise. Sykes' handy work is as good as ever. In 'She Ain't For Nobody' and throughout \\"the Honeydripper,\\" Robert Banks' organ work shines. One of the greatest and perhaps least appreciated aspects of this album is that it featuresKing Curtison sax. Infused with Soul and R&B;, this 1960 Blues release has that great vintage sound. The recording fits in well with similar efforts like \\"the Return of Roosevelt Sykes\\" and \\"Feel Like Blowing My Horn.\\" Listen to \\"the Honeydripper\\" and celebrate the power and glory that is the music of Roosevelt Sykes."},{"rating":"1","title":"If your're desperate...","review":"I was looking for Suddenly There's A Valley and downloaded it as an MP3. The quality is so bad that I wouldn't recommend this to anyone - unless you're desperate for a song and don't mind the lack of quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book on adolescent development in the 21st century","review":"As the author of a book on teens and adolescent development, I'd recommend THIS book as the best current book on adolescent development that's been written. The problematic and accurate nature of that statement is that Prof. De Zengotita hasn't written a book on adolescent development--it's a book on media studies and culture. And there's the rub. If, in 2012, you want to know anything accurate, useful and prescient about how American adolescents develop their identities, you must understand the bi-direcitonal effects of media. This is one book every involved, caring parent will want to read. I'm quite sure he'd reject the hyperbole, but I feel strongly about parents reading the title."},{"rating":"1","title":"intelligent, but lacks intellectual discipline...","review":"Reading this book is like having to listen to your stoned parents bragging about how modern and cool they are for having a tevo, while you are busy hooking it up for them because they still can't figure out how to use it. Although de Zengotita brings up some interesting and important points, he has an incredibly convoluted (and, frankly, smug) writing style which unfortunately seems to be passing for intellectual rigor in the academy these days. A bigger problem is that he hasn't made the effort to organize these insights into any coherent theory or even anything coherent, period. The result is that we are left snippets of insight coupled with the vague notion that he's onto something really important, and frustrated with his refusal to exercise any intellectual or editorial discipline so that we can be more clear about what exactly that is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"I bought this book for my class on persuasion. It does not read like a textbook, its a trade. So it is a lot of fun to read and really informational. Makes you look at the media in a different light, I really enjoyed this book and would recommend it to anyone really. Not just for communication majors, it is for anyone who is interested in mass media."},{"rating":"1","title":"A long magazine article","review":"I wanted very much to like this book. I'm keenly interested in the affect media has on individuals and society and have read quite a lot in this area. Zengotita's breezy, intelligent and humorous style merely frustrated me. He presents mostly opinion, an extended essay. It is fascinating opinion, but not the sort of helpful fact-based analysis or data-driven synthesis I was hoping for. Perhaps if this is your first introduction to the field, the book would be enjoyable (though Neil Postman's \\"Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business\\" is for my money a great essay-like introduction to this field."},{"rating":"2","title":"And you thought it was just you...","review":"I've read and re-read this book a number of times. I never knew that someone else could even have as much insight into the patterns of my thoughts as De Zengotita does. It's a brilliant book -- and while its is very well argued and thought out, I couldn't shake the eiree feeling that I vaguely knew it all before... This however only strenghtens the book, for it demonstrates what a rich and deeply accurate account 'Mediated' is -- De Zengotita gives you enough perspective on the phenomenological processes of mediation to give you a tour of your own mind. Whether you like to craft playlists on iTunes; take eco-tourism vacations for their authenticity; are a dog-person; or have ever told anyone the story of where you were on september 11th, this book has something to say to you and your most personal thoughts."},{"rating":"2","title":"not the usual junk","review":"Tired of your newsweekly's glitzy \\"media\\" column? Or establishment outlets like CNN Reliable Sources? This book is some non-corporate, free thinking... substance! (at last) Written from a genuinely philosophical bent, informed by history and the social sciences, this is not the kind of analysis you find in the MSM.But the beauty part is it's all that AND a breeze to read. And covers not just the usual political-media topics, but how media pervades how we live our lives in all the day-to-day banality.So, great beach reading AND you'll impress your summer dinner guests afterwards with your insights from this book..."},{"rating":"2","title":"welcome to world world","review":"De Zengotita is a brilliant and elegant writer who is able to put clear words to vast and complex problems you've thought about and struggled with, but were unable to ever properly articulate--problems regarding where our relationship to the ever-expanding media might be leading us. Combining erudite philosophical insight, humanistic anthropological concerns, and highly readable language, he takes the hyper-self-conscious world of reality shows and 24 hour news in which we live, and questions the effects it is having on the way we think about ourselves, and the way we see what's around us. The examples he uses are absorbing, hilarious, and scarily dead on.

There is some wisdom here and there, but not worth the headache you'll get trying to decipher what is going on in his head. Here is an example:\\"If you say your own name to yourself at such a moment, it will seem utterly alien. You will then understand the sacrament of baptism.\\" Huh?At first, I thought his writing may just be over my head, but after re-reading most of it, I realized it was just bad. It's like the whole book was written when he was high or something. Some very good ideas, but most can be found in other, better written books."},{"rating":"1","title":"In Love With His Own Words ...","review":"This is a tough book to critique b/c my law school recommended it. The author writes a well organized book, but every chapter has been padded -- chapters that could have been concisely written in 20 pages drag out to sixty. Buy this book only if you have to and read it only if you must. You aren't going to learn anything definitive from these chapters and all the practicing lawyers I run into think the authors ideas are just plain silly. The best way to teach about trial advocacy is to include REAL transcripts from REAL cases, not made up stories about fire trucks and people late for work. Those work great -- on paper.

Set seven years ago on oscar night( and that is as close as he would ever get to one) Seagal gets bad guy Sadler(always fun as the bad man) on video ordering a hit on someone. Well before you can say \\"kung fu\\" Seagal is shot and left for dead , his wife is killed and his son gets away. But as we all know, if you don't cut him into pieces, just like Jason, Seagal isn't dead, but he is REALLY, REALLY MAD. Never once is this believable but as it moves so fast you never really have much time to think about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not what I remembered, but...","review":"I had these memories of Hard to Kill being an awesome movie. Back in the late 80's it was, but according to today's standards it's pretty tame stuff. Maybe we're all spoiled. I no longer consider this one of his best movies (-1 star). I liked him in The Patriot and Glimmer Man, for instance. Nevertheless, this movie has a place in action film history. Back in the late 80's, early 90's Steven Seagal was the premiere action star. So this movie is a must-have as one of the better Seagal films (4 stars). It's a classic action film of days gone by. Although you can still see Seagal in his latest efforts playing the same role, this file was his second and was one of the two that put him at the top."},{"rating":"1","title":"Average Follow-Up To 'Law'","review":"Not-so-exciting revenge story starring the ego maniac Steven Seagal. I was upset after watching this one. Seagal's wife is killed and he's put in a coma after finding evidence to put away a local mayor. Almost 7 years pass and he awakes to the \\"Weird Science\\" chick. They beat up a ton of people at a ranch and he embarrasses the bad guy at the end. Typical action movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Story and Action is Lacking","review":"This movie starts out well enough. The first fight scene is quick but entertaining. The plot thickens as his family is slain and he is in a coma, unbeknownst of the Bad guys (they think he died also). But while Seagal delivers a strong performance in a poorly directed movie, everything else crumbles. Le Brock, then married to Seagal, is poor as the nurse bringing Seagal back to health so he can clear his name and wallop the bad guys. Bill Sadler is OK as the sinister, power hungry senator, but the movies fight scenes are boring and people are knocked out in unrealistic fashion (a lot of Glass Jaw Joes in this film).Still, it is not a total disaster, if you have an hour and a half to kill; it beats any Seagal Movie besides Exit Wounds since 1997."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to Watch...","review":"Don't get me wrong, I love these types of films but this one took WAY too long to get going.

Mr. Seagal has never been much of an actor and in his prime was run of the mill in martial arts ability at best. With Jackie Chan, Jet Li, Chuck Norris and so many other better talents available, there is no reason to waste time with minor leaguers. Steven is to martial arts as K-Fed is to music.

Takeshi Kato also gets to express himself more than his role in High and Low allows. Much of the film has a \\"Western\\" overtone - down to rich playboy Tatsuo's game of hunting, and the interior of the ruined factory that's reminiscent of dungeons in WWII films...oh boy.

The comments about the radar in the book are so brief that it gives you the wrong impression about the different approaches the germans and british had to this new technology. The tactics of the german pilots are only described briefly. Yes, we already know that the germans invented the \\"rotte\\" and the book goes tell you about \\"schräge musik\\", that the germans tried to shoot at very close range and so on and so on.

Chain of Fools, the old Aretha Franklin standard, hits a new note. It combines the seductiveness of Kevin Ayers with the darkness of the Cure."},{"rating":"1","title":"For Philosophers and Thoreau/Transcendentalist Scholars only","review":"This was a very difficult book for me to read as there was too much going on. Thoreau had a wandering mind as well as body, and that comes out quite well in this collection of his works. Unfortunately, I don't like that sort of writing. It always felt like he was rambling and would never stick to one topic. While this is an admirable quality it is also frustrating. There were some interesting parts in this book. I particularly liked aspects of \\"Civil Disobedience,\\" the chapter in Walden on reading was riveting, and his \\"Life Without Principles,\\" had some interesting thoughts. And, too be fair, I read through this rather quickly. But, this is a book only for philosophers and Thoreau/Transcendentalist scholars. Average readers should stick with \\"Civil Disobedience\\" and Walden."},{"rating":"2","title":"great value","review":"Very nice collection of Thoreau's work. Perfect for anyone wanting to get better acquainted with Thoreau."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"Have been using this for 3 months now & find it very easy to use, i rarely need to use the high watt bulb as the low is so good. But in dark streets you are able to switch between easily. I love the fact that it gives you the 1/2 hr warning before it runs out. It is very compact and fits on the top of your bar out of the way."},{"rating":"1","title":"A tangled mess","review":"This is one of the least inspired and entertaining mysteries I've encountered in years. The plot is ridiculously complex (and silly), the camera work is irritating, the hero is a raunchy oaf, and the writer has badly confused Anglo-Catholicism with Catholicism in his portrayal of an English church. Even the quality of the picture is not that great. Stay away from this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"I should have known better","review":"Not the first time I've read an anthology with stories by authors I love - for their full-length novels. Not the first time I've been sorry about it. It's a real challenge to write a stand-alone story about a character with 3 novels out there - and a novella has very different pacing demands from a full-length. Anyway, if you've read the Walker papers, you'll find Banshee Cries duplicates an awful lot of explanations (with the identical same phrases, which really gets my goat, did she just use generic fill material?) Oh well, I'll stick to the novels (which are really, really excellent and you should go and buy any full length by C.E Murphy right now; you'll thank me.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy it when the used books come out","review":"The story by Mercedes Lackey was written at the age 13 and below level. Very juvenile and predictable, and about on a par with her Gryphon series, particularly the second and third book. I felt as if she was just hacking the story out to have something to offer during this time period. Her characters were way too wooden and without interest. The other two stories by Tanith Lee and C.E. Murphy failed to hold my interest past the first three or four pages, and I'd have a hard time telling you what they were about. This just isn't worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"not as good as i thought","review":"It took me quiet long to get into all of the three stories!! The last one from C.E.

Unfortunately, because JG's writing style is so good, I can't even put the bad ones down, however I did stop reading this one halfway through and came back to it. As someone else has noted here it seems to lack any sort of real direction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read Only if You Are Having Trouble Sleeping","review":"This book was a real snooze. It seemed to go on forever. The ending was incredibly anti-climactic. Grisham could have done something bold at the end (think sister), but went with some obscure, hardly believable, ending. Very, very weak. Don't waste your money or time. Unless you need something to put you to sleep."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Well is Bone Dry","review":"I have read 12 of Grisham's 17 novels. He truly gave the best of himself at the beginning of his writing career and has been on a downhill slide ever since. He used to write books that I literally could not put down. I had to force myself to finish this book. It had none of the page-turning, pulse-pounding suspense of his earlier books. It was just...boring. On top of that I found it to be sloppy, too. There were times when he told us (again) what he had just told us 2 pages earlier. Whoever edited this book also missed several mistakes (Miss Callie would have counted!)Want good Grisham? Go back and just reread his older stuff because he's obviously not going to give us anything new that comes anywhere near his earlier books. If you're dead set of reading this, check it out from the library. Don't waste money on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Last Juror? No, the latest BORE!!","review":"This was nothing like any of Grisham's past novels....the title alone is nothing like you'd expect. First, there was no 'last' juror...only 3 died in the book. And there was no single juror that held any precidence over the others at all that had any major plot line of the story. I feel that two thirds of the novel is completely irrelevant. I'm sure that it would be interesting to anyone wanting to know about the history of Clanton during the 70's; to them it would have been astounding....but no, it was a historical bore!I wanted a courtroom thriller, but really, any drama in the courtroom happened completely randomly in the last 10 pages....I kept reading only because I wanted the monotonous story line to end.If you are looking forward to one another one of Grisham's better thriller, wait till his next book....this one is a bore from page 5 through 455. Sleep Tight!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, boring, boring","review":"This book is a boring yarn that I thought would never end. It has no particular plot and just rambles away. I fail to understand why the author thought that this might be interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Grisham Ever","review":"This is by far the worst ever Grisham book. It is like no other Grisham, in that there is barely any courtroom action. The chapters seem thrown together, and NOTHING happens. The only reason I kept reading was to see if anything would develop. Read any other Grisham."},{"rating":"1","title":"COULD NOT WAIT TO PUT IT DOWN","review":"MY WIFE READ IT, SAID IT WAS OK. SHE AND I HAVE READ EVERY GRISHAM BOOK AND LIKED MOST.

WRONG! Don't waste your money, reading this book is less exciting than listening to Nora Jones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good, But mine is better","review":"John Grisham may well be the very best author working in the U.S. today. Let's just get that out of the way up front, since everyone seems to repeat it ad nasuem. He's one of the greats- and, unlike many lesser authors, his creativity has not dried up over all these years.But having dabbled in fictional writing myself, I came up with roughly the same storyline as this book. While I didn't complete a manuscript, I did manage to get a few chapters (as well as a complete outline... hmmmmm...) to several publishers. Oh, and before I forget to specify, this was all more than 3 years ago.So it goes without saying that I was loathe to finish reading this book, and my opinion remains somewhat biased. Of course I love the story- but I loved it more when I was telling it! Please keep in mind, I'm not making any accusations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Out of Ideas","review":"This is by far the worst Grisham yet. Too many Good Ole Boys, Bubbas and babbling. Absolutely no suspense, drama or reason to continue reading. Fall asleep on the front porch of an historic falling-down old home in a boring small town with this one. Let's hope Grisham hangs up his lucrative contractual hat with this bomb. Pass this up for almost any David Baldacci or Dan Brown read you can get your hands on."},{"rating":"1","title":"couldn't even finish it","review":"I'm a big fan of John Grisham early works... Runaway Jury, Time to Kill etc. But this story and The Summons sucked. I read the The Summons all the way through and I never felt the suspense and after I got to the ending I felt stupid for forcing myself through the book. This story I decided not to even finish. The stories susposed to be about a man coming back and killing the jurors after he gets out of the jail. So I'm thinking that theres going to be about a 100 or so pages leading up to the man getting out of jail then there would be the killings. I got over halfway through the book which was very boring and I was still reading about the time surrounding the trial. I couldn't figure out the point of all this extra info. So I gave up. Don't waste your time if you're a fan of the early John Grisham."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grisham losing steam?","review":"If you're looking for the typical Grisham \\"thriller\\", this is not the book. The Last Juror is disappointing at best! The story that is outlined on the book jacket takes more than one third of the book to unfold. In other words, the book jacket told us the same thing that a full one third of the book told us. The second third is barely readable! It has absolutely nothing to do with the plot. The book is certainly not what the reader is looking for when reading a Grisham novel.Grisham has indeed earned the financial freedom to discover other genre's, but I wish the publisher wouldn't try to fool the reader into thinking this is another legal thriller."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was he thinking?","review":"I was extremely disappointed with the entire book. I forced myself to finish it, hoping it might get better. I found myself skipping entire paragraphs and missing nothing in the process. The characters are all completely forgettable, and so is the story. The end was predictable, and any moron could have guessed why the jurors were being eliminated.Please don't write another book, Mr. Grisham.This was a complete waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is that all there is?","review":"John Grisham's books tend to be easy to read. Unfortunately, his latest books do not live up to \\"The Firm\\" or \\"The Client.\\" The plot of \\"The Last Juror\\" was so simple that it didn't take a rocket scientist to guess what would happen next. That isn't necessarily a bad thing, but this story line left you feeling unsatisified. I compare it to going to a great restaurant and not getting enough to eat. After plowing through 355 pages, you are left with a \\"is that it?\\" reaction. The ending wasn't enough to make you feel full when you left the table."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"Grisham disappoints the reader in this drab novel. Too many inconsequential characters, which makes the book choppy to read. Granted, a surprize ending, but not enough to propel the novel into a mediocre book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This book was a nice narrative but you can clearly see how the marketing folks got a hold of it and tried to sell it as a thriller. It isn't one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not your usual John Grisham book!!","review":"I was very disappointed with this book, in that it did not follow his usual genre. I did not read reviews ahead of time or I would not have purchased the book. I am an avid reader of his books and buy them as soon as they are on the market. The jacket of the book was very misleading. I kept waiting for the trial to be over so we could get on with the riveting story of the revenge issue. It never got off the ground. I almost did not finish the book. The redeeming factor in the book is the relationship with the last juror, which was the whole point of the book. It should have been advertised that way on the book jacket."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is John Grisham?","review":"Will the real John Grisham stand up please! This makes 3 in a row...surely he is on vacation and this is written by someone else. Where is the wonderful detailed stories of the past."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Last Juror","review":"A fantastic read! Grisham deviates from the \\"greedy lawyer\\" genre he helped to popularize (tho the book contains several characters who are attorneys), and he does what he does best- storytelling of the people in the deep South. Woven into the main plot- a murder and trial- is a fully fleshed corps of characters, some likeable and others not, and as the book proceeds, I found myself truly interested in most of them and the outcome of the plot. This is by far his best written novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Last Juror is a sure miss!","review":"It's been awhile since I read a John Grisham novel because I'm not a big fan of contemporary writing. However, after reading the dust cover of The Last Juror, I was hooked. I braced myself for a thriller reminscent of A Time to Kill (after all both books were set in the same small Mississippi town). I was sorely disappointed. Grisham tosses in almost everything but the kitchen sink in this novel as he waxes poetic on small town life in Mississippi, the evils of Wal-Mart, and the wonders of Southern cooking. This is a great sentimental novel but as a thriller it lacks punch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is the plot?","review":"I have always been a fan of John Grisham's writing, defending him in the face of my intellectual friends who consider him to be formulaic and predictable. My response has always been, \\"Who cares, as long as he keeps writing books with such scintillating plots and characters?\\"But this latest offering is a bitter disappointment. The pace is plodding and never amounts to anything: no suspense, no drama, not even an interesting string of events. The characters are nothing but cardboard cut-outs. The book reads like a boring photo album, with quick descriptions penned on the back of each picture. The most telling sign is the utter lack of emotional depth, especially when this book is apparently supposed to be a heartwarming tribute to Grisham's somewhat idealized memories of the Deep South.I kept reading this book until the bitter end, convinced that Grisham was going to turn things around. He doesn't. Skip this turkey and save yourself the time and aggravation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I usually enjoy Grisham's books and even tolerate his political views but this book was dreadfully boring. The story just lacked the thrill and suspense of his former books and the plot was just too predictable. The end was so disappointing that I kept thinking that I missed something. Would not recommend this book unless you need something to put you to sleep."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"This book is as well written as any other by John Grisham that I've read. I really enjoyed seeing familiar characters from A Time to Kill come back up with a little background to them. Highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful story","review":"I am not going to summarize the book, that has been done enough, I don't normally do that in my reviews.......anyway, I really enjoyed this book. I was surprised at all the mixed reviews I read on Amazon as well as some papers and magazines. I thought this was one of Mr. Grisham's best. I have to admit, for you skeptics out there, I have always been a fan of Mr. Grisham's, but I have felt his last few books have not lived up to my expectations. I think this one is WONDERFUL. I think Mr. Grisham is just a great storyteller, and this was one great story. The charcters were believable and interesting, and the story itself grabbed my interest and would not let go. I for one am thrilled to have a Grisham book that rates up there with A Time to Kill, The Firm,and Pelican Brief. This book will join my stack of Grisham's that I like to reread, just for the enjoyment of a good story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grisham is Back!","review":"Grisham is back and in top form. I really enjoyed this book--its a quick, interesting read. Like most Grisham novels, The Last Juror is set in the south. But unlink most other Grisham novels, this isn't in the viewpoint of a lawyer, judge or client--despite the title. The view from the editor/jouralist looking at a grisley rape/murder over many years is unique.The one criticism I have is some of the plot twists (away from the rape/murder case which is the focus of the book) you could see a mile a way. Grisham is at his best when dealing with crime and the law. Not so much with everyday human life and relationships."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible book, poor editing","review":"This feels like Grisham's attempt to write Southern literature, rather than suspense fiction. The entire book feels like a feeble attempt to imitate Harper Lee. Don't let the book jacket fool you, a full 1/3 of the book cover stuff that isn't related to the trial at all.The editing is also poor. Once he used the same exact descriptive sentence in two different places in the novel. In another, he describes a young man wants to be a draft dodger but is convinced to go to Vietnam by his parents. Less than 10 pages later Grisham writes that the parents begged their son not to go.The entire plot is a let down. There is no suspense, the \\"surprise ending\\" meager and predictable, and Grisham wastes half the novel writing about utter non-sense that is not related to the story and is not charming."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst I have ever read !!!","review":"This has been the worst book from Grisham than I have ever read. It was a waisting time. Page after page I was expecting things change or come better but at the end I was dissapointed with this book. I should read the amazon rate before buy this book. I'll do next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spare me","review":"The first Grisham I read was The Partner. I loved it and proceeded to plow through every one of his books. In the last five to six years, save The Brethren, his books have become nothing more than essays that go nowhere. After now having read The Broker and The Last Juror (both having only the thinest of plots- if they can be called plots) I can confidently say I would only buy another Grisham if all the book stores and publishers in the world burned down and someone was giving one away. You may think I'm being harsh, but I get the feeling Grisham's heart is no longer in it and he is only writing for his publisher and hip pocket now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Grisham's Finest","review":"Usually John Grisham's books are a pageturner. Unfourtantly, The Last Juror is not one of those. I'm not even sure what the title is refering to. The first half of the book starts out strong but the 2nd and 3rd parts are weak. Parts of the book talks about Danny Padgitt but once the trial ends, it seems like Grisham is just filling paper to get a full length novel. There are even parts of the book where it's just gibberish. In fact, some things don't belong here.Last time Grisham visited Ford County was in the book A Time to Kill and that was 10 times better then The Last Juror as it had was filled with suspense and mystery but in The Last Juror, there's none of that. I like Grisham's past books but this one falls flat throughout."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Slow Read... A far departure from his first books","review":"I used to be an avid John Grisham fan. I would anxiously wait for his books to come out and be one of the first to purchase a book. Lately, his books have strayed and have not caught my interest. This book sounded like it could be in line with his first books, so I was anxious to read it. I can usually finish a Grisham book in less than a day... this one dragged for about a week. I forced myself to finish it so I could start a new book. The main character is not very interesting and it makes it hard to feel any involvement in the choices he makes in his life. If John Grisham continue the same trend, I will have to find a new author to enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"excellent detective story trying to get out of boring novel","review":"At the heart of the book is an excellent detective story of perhaps 100 pages which matches the better pieces of Agatha Christie. The trouble is that Grisham padded it out to a full-scale novel by throwing in everything but the kitchen sink: Missipppi corrupt politics, black history and cooking, the Viet Nam war, and so on. There should be a law against such blatant padding!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A meldng of the legal thriller and the small town story","review":"Awesome! This is a magnificent meld of Grisham's legal-thriller type stuff with a beautiful story of small-town interactions and friendships. I thought this was a great development in Grisham's writing style, and this was the book that made me want to try The Broker. Definitely pick this up. But DO NOT READ THE INNER JACKET, because it gives away about 70% of the action, and I would have rather seen the plot develop without reading the spoilers in the jacket. I don't know why they put so much info there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just not what I expect from Grisham","review":"Ok I am not saying this is a bad book - it does hold your attention and there is a little twist at the end but it is just not what I have come to expect from Grisham. I expect more law talk, suspense and action - this bordered on Chick Lit. There is nothing wrong with talking about people's feelings but that should be in a book by Danielle Steele not Grisham."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad","review":"I enjoy Grisham. The man can tell a story! But this time, it was a slow, boring story. This is even worse than Bleachers. It's predictable, it's uneventful,.....Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"This book was so disappointing. I've red lots of John Grisham's books, and I found this one almost totally uninteresting. I kept waiting for something exciting or suspenseful to happen, and even the waiting wasn't written suspensefully!Certainly not up to John Grisham's standards."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but for a Grisham book?","review":"I'll be honest, this is the first Grisham book I've read. I though it was a great book, as far as a novel depicting a character and a town, and the changes that both go through over time. However, it wasn't what I expected with my first Grisham novel. The main point of the book was not the murder which happens in the first 20 pages. I will make this comparison: If the film \\"A Time To Kill\\" is an exact representatin of the book, and you enjoyed reading the book, then \\"The Last Juror\\" is one you want to stay away from"},{"rating":"2","title":"Different type of Grisham","review":"Enjoyed the book a lot, not Grisham's typical courtroom drama. ALthough there were courtroom scenes in the book the story was told not from a Lawyer's perspective but from the town's newspaper owner. Found the main character courageous as he took a newspaper famous mainly for lenghthy obituaries to doubling the circulation by printing what he felt the town NEEDED to know about situations that had been ignored for many years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!","review":"I kept waiting for the story to start, but it never did. I hung in there, thinking that eventually something was going to happen. Even when there was a ripple of an event, it was written about in an uninteresting way. No suspence, no intrigue, just a waste of time in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to Grisham?","review":"I think John Grisham usually writes excellent legal thrillers, but this one was horrible. He seemed to be very wordy without having a point. He dragged things on, the conclusion was poor and unfullfilling for all the time put into reading the plot. The characters were likable, but just did not seem to go anywhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chick Flick","review":"I was ready for a great story in typical Grisham style. What I got was a chick flick. I usually quit a book like this after 90 to 100 pages. I should have this time. However, I kept hoping the story would get better. Save your money and re-read the firm."},{"rating":"1","title":"sleepy time","review":"I must admit that I fell asleep often while reading this book... which is rare because John Grisham usually keeps me up all night with his usual page turners. I thought this would be a come back after \\"Bleachers\\", which bored me to tears, but I was sadly mistaken. Can we please see more of the old \\"John Grisham\\" next time?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Jury Award.","review":"This is one of the best books one get to read of John Grisham and any author one can think of.The way he presented the story was lucid ,simple and always keeps you engrossed.This is one of the best book one can nread in the recent times.GOOD WORK JOHN .KEEP GOING."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bait and Switch","review":"Thought it would be another great courtroom thriller like Runaway Jury or The Partner. Instead, it's a long winded, wandering human interest story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, although not as bad as A Painted House","review":"In between the taut exciting thrillers Grisham used to wirte and the pointless drivel of A Painted House and Skipping Christmas. The first part was pretty good, not predictable at all, but then he just changed modes and starting droning on and on about boring small town life and didn't get back to the story until near the end. I long for the days of The Firm, A Time To Kill, The Partner, The Runaway Jury. Those were books I couldn't put down. It's been several years since Grisham's produced anything like that. This will be the last hardcover Grishal novel I buy--from now on, I wait for the paperback."},{"rating":"1","title":"PLEASE","review":"Help me finish this boring book. Stuck on page 200 or so and page after page of some boring town election. He cant create suspense, he can barely stay awake writing his own books. How did anyone finish this book?"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Honey, can you write another book? The bank account is low\\"","review":"About halfway through this book I turned to the front and counted how many books the author had already written before this one...16. So this is his 17th novel. Like many other reviewers, my overall criticism is there is a lot of padding or \\"fill\\". I have no idea, but it seems like the motivation to write this book might have been low and he just wasn't focused on how this novel was going to turn out."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very boring book","review":"I LOVE John Grisham. I have read almost all his books, but this one.... I couldn't even read beyond the first hundred pages. It is so slow, a lot of narrative. It looks more like a history book than a thriller one. I didn't like at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not his best work by any stretch........","review":"If you like the Grisham novels where it's non-stop action and suspense all the way through the novel, this book is NOT for you. It is not even close to his other jury titled book \\"The Runaway Jury.\\" This books is very slow and the real mystery only begins in the last 50 pages. Up to that point, it is very slow and actually boring. Quite a drop-off from Grisham's usually high standards in my opinion"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another vote for a solid 4 star rating","review":"John Grisham displays the ability to write a vaiety of types of books, all entertaining and unique.The Last Juror was not as fast paced and full of plot twists as some of his other works, but I think he was trying to portray life in an unspoiled, slow-paced Mississippi town in the 1970s - one that clung to Old South values and Old South traditions.I thought the commentary on how \\"Bargain City\\" swoops in and impacts small town America was interesting.I was very pleased with this book, and I am also proud of Mr. Grisham for keeping his books mostly clean and sticking to his faith in God."},{"rating":"1","title":"Much Liberal Propaganda","review":"A college journalism dropout buys a struggling rural county newspaper in Mississippi, only to find himself embroiled in a sensational murder trial. Really a portrait of the deep rural South in the decade after the end of Jim Crow, with some crime and suspense thrown in.But Grisham uses much of the novel to editorialize, through his protagonist, against the Vietnam War, against Wal-Mart, and in favor of forced busing. The only area where conservatives come out well is where some of the best characters attend church regularly. Read some politically incorrect history after reading this one to get a balanced view."},{"rating":"1","title":"Those were the days","review":"Kind of reminds me of a good ol' boy talking about the ol' days and oh, by the way, let's throw about 4 pages of story into all the reminiscing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A different angle.","review":"Yes, this is another lawyer story...but Grisham expands the parameters this time, giving more focus on characters and their development. A nice leap forward for the writer. As a fan, I've waited for him to break out of his usual shell, and he has certainly done so with \\"Last Juror.\\"On a more tenuous note, \\"A reader from New Orleans\\" should concern him/herself with more important things.

I haven't read that many, but this one was AWEFUL. It was sooo drawn out, and basically a waste of my time.However, I must say that I liked \\"The Summons\\", \\"The Testament\\", and so far I'm liking \\"The King of Torts.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Wha?","review":"I am completely mystified by the reviewers who gave this book more than one star.Mr.Grisham obviously wrote this in the hours between breakfast and lunch AND on a Sunday after church services.I got so tired of listening (book on tape) to his descriptions about FOOD. Ok, the author was hungry -- we get it.The church visitations were also useless (and there were a lot of those!). And gee, got any political convictions you'd like to share? ZZZzzzzzz.Michael Beck did a fine job as reader (although Harry Rex sounded like he was speaking with large wad of chew stuffed in his mouth). I just didn't like any of the characters (Willie was such a pompous so-and-so).This was not a courtroom drama or a revenge thriller. It just went on and on and on.I think someone needs to nuke Clanton right off the map."},{"rating":"1","title":"didn't like it at all","review":"This was so boring. There was too much emphasis on secondary characters, not enough on the plot. I was very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who are you and what have you done with Grisham?","review":"I was disappointed with Grisham's latest book, The Last Juror. The book slowly plodded along with no real direction. Not much a story: 25-year-old Willie buys a small-town newspaper and writes about the townsfolk. A man, Padgitt, kills and rapes a woman. Man is not sentenced to death penalty because of a hung jury. Newspaper sales go up. Willie befriends an older black woman, writes about her family, has lunch with her every Thursday. 10 years later, Padgitt is released from jail. Willie sells the newspaper. Black woman dies of heart attack. The end. Come on!!! This book was awful.Like most readers, I read for fun. This book was not fun. What happened to the Grisham who wrote simple-minded, super-fast reads such as The Rainmaker, The Client and The Firm?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Have I read this somewhere before?","review":"I am from Mississippi and went to school at Ole Miss, so, I am supposed to love John Grisham's books. I used not be able to wait until the next book came out.I find his books to all be cut from the same cloth. What happened to the great suspense books like The Firm and The Pelican Brief? It seems to me that Mr. Grisham is losing his passion for writing. Much like the main character in this book, I think that Mr. Grisham is just trying to produce a story fast enough to meet a deadline set by his publisher and just good enough to pass the minimum requirements needed to sell a few copies.In a nutshell, Mr. Grisham's books are becoming steadily worse. My advice--don't waste your time reading this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING","review":"The story was kind of interesting in the beginning, but went wayward in the middle and finally ended without a fizzle. It was bland and flat. I'm not sure it's worth being hard covered."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's the point?","review":"I am a big fan of John Grisham, but this book has to be his worst. While the characters were enjoyable, I'm not quite sure there was a point to the book at all. There was no suspense, or mystery, or anything worth grasping. It went along at a snails pace and I think this could have been written in 100 pages instead of 355 pages. Don't waste your time or money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of his best........boring","review":"I am a big John Grisham fan and have read all his books. I think I only read them out of habit now because I have not enjoyed the last few. This was one of the most boring books I have read in a long time. I think John Grisham should take a few years off and then maybe he would be able to write like he did 10 years ago. I plodded through this book hoping it would get better, not really caring about the characters and finding it very predictable. It never did get better but it did end!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not My Cup of Tea","review":"For a John Grisham book, I was a bit disappointed with the writing style. It took me at least 100 pages to become remotely interested and even then I still wanted to put it down. The storyline seemed interesting enough: In 1970, one of Mississippi's more colorful weekly newspapers, The Ford County Times, went bankrupt until a young mother was brutally raped and murdered by a member of the notorious Padgitt family. After being sentenced to \\"life\\" in prison, \\"life\\" in Mississippi doesn't really mean \\"life in prison\\". It seemed like it would be an amazing thriller but quite honestly it was a slow and boring read."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst of John Grisham","review":"Is it one story or a bunch of mini-stories totally un-related.

But this book was a huge disappointment. There was way too much time spent talking about church visits and introducing yet another new undeveloped character. The middle of the book drags and lacks direction. The best part of the book was the relationship he has with Callie's family. The nine years that Padgitt spends in jail could have and should have been condensed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"For a couple pleasant afternoons in Summer","review":"After I have read this book, I had the feeling to be in Southern, with its hot and humidity, but I had preferred a different story to spend my holidays. The title is not what you expect, because there is a trial, yes, and a jury, yes, but is a small part of the book. While you are reading The Last Juror, you are learning how was the life in Claton (Miss) and how a 21 years old, can run a paper with a loan from his grandma.The book is as reading obituaries, nice ones, but no more."},{"rating":"1","title":"A light skim","review":"Not really the author's meatiest books and it doesnt really present a 'page turner' feel to it.

Perhaps at 1/3 its length it probably would have held together. It's stretched way too far. I finally quite halfway. Not unpleasant. Just mind-boggingly slow. He's not a deep writer. If he doesn't keep it moving everybody's in trouble. Way slow. Only have so much time in this world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Riveting","review":"This novel was much more character driven than plot driven than other Grisham novels I've read. I enjoyed the first person narrative and the way the characters became real. This wasn't the kind of book that so gripped me so that I had to rush to read it in one setting, but instead one that I was able to take more time to savor and enjoy the nuances of some of the southern flavors and smells. Enjoyable book."},{"rating":"1","title":"meh","review":"Like the past few efforts from grisham, this one catches it's stride after a couple of boring chapters, keeps you plodding along out of mild curiosity, blazes through a bunch of frivilous events near the end, then plunges you off a cliff with no climax, and a confusing \\"resolution\\". My love for courtroom novels, and grisham's earlier work keep me searching for his long awaited return to form. This isn't it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The last juror","review":"He's still the best! Grisham has it down pat as a fascinating lawyer and story tell. Read all his books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I bought this book because the synopsis sounded good and because I knew John Grisham had a reputation of being a great author of suspense novels. This book was ok, but just ok. There wasn't any suspense that I could see, and it wasn't the type of book I couldn't put down. It was just a nice little tale of a town and it's people. Not a typical Grisham novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Historical Fiction, not legal suspense","review":"In this novel John Grisham has created an in depth and fascinating study of a small southern town and all its characters, tracking their growth and development over time. He details food, customs, race relations and politics. However, that is most definitely not what I wanted from a Grisham novel with a legal title. I wanted suspense and thrill. This dragged on with Michner-like detail providing occasional clues to the secondary legal plot while chronicling history. The denoument was highly anticlimactic. Read it for lovely historical fiction, but not if you want hardhitting, riveting thrilling suspense."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Book","review":"John Grisham's latest book really impressed me. When I read this book, I could almost see myself there. I could picture each character, especially Lucien when he was mad in court.It was very entertaining and funny in many places. It was also suspenseful in many places. I liked how Grisham slowly started with the suspense and then made it more and more suspenseful until the end. If you're looking for a book that will surprise, entertain, and will let you have a good time, read The Last Juror by John Grisham."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grisham's Best--but mind the ending","review":"Other than his short story collection \\"Ford County,\\" this is the only decent book Grisham has written since \\"The Rainmaker,\\" and even this one, much as I love it, had an ending that made me find somewhere private and cry. Maybe it wasn't such a good move to read it shortly after my mom died, and maybe I should have thought twice because of Grisham's taste for bitterly unhappy endings. It could have easily ended in the courthouse, rather than where it did. Up to then, it was a true page-turner, as impossible to put down as any book I can name. Nothing since by him has come close."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wasn't expecting much","review":"I wasn't expecting much based on some of the negative reviews about this book, and perhaps that was why I enjoyed it so much. True, it's not at all like Grisham's thriller genre, but it does have the courtroom element and this, coupled with his styles in \\"A Painted House\\" and other great reads of his, makes it enjoyable and fun. The story itself is not that unusual but the masterful telling of it reminds me of \\"King of Torts. Overall I thoroughly enjoyed it. Would also recommend \\"In This Mountain\\" and a great new book I just discovered: \\"The Bark of the Dogwood\\" by Jackson McCrae."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trite and tired","review":"The murders are a bore and don't really get underway until the end of the book. No real narrative tension in this book. Grisham can't create original characters--they are mostly steriotypes. The setting is also one that has been done often and better--by Grisham himself, for example"},{"rating":"1","title":"One of his worst...","review":"I am surprised to see so many positive reviews here. The books started off wonderfully, with an interesting protagonist and fabulous details of life in a small town in the 70s. The murder and subsequent trial was also great, and the suspense that this all set up was good too.Then, the story pretty much stopped moving. Grisham got into painful details - scenes that had almost nothing (and I'm being generous) to do with moving the plot. I kept reading because I couldn't imagine he could do this... it had to pick up again somewhere, didn't it?Sadly, no. The last few pages got back into the drama, but the story ended with a neat excuse for real closure. Too simple, too convenient.Someone described this book as \\"literary.\\" I don't see it, sorry. Grisham is one hell of a story-teller. He's got a great imagination. I imagine this is one of those books that \\"by contract\\" had to be finished according to some publisher's schedule. Too bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very boring..read the short version","review":"I have read every John Grisham novel and found this to be very very boring.The best way to read this book:1. Read the first twenty pages2. Read about twenty pages in the middle3. Read the last twenty pagesAll the other material is just fluff and a real waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much here?","review":"This was my first Grsham and I was extremely disappointed with the entire book. I forced myself to finish it, hoping it might get better. I found myself skipping entire paragraphs and missing nothing in the process. The characters are all completely forgettable, and so is the story. The end was predictable, and it was plain to see why the jurors were being eliminated. Maybe I should give his early books a try but so far I am not impressed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grisham's lost it","review":"John Grisham is usually a guarantee for a page-turning read. This, however, is the signal for me to stop buying his books. It kicks off well, then just completely loses focus and direction and prattles on endlessly about this and that and nothing of interest - I have the feeling this is Grisham's attempt at writing himself an \\"Epic\\", and he fails miserably. As for the oh-so-perfect Miss Millie (or whatever her name was), I just felt like pouring one of her oh-so-perfect pot roasts over her head and telling her that her oh-so-perfect, 7 PhD'd kids (yeah, right) bore me to tears. I have to agree with Dr. Ansari - by the time the books starts \\"revealing all\\", you just don't care anymore. Nausea, Grisham style."},{"rating":"1","title":"tame and lacklustre","review":"I was thoroughly disappointed. Although Grisham does a reasonably good job in setting the historical scene in bigot-ridden Mississippi, the long passages detailing mundane characters and trivial parathemes are mostly superfluous. When the story finally enters second gear around page 420 (of approx. 480) it is too late, and the reader is longing for an ending, no matter how it arrives. Even then, the build up to the finale is jerky and completely lacks suspense. Grisham must be one of the most over-rated writers of fiction today."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Last Juror almost lost me. . .","review":"Bought the book in February and just finally forced myself to finish it last night. (It looked so lonely on my nightstand, watching piles of more interesting and well written books come and go.)Why did it take me so long to read this particular Grisham work? Because this book lacked the page turning quality of his previous works. The narrative arc was shaky at best, with the ending a shoot'em up let down. Be warned -- many characters waltz in and out of the story, lots of wacky over the top stereotypical southern names to keep track of. I did enjoy the author's thinly veiled attack on WalMart -- he did an excellent job of explaining the damage caused to small town economies by WalMart stores."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can you say, \\"BOOOOOORING?!!!\\"","review":"I used to LOVE John Grisham, but I found this book extremely boring and yet the perfect book to bore me right to sleep every night. I only needed to read one page each night before I was out. I can understand his other books centered around Christmas and family life being more sensitive and about feelings and stuff, but when the title comes right out and says, \\" The Last Juror\\" and there's a picture of a Jury table on the front cover I expect it to be as fast-paced and exciting as all of his other law books. I was very dissapointed. The summary on the inside flaps actually built it up that way, which is why I forked over the money to buy it. But, like many movie trailers, most all of the exciting parts were in the summary and the book, for the most part dragged and dragged. If you are looking for a typical fast-paced John Grisham book do not get The Last Juror. You will be highly dissapointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"He just doesn't have the touch anymore...","review":"Really frustrating to spend all this time reading a book that juts goes nowhere.

It's the first John Grisham novel I have ever read. It is simply dead boring. There is nothing about it that makes it a \\"thriller.\\" The title is completely misleading. Don't even waste your time getting this book out of the library unless you want to read a long drawn out story about a small town in the south. It's not even a good story about that. I agree with everyone else who gave this book one star (or less)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can I have my money back please??????","review":"This is by far one of the worst books I have ever read!

Hopefully they will not attempt to make this into a movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wake up the editor","review":"This is the type of story you'd see on a TV news magazine show. Instead of taking a break during the story and going to a commercial in between, Grisham has to fill up space. I don't know if it was because he had to fill up pages, or because it allows him to express his own politcial views (D), but Grisham goes all out. Readers can tell that he is trying to talk about Wal-Mart and what it does coming to town (as he sees it), and he uses Vietnam to point out his feelings on Iraq. It's not enough just to point these out, he has to include the editorials and speeches in the text.Why do we have to read through this? This was an interesting story, but it stretched far too long. Where was the editor when this manuscript came in? Did they just let him ramble because they know it will be a bestseller? Just stick with the story. I don't care how short it is. Maybe put two together if you have to. I enjoyed the personal impact ending, as opposed to the plot ending, which was a bit lame."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Last Reader, Maybe","review":"Grisham, you've gotta be kidding. I beg my fiancee to let me buy this book -- as we are on a shoestring budget-- and she relents and this is what I get? I love Grisham. I hated this book. I read it and realized it was good for something -- to cure me of my insomnia.This is why I'm writing in my spare time. I'm tired of picking up a book in hopes of it being decent and finding out it's a waste of time. I mean, it wasn't even fun to read. That's all I ask for, something halfway entertaining.And the sad thing is, the next Grisham book that comes out will be purchased by me again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn","review":"I am so glad I am done with this book.

The charachters are absolutely forgetfull. I really enjoy reading and developing a \\"relationship\\" with well drawn charachters. None hear.

This is one of those books you really don't want to finish!The beginning is fast...the middle is steady...and the ending is wonderful!I won't give it away here.

I have not before read Grisham's work, and expected a thriller, a page-turner, perhaps something similar to \\"The Da Vinci Code.\\" What I got was a long, slow, tedious retelling of the trial portion of \\"To Kill a Mockingbird,\\" complete with the southern charm, token black woman, trashy white criminal, rape and murder. I had much higher expectations, and was keenly disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this book","review":"I am a huge John Grisham fan, but this book was not worth the paper it was written on. He seemed to lose interest in the story he was writing about half-way through. Once the trial was done, he diverted his attention to a lashing of Vietnam and Wal-mart (not so cleverly hidden with another name, but he threw in every cliche the liberal media uses against Wal-mart. It made me ill). These were not relevent to the story, and served no purpose other than to be a pulpit from which Mr. Grisham could vent his personal views. From there I lost interest in the story, but finished reading just to see where he would go from there. Mercifully, he got off the puplit at that point and got back to story. The wrap up was boring, and poorly conceived. Not at all the thriller fans have grown accustomed to. If this is a preview what Mr. Grisham has left in him to write about. I won't be buying any more of his works."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of John Grisham's best....","review":"John Grisham has become one of my favorite authors.

It started out as such a promising grabber - only to fizzle into a frustrating bore. The character development was lame and where the heck was the plot? When reading Grisham's earlier books, I loved being \\"taken away\\"; after reading this book, I just feel \\"taken\\".As a Legal Aid lawyer, and having lived in a small southern city, I applaud Mr. Grisham's adroit handling of complex racial and social issues in previous books. In \\"The Last Juror\\", the character development and plot did not go far enough to either deal effectively with issues or entertain. I'd like to see Grisham take the same characters and write a sequel that has some bite.Please, Mr. Grisham, give us something rich and complex that we can sink our teeth into and then savor long after reading that last page."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grisham Abandons Success Formula - Again","review":"Normally, I can not put a Grisham book down. The Firm, The Client, The Street Lawyer, The King of Torts all have that fast paced excitement we expect from a Grisham legal thriller. Such is not the case with The Last Juror. Although there are some interesting parts, this book reads much more slowly and lacks the excitement of most Grisham novels.The Last Juror is much more about life in a small southern town than it is a suspense novel. If you liked The Painted House then you will probably like this book too (I didn't like The Painted House at all). Just don't expect it to be a legal thriller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing New Here","review":"Grisham has experimented with so many styles lately that he doesn't know who he is.

He didn't give me a reason to. There was one point where I thought I might connect with Callie, but it never happened. Grisham wasn't sure where he wanted this story to go, so he rambled on for 355 pages with laws from the 70's that were or were not true; elections that I could care less about because there wasn't a reason to care; he threw in a \\"walmart\\" taking over the town; a nude sniper. Although I finished the book, on several occasions, I found myslef asking \\"why am I wasting my time reading this book?\\" A waste it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I had really been looking forward to this book, expecting (and hoping for) a return to the great legal thrillers that made me a John Grisham fan. Unfortunately, this book wasn't what I expected at all. The book centers around a young newspaper editor in Clanton, Mississippi during the 1970's. Rather than a murder mystery or a legal suspense book, it is a story about a small southern town dealing with the issues of the day, including Vietnam and desegregation. The murder and trial are only a very small part of the actual plot. They help to explain the town and the people living there and it provides some action to keep the plot moving, but don't expect to be surpised at the ending.All in all, it wasn't a bad book if you're looking for a story about a small southern town, but if you're looking for a good legal thriller, this isn't it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grisham fails again!","review":"With all the hype,I really thought Grisham was back.

The actual \\"murder\\" takes up only a 1/5th of the book. The rest is a sociological study of Mississippi. If I was in the mood for that, I would have gotten a sociology book. Why label it a mystery when that is not what this is about?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Storytelling","review":"Grisham tells an intriguing, captivating story in The Last Juror. It had several stereotypical yet enjoyable characters. The time and setting of the novel are conducive to an interesting plot with several conflicts and twists.There are some cliche's here though that lessen the impact of the novel. For example, the evil Padgitt family that lives by itself on the island and rarely ventures into town, the redneck sheriffs and gool ol' boys around town. But I'm sure they are founded in truth.Grisham follows through on this story and closes well (unlike The King of Torts which fizzles at the end). It is a good, entertaining read that has more than a little humor and good wit thrown into the mix."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grisham's Best? Yes, but.","review":"I'm normally not the type to go for Irving/Grisham/Clancy novels, but stranded in the Raleigh/Durham airport, I decided to venture into new territory. The review blurbs on the book from the NYTimes and others all glowed that this was Grisham's best work ever. It was \\"atmospheric\\", \\"tonal\\", approaching true \\"literature\\". I was sold.I quickly finished the novel and set it down with a sigh of relief--relief that I'd finished the damn thing and relief that I had never subjected myself to other Grisham works. This novel was light on anything of legal interest, lacking in interesting suspense, and of dubious effect when it came to the verisimilutude of the two main protagonists.There was nothing wrong, per se, with the novel; but by the end I was completely unmoved. For those who say that this novel is great despite lacking in legal suspense, fine; but if you want a good literary narrative than go read a real novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Refreshing change of pace","review":"\\"The Last Juror\\" is a bit of anomaly. There are many times when I have read non-fiction and found it hard to believe that the story is TRUE. While reading \\"The Last Juror\\" I had to keep reminding myself that it was in fact fiction. Such is the charm of Grisham's novel... it is warm, chraming and, at times, thrilling.The actual story is fairly predictable and at points, brutally slow. Another slight annoyance is Grisham's portrayal of northern Mississippi. I feel that he has focused more on the stereotyopes of the region and less on actual day-to-day life (I have lived in NE Mississippi for the last 5 years).I think Grisham found a nice balance of legal thrillers with his more human interest type stories. I would suggest \\"The Last Juror\\" to anyone who enjoyed \\"Midnight in The Garden of Good And Evil\\". I definitely suggest it as a nice quick read, especially if you happen to be at the beach!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good read on a rainy weekend","review":"The Last Juror did not have the usual flair that Grisham's books have but still a nice read.

I have liked some better better than others, but THE LAST JUROR reeled me in from the beginning. The protaganist is believable, and it is neat to watch him find his voice as he interacts with the residents in a small town. Grisham is meddling in \\"social history\\"--he hits class issues, civil rights, gun control, the buying habits of small town USA, and on and on.He has a disclaimer about certain Mississippi/Ford county laws with which he took liberty, but on page 114, he has the first Italians in Ford county loaded into 1904 Ford Model T's at the railroad station. Oops. The first Model T's were built in 1908.I'm glad that John, like Willie, has made lots of money doing what he likes to do. Now he has the resources to do a little experimenting. In my opinion, Grisham is never a dull read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"John , We Hardly Knew Ye","review":"What has happenned to the author of such thrillers as The Firm, and Runaway Jury ? With The Last Juror Grisham seems to be continuing his journey to who knows where ( but obviously the trip includes the bank ).I really wanted to like this book, but didn't. Whoever wrote the NY Times reivew on the cover, \\" One of his best: a thouughtful and atmospheric thirller\\" clearly did not read the book. It might be atmospheric, but a thriller it isn't. Also, it seems real preachy, ie hard working loveable black mother raises a bunch of PhD's and charms the young newspaper editor with food and stories about how hard it was back in the dark old days in Mississippi. Been there and got the t-shirt many times.This book is in the category of Grisham's The Testament for which he should have been prosecuted for writing.Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"a long struggle","review":"I've read A Painted House and Skipping Christmas by John Grisham so realize that he's been moving toward a different style from his previous books, which I enjoyed. Unfortunately, I feel he hasn't mastered this 'new' voice. I found The Last Juror, as with Painted House, to be wordy and confusing, as if Mr. Grisham was thinking on paper without the benefit of a strong editor giving shape to the story. The storyline meandered, then jumped around and overall failed to catch my interest or my emotions. While the premise was intriguing, I had to struggle through part one and part two but ended up skimming part three, never what an author wants to happen to his story. I'm still not sure what story he was trying to tell with this book. I don't think I'll be buying a John Grisham book until he has a stronger grip on this new 'voice' he's working on."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved it!","review":"This was a great book! Although very different than Grisham's other novels, it was a terrific, quick and insightful read that I highly recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was the worst book I have ever read","review":"I kept waiting for this book to get going, but it never did. After wading through much politically correct mumbo-jumbo of the main character, it became obvious that I was in the midst of reading one of the worst books ever written. I had never written a review before, but this book was so bad, that I just had to go online and see if anyone else thought the same as me. Don't waste your time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Disappointment","review":"Grisham is off on another political tirade. He starts off developing a decent plot and then abandons it. He gets off on an anti-Vietnam crusade extolling the virtues of running off to Canada. He focuses on his relationship with a matriarch which, again, diverts from the story line. He treats the solving of final crimes as an afterthought. Grisham has clearly lost it. Where he once wove a tale that meshed from beginning to end, he now appears on an ego trip to stuff his political predjuces down the readers throat at the expense of whatever plot he initiated. I was also disappointed with The King Of Torts for many of the same reasons. This was the last book by him that I shall read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible deceit","review":"The jacket cover write-up of this book leads one to believe it is a courtroom thriller, like other Grisham novels. In fact it is not. It is a very slow-paced story of a newspaper in a sleepy little town. If Grisham really had faith in this story he should have hyped it for what it is and drawn an audience with its eyes open, rather than using deceit to lure unsuspecting readers to their 400 page, excruciatingly tiny-printed doom."},{"rating":"1","title":"LAST IN PREFERENCE","review":"Grisham is one of best the authors i've ever read, but the Last Juror is a great deception. It's a very well written book, but it don't have that \\"impossible to put down\\" thing the others do.When you are not impacient to know the closing of a case slow carried by the pages of the book, it indicates that something is very wrong with the plot. It's realy diferent from the other 11 books i've read from the author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, boring, boring","review":"Grisham has definitely lost his edge! Where is the suspense? Where are the page turners we so eagerly awaited since \\"The King of Torts\\"?

Quite a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where has John Gone??","review":"Don't waste your money buying this book. It plodded along with no plot that I could find.

The rest, pardon me, stink. I have tried and tried and tried - loyal to a fault. But none of them are anywhere close to A Time to Kill and The Firm.How sad.Finally thought it time to try again and picked up The Last Juror. Another mistake.This book is average at best and full of hoo-hum drama. If you must read it, pick it up and the library. Not worth, frankly, your time or money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not too bad","review":"With the exception of the beginning of this book describing the young women being attacked and the occasional vulgarity, I enjoyed the story of this book.I found it interesting how the author weaves characters into this book from his other books."},{"rating":"1","title":"HAS GRISHAM LOST HIS TOUCH?","review":"Not since The Firm has Grisham managed to reach the same level of intensity. The Last Juror is awkward, predictable, and at times awfully dull. The Client and The Partner were close, but it seems to me that Grisham has succumbed to his fame and perhaps thinks people will like anything he writes. A Painted House, Bleachers, Skipping Christmas; yuck. I knew who the killer in this book was long before he was supposed to be, or should have been, exposed. If you feel you must buy this book simply because the author is Grisham, do yourself a favor and wait for the paperback."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"I have read most of Grisham's books and was quite excited when this one came out. However, after reading it, I was disappointed. Sure, the books starts off with a very interesting plot, but 1/3rd of the way through the book, the trial has ended and the rest of the time is spent following Willie around town. I wish Grisham would go back to the writing style that got him here in the first place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grisham Fell Down","review":"Not your typical Grisham novel. It lacked quite a bit of the detail you normally expect from him. He spent quite a bit of time weaving characters and events into the story that never really added anything. It just seems to meander. I'll buy his next book and hope he wakes up in time before he becomes another James Patterson."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grisham,s always good","review":"I believe John Grisham is truly one of America,s greatest writers , not only one of the most popular. He spoiled me with \\" King of Torts\\" , which I believe to be his best and one of the best books I,ve ever read. Bleachers followed and was excellent illustrating how we idolize coaches and team that are successful and overlooking that this same were not always hero,s to their children and friends. The Last Juror is an very good read bringing Grisham back to his boyhood Mississippi. There are a lot of little stories along with the main theme. This is almost the differance between just eating and dining. It,s Good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this Grisham?","review":"I've read most of John Grisham's books and have always enjoyed his storyteller voice and style. This book carries a very different tone and style -- it's much more cliched and predictable, and much less of a page-turner (in fact, many times it borders on boring). My biggest complaint is that he is sloppy in his storytelling, and inconsistencies, contradictions, and loose ends abound. It's nothing like his early legal thrillers, and is not even as good as his recent books like Bleachers and The Broker. If you plan to skip a Grisham book, this should be the one."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor effort","review":"This was a simplistic novel. The characters lacked credibility and their personalities were stereotypical. The plot was unwielding and unsatisfying. It was difficult to figure out who the ultimate killer was because it was totally unrealistic. Grisham's novels always have a feel good aspect to them (i.e. lawyer finds his way; justice prevails) and I think that is what hooks the reader. The quality of the book is secondary. There are so many better writers out there ( Elizabeth George, Laura Lippman, Peter Robinson). I suggest readers give these authors a chance. You won't be sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Last John Grisham book I'll ever read.","review":"The Last Juror was a sad disappointment. I had heard great things about John Grisham but had never read any of his books. I chose to read this for a book club, and had it not been my responsibility to finish it, I probably would have never finished it. It was moderately suspenseful in the beginning, and then it just died off. Danny went to jail, and that was it. All of a sudden I was smothered with meaningless details about Willie's life and acceptance in Mississippi. At that point, I didn't care if Danny was guilty or not. I didn't care how the story ended. But as I said, I had to read it, so I skipped through a few pages of blabber, and made my way through the painfully boring ending. It was a sad excuse for a suspense novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"The last juror","review":"A gripping novel from page one to the last page .Typical Grisham thriller.Have now been motivated to buy The Runaway Jury.1"},{"rating":"1","title":"It was so-so","review":"I read this book and found that it is a little bland. I think that Grisham is just throwing books together now and not taking the time to make a great book. Still think his best book to date is a \\"A Time TO Kill\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the plot?","review":"This books takes the reader to the very edge of suspense but never produces the thrill. I kept hoping, until the very last page, to be awarded with the twist or big payoff at the end of the story. I am a huge fan and normally read a Grisham book in 2 days, this one took me 3 weeks. I forced myself to finish it because I had woven a web in my mind and wanted to see if I was right. It turned out my ending was better than the one in the book. The account of life in a small southern town during the 70's was a pleasant read but not enough to make up for the missing plot and average story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good read at all","review":"I read some of the other reviews raving about this book. I have to ask myself if we were reading the same book. This was a 50 page book written on 350 pages. Very little actual plot. Actually, it reminded me, at times, of a poorly edited movie. I hope Grisham hasn't lost it. I enjoyed the King of Torts immensely, but this one was a real dud."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Last Juror","review":"Grisham has a unique talent to write about small, Southern towns and make them a place you want to live. He uncovers the good and the bad but he also makes you think. Miss Callie is a woman I would have loved to have known, for her strength, courage and commitment to her Lord and Savior & her family. Sure this book isn't a taut legal thriller, but it has it's moments. This book is more a character study which Grisham has a way with, especially when it comes to Southerners. Read it and enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Move over Faulkner","review":"The Last Juror is a wonderful story about the decade between the late '60's and late '70's, tangentially covering social and political issues from Vietnam, Civil Rights, and the youth movement. The characters are real people you will care about. The story is well paced and grabbing. If anyone has been harboring doubts about the status of Grisham in the Pantheon of great American writers this novel will easily dispel them. This is a rich Southern Novel that will stand beside all others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grisham returns to fine form...","review":"With 'The Last Juror', John Grisham has delivered a novel that will please fans of both his courtroom dramas and his other more literary works. While a slower-moving story than some of his other legal thrillers, I found the combination of the courtroom scenes juxtaposed with the snapshots of Clanton life circa the 'Old South/New South' era to be very effective. You really feel as if you get to know (and care for) the main characters...especially Willie Traynor and Callie.Pick this one up and give it a try...you shouldn't be disappointed!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"I thought this was Grisham's best book in years. He captured the spirit of the 70s in the deep south while giving the darker aspects those difficult times a light touch. His quirky characters (one of the things he does best)were well written. And, for those of us who loved \\"A Time to Kill,\\" it was interesting to compare characters in this loose \\"prequel.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Progressive Jazz-Fusion Theatrical Circus Rock Band","review":"This album (the band's second) shows a strong growth in songwriting confidence. Their innovative instrumentation, including the use of instruments not normally associated with Rock 'n' Roll creates a unique and refreshing sonic landscape. The songs on this album range from electronica-inspired dance music to ballads, each with its own distinctive character. This is a band with high musical ideals, challenging arrangements, and lyrical content that explores the darkness, excitement, hedonism, and banalities of life with a fresh perspective. The songwriting is frequently epic, with long stretches of wonderful instrumental bridges. \\"Beneath Topeka\\" deserves wide-spread airplay. Add this CD to your library!

They're not bad, but they make such a mess that you can't really tell how much milk the baby is actually taking. These Dr Brown's don't have that problem (I have the slim design) and my baby was noticeably less gassy after trying them out. He was getting quite a bit of colic during the first 2 wks he used the Avent bottles. Now that problem is gone and sometimes he doesn't even burp right after. I put him down and after about 5 mnts or so, pick him up & he burps real calmly. Bottom line, I do like these bottles very much.

While he had no problems using the Playtex Nursers, he ended up having a problem with Dr. brown's Natural Flow bottles. First off, they are a pain to clean. Each piece needs to be painstakenly washed (boiling the nipple, washing the bottle, and scrubbing each hole of the the insert and the reservoir.) It was certainly laborsome and time consuming. Anyhow, when he uses them, he spits up where he didn't with the competition. I tried to figure out why. If you tip the bottle over it drips constantly without any sucking. So my baby is not sucking or swallowing when he uses this product. He lets it build up in his mouth and then ends up having to push it out when he has gotten too much. Needless to say, we are planning to return these and will stick with Playtex."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the time or the money!!!!","review":"If I could rate this any lower then 1 star I would, when I was pregnant I did alot of research on many different bottles, I decided to go with these based on all the reviews even thow knew they took a long time to clean, I wanted the best for my baby, but my baby is very gassy and does not burp well.

Much better would be to introduce an exercise with about five reps, show it from the side then from the back.

By the way, i didn't buy that this story is true. Well, i did when I was a teenager. Just because Hollywood says its true, one shouldn't have blind faith. I guess in the 80s it was easier to say this kind of lies than now that we have the internet.

The true story of Frank Dux sounds very interesting, but his name will be forever attached to the now has been that is Jeanne-Claude Van Damme. Most of us wish that Jeanne-Claude's only role was the role of Predator in a blue body suite that they would basically blur out and show only the tracers. He only did that role for one day then quit.

How mischievous of the young man! The fighters trained by breaking ice over their heads, chopping wood and cracking bricks. Rugged! These are the toughest men alive and when they fight, they have no mercy upon anybody. Now, that is a spirit a genius would have. Van Damme is a new genius and will become a lord.

Follows the usual predictable martial arts movie plot (really, we wouldn't expect anything less!). I am however fascinated that reviewers, et al still write about the events on this movie being based upon the \\"real life\\" experiences of Frank Dux. Dux has long been discredited as a liar and fake, both as a martial artist (Dux was never in a \\"kumite\\" competition), and as a military \\"hero\\" (never in the CIA, and was only in the Marines for 6 mos., & never left the U.S. during the Vietnam era), see LA Times Valley edition, May 1, 1988 article \\"Ninja: Hero or Master Fake?\\" by John Johnson.

Rather than a contrived and cliched plot, this movie (based on the real experience of Frank Dux) displays different forms of martial arts through the brutal kumite (similar to shoot fights or UFC).

They are able to joke around a good bit and enjoy life. This seems much more realistic to me based on my own experiences at sea. \\"Peter Simple\\" is written by an actual man of war captain from the Napoleanic era and so probably portrays a much more accurate picture of life on a British man of war than any of the other similar novels.

Customer service immediately sent a new piece and I was able to assemble the entire stand without problem. Its excellent for a loft space, so I can roll the TV close to my desk or close to our L-shaped couch. Just need a big burly guy to help me attach the TV and lift it to the stand - too bad Peerless isn't nearby for that too! I would highly recommend this product and the company, Peerless, and will buy again from them.

Makes for a real value."},{"rating":"2","title":"TV STAND/CART IS PERFECT!!!","review":"This TV/Stand Cart is perfect for my needs. I use it with a LCD I like to push from my Living Room to my Outside Deck. Perfect for those clear nights when you want to sit in the hot tub and watch either tv shows or sports. I got it from Amazon for 389.50 and it is woth every penny. It rolls very easy and each wheel has a brake. Assembly was also very easy. I did it myself within an hour. Just follow the instruction and it should go fine. The TV mounts on it very securely and it is by no means top heavy. I am just glad I found this \\"Robot\\" looking Stand/Cart which fits all my needs. Good job Peerless!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very sturdy!","review":"I purchased this so that I could move a TV to the outside patio or into the garage when needed. It is very well constructed and comes with a variety of mounting hardware for various applications. It is narrow enough to fit through a standard doorway which is key! The only suggestion for improvement would be the additional of a handle of some sort so that you are not using the TV to move the entire cart, putting unnecessary strain on the TV mounting points."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not quite there...","review":"Plot is good, but it's somewhat lacking in execution.

Possibly the worst acting ever. Second, the premise of the plot is ridiculous. Science fiction should have some basis in um....Science. The premise of the movie is that the device was created to manipulate DNA to heal wounds. A wound healing device would be a great plot for science fiction movie but it would not have to manipulate DNA to do it. It's clear the writers do not know what DNA is.

It was unrealistic in how it basically only showed him having to deal with one class and it was un-entertaining, which surprised me, as I am a fan of Lindsay Wagner.They were so busy trying to be artsy that they forgot to do justice to the story. The end was supposed to be profound, but really left me cold. I was as disillusioned with the movie as Timothy Bottoms was when he discovered the professor still didn't even know his name. I would not recommend this DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok","review":"Belive it or not, my Contracts professor loves this movie. I on the other hand, do not. The movie was pretty slow and I don't really believe it accurately portrays the current law school experience.

Today's graduate and professional schools including law school are more diverse than depicted in the film. Also, the John Houseman character is a bit over the top. I like his performance and maybe there are a few characters like him out there, but consider today's political and social climate on campuses. Would Kingsfield get tenure or high marks from his students with this kind of behavior? Possibly, but not highly likely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't live up to expectations.","review":"I bought The Paper Chase on DVD because I like courtroom dramas (Perry Mason, The Verdict, 12 Angry Men, etc.) and I also like school dramas (The Emperor's Club). This film had no courtroom drama and very little in the classroom. John Houseman's scenes are the best, but he's only in a dozen very brief scenes, with perhaps a couple dozen lines in the whole film. The rest is like a soap opera set at Harvard, and very disappointing compared to the expectations set from reading other reviews here."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie was terrible","review":"This movie is so bad. It does not stand the test of time. I saw it decades ago when I was young and idealistic. I think kids today would laugh at it.

There is nothing particularly interesting in these experiences, nor any insights into education, law school, relationships or any of the other things that movies try to enlighten us about.This film will appeal to lawyers who like to reminisce about their good ole days, and maybe law students, but only to them.Everyone else will be sitting, waiting for something to happen. But nothing ever does happen. Nor do we care about the people it doesn't happen to.You have been warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"This movie is so boring. I painfully watched it during my first year of law school. The plot is thin and predictable and there is hardly any excitement in this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"A movie with a plot!","review":"It so rare to come across movies with an actual plot these days. If you are in the mood for a legal drama without the courtroom battles, this is for you. Timothy Bottoms is great as Hart a 1st year law student finding out the hardway what it takes to succed at Harvard. John Housman is phenominal as the Contracts professor who is as hard as they come. Excellent story, and some humor. The obligitory love spiel is ok. I like Lindsey Wagner, but its flighty at best, and semi detracts from the film. So with a complaint, why did I give it 5 stars? Because the movie earned it. Its gripping from the start, and holds you to the end.

Riddled with cliqued chart lyrics for commercial dance bands backed with a 90's dance beat to go with this sorry excuse of a sell out record.If you like your music with these lyrics in- \\"I know i love ya,just wanna touch ya\\"\\"You knock me off my feet\\", \\"Lets spend the night together\\",and wait for it - \\"I have never known a night like this\\" then you will join the line with the rest of the teenage girl fraternity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lead causes cancer!","review":"These memorex keyboards are okay. The hot keys won't work unless you install the software on to your computer, but the software is memory resident. So it becomes just another program that eats up your system resources. Also for some reason, memorex decided to put lead as a conductor in the keyboards cord, so you run the risk of getting lead poisoning each and every time you touch the cord. You will see a warning to this effect on the cord itself.That alone is enough of a reason to stay away from Memorex keyboards! Even though Memorex does make cordless keyboards, they lost me as a customer due to their reckless use of lead in their products.Not worth the money, not even if it was free.

Given the huge expense of this item, we were stunned and disappointed to find the miniature scale of the toy. A total waste as far as I am concerned, and nearly a complete waste for him as well. Basically the high price for such a small item ruined all the fun as well as having used up the balance of a small boys gift certificate. The toy, although cute for a moment, did not bring any lasting fun. As for durability we wouldn't know because it has not been heavily played with. There is no educational value inherent in the toy or its use, although we knew that when placing the order. We have, however, I think, learned something about ordering items over the internet as opposed to seeing them in a store.

I bought it a while ago but just got round to using it in my projects. It offers the traditional mix and match of fabrics with wall coverings. It actually is more interesting as a general interior design book than one exclusively for wallpaper as the title would suggest. The pictures show the wallpaper used to only decorate a room, rather than to create you know that something that you want by changing from paint to wallpaper or just changing the wallpaper to achieve a new look."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gorgeous book","review":"I just drooled when I first saw this book!

There are designs for narrow walkways, curved entrances, large yards, small yards, front yards, back yards, boulevards, and with varying themes: by colour; by function (e.g. to attract butterflies or hummingbirds); by plant types (e.g. all shrubs, herbs, cutting flowers, fragrant plants). While not every design is suitable for every Zone, there is a good selection for each Zone, and where possible the authors provide substitutions to expand the applicable zones for a design. The book also includes botanical as well as common names for all plants listed in the coloured watercolour drawings. All in all, this is a very well written and useful book, for gardeners of all levels."},{"rating":"1","title":"A letdown","review":"Somehow I missed the fact that all the designs were illustrations (watercolor paintings?), not photographs. I get inspired by looking at photos of existing gardens that someone actually created. Looking at paintings just doesn't do it for me. Besides, as the other reviewer said, these gardens are for zones all over the US, not necessarily for my zone, so not all the ideas work for me.The other thing that is missing in this book is at least a small photo of each of the plants/flowers on a page. Sure, I can look them up in another book. I'm familiar with quite a few of the flowers and their Latin/common names, but a beginning gardener wouldn't be. This is definitely not a book for beginners, and even as a more advanced gardener, it was disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"wow what a stinker","review":"Terrible script, I only laughed during the nitrous oxide scene, The rest of the movie was so dull and boring.

The girl he wins is not bad looking either, and as for his mom, I got two of her films. Now...Queen Latifah is like the star of the film! Heck, she is! I love her name in it...Belle is such a beautiful name and it fits Latifah's personality quite well. Jimmy in it...is a great cop and a little bit clumsy, but he's great! You know what? I like that Diana Ross song too! It's my favorite as well! Jimmy really did save the day and Belle's life in the movie. And that's another thing...I like about him.

The data CD is useful if you have nothing else, but there are way better programs out there for making forms, contracts, business plans etc. The last CD, a compilation of short stories of successful entrepreneurs was ok, but nothing to get too exited about.

The California/Nevada guide is no exception, but it's just too outdated (published in 1996), and I wouldn't recommend buying it and instead would recommend waiting until the come out with a new one, whenever that will be.

The story is ridiculous, Lynley and her \\"brother\\" in the movie strove mightily and almost successfully to be real actors, and the final result, which is supposed to be creepy, is simply laughable. Bad film fans will not want to miss this turkey. It could indeed become a cult film--you know, show it at midnight, get stoned, and promenade around the theater shouting for Bunny Lake.

Even the credits are hilarious."},{"rating":"1","title":"MY GRADE: C plus.","review":"British humor is very much hit or miss for me and this is one of those misses. It's all about the death of a patriarch that brings his friends and other contacts together in a goofy, mismatched farce. Slow beginning big time but if you absolutely love British humor, well, it might be worth it.I watched this one for close to an hour simply because it didn't require my full attention and I was surfing the Web. I know some people out there think you have to give 100% to a movie to properly grade it but that's a lot of rubbish and just goes to show some people cannot multitask, especially when watching a film that is average or lower.Peter Dinklage has a supporting role in this but he isn't anything like his Tyrion character so don't go in with expectations.The budget was $9M and it made a bit over $46M at the Box Office.STORY/PLOTTING/EDITING: B minus; HUMOR: C minus; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B minus; WHEN WATCHED: mid July 2012; OVERALL GRADE: C plus."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different strokes, I guess","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, it was NOT like any other I have seen and I wonder where the people who rated it 1 star get this idea from.My only observation of the bad reviews is that almost all of them have something like \\"I think I have a really good sense of humour\\".

Matthew MacFadyen, a very brilliant actor, comedy or drama. I like the actors here - Matthew, Keeley Hawes (also his real life wife), Rupert Graves, Alan Tudyk, Daisy Donovan, Andy Nyman, Timothy Spall and the rest did their jobs so well. I just can't stop watching it, specially after work (like a therapeutic movie that lightens your stressful day). I just like to watch British movies - drama and comedy. Worth paying for, and for keeps. A fan of Matthew and Keeley. JUST LOVE BRITISH PERIOD DRAMAS AND COMEDIES.

The fiancee never giving up on her betrothed in spite of what her relatives thinks. However, the bad outweighs the good. The movie relies on drug humor, midget humor, and scatological humor for the gags. They don't even do it well. Cliches abound. The actors seem to be trying hard, but the script never delivers completely. The pacing seems to drag on certain scenes at times. It is definitely frenetic at other times.In summary, perhaps if you were in the right mood, you might enjoy the movie, but there are many better farcical movies out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice House","review":"Although billed as a \\"comedy\\" this movie doesn't contain a single laugh. I guess what they meant is a \\"comedy of errors\\" where unlikely-event-follows-unlikely-event to the point of compounded absurdity. The film doesn't feel like Frank Oz either, but more like a second- (or third-)rate BBC television programme.

It held quite a lot of promise, but little (no pun intended) of it came to fruition in this stretched almost comedy that deteriorates into a story of the effects of LSD on people's behavior. The rest of the story was not \\"traditional\\" British humor, because it would have been funny had it been so. This was predictable, sort of, in most every turn and the \\"surprise\\" guest and how it was played out was quite disappointing. The film tried and failed miserably to recreate the ambiance of \\"Four Weddings and a Funeral\\". The single funeral in the latter was better than the entirety of this film.

Absolutely one of the funniest comedies I've seen in years. The Brits really know how to make fun of themselves and make people laugh all over the World. I laughed so uncontrollably loud, my neighbors thought I was going crazy in this Frank Oz directed movie. The ongoing \\"Valium\\" gag was the real clincher in this movie; affecting Alan Tudyk's (Firefly, 3:10 To Yuma, Knocked Up) \\"Simon\\" to Peter Vaughn's \\"Uncle Alfie.\\" Peter Dinklage (In Bruges, 30 Rock, Nip/Tuck) adds fire to the Valium-induced high-jinks. Andy Nyman as Howard was uproariously funny. Bang-Bang laughs from the improbable happenings at a funeral service.

And while it's hard to believe the momentum can be maintained, especially given the morbid theme, the plot surprises continue and the laughs build until the riotous crescendo.

The oldest son,Daniel and his wife, live with the deceased and his wife and from the start, things go awry. The wrong body is in the coffin and sets the scene for all the other scenes. One of the younger family members is manufacturing and selling halucinogenic pills and unwittingly allows them to be mistaken for Valium with the expected results and one of the eldest members of the family is a cranky, bad tempered old devil who has an unfortunate episode of loss of bowel control which really made me heave!

(One half-chuckle, though.) To me this was just a tedious plot of offbeat characters showing up at a funeral and acting inappropriately -- but not in a funny way. For example, one of the guests accidentally ingests an LSD-like drug before the funeral, and then he is all weird and trippy during the service. I kept waiting for the \\"funny\\" part to start!

I tried to watch it but I, too, did not find any amusement and I checked the display and had already watched 37 minutes of it without the hint of a laugh. Does this movie start out REALLY slow because it just wasn't funny to me at all. I consider myself to have a pretty good sense of humor and I laugh easily at funny, witty lines. The bit with the guy who was under the influence of some drug was to me, something only young immature boys would find amusing.

Death At A Funeral is definitely worth checking out for some laughs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lol","review":"This movie made me laugh out loud on and off through the whole thing!

Who can't relate to that. If you watch it, I hope you like it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent dark farce","review":"4.2 starsShort version: The man who directed What About Bob? and did the voices of Miss Piggy, Kermit and Yoda makes a comedy about a funeral featuring accidental psychedelic ingestion and an extortionate gay midget (sorry, dwarf). If that doesn't pique your curiosity, this is not for you.Slightly longer version: Wonderfully off the wall British drawing-room farce writ somewhat large, with perfectly silly script and superlative cast. Director Oz was raised in Britain and it shows; he melds dry Brit wit with some of the better Hollywood tropes and dishes up an oft hilarious film that gets funnier as it goes, and at a pleasantly snappy pace. Tudyk is especially marvellous as the unknowing voyager.A must for any fans of British humor, gleeful weirdness, and intelligent dry wit in general."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jolly Good Show!","review":"I actually went to our local indie film house for this and loved it.

It's so nice, in fact, that it makes the plastic base surface on the router look kind of cheap. I'm also using the Rockler guide bushing set with the adapter, and those fit equally snugly in this adapter plate--so well that the centering tool isn't really needed.

It's not at all what it seems at first, a conspiracy theory movie -- not that that would have been an improvement, it's just that this particular paranormal theme is done, and it has the same ending twist *******************SPOILER AHEAD **************************** as the Sixth Sense, without the better acting that makes that movie watchable.

The main character Claire falls \\"in love\\" with a pushy passenger named Eric who challenges her to step outside of her safe box. There's nothing wrong with this idea per se but Eric was arrogant and reckless and I just couldn't see a smart and sweet girl like Claire falling for him.

Get the Chicago instead","review":"I bought the New World Spanish/English dictionary for college, and hated it. It seems to be missing a lot of words. Looking words up feels more frustrating, because they are often missing, and because this dictionary follows the practice of putting \\"ch-\\" after \\"co-\\" and the other C words. It's hard to explain. I just don't love the New World the way I love my Chicago.The Chicago English-Spanish / Español-Inglés was recommended by my highschool Spanish teacher -- I don't regret buying it. Classmates who bought other ditionaries (such as the Oxford, I think it was) often needed to borrow mine. It simply has more of the words we needed to look up and is fun to use and browse through. For example, the New World has the verb reference section in the middle of the dictionary, but the Chicago has it in front, where it's quicker to locate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for traveling","review":"There may be better dictionaries to keep on the desk in your study, but they are impractical, because of their bulk, to bring with you when traveling. On the other hand, the so-called 'phrase books' put out by Berlitz and others are little more than worthless. This dictionary is the ideal compromise. It is small enough to fit into a tote bag, carryon, or backpack, yet inclusive enough to have just about any word you might need (except vulgar or 'dirty' words--those you'll have to learn from the locals). Of course, you'll need to know the basics of Spanish grammar, but this dictionary eliminates the need to rack your brain searching for a word. I have been using it in my travels to Latin countries since the 1990s. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent Camera","review":"I purchased a Minolta HTsi Plus camera in October 2000 and have shot an average of two rolls of film per week with this camera since then. I have nothing but praise for this camera. The HTsi Plus has never failed me in any way. I suggest you buy the body only. Don't spend money on a 28-80 lens that may come in some camera kits; rather put that money into a lens that gives you much more flexibility, like a 28-200 lens. I use Sigma 28-200 and 70-300 auto focus lenses, and I can report nothing but satisfaction, reliability, and ease of use. I had considered purchasing a more expensive SLR camera, but today I am pleased I did not, for this camera is perfect for me, an experienced but amateur photographer. I have had loads of fun with this camera and taken hundreds of wonderful photos. I recommend the Minolta HTsi Plus without hesitation or qualification."},{"rating":"2","title":"FIVE STAR CAMERA!","review":"This is my first SLR camera... so I won't be able to compare this camera with other SLR camera. But I am able to say that if you were to buy a camera this would be a great choice. The quality of the Picture is much greater than point and shoot. You have more control on how your pictures turn out. The Minolta HTsi plus is easy to use for the basic features, but if you want to use the advance feature.... reading the manuel is recommended, but don't worry.

Actor/writer/director Stephen Lang's theatrical production of \\"Beyond Glory\\" may bring you to tears as you join these men \\"just doing their jobs\\" in a most extraordinary way. Lang's transition from character to character is as fascinating as each character's endearing story.

These are let down by the lack of context as to the battle within the wider campaign and a map or two would have enabled the reader to see the landscape and the positions, both would have added to the understanding of the action taken by each of the medal winners. Another example is the cover photo, listed as US Army coming ashore on Tinian Island in the Pacific Islands, which is sort of correct but Tinian is one of the northern Mariana islands (next to Sapian which was a major Marine victory) and was the home of the 509th Bomb Group which lead the atomic raids on Japan, a small detail yet one that would context this good book even better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beyond Glory","review":"This is the story of men who won the Congressional Medal of Honor. If you ever wondered what kind of men they were, this is the book for you. Each man's life is profiled, up to and beyond the event that defined their military life. The book ends with the actual words used when they were presented with the Medal. If you don't shed a few tears while reading this book, you don't have an ounce of patriotism.I thought it couldn't get better than the Medic who wouldn't bear arms, yet saved over 100 men single handedly in WWII, then I read the stories of ordinary men and real foul ups, who showed moments of profound bravery in the frozen Chosin Reservoir in Korea. I read the story of the longest held prisoner of war in Vietnam, horribly tortured, and of his wife, who led the crusade to finally get the men released. This is just an awesome book.

I mean, Rage Against the Machine sucks to begin with, but what them trying to sing Staind's lyrics sounded like crap! What this CD really is is an insult to Staind. It sounded like Rage was trying to rap Aaron's lyrics. Anyway, if Aaron had sampled this CD, I would have hoped he'd have gone and kicked Rage Against the Machine's a$$.

The cylinder will then simply pop back in with absolutely no sign of tampering.Not only that, but the cylinder number is etched directly on the lock bezel and keys, so if you have a repeat offender all they need to do is merely shoplift a very small set of keys that match (possibly dozens or hundreds) and they have valid access to any number of \\"locked\\" fuel caps."},{"rating":"2","title":"2012 Tacoma Replacement","review":"Toyota does not make a locking gas cap for the Tacoma and the gas hatch door is not a locking type. If you want to lock the gas tank this is one of few options to do so. As you can see by it's picture, the cap is threaded to the bottom which is NOT the same as Toyota's OEM cap, which is smooth for about a half inch to make replacing the cap after filling the tank easier.I had to call Stant to make sure this would fit on my 2012 as the Amazon guide indicated it would not. I does fit but is not as slick as the original. Some online reviews and the Toyota manual warn about a \\"check engine\\" light if the gas tank is not properly sealed by the cap. That was not an issue with mine.I'd spend more money and buy one that fit better if it was available but from my research I couldn't find one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't fit","review":"Got this locking fuel cap for my Chevy Silverado 1500 (2005).

However, within 3 days of putting it on my truck, the \\"check engine light\\" came on with a notification to \\"tighten fuel cap\\". Can't really tighten it any tighter as, once it is \\"locked\\", it just spins. So, it doesn't fit correctly even though it is the correct part number for my particular vehicle.

I upgraded to the latest version and still am not able to add my music folder to be shared.

I bet they have fixed all this, so I drag it out to find out still no updates.

A few thumb clicks through the menus and it was looking for servers. A jog upstairs to the PC and I dropped in the disk. Two minutes and I had it configured for my large collection of MPEG-2 video and MP3 audio. Another jog down the stairs and I had it streaming in another minute. Video and audio both working great.The only reason I won't give it a 5 star rating is because I haven't tried anything but the most basic functionality.

My wife just did not see the sense in buying a whole new computer for a media server so this was our middle ground. Now that we have it, she loves it. We have every CD in the house burned into MP3s and WMAs and now she can boom them over the home stereo. I do have one piece of advice about this though. Get Windows Media connect and run it instead of the media server that comes with it.

You can also play sercure WMAs using the windows media connect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Usable In Its Current Form","review":"The DSM-320 is not ready for consumer use and I'd wait for D-Link to update the server software before I would even consider purchasing one. The current version lacks even the most basic media player functionality and really doesn't do justice to what appears to be an exception device from a hardware standpoint. Current problems with the D-Link DSM-320 include:1. Unable to play more than one song in a row. The player stops after each song on an album. Must build custom playlists for each album in your collection.2. Repeated \\"Unsupported file format\\" on standard MP3 files. These same files play on every other mp3 player I own.3.

Fortunately, returning items to Amazon is rather easy, so I sent the device back after a few attempts to get a picture on my TV. Well, I was following the instructions and even used the Ethernet connection rather then going wireless (having read some of the feedbacks about weak signal reception).However, even with a wire, the D-Link DSM-320 did not find the media-server on the computer. Well, it did after some attempts to re-install the device. The reason for this might be that I use Linksys networking equipment but this should not be a constraint, I presume. The quality of the D-Link is very poor, though the box looks nice. The server software is even worst, since it does not even open the folders, which one selects in the setup mode. All-in-all, D-Link should make their homework before brining such a device to the market!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay away from this unit!","review":"This media player is great.... when it works, which is rarely! I have had this product for over a year now and have had nothing but problems with it. The only way I got acceptable performance (meaning it doesn't lock up on me) is by ditching the wireless connection and going with a hardwired setup. I tried two different wireless routers, but the router didn't seem to be the problem. I also ditched the server software, which would hammer my machine, and went with Tversity instead. After all of that, it was finally working well, until all of a sudden it died completely. Since I've had it for over a year, DLink tech support and customer service said too bad.

Hours was supposed to be the continuation of that new born man Bowie has made of himself, that one with orange hair and sensual voice, dressed in an England-flag suit, doing videos with Trent Reznor and all that stuff. But Hours is no more than a man revisiting his decadent past in the 80s, with boring and extremely long and dull songs. His voice dosent soud the same anymore; this time it is still and fakely high-toned. The new age aura of Thrursday Child doesent help very much (and the awful video neither). The only good song here is the not very original Whats really happening and Your pretty things are going to hell. The rest soud like Sting or something worse.-"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bowie is Back on Top!","review":"Tremendous album from David Bowie. In all honesty, the album I've been waiting for since Scary Monsters and Super Creeps. There is not a weak link on it. Standouts include: Thursday's Child, Something in the Air, What's really Happening?, Seven, and If I'm Dreaming My Life. His singing and lyrics are great, and Reeves Gabrels guitar work is superb. A definite must have for all Bowie fans, and rock fans in general."},{"rating":"1","title":"What ECD?","review":"It is a sad day for music lovers when you get an ad for an ISP each and every time you insert the disk into your computer.

The instrumentation is a bit too passive and sparse too for my taste. In theory that could've worked well, since the lyrics are quite depressive and the overall mood is a heavy one, but it all sounds bit uninspired to me. Add to that the lack of inventive songwriting and you have a very mediocre album."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is music that doesn't matter!","review":"Strained and boring, this is Bowie without a clue. No follow up to his proposed trilogy, only two tedious albums of nothing to speak of bring us to \\"Hours\\". A man that was once a role model is now a complacent bore. Too bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Poor","review":"I've been a fan for 25 years. I had a ticket to his Roseland cocnert, but I wasn't motivated to make the 5 hour trip.

When he's mundane, as on Hours, its passe to the max."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where, oh, where, were the spiders?","review":"I'd heard so many good things about this album, and must say that it's the biggest disappointment I've heard so far this year. We get Bowie sounding frankly bored while generic alt-rock guitars and miscellaneous noise try to capture the brilliance of his earlier albums.Listen to the album honestly, and count how many times Bowie actually hits a note or does something that doesn't sound like a bad cover band lethargically ripping through parodies of his hits.Even Pat Boone doing metal was better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing","review":"Utterly depressing.

He's still a great musician and I don't think this is trite or anyting, I just plain don't like it. You might want to give it a listen cause I know it'll apeal to some ppl."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forget it!","review":"As long as masterpieces like \\"Low\\" and \\"Heroes\\" are available, there's absolutely no reason for buying this plastic and commercial album. Many songs are just empty, flat-sounding pop fluff. After his more experimental mid-'90s work, this is a sort of sellout and probably a blatant stab at the record charts all around the world. Many people claim this to be \\"fabulous art\\" because it's Bowie. O.k., it's Bowie, but this album is among his weakest."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good soft rock album","review":"I was really suprised when I first heard this album because it was so different from the first album I heard by David Bowie (Space Oddity), but it's quite good in a different way. The lyrics are a little confusing but nice nonetheless, all of the tracks are pleasant to listen to, and the song \\"Seven\\" really stands out - i'd say its among the most beautiful and touching rock songs I've heard. I'm not giving it 5 stars because it dosen't quite have the oomph of the REALLY good albums like Kid A or Sgt. Peppers, or even Space Oddity, but if you like soft modern rock, it's definatley worth your 15 bucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another superficial album. What are you doing Bowie???","review":"I respect Bowie since a long time. However, I must admit that this album, like many others from him, is inegal. It sounds like some of his 70s and 80s stuff. It could have been a genius idea to go without the techno-style this time. However, Bowie delivers poor songs on Hours..., too long and superficials. I still like his sense of soft tragedy and urgence on some songs, but this is not enough to make a great album. Bowie, if you read this, \\"Please stop to always follow the music culture year after year. Yes, great bands are delivering cool hits on the radio, with inovative sounds, but you should deliver your own tragedy with your trips, not with music producers, mixers and fashion musicians.

There might be 2 OK tracks, but that's it. The lyrics are depressing, the music is boring, and Bowie's voice sounds as if it's been electronically slowed down and drawn out.

It's not TOO varied to be jumpy though. One song ALWAYS flows into the next eloquently. I have all of bowie's albums, and his \\"comeback\\" albums (Outside and Earthling) have NOTHING on this. This almost seems as if they extracted the pop songs from underneath the Jungle and Industrial-ish beats and made THIS. Bowie is truly back."},{"rating":"2","title":"His best album in years...","review":"Meet the New Bowie, same as the old Bowie...sort of. Reading some of the comments on this page, it occurs to me that this is probably an album you can only FULLY appreciate if you're forty-something and have actually HAD the experience(s) of loss and regret (thankfully, not everything is about youth and its excesses, proving once again that middle-agers make the best rock'n'roll--sorry, kids). Tracks 1-7 are all excellent, more than could have been expected; the last 3 aren't as strong but grow on you with each listening. All in all, a very satisfying album from one of rock's vanguard artists."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"It has taken a while but David Bowie is finally back at doing what he does so well. Why try to adjust to the mood of the day when your own style never goes out of fashion? Hypnotic, melodic, haunting songs that will remind Bowie fans why they never lost faith and should seduce a whole new set. Back on top of the world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, please","review":"This album is by far the worst Bowie album yet, and I'm including Love Ya Til Tuesday in that calculation. Bowie sounds flat and bored through the whole thing, and the music itself sounds like it was produced in two \\"Hours...\\". If you want a Bowie album, buy Outside or his older stuff. I was thoroughly disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bowie needs St. John's Wort!","review":"What the hell happened? I was misled into thinking this album was going to be great. I hope Bowie doesn't sing these songs tousher in the new year. I really have to question themajority of Bowie fans who thought this album was his best work in twenty years. Depression must be popular again! And that's the bottom line cuz stone cold and the future world series champions \\"the atlanta braves\\" said so!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not good","review":"This album is so contrived. Thursdays's Child is an alright song- but most on this sounds like a hollowed out rock star searching for some substance or pretending to have some and coming up empty. I loved the jubulance and even thoughtfulness that he had on all his 7o's albums from \\"man who sold the world\\" through \\"Scary monsters\\" (although I never went for pin ups). And some of his singles since then have been OK. But what is this- it's like he's not even trying."},{"rating":"1","title":"wednesday's adult?","review":"Diary of an unfulfilled pop star or sympathy card to his generation? Does it matter? Bowie's 23rd album spares us another round of trend-hopping, opting for a more believable adult-contemporary groove, but his pathological ironic detachment makes him hard to take seriously as Love's Survivor. Even so, this album didn't have to be so weak -- the emotional heft in Bowie's songs has never come from him but his guitarists, from Mick Ronson to Stevie Ray Vaughan. A pity that Reeves Gabrels is such a cipher. His latest collaboration with Bowie is typically stagnant; bloodless guitars and synths substitute half-baked \\"moods\\" for genuine emotions. As for lyrics, take your pick from obtuse, half-finished or banal. \\"Sometimes I cry my heart to sleep ... Sometimes my courage fell to my feet,\\" the auteur laments in \\"Thursday's Child.\\" That would be drippy even if it didn't come from a billionaire married to a supermodel."},{"rating":"1","title":"David, what were you thinking?","review":"This album is one of the most morose, dark, and just plain boring collection of songs I have heard in a long time. I don't know if Bowie was trying to be \\"deeper\\" than usual, or if he was suffering from some deep depression when he recorded the material, or what, but I did not enjoy listening to this very much. I have every album Bowie has put out, including some imports and hard-to-find selections, and this one rates pretty much at the bottom of my list. Too bad -- some of the songs really had some potential, but they went nowhere in my book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great lp!!!bowie's second best after earthling","review":"This is David Bowie's second best lp after Earthling.He's finally returned to the good old Hunky Dory days and songs like Seven,Survive and The Pretty Things are amongs his best 90's songs.If you like his early 70's stuff and a few good 80's rock stuff you should definitely check this lp."},{"rating":"2","title":"Typical Bowie: Very Good and Very Bad","review":"I've always felt Bowie's albums featured too many throwaway dities, and \\"Hours\\" adhered to that rule. (\\"Station to Station\\" was an exception because it only featured six songs.) His good songs are usually excellent however, and there were enough of those on this album to give it four stars. I especially liked \\"Pretty Things..\\", \\"Seven,\\" \\"Survive,\\" and the last song. \\"Tuesday's Child\\" totally lost me though, and what was that reason for that dopey instrumental? Worth a listen for the good stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Back to Form...nearly","review":"After a few dissapointments this is the best Bowie album since Scary Monsters.Beside 1 Outside in 95 Bowie has been a little too 'safe' of late but hours proves that he still has that spark.Highlights include Survive and Something in the Air plus The dreamers taking us back a few decades of musical style.Not the best bowie ever but he's certainly getting back to form - we know Bowie's not finished yet!Not a fan of Bowie? don't worry, there's still lots to like on this album whatever your taste."},{"rating":"2","title":"David Bowie looks back, not in anger. . .","review":"David is getting older, as I am too. This wonderful album reflects back on his life. As David matures in his songwriting skills, his musical complexity is light years from Ziggy Stardust.

I eagerly await his next venture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Muzak on Parade","review":"It was with much anticipation that I waited for this CD...the last big one for the millenium...unfortunatley I found very little to have been excited about. The music is bland, the lyrics are insincere romantic tragedy at it's worse...and of course this one might become popular in say, Europe...but then again, \\"Let's Dance\\" was an immensely popular album that shared in the lack of same substance \\"Hours\\" does. There are moments of brillaince throughout the CD, but they sound more like \\"planned accidents\\" than anything else. The final track, \\"The Dreamers\\" does leave one with hope though...hence, two stars. Save your money and start a savings account at bowiebanc.com...you'll probably get more of interest there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please David, sing again!","review":"I find this album very boring. All the songs are slow, and they all sound the same. To top it off, Bowie rarely SINGS on this album - he talks all the way through most of the songs. I'm a huge fan of most of Bowie's stuff from Space Oddity to Scary Monsters, but not a lot of the later stuff (except Tin Machine) and I group this album with all of the new music. Don't get me wrong, this album isn't a complete waste of time. But I only ever listen to it on a rainy day while I read a book, and Bowie is capable of song writing that refuses to regulated to the background. I wish he would release something more innovative and creative again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not nearly great enough to close the Millenium","review":"It's a fine album, just not for David Bowie. The man is a genius as his earliest efforts and his recent bold \\"Outside\\" prove, but this is not the CD of a genius. I'll say it: trite"},{"rating":"2","title":"Something in the Aaaiiirr... something in my EYES!!!!","review":"This has one of my all time favorite David bowie songs \\"something in the air\\" and is an overall very pleasant album. Bowie took a more simplistic approach having switching outside and earthling's dark glitchy moods for more acoustic and organic feel. Still the album has enough edginess to not let you forget that this is still David Bowie."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bad copy...","review":"I used to love Bowie and decide to see if I could love him again. I listened to a lot of his latter work on youtube and liked what I heard of Hours so I ordered this version of it but found it was a poorly made reproduction of the original. Many of the songs have been slowed down to the point that they sound out of tune. Yet when I listen to the same song, from the same album on Youtube, I like it and it isn't out of tune.I don't know if this is a poorly made bootleg or what."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Hours","review":"I am very surprised to hear some of the bad reviews of this album. Bowie does another bang up job in my opinion and I found it to be very relevant to my own life and especially in the current state I am in. I find Thursday's Child to be a superior song about a man regaining control of his life - it is very uplifting for me - 'throw me tomorrow seeing my past to let it go now that I really have a chance ...this is a song about a person changing his life around for the better - I love it. Next song I love is Something In The Air, this is a fantastic song that chronicles a break up - a personal relationship that doesn't necessarily have to be with another person -... \\"danced with you too long\\" - this could be about an addiction. Bowie's voice is excellent - his backup singers and musicians are all first rate - the whole album is excellent - Bowie is a fantastic lyricist. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"people with no music taste...","review":"surprisingly at near epidemic proportions is this new disease.also known as being a person with no musical taste.I think this is a very good album. while not particularly groundbreaking or as experimental as his other works i.e. Earthling 1.Outside. or diamond Dogsi have no idea why anyone would compare this album to Hunky Dory the two are completely different.The most comparison I can find is maybe the Deram anthology and that's mostly reffering to the rather understated instrumental accoutrements. the musical accompaniment in hours is actually much more interesting than that of the Deram anthologies as well.i think survive is an absolutely beautiful song.This album though is a bit of a sober melodramatic one.I personally like that, but other people not so much.I enjoyed this album quite a bit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quietly surreal","review":"It might not be like 'Earthling', but it is certainly unique. The lyrics are wonderful. This cd doesn't demand much, but it certainly deserves the same attention as the rest of his work. I find it has more heart to it than most music, and has helped make David Bowie one of my favorite artists (among queen, orgy, and korn). It is relfective of the times, and I would hope that the meaning and sound communicated in this masterpiece is what 1999 can be remembered for, not the backstreet boys."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for casual listening","review":"While I know this isn't Bowie's catchiest album, for me it is emotionally, the one that has the most meaning. I know at the time he put this out he said he was trying to make music for his generation instead of trying to cater to the usual pop main stream. It is an album who's lyrics are filled with thoughtful ambiguity. The musical style is quiet and ponderous, for the most part, supporting the same in the lyrics.Without going too far into my own personal reasons for loving this album so much, I will say it is what I put in my cd player when I need to find my way out of a mental crisis. The lyrics are always giving me new meanings and as I grow older (I first bought this when it came out--which was my first year of college) I find myself coming closer and closer to the material that Bowie presented.This was my first David Bowie album and I've never regretted owning this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cocaine is the remedy","review":"Bowie will revive, providing he will use drugs again. I'm saying this because he is going for another all time low. (The first was in the 80's) Reason? A real bowie album 'grows' on you. The more you listen, the better it gets. But here it is the other way round. At first the album seemed reasonably nice, but after the fifth time I couldn't bare it anymore. By the way the new videoclips are extremely boring and the guitarist Reeves Gabrels must be sacked."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Hours...\\":Retrogress or Regress?","review":"David Bowie, the curious man, the innovator of popular musics, the space-alien dilettante, the laurels-resting-upon richest musician in the U.K.: on \\"Hours...\\" the latter incarnation of Bowie makes his appearance, and I can say that I am little impressed with his flagrant complacency. Honestly, I opine that this outing was hardly much more than a soft-sell commercial for his new internet service ~ which is quite adamantly advertised on this enhanced cd's multimedia portion. I am not counting him out, yet, but Mr. Hunky Dory is in his mid-50's, and, like most pop/rock auteurs his age, he is beginning to age with a stagnant grace.

It's only scary feature is the fact that it is remembered enough to be released on DVD. My favorite part was the mouse trapped to a machine and then it disappears. It disappears in such a cheesy, horrible way because the film tricks used back in the early 60's were so weak, so it doesn't look believable. Another favorite part was the guy who was supposedly being beat up by an invisible man, but it was really funny because the guy was jumping around pretending he was getting punched and strangled. It's funny!

Leslie is playing and singing as well as one could expect. The songs suit his style. And if it all comes off sounding more than a little like ZZ Top, that's okay. The problem is that when you put the name of Mountain on an album, people will expect a certain sound. Leslie does what he can with Nantucket Sleighride but the missing pieces just become all the more glaring when you redo a song like that one.The loss of Felix Pappalardi was huge. His singing and songwriting were just as important as Leslie's. But the missing piece that Leslie refuses to acknowledge is the importance to the Mountain sound of Steve Knight's keyboards. Mountain was more than a blues band, but without a great keyboard player they have no choice but to play the blues."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not their best","review":"Nothing special here and if you are looking for an introduction into Mountain, this shouldn't be it.If you play \\"Talk Dirty\\" from Leslie's late 80s album and the song \\"Mystic Fire\\", guess what?

They unleash great pure rock tunes with energy like in the days of old. If you have been waiting for an all out heavy and hard sound with a solid performance by real musicians, you found it! They even throw it a killer tune with some strings just to keep you guessing. Some groups get better with time, but this group was great from the get-go. This proves they have never missed a beat!

Nantucket Sleighride Redux was very good and it sounds like Leslie might finally be able to SING it properly (I've seen Leslie live twice - the playing rocks but he just can't SING that song for some reason... sigh), and some of the other songs are OK, but nothing memorable.The album (like the last one) is still lacking in the song-writing department (Gail and Felix might have been weird but they were OK to decent song writers) and the sound here is thin, for some reason.OTOH, I did buy it (and another one for my brother, who's loved Leslie/Mountain for YEARS), I do listen to it, and it still has more heart that 9 tenths of the \\"product\\" being produced today.So - to sum it up - it's well worth 10 or 12 dollars, and if you get a chance, go see Leslie/Mountain, that IS worth it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Leslie West.....","review":"Leslie West is said to be Jeff Beck's favoite guitarist.

However, as another reviewer stated, it is hard to tell when the sharpener is full and will end up with shavings pushed waaaaaay up into the mechanism. More importantly though, the sharpener only works when a little plastic piece is insterted at the inside-back of the sharpener. This piece is not permanently attached to the sharpener and if it should fall out and get lost (which is very easy to do when emptying the sharpener), there is no way to get the sharpener to work ever again.

The only complaint I could make about it was that the shavings tray is very small, and if it got overfilled it was very difficult to pull out and could break.But when it came time to replace it, my second one's blades were clearly off center, because no pencil would sharpen evenly. The whole unit would shake and rattle too. So I returned it.

Although it's hard to judge whether vitamins are \\"working,\\" I do feel that they're having a good result.My one major complaint is that these vitamins taste bad. If you don't get them down very quickly, they'll leave a pretty rough flavor behind, and, even if you do swallow them instantly, they still put a bad taste on your tongue.

It is not surprising that all the big names are praising this book; and as one of the customer reviews said: Sulloway is shooting some Marxist and Freudian cows. In his dreams, maybe. I only wish Sulloway would learn to do some honest history one day, instead of piling documents upon documents, and \\"evidence\\" upon \\"evidence\\" and call that science. Well, science this is not. Unfortunately, the topic is too complex for even 200 pages of notes. In reading this book one ought to think about what Sulloway ignores and waves away...

As was brilliantly pointed out in Judith Harris's book \\"No Two Alike,\\" this book has no scientific basis. I am at least the second review here to point this out.As Harris explains, the portion of the variance for most major traits(juvenile delinquency being a rare exception) that can be attributed to birth order is basically negligible. The only reason for why a correlation may exist at all is probably due to genetic differences in the parents themselves. For example, parents with higher IQs tend to have fewer children. Since IQ is a heritable trait, we can expect only children to have higher IQs than latter-born children in large families. The cause here is genetic in origin. Once these genetic effects have been corrected for, the role of birth order becomes negligible."},{"rating":"1","title":"what you need to know of the man and his work","review":"For many years I assumed birth order maters - and that this is my unique idea. Ha! And Ha! - respectfully, now I know. But at the time I heard Sulloway's lecture to the Skeptic Society - I was still sympathetic to the idea. Finally someone got it! I thought. However, listening to him, I knew he got it all wrong. I could explain how he is wrong, and yet, he did all that research, he had all those numbers... maybe he is right after all...Later I found out.

For example, excluding certain theories on the basis that \\"they would have been discovered by others around the same time\\" can hardly be called scientific. And then, after lots of very impressive statistics, he wanders off into the land of anecdotal evidence science that makes the reader wonder why he's working at MIT in the first place. Although there is probably a basis for some of his conclusions, and it is a great effort to bring science to this subject of popular prejudice, I can't support the raving reviews it received in the press."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth it!","review":"Did you ever have the feeling that you read a different book altogether?I found Prof. Sulloway's work to be highly revealing. He obviously managed to bring this topic from coffee table discussion to true scientific value. I am a bit confused as to the criticism of other readers however. If one were not to use multi-variate statistics, pray tell how would one go about proving or disproving any social theory? The historical examples, as I understand them, are a means for the reader to understand the significance of the data, which was obviously well documented.Clearly human behavior cannot be determined 100% from research, but it does point to significant tendencies.

The woofer is also too loud compared to the left and right speakers. Since there's no way to adjust the volume of the woofer separately, I ended up not being able to turn the speakers up as much as I wanted to -- the bass would overpower the rest of the sound when I did.The volume control is deceptive. When you turn the volume up 50%, you get about 90% of the maximum sound output. The remaining half of the volume control is pretty much useless.The cord connecting the left and right speakers is permanently attached to both of them, which can be annoying. It's about 6 feet long -- too short for my desk.

But the worst betrayal is the portrayal of Penelope's love affair with Richard, especially the change to its ending and to the ending of the book.

It should have been Judy Dench! This is nearly as bad as the carnage wreaked on \\"Clan of the Cave Bear\\" by casting Darryl Hannah. Trying to stuff a big novel into 98 minutes is a travesty. I see why writers like Steven King and J.K. Rowling take such tough control of their works when someone wants to film them. Couldn't we wait a few years and try again, this time in a 13 week series or something like \\"Ballykissangel\\"?"},{"rating":"1","title":"No way to improve upon the book","review":"I was disappointed to say the least. Ms. Lansbury was fine, but the other casting was not good enough.

Behold some of the finest quartet playing on disc - modern or historic.

Its proofs are too dense in some places and too sparse in others, and its notation is obscure. I returned it almost immediately. I do not believe that any eighth grader could understand this book. If its price were not so low and its potential audience so limited, I would suspect fraud on the part of the first amazon reviewer. I eventually used the 2nd edition of Fraleigh's Abstract Algebra text to learn the proof for the insolvability of the general quintic.

This is an incredible collection of stories, who's diversity defies Hemingway. However, unlike the other reviews, I don't believe that the stories are about exile in such a simple way.

So if your child has attended a Montessori program and done push pinning, he/she will probably love this."},{"rating":"1","title":"do not buy this toy","review":"Based on the reviews I just read this product must be defective. There are some who write that it works just fine others, like myself, say that IT DOES NOT WORK AT ALL. I tried for an hour to get it to cut. Read and re-read the instructions. It just did not cut. If I jammed the pen into the paper right through the pad it made an indentation but that is all. Crayola needs to recall this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Paper cutter?","review":"My sister bought one for her kids. My first impression was that it was a tattoo gun. After arguing with my sister for a minute whether it could make a tattoo or not I tried it. I now have a permanent smiley face on my wrist. It is in fact a tattoo gun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy with younger children","review":"Purchased, installed batteries and returned. May be OK for 8 and above, but if you have younger children, don't buy. The cutter can puncture if held against skin. I now know what it must feel like to get a tattoo."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK, but flimsy.","review":"Yes, it works. Yes, it's slow. But the biggest problem is that after using it only a handful of times, it just broke. There's no longer any tension in the point - if you press on it, it just pushes right up and retracts into the head. Can't see any way to fix it - the head doesn't have normal screws so I can't open it (I did take the tip off, but the problem is beyond that). Unfortunately, we've had it for a while so returning it isn't an option. Guess it's going right into the trash. I'm getting tired of these relatively expensive kids' toys that break so easily."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Dangerous","review":"I don't know why people keep saying this thing is dangerous just because of what it looks like. People are equating it to a tattoo needle! Anyways, it's NOT dangerous, I've heard of many adults actually turning it on on their own hand to make sure it's safe and IT IS. I've never heard of someone (or their kids) getting cut with this thing. Crayola would be pretty dumb to market this thing as safe if it wasn't. That would be a lawsuit waiting to happen and they know it.In any case, I personally think this cutter is pretty neat and is a blast for all kinds of projects. If someone buys it and it doesn't work all that well, just return it and be done with it, yanno? And of course if you love it, well, keep it and have fun!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerous!!!","review":"This toy is dangerous!! Don't buy it! The 'cutter' is really a metal point that jabs in and out of the pen and perforates the paper- It is seriously just like a child's version of a tattoo needle! It claims that the point is safe, but it is sharp enough to perforate a child's skin too.I originally thought this would be a fantastic toy for children, but was highly disappointed when I realized how this supposed 'safe' toy really worked."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seriously . . .","review":"I am in no way a prude, but holy cow is this thing dangerous. The reason I am even looking it up on the web was because I was SURE there would be a recall on it. My wife got it for our 5 year old and besides not really cutting, it IS a tattoo needle. Can't think of any other reason to own it really except to do bad prison tats in your own home. Good thing my boy loves tattoos and we got him the pack of 500 tattoos(removable). I guess when he's older he can whip this thing out and get started on the real thing. Sheesh. Shame on you Crayola."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too hard for younger kids..","review":"My daughter is almost 6 and we got her this for Christmas. The commercials made it look really cool and easy for kids, no more scissors! Well we opened it today and it's too hard for her to hold the button down for any amount of time and to move it around slowly enough to actually cut anything. I'm having to do it all for her and my hand gets tired too! They should have made it that the \\"pen\\" cuts when just being pushed on the paper or something. I have a 9 year old also that was trying to use it and it wasn't all that easy for him either. Seems more like something teens or adults that scrapbook would use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hunk of Junk","review":"Don't waste your money! I did not buy this from Amazon as it was unavailable, but don't bother to find it elsewhere. You have to push so hard on the cutter to get it to cut that it tears the paper. My 11 year old was unable to use it effectively. I was barely able to get it to cut a clean line. Can't imagine the frustration of the people that paid $30 plus on Ebay to get one of these for Christmas. I'm returning mine and will use the credit for some good safety scissors, constuction paper and glue."},{"rating":"1","title":"UNRELIABLE AND CHEEP","review":"I bought this item thinking it was a thrifty and reliable way to burn DVDs off my Mac.

I love healthy snacks but these lacked flavor and were almost too hard and crunchy to chew. I ate them with hummus which was ok, but when I tried to eat them plain, I couldn't even get through one little pouch. Great concept but needs more spices to make them tastier and more flavorful.

This product would be a 5-star product if it worked the opposite where it would instantly start when your hands went under it but would take a few seconds to shut off afterwards or when it detects the hands are no longer there.

I think my favorites in the collection were \\"The Prophet's Hair,\\" and \\"The Courter.\\" In fact, I think \\"The Prophet's Hair,\\" was the story which truly reminded me that Rushdie knows how to turn a phrase. While at times there is a certain ambivalence in some stories, I think that is understandable in point of view of Rushdie's own background. It is an attitude that comes from being a product of two cultures and wanting to have claims to both, not just one or the other, as Rushdie so elegantly proclaims at the end of \\"The Courter.&quot"},{"rating":"2","title":"--Nine Rushdie tales. =East, West, East/West.","review":"Rushdie's writing contains the joyous confusions of being claimed by two cultures.

The version of \\"Country Boy\\" on this CD has just Cash with his guitar. It's a nice version of the song, but the one on the original album has Perkins on guitar and Grant on bass. I know this for certain because I have an original copy of this album from the late 1950s - it's a very beat-up copy, but it plays well enough for me to say without a doubt that Varese made a mistake!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute, but a little thin","review":"Drew is always a sight, but the story was thin. The quality of the picture was good, so was the sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"She's so sweet","review":"Drew Barrymore is a doll in this short story comedy about a southern gal finding a father of her child. At first, I thought it was a comeback of the movie, Annie at the first glimpse of Sally at the burger drive in. I just love her charms besides her glossy lips. Although funny, the only criticism that sparks in this comedy is that Sally, who is so young and innocent and who got pregnated by an overwhelmingly older man should deliver a message to young girls to be responsible on their bodies. This is rated PG, so I would strongly urge parents out there to render advice. That's all folks, otherwise, it is a great comedy for the entire family to watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"B - O - R - I - N - G!","review":"This couldn't decide whether it wanted to be a romantic comedy or a black comedy. No matter which it was trying to be at a particular moment the dialogue is CONSISTENTLY delivered in a oddly-rythmed mono-tone mumble (mainly by Luke Wilson but Drew is also guilty). With no sense of tension, hint of a logical plot, or ultimately even a climax, the movie simply peters to a bland end leaving one thinking \\"WHAT A WASTE OF MY TIME\\". I would have given it zero stars if possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really boring!!","review":"Although I love Luke Wilson ( I love you Luke!!!) I didn't like this movie at all. I hope to see Luke soon in a good movie. I fell in love with him the instant I saw him in 'Bad blood', an X-files episode. And this episode was written by Vince Gilligan, as is the movie so I gave it a try... Total disappointment!! I expected a lot better from my fav. X-files writer Vince Gilligan.

I am neither a Drew Barrymore fan nor a detractor. It seems her fans are the few that actually like this movie. The plausibility factor is zero which absolutely guts the humor premise. A good part of my tastes embrace dark humor but this movie looks more like an elaborately staged non-funny improv. They were reaching for Repo-Man but managed to bottom out under Peggy Sue Got Married instead. If you read all the reviews you will find someone who mentions this is the stinker they use to grade all the other movie farts. I agree whole-heartedly with that assessment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ridiculous and funny dark comedy","review":"This movie has enough plot twists and comic relief to keep anyone's attention.

The twists and turns were totally out there and not believable (as opposed to a good movie which would have unbelievable twists) If you have to see a Drew Barrymore movie of the second phase in her career this is not the one.

Luke Wilson, who is one of the best looking men on the planet, portrays Dorian, an equally kind and lovable character who has to deal with a crazy mother & brother, while falling in love with Sally. \\"Home Fries\\" is a great movie about getting over the hurdles of life and fighting to be with the one you love."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wild,Weird","review":"Home Fries is an endearing dark comedy.

Sounds strange-but in many ways this is a strange film. Not strange bad, but unlike anything you may have seen. I didn't realize what the film was REALLY about until the end. Its about one man's spiritual journey and his quest to find his place in life,to find love, but mostly about his quest to find meaning in religion. But the religious theme is quite subtle. At first it just seems like a drawn-out story about a lonely homosexual boy and frankly I was bored with it for a while. But I can highly recommend it, I don't beleive I have seen many films that deal with a person's quest for a meaningful religious belief quite like this one. It is not an upbeat story. But the acting is top-notch. Jeremy Irons is perfect in his role. Don't think his character is just a doe doe with nothing to say. He is quiet and introspective and seeking truth."},{"rating":"2","title":"DVD Set of Brideshead Revisited","review":"This is a deluxe set of four DVD discs contained in a white glossy box with a picture of two of the central movie characters on the box.

It was a real letdown. Without going into the storyline, let me say that it was a waste of time. I like stories that have endings that are satisfying. This story was not one of them. It seems that all the characters in this story have no happiness. The only thing I liked about the story was the scenery and sets which were top notch.

However, I do love excellent writing and acting and John Mortimer's adaptation of the Evelyn Waugh novel is simply superb. It is what brought Jeremy Irons to the attention of American audiences. He is the narrator of this story about a very wealthy Catholic English family. He is drawn into this family when he meets the son, Sebastian, at his college. Eventually, he is drawn into relationships with more family members and Sebastian's sisters, Julia and Cordelia, also become very important to him. Sebastian is ultimately a flawed and trajic man whereas our narrator begins to adopt the worst aspects of the upper class into his own character: boredom, lassitude, disenchantment and jadedness. Set in the earlier 20th century, the recreation of detail period and costume is also outstanding."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Blu-Ray quality","review":"I purchased the new Blu-ray box set of Brideshead Revisited assuming that the DVD would have been digitally remastered and the picture quality and sound improved. I already own the 25th Anniversary Collector's Edition from Acorn Media with all the DVD extras and special features. I am horribly disappointed to find that the image quality is exactly the same as the old edition with dull muddy colours and an unclear almost VHS quality image. The master has definitely not been remastered in any way. This DVD set is NOT up to Blu-ray standards. Do not purchase it if you already have the earlier edition. A total waste of money!!If Pride and Prejudice (TV series )could be remastered beautifully for Blu-ray why can't Bridehead Revisited be done as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent DVD Collector's Set!","review":"Finally! This television masterpiece has come to DVD in a nicely packaged and digitally remastered presentation. I'm not sure what the problem was with Mr. Stewart's player, but the discs all play beautifully on the several players I've tried them in. And the color restoration and remastering provides the clearest and best picture I've ever seen. Based on Evelyn Waugh's classic novel, Brideshead is an elegant and unforgettable story set in the fading years of the British Empire and stars Jeremy Irons and Anthony Edwards in career-making roles. I'm a little disappointed not to see an interview with Irons on the DVD, but the *real* reason to buy this is for the series itself. It's well worth revisiting, again and again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Other than the setting, i.e., Lithuania, I found the book a great disappointment. More suited for children's literature."},{"rating":"2","title":"His Chicago is better...","review":"I like very much Abbado directing Mahler's 7th. The velvety sound of this recording makes adds to the impression of night indeed, and I could of course have rated this one with the five stars, but the velvety sound can also be described as haze, it is not clear, and this aspect it shares with the Abbado/Berlin 9th and 6th.Abbado's earlier recording of the 7th with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra - amazon-search: B000001GNE - feels much deeper and urgent to me, more inspired. Chicago played as good as, if not better, the Berlins, and most important: the recorded sound is clearer. I got this Abbado/Berlin before I purchased the Chicago, so this is not a matter of habit. I have many great Mahler 7th, Kubelik (DGG), Kondrashin, Bernstein (Sony), Gielen and these two by Abbado - I don't mention the not so great. My deserted island pick for this symphony would be either Bernstein/New York (Sony) or Abbado/Chicago (DGG), in spite of the superior clarity of Gielen's 7th."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great new way of thinking!","review":"This book will give you a functional view of what knowledge management is and how to implement its processes in your company or organization.

I was getting sick of using a razor knife, router and sandpaper to flush the edges. So I decided to spend some money on \\"the right tool\\". But after trying the Freud EB-090, I would not recommend it.On the positive side, it is faster and safer (than the way I usually do it).But clearly outweighing those advatages are the following...- you need a good, sharp blade and these are not blades you can sharpen yourself. Replacement blades cost half-again the price of the trimmer.- I just can't get good results. Hand pressure and other factors affect the quality of the trim.I could improve results with more practice, but my decision is to return the gadget and spend the money on a good trimming knife and bandaids."},{"rating":"1","title":"Find another option","review":"First of all, this tool can't be used properly on 1/2 inch stock because the sides don't squeeze in that far.Secondly, it isn't very effective on real wood veneers.

At first I thought it was because I'm used to my kindle, but when compared to other paper books, the printing is awful. It feels like I'm staring at a wall of text, and the lines tend to merge together. There needs to be more space in between the lines, and it would go a long way if the pages were not so bright. I think this is the first book I've ever seen with this problem, and I hope it's the last.As far as the content of the book is concerned, it's about what I'd expect from a basic philosophy book, so that's not really an issue."},{"rating":"1","title":"A 250 page CV on how Clive James became an intellectual","review":"Having so much enjoyed the first two volumnes in this series, I was not prepared for this turgid list of self improvement.

It wasn't. While I can understand the author's anger at herself and her former husband and life, it is cumbersome to read. She has great distain for most men and overweight people. Despite traveling to numerous locations around the world, her writing reads like a diary and is often repetitive. While I'm sure this was cathartic for her, it just wasn't interesting. It is highly judgmental of others. The book abruptly ends when she boards the plane to fly home. I only read through the entire book to see what kind of impact the trip had on her life after returning home. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have for any serious student of astrology","review":"There are plenty of books out there that will tell you what your Sun sign means. There are some books that will describe certain aspects, such as Sun square Mars (like the excellent James Braha title.)Tierney's book, however, is one of the few (if not the only one) that will explain in depth what an aspect itself (e.g. a sextile, a square, an inconjunct) means, how waxing and waning aspects are different, how aspects relate to signs and the more complex configurations that build on aspects, as well as other topics such as retrogrades.While the material is rather abstract, in my opinion it is virtually impossible to have a mastery of astrology without understanding the contents of this volume. It is that profound and important."},{"rating":"1","title":"Movie was a disappointment","review":"I bought an old 2004 used copy of the movie because I love Sophia Myles acting. Based on the director comments comparing it to The Others and Sixth Sense, I was expecting a ghostie or two, but there wasn't even one. I guess the caretaker standing in the yard saying he didn't go to THE WOODS relates to the gardener in The Others, also the little girl saying her stepmother was MAD. Couldn't find anything that reminded me of The Sixth Sense. Too slow moving, too contrived, a lot of the plot didn't really make sense (she had so many opportunities to leave and didn't), none of the acting rang true like you expect in a movie, and of course the ending stinks. I'll donate it to the local library instead of saving it to watch again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly Awesome","review":"I have been a Yes fan for about 30 years and I must say this is one of the best pieces of music I've heard.

It may be a little pricey to some, but I must say....it's well worth the money.The book that comes with the five c.d. set just adds to the flavor. Having been seperated from Yes music for a while, when my fiancee gave this to me as a Christmas gift I was very pleased. Once I heard it....well let me say this, it actually brought tears to my eyes,as well as a lot of memories. This is a must have for the true Yes fan.

Professor West sees the world almost entirely through the prism of race, while Wallis is best known for providing cover for abortion rights politicians with his Sojourners organization. Yet somehow Mich endorses works by both of these partisan figures in his book. There are useful things to learn from Mr. Mich, but the vision of social justice on display in these pages is frequently politicized. (One of the accomplishments cited by Mich is lobbying for a reallocation of funds from a large tobacco settlement toward favored political projects.) That isn't surprising; Mich is employed by the Diocese of Rochester, a redoubt of progressive politics and doctrinal dissent. Readers are advised to seek other resources, and they might consider learning what the Church teaches about social justice. Fr. Rodger Charles'sAn Introduction to Catholic Social Teachingis a good place to start."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great romantic read!","review":"Chance of a Lifetime is Amy's Leigh's first novel, and what a treat it is!

It is sure to be reread whenever the urge to revisit the history of Texas' contribution to the U.S. Army Air Force's efforts during WWI and WWII.I was impressed also with the numerous vintage photograps, maps, descriptions of the relevant airfields, aircraft photos and specifications, as well as the high level of documentation from primary source documents.This book absolutely has to be the best book on this topic yet written.

The plot is pretty much non-existent, the characters are completely one-dimensional and often practically indistinguishable.

Kenny Paulsen's guitar playing here is on the same edge of heavy metal as that in The Guess Who's version of Johnny Kidd's \\"Shakin' All Over\\", but Kenny's a better player. He sounds a bit like Cliff Gallup, Gene Vincent's original guitar player, and that's high praise. His intro riff is a killer, and the cut just flashes brilliance!

I agree, some of the content may not be appropriate for adolescents. However, the message the book gave me has changed my life for the better. In Brian, I saw the power of dreaming big, of not forgetting and to never stop persuing your dreams. It opened my eyes and the world became a much more exciting, magical place - much like the wonderful places Llywelyn describes in her books.

As a student of Irish history, I can tell you this book is not only poorly written but historically inaccurate. Not that perfect accuracy should be the goal of a fiction writer, but how about making an attempt at being accurate as well as entertaining? The book rambles on and on with little motivation for the character's actions or substance in the writing. Some of the passages are just laugh-out-loud ridiculous.\\"His face looked like a linen napkin\\" Really? What does that mean? It was in someone's lap? It was covered in gravy?The author makes use of (often misspelled) Gaelic words throughout, but doesn't include a glossary. Are we supposed to be impressed? It just makes the sentences awkward.Avoid this book at all costs.If you want authentic, well-written historical fiction, stick with Pressfield or Rutherford.

Being a Foodie, I picked this book up hoping to find a book about this woman and her attempts at following in the great Julia Childs Whisk-prints, and instead about 100 pages into it i realized that i was taken, robbed and the joke was on me. Julie Powell is a woman who hated her life, her job, and wanted to get rich off of a dead womans reputation and i think its despicable. There is not one Iota of Julia's amazing spirit in the pages, only Julies filthy mouth, kitchen and monotonous repetitive monologues. Oh, she hates eggs, and uses wonderbread to make recipes, we get to hear about her brilliant idea for a blog and how everyone loved the way she wrote, I am not sure if this womans nose is brown because of eating chocolate or because she kissed her own self righteous behind too much.If you love Julia, do not read this, its full of insults thrown her way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do NOT Waste Your Time Or Money!","review":"Before buying this book I came to Amazon and read a bunch of reviews. While many of them were negative, I figured, \\"I like all books.\\" Wow. I should have listened to those other reviewers. If Ms. Powell had stuck to the memoirs of her cooking, it would have been great. Instead, she sticks the cooking bits in between unneccessary political commentary, complaining about her job, snarking at her husband, and general awfulness. She is so unlikeable, that I am considering not finishing the book. I have only done that twice before, usually I just slog through. If you haven't bought this book yet, don't.

It was my pick to jump start my summer reading binge. Maybe I'm spoiled after reading \\"Cooking for Mr. Latte\\" and \\"A Homemade Life\\", but this is just painful to even attempt to finish. I'm trying my darnedest too, but it's slow, neurotic (not in a good way), and the cooking is such a miniscule part of the whole darned thing. How did she get a book deal? I hope the movie is ok, maybe that can salvage this, because man, the book is already in my donate box. Not even going to TRY to resell the darn thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Disappointment","review":"Although this author is witty and has a definite way with words, I found her to be a whiny brat. In her wry manner, Julie displays a lack of respect for most people she encounters, camouflaged under a cloak of humor. I did not expect a cookbook, but hoped for a more engaging story of \\"self-awakening\\". I put the book down because I could not spend another moment with this individual, who mistakenly finds her histronics an amusing topic of interest for eveyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"This book starts out with a good premise, but then quickly deteriorates to the story of ME ME ME, rather than a cooking adventure.I kept hoping the book would improve, but this morning I decided that I couldn't read any more.

I'm very sorry now that my husband wasted hard-earned money on this.I'm only half finished, but I doubt that I will be finishing it. It is not about cooking, and as everyone else has said, foodies will not like it. It is not inspiring, and there is nothing to identify with. You can't even root for the author.

The screenplay writers did an excellent job turning a sow's ear into a silk purse (or reasonable fascimile of it.)I barely made it through the first chapter without wanting to just throw the book across the room. Turns out Julie Powell was a whiner far earlier in the book than she was in the movie. At least in the movie, some of the whining is charming. In the book it is not at all charming. You just want to smack her and yell, grow up already! In comparison, Julia's memoir is far more interesting, and while Julia definitely had her moments, it was clear she was far more emotionally mature than Julie. No wonder Julia blew off Julie and her blog."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!","review":"After reading My Life in France I couldn't wait to read Julie & Julia.

A complete disappointment. Flippant, ignorant about food and cooking techniques, Ms. Powell is hardly the person to be taken as an expert on food, even if she did cook a lot of Julia Child's recipes (and yet Bon Appetit and other publications, including The Washington Post, are falling all over themselves offering Ms. Powell writing assignments--it goes to show how much such publications really do seek new, fresh voices in food writing--take note, all you food writers out there!). Superficial and not worth the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great concept, but not enough about the cooking","review":"As a librarian, I usually don't buy books, but I was so excited about this one, I bought it when it first came out. Sad to say that I couldn't even finish it. I was hoping for more insight on Julia Child--more on the recipes--more on the food. What I got instead was a lot of unrelated, self-focused rambling about a New Yorker's life (and her friends). Perhaps it has been mis-marketed. I have a sense of humor, but I didn't get into the sitcom-style whining about 30-something life. I felt as though I was wading through the mire of her life just to get to any good parts (and some of us cook in far worse kitchens--get over it!). I sorely missed the recipes and the passion for good food."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too self indulgent","review":"As a writer and a blogger, I expected this story to be so much more.

She'd been around the block a few times.Julie did use the word f*** too much. It stopped being funny on about page 10. Her references to September 11 was tasteless even if they did revolve around her job as a secretary. Plus the writing in general was terrible. Julia Child should have been pissed at her.

Don't waste your time unless you like self-indulgent, self-important bloggers who think their thoughts and their lives are the most important thing on the planet.

FIND A BETTER WAY TO EXPRESS YOURSELF OTHER THAN WITH EXPLETIVES! Good grief, her use of the four letter word is exhausting. That smacks of dullness of mind. She had a great premise and ruined it by her continual use of profanity and whining. A very disappointing book. This is the first time I have ever chosen a movie over the book.

Despite the overuse of profanity, the endorsement of destructive behavior(encouraging friends in adulterous affairs) and the incessant bashing of \\"evil\\" Republicans, I pushed on. I'm 3/4 of the way through the book and I'm done. I just can't take anymore! I usually read Amazon reviews before spending money on a book but on impulse picked this up at B&N. Lesson learned!

I got to page 81 and gave up, something I rarely do. I like to finish what I start! Julie Powell does nothing but complain. She seems to totally lack a personality, while her poor husband Eric has to put up with her nonstop foul moods. In the pages that I read, there is very little actual cooking being done. She mostly talks about her crappy job, moving,her crappy apartment, commuting, a visit with her parents and brother, and going to the doctor. I expected this to be about each recipe she mastered, but it's not. Read My Life in France by Julia Child and Alex Prud'homme instead. Very satisfying indeed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hope the movie is better","review":"This is one of the few books I have not and will not finish. I had such high hopes for this book. I forced myself to keep reading thinking at some point it might actually improve. Who is she writing this book for? It surely can't be for people who actually know who Julia Child is. Ms. Powell writes like a spoiled, foul-mouthed 19 year old who could care less about Julia Child or her cooking. Her repeated and irrelevant political comments, her lack of compassion for the 9-11 families, her incessant and inane daily mental breakdowns....and very little about cooking....made me realize that if she can get published...anyone can get published. This is a terrible book. As I did not finish the book, I can only hope that Ms. Powell did not quit her day job."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste on all counts!","review":"If you are thinking that this book will be as charming as the movie think again! I read about 70 pages and gave up which I normally do not do. Julie Powell disappoints on every page.

Julie, if you are reading this, you owe me $8.00!"},{"rating":"1","title":"0 stars","review":"This was probably the worst book I have ever read. It was the best idea, in the wrong person's hands. All Julie Powell did was complain, and whine. This book is not for foodies, because there was not enough mention of food. It was bascially a book about her political views (which were too strongly voiced), and her insensitivity about her job (talking to 9/11 victims families only one year after it happened). Poorly written and very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terribly written","review":"Even though I was looking forward to reading this book, I was disappointed. Julie Powell is a terrible writer. She seems to have a boring relationship with her husband, an unsatisfactory sex-life, and a quite bitchy attitude.

It had lots of mistakes and then it seemed to me that the author was all over the place. Sometimes you just sort of want to throw the book at the wall or then you just sit there and think WOW she actually got a book deal and a movie deal out this. ONLY in AMERICA! Thumbs down and a zero star. Why did I really buy this book?

Big waste of time.At one point I thought I had left it on an airplane, and when my husband urged me to talk my way back onboard, I waved him off saying that the book wasn't worth it. But it appeared in my carry-on after all.So, I finished the book. I give it a solid \\"C\\".Here's my lingering question: WHERE did Hollywood come up with that darling Amy Adams to render the part of the sharp-tongued, crude, and egocentric Julie Powell in this book?

I would strongly recommend this book if you are intrigued by the idea of reading a light hearted memoir that revolves around food."},{"rating":"1","title":"Politics Broiled Dry and Unpalatable","review":"You can still read Powell's original blog out there on the internet...and it is not the jolly Bridget-Jones-esque diary that they are making it out to be. She is a hate-filled New York liberal woman who hates her government job, her Republican co-workers, George W, and basically anything religious (calling them crazies at every opportunity). How gleefully Meryl Streep must have read this diatribe. If ONLY the cooking elements had been on Powell's mind it would have been entertaining IF you do not mind the multiple f-bombs.

Seeing the movie just made me all the more gung-ho to finish the book and of course, buy myself a copy of Mastering the Art of French Cooking!! Outside of the scenes of Paris in the movie, the book has much more detail of life in NYC apres 9/11 and the arduousness of Julie's idea of a project -- to cook each recipe from the massive cookbook and blog about it.

It led me to read My Life in France a few years ago (Julia's memoir)which I loved but now I am reading Dearie, a well written biography about Julia's whole life, not just the happy bits in France, by Bob Spitz.

Well, unfortunately Julie Powell felt the need to \\"liven it up\\" with so much profanity I couldn't even get through this book. Very disappointing. This is not a sweet book, this is not about cooking so much as it's about Julie finding more ways to include the \\"F\\" word into every day language. Don't let the cover fool you.

Miserable. B. Whining. C. Self-Obsessed and D. Political. I put this book down on page 100, thoroughly disgusted by this exasperating woman and her mercurial, childish moods. I was so excited to read it after seeing the article in People, and I thought the idea was really inspiring and wonderful. It was such a great project and it took a lot for her to slowly whittle my respect for her, but she did an excellent job of it. This was a good idea that is fumbled in the hands of an inspipid, boring woman who I am so sorry I know anything about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Title should read Julie & Julie","review":"I utterly hated this book! The author whines, complains and then whines some more. Thank goodness for the chapters reflecting back to Julia Child's life because it gave me a break from reading about all her complaints. It's a shame the author had to used Julia Child's life as an excuse to write a book about herself, and boy does she like to talk about herself. Save your time and read Julia Child's biography. It's a lot more entertaining and you won't feel like kicking yourself for wasting your time reading this drivel."},{"rating":"1","title":"complete trash","review":"Please don't waste your time reading this trash. I threw the book away after reading a few chapters....I look for books that make me laugh, cry, think, imagine,learn from and get motivated or inspired....this book did nothing ...This book is not about cooking ...its not about the great Julia Child...its about the daily life of an angry, uninspring, foul mouth woman who tries to cook her way through Julia Child's cooking book without even enjoying the experience...however I do recommend the movie....you see a lot more of Julia Child ...it is well played and even the Julie character is quit nice..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Narcissistic and boring","review":"The jacket gushes, \\"Julie Powell writes about cooking the way it always needed to be written about.\\"No, she doesn't. She writes about her friends' dysfunctional sex lives, about her own barely-controlled anger management issues, and about how much city life sucks for the less-than rich. But she writes very little about cooking.She also has a rather limited vocabulary, substituting liberal amounts of profanity. This gets old quickly, too.I threw this away unfinished; I didn't want to be responsible for anyone else wasting time on this book by giving it away. Fortunately it was cheap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unless you grew up loving...","review":"whiny sitcoms, this is not the book for you. Like others, I was hoping for the details of Julie's journey working her way through Julia Child's first book. I could care less about the profanity or the politics (although the latter just got annoyingly tiresome even for this liberal), it's just the whining. My God! how the woman whines. And moans. And mopes. Some books make you glad, others make you cranky; this one leaves me with the urge to grab the author by the shoulders, give her a good shake and yell, \\"Stop whining!! My 9 year old niece whines less than you!\\" And tip for Julie--any recipes you had problems with were because a) you have no clue how to cook and b) you were too distracted whining to follow a recipe. I wish 0 stars were allowed in reviews--oh, I know! I'll whine about it. It seems to work for Julie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the paper it's written on....highly disappointing.","review":"As an avid blogger and foodie, I looked forward to buying this book for over a year. Now that I have it, I can't even finish reading it. Powell is not only a bad cook but a bad writer as well.This book doesn't stick with any audience. Bloggers think it's overrated. Foodies think it's insulting to Julia Child. Readers feel it's a bad piece of writing. Overall, it's just bad. On top of everything else, her constant b*tching about her botched recipes got on my last nerve.Boring and not really about anything, this book is as bland as an unseasoned chicken breast."},{"rating":"1","title":"I counldn't even finish it!","review":"I had such high hopes for this book, especially after reading Powell's article in a recent Gourmet (or was it Bon Appetite?) magazine. I am so utterly disappointed in this book. If Powell had completely focused on her cooking project I would have been mildly amused. However, the chaos in her life is not entertaining. I don't want to read about someone drinking Vodka every night and complaining about the world. This book is not what I expected and I'm embarrassed that I gave it to my father as a Christmas gift. In his words, \\"life's too short to waste it by reading books like this\\". What a waste of money. After reading half of the book I finally put it down last night and won't be picking it up again. Such a disappointment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much Julie, not enough Julia","review":"Two stars is generous...unfortunately (and I tried so very hard) I could not finish this book and left it in a rental house in Florida over the holidays for someone else to read.Desperately in need of editing...perhaps there is a real generation gap in that I found the author to be very naive. This shouldn't be shelved in the cookbook section of bookstores--a memoir is more like it. If you're interested, take it out of the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Julie Powell, I don't like you","review":"I had such high hopes for this book and have been sorely disappointed. I've only read about half of it and am making myself finish it since I paid full price for it. Reading should not be a chore. There is so much wrong with it I can't cover it all but here are my major complaints:First of all Julie is downright obnoxious. There is nothing likeable about her. She is whiny, crass, and extremely vulgar. This book is also full of profanity. And I am appalled at her cold feelings towards 9-11 victims. I'm glad I'm not the only one who noticed that. Second, this book has hardly anything to do with cooking. The author mentions the recipes almost as an afterthought. Third, she completely overwrites and I'm finding my mind wondering on nearly every single page. I am no psychic, but I am rather comfortable predicting that her newest book will be a complete and utter failure. I can see why Julia Child wanted no part in this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terribly Disappointing","review":"I was so excited when I got this book. But I am walking away from it completely disappointed. I love Julia Child but didn't see where she was a big part of this book. In my opinion, I didn't understand what Julie Powell was trying to get across to her readers. I was 40 pages into the book and had no idea what I was reading. I thought maybe if I stick it out, things will start to make sense. Well halfway through the book, I was more confused then ever. This book makes no sense. Julie Powell is all over the place with her story. She jumps from one subject to another without finishing what she was talking about in the first place. Very frustrating to follow. By the time I got halfway through this book, I had no idea what I had read. This had to be just about one of the worst books I have ever attempted to read. I won't be finishing it and would not recommend it to anyone that I know or who asks me about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"TMI (Too Much Information)","review":"My husband stopped reading after 50 pages.

She constantly drops the \\"F\\" bomb and I don't care to know so much about her or her friend's sex lives.As a fan of Julia Child, guess I expected more of the challenges of cooking Julia Childs' recipes as written. They're sort of an afterthought (maybe 2 or 3 paragraphs in a chapter) after the trials and tribulations of her life. The boredom of 9/11 ceremonies that as a government worker she is forced to witness, the boredom of her job, her dislike of Republicans, her boring fellow workers, etal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I had this book on my \\"to read\\" list for some time and finally got around to picking it up. I thought this would read along the lines of, \\"Cooking for Mr. Latte\\" which I thoroughly enjoyed. I was expecting (and wanting) something very light-heartened and by the description I thought, \\"Julie and Julia\\" would be exactly that. I could not have been more wrong. I found the author to be annoying and very unlikeable. I got about 1/2 through the book before I gave up. Wish I had read these reviews first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!","review":"I really wanted to like this book. I am a chef who loves cooking memoirs and Julia Child so how could I go wrong? Well I went very wrong, very very very very wrong.The book has nothing to do with cooking, from a woman who seemingly hates food and only started cooking(by her on account) to snag her husband. Why I wonder did the woman choose to do all of the recipes in MTAOFC in 365 instead of truly trying to do the recipes as written and to perfection? I do think as a past reviewer has said that this was Ms. Powell attempt( which she did successfully) to get rich off of the late and great Julia Child.I am not a fan of reading about a very spoiled woman who seems to have no real talent of her own. Complaining about living conditions, family, friends, job, etc. but never seeking to improve them. If you like to read this sort of thing, this is the book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amusing, but...","review":"I read this a couple years ago -- one of my fascinations in life is good foodie food, and another is reading memoirs. This book does combine these two aspects of a considered life.I read the book, and while I enjoyed it, and stayed to the end, I really wouldn't provide more than two and a half stars to this one. Since reading it, I've discovered the real world of food blogs on the Internet, with many authors who blow her book away. The concept of making every single recipe in Julia Child's \\"The Art of French Cooking\\" was an excellent one. I was amused by her trials and tribulations with some of the more arcane recipes and ingredients, and I'm glad she preserved onwards.But afterwards? I felt like I'd just over-eaten at an Outback, or something. Filling, but I think a few less metaphoric carbs would have helped this meal tremendously."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would like to see changes in the sellers industry...","review":"I can't say really, whether the book is awesome or not, as I didn't finish reading it. I would appreciate a rating system, much like the movie industry uses, that would let me know BEFORE I purchase an item if it may contain matter that I find objectionable. That way, I'd save my money for something that I would actually end up enjoying.This book contained extremely strong language, through out the first few chapters, so I didn't ready any further and couldn't tell you if it was great, or if it contained any other objectionable material."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"It was suggested to me that this book was really funny and very good. I wish that was the case. I found Julie Powell to be self indulgent and nasty. In the movie (which I saw first, and pretty much liked it) Julie asks her friend if she is a \\"b*tch\\" and her friend told her, of course you are. In the movie I couldn't see it, but in the book there is no doubt that she does live up to that unattractive title. Too bad, I was hoping to like this book, but did not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass on this, go directly to Julia Child","review":"I was very glad once I finished this book, it was the only book I have ever wanted to throw directly into the trash (which I did). Julie Powell is a lazy, whiney, high-maintenance, self-centered, self-absorbed, unappealing person. If her year of cooking was a year of self discovery, then it appears there was nothing there to discover. But then Julia was all about you and Julie is all about herself and I can find nothing in the book to provide a good reason for her self-absorption."},{"rating":"1","title":"read something else instead of this","review":"I had to quit this book halfway through - I just couldn't take it and justify wasting my time trying to read it. Such dribble - nothing funny about it. Just boring - the movie gets good reviews so I figured the book would be half decent. Not so... Spend your money on any other book and spare yourself!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Insipiring","review":"I didn't see the movie and do not plan to - I generally enjoy the book better. I love cooking and found this book inspirational - as in when attempting to do something one does not need a perfect outcome. There weren't a lot of English print books to choose from while I was vacationing in Italy but this was on the shelf. At ten euros it most definitely overpriced but I had only brought one novel that I too quickly finished.

On a trip back home to her parent's house, she finds a copy of Julia Child's Mastering the Art of French Cooking and comes up with a crazy idea. Over the course of one year, she is going to cook every recipe in the book and write a blog about it. This book is an extension of that blog and her experiences during the project.Julie is a humourous writer and does not glamourize her feelings, successes, and failures during the year of cooking. Some of the side stories about her friend's lives could have been shortened or left out, as I found myself losing interest in these parts. I would also have liked to read more about Julia Child as well, but overall, this is a fun read that really lets you get to know Julie....and way more about bone marrow and killing lobsters than you ever wanted to!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Julia good, Julie lackluster - 2 thumbs down","review":"I wish I hadn't spent $ seeing this since it did bash a political party, which I find divisive for our troubled country right now.

The movie catches the essence of what she went through in the book. There are some scenes in the book that were funny and didn't make it into the movie, but there are also a few gross stories that didn't make it into the movie, either. Overall, the writing was good, but I think I liked the movie better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Julie&Julie","review":"Disappointing read - with all the hype regarding the movie I thought it'd be fun to read before going to the movie. I didn't find the book very interesting. guess i thought there would be more about the trials of cooking Julia's recipes vs about Julie trying to pull a life together. I ended up skipping through to the end just to get the gist of it - and then relieved to move to another book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable Read","review":"I'm really surprised by the scathing reviews that have been posted here. Some people seem to forget that Julia Child is not the author of this book. This is a book about Julie and the impact Julia had on her life. Read \\"My Life in France\\" if you only want to know about Julia Child.I'm glad Julie was able to find solace and success in her cooking project while working at a stressful and thankless temp job. I thought this was a great memoir.The movie was a disappointment and didn't give Julie the depth of character that comes through in the novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing read.","review":"The author narrated some amusing scenes (Subway platform sticks out in my mind) but overall it was a joyless read. She continually gripes about everything imaginable (job, mother's prying, lack of intimacy) but does nothing productive to initiate change, creates and maintains filthy surroundings, and is a perpetual job for her husband in her needs to be reinforced, picked up, coddled, and cleaned up after. What a bleak picture of what it means to be a woman living in 21st century New York. This book was a good reminder to myself to read the reviews before buying!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Profanity abounds!","review":"I was, quite frankly, shocked at the language used! I saw the movie first and just loved it so I was not prepared for the liberal use of the \\"f\\" word and taking the Lord's name in vain so many times! I'm surprised that someone made a movie out of it! Sometimes swearing or cursing is part of the nature of a story and more or less expected - but it was totaly out of character for this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Julie is a poor substitute for Nora E","review":"Loved the movie so much I had to read both source books. Started with Julia's book and then moved to this one. I have never appreciated Nora Ephron so much until I saw what she did with this second class material. It plods along with not enough cooking as well as not enough life. Julie's most interesting scenes in the movie did not come from this book -- they were obviously Nora's creation. I did love the bits of Paul's (Child) letters that separated a few of the chapters. This books cries out for more Paul. I seem to remember reading a movie review that called for more Julia and less Julie. That goes triple at least for this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kinda Whiny","review":"I thought that the book was very whiny, another one of those, \\"I'm pushing thirty having a third of the way through life crisis!\\" books. I thought that the movie was excellent, but the book bored and depressed me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just not funny.","review":"I kept waiting for the \\"sparkling wit\\" that the cover blurb promised to show up. I would have settled for the \\"laughs out loud\\" other reviewers claimed to have. Unfortunately I didn't find either one. I had such high hopes for this premise, but by the end of the book I simply didn't care any more. I gave the book 2 stars because I loved the little bits about Julia. Julie was just boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother with this drivel","review":"I'm a self-proclaimed 'foodie', so I bought this book thinking I might try cooking some of Julia Child's recipes myself. What a disappointment! This is not about cooking at all. It's a self-absorbed, whiny, disjointed mess that I can't believe any publisher would bother with. Blogs, it seems, are the new 'Christmas-card updates' for people who think their lives are interesting to other people. Not so. Fortunately, the movie made ostensibly of this book is delightful. But feel free to take bathroom breaks any time poor Amy Adams comes on screen. She's a wonderful actress but can't bring to life this pitiful woman who could interest no one. Not everything needs to be chronicled."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Cooking Related Book - Good Whiny Self-Indulgence","review":"I read this book long before the movie came out. I enjoy cooking, watch some cooking programs, have read a biography of Julia Child, have used recipes from Mastering the Art of French Cooking, and so approached this book as an interesting discourse on food and life and Julia Child. In all those respects, the book is a failure. The author is not a particularly good cook, does not aspire to get any better, approaches the cooking as a challenge she sets for herself (much as one would memorize the periodic table of elements or read the entire OED), does not lead an interesting (even quirky interesting) life, and has no meaningful insights to offer the reader.I slogged through the book, thankful that I do not know her or her friends. On the other hand, I do wish I could have attended a meal with Julia and Paul Child."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't really care...for her or about her!","review":"You know...what a great story. I love the idea of challenging yourself to something crazy...something out of the box to get you out of a rut. But boy...I did NOT like Julie. She was...I can't really put my finger on it...unlikeable. She just really didn't have a good personality. I thought she treated her sweet hubby like a dog...and her mouth was just foul...and she could care less! I thought the way she talked about 9/11 was really crappy and she whined and cried so much I almost cheered when she was told Julia Child didn't care for her! I hope they make her movie character much nicer...it will be a hit then and fiction...but at least then people will like it! I'd pass on the book if you haven't read it and wait for the movie...hopefully Hollywood will add some magic to it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Self Involved Drivel","review":"So often you hear \\"The book was so much better than the movie\\", not the case for this book. Watch the movie, read Julia Child's autobiography \\"My Life in France\\" but don't waste money on this book.The author barely touches on Julia's actual influence upon this project. She's more interested in giving her friends permission to have affairs, drink too much, curse in every other paragraph, scream at her husband constantly, and give her political opinion on nothing at all.If how she treats her husband in the book is in any way reflective of how he was treated in real life then I don't understand how he stayed with her."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I LOVED the movie, so I bought the book....it was a great disappointment. The amazing movie writers did an amazing wonderful job of turning Julie Powells book into a fun movie. The Book is NOTHING like the movie. The book is foul mouthed trash.

If you liked the movie.... don't buy the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"One woman's story - a quick, fun read","review":"All of the 1 star people need to take a BREAK! This book hasn't changed my life, but it was an interesting take on someone setting a goal and meeting it - however arbitrary and supposedly trivial. The book is one woman's perspective, and if you don't like it, you won't like this book - just as with any book. She talks about being strongly opinionated politically, flipping out on her loving husband, and having a grubby kitchen - things many of us have done in one way or another. She describes how setting a goal related to something in life that she loves, rather than the job she is compensated for, frustrates and fulfills her. She finds her interests and talents later in life. Yes, she drinks, curses, and mocks strange and delusional suggestions related to the events of 9/11. She is not an insensitive, evil bitch - she is funny, irreverent, and has written a very funny book that is a quick and enjoyable summer read. Loved it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"oh, go ahead and read it!","review":"I thought it was hilarious. It was as crazy as if any of the rest of us mere mortals tried to cook all of Julia's recipes in a year. UGH!

I can't get into at all. . . no, I haven't finished it.I don't like the style. It is indulgent and somewhat crude at times. It isn't that I don't like the blog style; it is that the stream of consciousness style takes things so off subject most of the time that it is difficult to remember just what the point is.I wish I would have read a few reviews before I bought it.

This book is not about cooking. It's more about existential angst that results from a dead-end job. Even Julia (the real one), living at the time, when told about the project, sneered at the idea.

If you get through this book you'll see why I may have found myself enjoying it because I could identify with Julie Powell a bit; but it had great things to offer besides-things outside my realm.

The movie is much better than the book. This book spends way too much time on Julie and very little time on Julia Child. Thus, the book was quite disappointing. See the movie, don't waste money on this book, get it at the library. Also, the foul language in the book was soooooo unnecessary and offensive. This gal is no lady.

It is poorly written, uninteresting, sophomoric. I can't understand how more deserving authors routinely get their manuscripts turned down by publishers, but a waste of time like \\"Cooking Dangerously\\" makes it into print. I've heard it said that Julia Child was aware of Powell's blog but did not think very kindly of the venture because Powell never wrote about the food itself or about technique--she was interested only in publicity. I wish her well but hope her 15 minutes of fame are over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck, hate the use of Julia Child's good name...","review":"Julia was right to hate the use of her name by others, Julie Powell is the exact opposite of what Julia was."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enjoy a little poison with your food?","review":"Received this book as a gift and flipped through the pages for a quick preview. The first passage I read involved a leftover charlotte cake that the author carried to her workplace to share. Unfortunately she dropped the cake en route and the dish was smashed. She served the cake anyway, but went around the office to warn a select few (those who shared her political affiliation) to avoid the cake because it probably contained ceramic dish shards and traces of antifreeze from the street surface. I had to read this passage twice to confirm it was as horrifying as my first impression. Then I trashed the book. Normally I give away used books, but this one is too toxic to pass along. Why should anyone feed their mind with anything this person has to say? Why would anyone want to nourish their bodies with anything she prepares?

Frankly I am disappointed with the profanity in this book. I am not a fan of profanity and I do not read books with such. I wonder if I could resell my copy to Amazon. That's how i feel about the book. My money is wasted. Thank goodness the movie is much much much better and there was only one profane word said only once in the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK, but.........","review":"I enjoyed the book when she wasn't cursing, dissing conservatives, and obsessing about hers and everybody esle's sex life. No wonder Hollywood came calling....though I'm glad she found her passion."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth the read","review":"I began this book the day after I finished Julia Child's \\"My Life in France.\\" Julie Powell admits in the onset of the book that the \\"memoirs\\" of JC are often fiction. That is true and I find it an embarrassment to a great woman.Julie Powell is not a polished author and her prose is generally nothing more than what you would find in a silly, young woman's diary.Buy Julia Child's book, it IS worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"funny but disappointing","review":"The vapid prejudice was unappealing. Of course its ok to disagree with a set of political ideas. The blessing of America as we can all disagree openly. But to just randomly name \\"republicans\\" as the evil guys in the world in the name of humor is not funny and reveals prejudice...Too bad as the book surely has its funny bits. It rawly shares a vulnerability which has a real appeal."},{"rating":"1","title":"yuck","review":"Awful. Simply awful. In every possible way.

But even they become boring and trite after awhile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book I'vd read in a very long time!","review":"I picked up this book at the bookstore thinking it was another of those \\"chef teams up with Julia\\" things. As I read the blurb on the cover I was immediately intrigued so I bought it. I read the entire book in 2 days and LOVED it! I felt like Julie was me, or I am Julie. She has so many of my own issues and she is honest and unapolagetic about herself. Someone earlier was offended by the Republican bashing--so what? Get over it. I have the same copy of MtAoFC and I referred to it as she talked about the recipes. I have to agree that aspic is pretty nasty! But it had to be made to accomplish the goal. Long review short--I absolutely adored the book and am looking forward to anything else written by Julie Powell!!Jennifer Alamdari"},{"rating":"1","title":"Julie and Julia","review":"I desperately tried to like this book - in fact, when it arrived from Amazon (used - thank goodness), I couldn't wait until my baby was asleep to jump into bed to start reading it. However, after picking away at Julie and Julia for three nights, I finally had to put it away for good. I found it tedious and rather uninteresting, focusing more on the writer's unappealing life & friends than on cooking. Nice attempt, but overrated and a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is one time I'm certain the movie will be better than the book!","review":"I managed to get through the book, because it became my own insane Julie/Julia/Audrey project. What a waste of my time. I really don't recall any \\"laugh out loud\\" moments as promised by the press release. I don't even like the author very much. Only at the second (or was it third) ending did I hold out any hope that Santa finally delivered Julie Powell's much overdo maturity. I was hoping for some more parallels to Julia Child. For that, I blame the movie hype (which made me want to read the book in the first place). I'm certain that Nora Ephron's magic will save this tale - in fact, I'm counting on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Now I Understand","review":"Now I understand why Julia Child had nothing personally to do with Julie Powell's project. I began reading this afternoon. I stopped 25% of the way through. I did not want to waste any more of my time. Julia Child had class. Julie Powell does not.The language the author uses ruins any enjoyment of descriptions of the dishes. Any reference to Julia Child is a lame attempt at transfer."},{"rating":"1","title":"There is a marketing problem here......","review":"I think in general this book attracts \\"foodies\\" when they hear of the \\"project\\" or if they picked it up in a bookstore and flipped through the jacket. And my wife got it for me for xmas because she knows I love to cook and figured I would like this.The fact is that it should not be marketed to foodies and in general foodies will not like this book. It obviously has significant amount of text devoted to cooking but it is not the majority - the majority is devoted to the unlikeable Julie and her generally unlikeable friends. I think the biggest challenge here is that one gets no sense that Julie likes cooking or food in general - and is engaged in this project for reasons wholly unrelated to food/cooking.So for me a huge disappointment- and for other foodies - you can skip it.Lastly I was very surprised to find out the author was from Texas. I would have guessed New Jersey or Long Island."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Child and not a Reichel -- what is this?","review":"As an avid cookbook and memoir reader, this had great promise -- as did Miriam's Kitchen for example, which it delivered -- but this was not a good read, not a good insight except into continual expression of frustration about vocation, living conditions, lack of culinary background or skill, . . . good venting, poor reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"I skimmed through this book, but finally closed it for good when","review":"she compared trussed chickens to sex crime victims. I mean really, I suppose that's an attempt at humor, but I still found it offensive. Do yourself a favor, skip the book and spend some time reading the 1 and 2 star ratings here. They are more entertaining and better written than anything Ms. Powell has put together."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I was so disappointed in this book, and the fact that I spent good money on it! Loved the movie, and am so grateful it wasn't peppered with expletives. By page 45, I'd had enough of the author's foul language, and threw the book out. No, I won't give it away, because I cannot recommend it. In addition to the offensive language, the author's excessive use of long parenthetical and wordy descriptions became difficult to wade through: too many extraneous details! The last two pages of the book sum up the author's petty and self-centered view of life and death; but that is what happens \\"when you don't believe in heaven...\\"Julie & Julia"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stinks like bad fish!","review":"The author is annoying and I couldn't finish the book. However this influenced me to rush out and get \\"My Life in France\\" and \\"Mastering the Art of French Cooking.\\" I also have \\"Appetite for Life\\" which is Julia Child's biography. READ My Life in France. It is Julia Child's voice, and warm and wonderful.I am disappointed because I really wanted to like this book, since I love Julia Child....since Nora Ephron is doing the screenplay for the film, maybe it will be worth it.I can't imagine Nora even liking this girl Julie. Let's hope the movie is a good one...Meryl Streep and Stanley Tucci....with actors like that, I have hope.I gave Ms Powell the one star because she pushed me to go out and get the other books, and those I love. So I thank her for that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Julie is a whiner who doesn't like to cook!","review":"I only read 2/3 of this \\"memoir.\\" Before reading I was intrigued by the concept - the author cooking the recipes of Julia Child. Sounds like potential for amusement. I agree with many of the negative reviews below that this is a self-absorbed, whiney author. I found each chapter repetitive - drinking her gimlets, not having sex with her husband, her try-too-hard-to-be-eccentric friends. This book is a case in point that a popular-blog-does-not-a well-written, well-conceived-book-make. I would recommend Ruth Reichl's memoirs or Peter Mayle's tales of French food and experiences. Or Julia Child's \\"My Life in France\\" (haven't read that one, but it has *got* to be better than this.) This book is a poor choice for a reader, a foodie or anyone who abhors whining."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've read one third of the book, and then dumped it.","review":"I liked the idea of the book's basis; that is, blogging about learning French cooking by using Julia Child's book about French cooking. But I couldn't stand the author's personality style as it came through in her writing. It's not so much that she uses the F-word a great deal, but the fact that she is a whiney, crybaby, mean-spirited person. I feel sorry for her husband for having to put up with her histrionics. My copy is the paperback of 300 pages, and after having read the first 100 pages I cannot take any more of her. I've never felt this way about a book before, but it makes me angry. Sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"The movie has to be better than this","review":"I am about half way through this book. I expected to love it, but don't and cannot decide whether to keep on or dump it. A few days later.......... Ok, I did finish it and it never got better. In fact, it got worse. Julie goes on and on about her friends, spends most of her time drunk, lives in an apt that should be condemmed and is NEVER cleaned, then is shocked when she ends up with maggots, yes MAGGOTS, in her kitchen. Please don't bother with this book. Can't believe I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed!","review":"I was expecting more about Julie's experiences making and eating the recipes of Julia. What I got was a disjointed and profanity laden book which had little to do with Julia's recipes. Not being a prude by any means, I enjoy profane humor - if done with style however Julie seemed to use profanity more for the shock value. Over all the book was disappointing and since I don't like to waste time it won't get finished. On to the used book store!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing at Best, Offensive at Worst","review":"The movie was great, and I'm amazed that anyone read this book and turned it into workable movie material. While some material is funny, her excessive use of profanity is not clever, and her political opinions are unnecessary. I thought it would be a humorous book about cooking adventures instead of an adventure through neuroses.By the way, on behalf of all conservatives, thank you for letting us know how much you hate us and for alienating me as your reader. I'm not even a Republican, but rather a Libertarian, which I am sure makes me even more greedy and uncompassionate in your eyes, but your outspoken disgust of all conservatives makes it easy for me to not waste money on any of your other literary endeavors.Now, go apologize to someone for the money you've made."},{"rating":"1","title":"For once, the movie was better.","review":"I purchased this book after seeing, and truly enjoying, the movie. Unfortunately, my favorite elements of the movie were completely absent from the book. I did enjoy thinking about preparing many of the dishes from MtaoFC as I read, but I continually missed the movie's lovely connections to Julia Child's history and her development as a chef, writer, and teacher.In reflection, it seems to me that Julie Powell fell into a project that captured the imagination of many, and which had a profound impact on her own life. That project, however, did not make her a good writer or an inspiring person. The screenplay writers, on the other hand, accomplished both these goals and made me want to buy Julia Child's MtaoFC, read more about her biography, and cook for my friends and family.Julia captured my interest; Julie, not so much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dazed and Confused","review":"I had such high hopes for this book and I was looking forward to reading Julie and Julia. Now that I have started it I'm forcing myself to finish it. I'm so disappointed in the book I don't even know where to start. First let me say that I am a TEXAN and I love Julia Child, I grew up watching her on PBS, and this book is a Total let down. I didn't expect to read about Julie's childhood or her issues with her husband and family. I thought I was going to read a diary of sorts. I'm confused as to why everyone has ranted and raved about this book. I'm more than halfway through the book and as I read on my eyes glaze over and my mind drifts and I have to force myself to concentrate on reading...I just hope I make it to the end. If you want a good read, read Amanda Hesser's \\"Cooking for Mr. Latte\\", she talks about Julia Child and it's a great book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Taste\\"-less","review":"Poor Julia Child, she deserved a better tribute. Powell is just profane. It isn't the potty mouth so much - just, ick, the joyless, self-referencing, cynical, bedhopping, person-trashing, mother-blaming, aren't-I-funny New Yorkishness of it all. Julia Child was encouraging and uplifting and full of fun. Julie seems to be the antithesis, and it sucks the appreciation from the whole project. Hope the movie is way better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meanspirited woman","review":"The writing was okayish... But these details from the novel really turned me against the writer. A woman who laments that her life is not like her friends because she's (gasp) married and not having wild sex with all sorts of men and woman, states she loves her husband like a pig loves shot, complains (repeatedly) that she's a failed actress turned secretary when she admits she never attempted acting really speak to a woman who is very immature. Another example- she accidentally drops a very nice dessert before coming into her office. She places the dessert in the breakroom with a sign stating help yourself and then proceeds to tell those people who she knows to share her political ideology that the dessert might contain glass shards and antifreeze."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leave out the swearing please!!!!!","review":"This book would have been ten times better (and half as long) if she had stuck to her cooking experiences. I could completely do without her foul mouth and her completely unrelated rantings about politics and sex. This book had great potential, but doesn't deliver. I fervently hope the movie version takes out the garbage and only keeps the good stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of time and money","review":"A book as messy and nasty as some of the authors unsuccessful attempts at Julia Child's recipes. Is there anyone so self absorbed as \\"Julie\\", so mean and abusive to her husband and coworkers, she would actually feed a left over desert possibly contaminated with shards of glass and antifreeze to coworkers. You actually come to despise Julie and wish the butter ladden recipes would clog her arteries!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great movie, not so great book","review":"Well, this was quick. I usually read to page 100 before stopping, but frankly, I have so many books in my TBR pile, I am getting pickier. I can see where this book might be a fun movie to attend, but as for reading, I found Julie an unbearable character, with no depth, another gen-xer. The writing was easy reader 101 and I was just bored. I don't want to be bored, I want a book to grab me and not let go, I want to forget that my bottom is sore from sitting too long. I want to forget that it is 2 am. This book would never do that. So, I put it down at page 63.I do, however think this will be a fun movie to see and plan on doing just that!"},{"rating":"1","title":"SEE THE MOVIE. SKIP THIS BOOK.","review":"I won't even go into detail. Suffice to say this book is written by a so called \\" writer\\". The book is poorly written as is but to top it off the author is a self absorbed, negative, whiny, humorless and thoughtless woman. I am an upbeat person and felt depression settling in as I was reading it. Juia Child has class.......... read her story. If you feel the need to read JULIE&JULIA don't waste a cent, get it from the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure Dreck...","review":"Insufferable. F-bombs, profanity and vulgarity spices this piece of dreck about a whiny, non-stop kvetching excuse in a pseudo-literary exercise. Is it any wonder Mrs. Childs wanted nothing to do with this. This is about the author, her trials and tribulations blogged. It is NOT about the wonderful Julia Childs. If you loved the movie, DON'T read this book. You got a sense of the author in the movie, and thankfully only that. She rode Julia's apron strings to hopefully, only 15 minutes of fame. Nothing further redeemable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better as a Blog","review":"The premise had promise. The execution was shallow, narcissistic, and naive. In short, it brandished every hallmark of the blog it once was.But, let me be clear: I actually would have loved it as a blog. From a book, I craved more thoughtful prose and structural and thematic sophistication."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not at all what I expected","review":"I loved the movie and looked forward to reading the book. It was not at all what I expected. The movie was a wonderful parallel of their lives, and was sensitive, funny, and tasteful. The book was trashy at best. I loved the Julie in the movie, and disliked the one portrayed in the book. Very little time was spent on her cooking adventure and much was spent on her trashy friend's sex lives, her drinking adventures and bashing the Republican party. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who Cares?","review":"I bought this book at full price at the local bookstore because I couldn't wait to read it. I am a long time fan of Julia Child and have used her cookbooks for years. Reading her books as one would a novel, I learned a great deal about cooking and ingredients in my early 20's.I am so disappointed. I find it impossible to read further about this woman's life (Ms. Powell's). It is a rambling story about her life with only a sprinkling of Ms. Child. The author is a 20 or 30-something living in New York with a rather mundane and unsatisfying existence. I feel she peddled her story on Ms. Child's good reputation and life; and, in turn, did a huge diservice to Ms. Child. Shame on Ms. Powell.But, at least she got out of her lousy secretary job...with our money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring - and overrated","review":"I think my title pretty much sums it up. The author's writing style isn't great - she stumbles over her words here and there. And there's not enough information about the recipes or even what she cooked in a general sense. I've just spent ten pages on stuff cooked in aspic! And the bits that are meant to be Julia's diary are plain weird - I'm completely skipping them, and can't wait to get to the end of the book.Massively overrated, I'm afraid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Now I understand","review":"I saw the movie and really enjoyed it (other than the needless profanities and slams at Republicans). When I saw the movie I could not understand why Julia Child did not approve of Julie Powell's efforts and blogging. I thought that perhaps given her advanced age, she did not understand what Julie was doing. I was wrong. Now I understand completely why Julia Child did not approve of Julie Powell and her efforts. Amy Adams plays a much kinder Julie in the movie than the real Julie does in her book. The Julie Powell in this book is a self-absorbed, profane woman who seems more concerned with complaining than cooking. If you enjoyed the movie and have not read the book, I would advise you to skip the book and enjoy the fantasy the movie put forward. Reading the book is liable to ruin the experience of the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasn't horrible, but still a let down","review":"I love to cook, and I'm also almost 30, so when I picked this book up at a bookstore at Grand Central Station a couple of months back, I was excited to read it. I read the first chapter and wasn't impressed, so I didn't come back to it for months, until I finally broke down and finished it last weekend amongst laundry loads.Like the other reviewers, I found the book to be very little about cooking, and more about a rather immature perspective on what seems to be a life with little to complain about. I didn't get the impression that Julie even LIKED to cook, so that kinda bothered me, since I thought it would be more of a celebration. She frankly struck me as someone with too much time on her hands who took on the \\"Project\\" merely for something to do.It was ok, and an easy read, but very self-indulgent and precocious."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big disappointment!!!","review":"After seeing the film, I looked forward to reading the book it was based on. I loved the movie! Unfortunately, I can't say the same about the book. Usually, the book is better than the movie, but not in this case.I don't know how Powell was able to get this thing published, except that it was a novelty at the time. The writing is poor, and rambles on about nothing in particular. Not to mention the fact that her use of vulgarity is unnecessary and used way too often to suit any reader. Unlike the movie, the books dosen't go into the preparation of meals and the humor in preparing them. The only light present were the excerpts from Julia Child's life.All I can say in closing is stick with the movie. If you like the movie, don't read the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful book","review":"This book was almost unreadable it was written so badly. Julia Child herself criticizes Julie Powell in this book! Julie leads a shiftless life where she drinks too much and whines constantly. It was so badly written I found myself skimming parts just to finish it. I am so glad I didn't buy the book, but checked it out at the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Julia Child Turns Over in Grave!","review":"The premise is good...but the book was terrible. Plus this woman has the mouth of a truckdriver. I'm sure that Julia Child is turning over in her grave."},{"rating":"1","title":"read some of the book before buying","review":"I thought the premise for this book was very good, and I bought it with the intent to read it and share it with friends. However, I returned the book for a refund after reading less than half of the story.The main character in the story was constantly swearing or crying. The cleanliness of the kitchen was questionable, which was making me lose my appetite for the French food being prepared. The only eggs I want to read about in a book about cooking are the kind that come from hens. I really did not want to know that the main character was able to pay off her credit cards by selling her own eggs - twice! Parts of the story describe the main character's job near Ground Zero as an impatient and unsympathetic secretary at an agency that assisted families of the victims of 9/11.My advice to readers is to read a good portion of this book in a bookstore before you decide to purchase it, especially if you intend to give this book as a gift."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just a 1/2 star book really","review":"Luckily I didn't pay full price...but even at a couple dollars in the used section...I overpaid. I honestly don't know how this woman has any friends..or a nice husband.It took me quite a while to finish as I had to keep putting it down and walking away from it. I found most of it very annoying. But...I finished and then threw it in the trash. I've purchased a few other books that met that fate...and this was just another one that truly belonged there.If you really wish to torture yourself...go to a garage sale or used book store and buy it. Don't pay more than $1...as it's hardly worth that. You also may wish to drink as heavily as she does while reading. It might help.Can it be this easy to get published?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch the movie instead","review":"This was one of the most poorly written books I have ever read. I wanted to read the book before I watched the movie. Just when you think it is getting good it goes back to why am I reading this.The movie was great. Take some writing classes Ms Powell."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bad case of \\"potty pen\\"","review":"I don't actually own this book. I took it out from my local library at no cost at all, read about 30 pages or so, and decided that I did not enjoy Ms. Powell's writing style.The main problem with her writing is that she likes to use salty language throughout, which I don't like at all. I really wanted to like this book, but even overlooking the bad language, I just could not relate well to it. I'm just glad I did not spend good money on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Offensive","review":"I stopped reading after 40 pages. I expected this to be light and enjoyable, but the language was offensive, and I don't just mean the f word."},{"rating":"1","title":"I feel bad for her husband!","review":"For reasons unknown, Julie Powell embarks on a year long journey of cooking every recipe from Mastering the Art of French Cooking. At the end of that year, there is no growth, maturity, desire to become a chef....nothing redeeming. Julie is now just psyched that she got a book deal. I found this book very difficult to enjoy. I kept thinking how awful her husband must have felt when he read this, as she speaks so terribly about him. Read 'My Life in France' by Julia Child instead. It's a real contribution to the literary world from someone who earned and deserved her book deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh, lighten UP, folks!","review":"I liked this little venture into one woman's obsession. She wasn't trying to write Larousse's Gastronomique, for heaven's sake. It's just a fun little chicklit type of memoir. Quirky and cute. Just don't look for big a big emotional work of art or for a cooking how-to. Go aloong for the ride and enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Messy, disastrous, and wonderful","review":"Delightful! Powell has a natural, anecdotal voice that draws you into her chaotic life. She's even able to present her impulsive decision to cook all of the recipes from Julia Childs' \\"Mastering the Art of French Cooking\\" as a sort of valiant last stand against the increasing mediocrity of her life. Powell lays out the ensuing year of culinary obsessiveness in all of its messy detail. This is a great read if you're at all interested in Molly Ivans-style wit or the down-to-the-wire suspense of an episode of Iron Chef."},{"rating":"1","title":"Narcissistic Blather","review":"What a self-involved twit the author is. She catalogs her drunken stupidity and her friends' adultery while pretending cooking Julia Child's recipes is her \\"raison d'etre.\\" The book is full of self celebratory information and demeans the poor author's husband and his seemingly unending patience. What a lucky break Ms. Powell has had, Too bad it is undeserved, if this book is evidence of her worthiness of fame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad book.... Bad Movie","review":"I don't get it... What did Julie do that was so amazing? Write a blog? I read the biography of Julia Child years ago, my wife and mother used her book for cooking as well as studied in France.The movie would have had been much better without Julie, it seems like a strange twisted obsession on Julie's part, a means to create publicity and make money.I would not recommend the book nor movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deeply Disappointed in the book!","review":"Sad to say I was deeply disappointed in Julie Powell's book, \\"Julie & Julia.\\" After attending the theatre on two different occasions to see the movie, the movie left me with an appetite to buy the book. Unfortunately, Julie Powell chose to pepper the book with an infinite number of vulgarness including the \\"f\\" word countless times.As a writer myself, I know characters, plot, and a great story can be crafted without the constant use of profanity. I chose not to even finish the book due to the enormous amount of offensive use of profanity. Many other good books await my time and energy to explore.I regret having purchased the book. Next time, I'll stick to borrowing at the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Believe it for a Minute!","review":"I cook as a hobby when my diet and my budget can afford it. I do not believe this book or the blog for one minute! A young woman living over a pizzeria working a full time job would not have the money or the time needed to create an average of TWO complicated and expensive recipes every day for a year. Just one cheesecake costs me about $15.00 and three hours of my time, not to mention blowing my diet. She's invented the whole thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch the movie instead","review":"The movie was pretty good. The book left me feeling violated, like I needed a hot shower with a strong soap. I don't blame Julia Child for the way she felt. Had I been Julia, I would have sued to keep my good name from being connected with this piece of work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!","review":"I slogged through this book, waiting, hoping for it to get good...there are brief flashes of wit, but I can't get around the author's vulgar language and hateful outlook on life. What a bummer!Thankful I picked this one up at the library instead of wasting money on it. If you must read it, I suggest you do the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too bad one can not give an 0 star rating","review":"I bought this book based on the rave revues of the movie. I had not seen the movie as I prefer to read a book then view the movie.I seldom stop reading a book once begun, but I quit this one and returned it about chapter 4. What a waste of time, print and paper!Julie is a whining obnoxious woman and not even the parts about Julia could redeem this book in my mind. The little I read of the book has left me with no desire to see the movie even though I have heard they smooth out the Julie character for the screen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love Julia, not Julie","review":"I really thought I would LOVE this book, but Julie Powell's attitude towards 9-11 victim families and the people pouring out their hearts with ideas for a memorial made me sick. It is the typical liberal elitist attitude toward people she considers the \\"unsophisticated\\" or the so-called \\"great unwashed\\" that really could have been left out of this book. Also the nasty attitude towards co-workers who were Republican (I mean who cares?) feeding them dessert you dropped on the street with possible shards of glass? Really? I thought compassionate was the mantra, all I saw was ugly. Not suprised Julia didn't like this blog, also glad I bought this book used so no profits went to the author-I'm sure she wouldn't want any of my blue-collar money anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Cooking Memoir","review":"This memoir is perfect for anyone with any interest in cooking. You'll enjoy the humor and the imagined conversations with Julia Child"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible book","review":"The concept of this book made it sound like a fun book to read.However, I couldn't get past the second or third chapter. It has to be one of the worst books I've ever read. The author is more interested in whining about her own life, uses profanity more than I prefer (especially in a book which is supposed to be about cooking), and frankly wasn't very interesting.Read My Life In France if you want to learn more about Julia. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Only so I could see the movie","review":"I bought the book when the movie first came out. I always promise myself that I will try to read a book before I see the movie if I think it will be worth the effort. The book did make me want to take a cooking class and definitely made me laugh a few times but I think it was a little long. I was getting tired of the author at the end with her bitching.

Do NOT bother seeing the movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Satisfied","review":"The book is interesting but has far too much profane language for an older conservatve reader. I find it difficult to believe that Julie Powell actually talks the way it is written"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute, Engaging, and a Fun Read for any Julia Child Fan","review":"When I started reading this book, I honestly wasn't thrilled at first. It seemed to me the writer was trying too hard to be humorous and spent too much time thinking up clever witticisms instead of focusing on the content. But as the book progressed, she seemed to relax into her writing and it became far more fun for the reader. The pacing is a bit uneven here and there, and yes, she does take us off on unrelated tangents occasionally; in the end, however, it only adds to the endearing quality of this unabashed and heartfelt tribute to the greatest cook in American history.I admire Julie Powell's courage in tackling a project of this magnitude - as a long-time Julia Child devotee, I was relieved to see someone else had the same *&^%$ struggles with marrowbone that I did - and, although Julie, her husband, or her family might curse me for even suggesting it, I wouldn't be disappointed if she decided to tackle MtAoFC, Vol. 2."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK","review":"What does flithy language and sex have to do with French cooking? I thought this would be an interesting book about cooking. French food is to be respected. Julie Powell has no class. The book has many references about sex. She is immature and very disrespectful to Julia Child. I wish I could give this book away but I purchased the Kindle version. Please don't buy this book. If you want to be inspired about French cooking buy a cookbook."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fraudulent Book & Author with no Talent","review":"This book is a fraud. This woman has no talent, which explains why she could not make it in her chosen field. If not for disgusting sexual inuendos, cursing, degrading her husband, \\"friends\\" or members on the Republican party, there would be nearly nothing between the covers. If people knew what this book was actually about before reading it, they wouldn't. This is the only book I have ever bought that I will be going back to the store for a refund. This is coming from a woman who is a trial lawyer, a mom, member of two book clubs and can never get enought reading. Skip this garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE WASTE OF TIME","review":"I bought the book even after I read all the negative reviews, but guess what? They were all right!!! This book is a complete waste of time, it's just a blog, it should have been just a short story, because it's not entertaining, it's not special, the writer is just an egocentric woman with no direction and worst of all, with no writing skills.Please, go buy something else, and don't waste your time with this book.If you want really entertaining books about cooking, chefs, etc., buy something by Anthony Bourdain! He does rock!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Julie Powell could never walk in Julia Child's shoes","review":"The movie Julie & Julia was charming, really teaching me to love Julia Child's cooking and her hard work. This book, and Julie Powell, however, are a waste of time. The script for the movie takes huge leaps to improve her and make her likable. What's more, take five minutes to read her blog and you will see she is a prejudiced, mean spirited, selfish kind of gal. Her temper tantrums in the movie are fully representative of her true self. She curses like a sailor, despises people who dont agree with her, and is NOT the gal represented in the movie. She should take a job ministering to others, then maybe she could learn to write (and live)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable read","review":"Got through the book quite quickly as its an easy and enjoyable read. It inspired me to cook more French recipes and not fret about it too much. I do feel however that the swearing was slightly unnecessary and annoying - but if that's who she is, then at least it is authentic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Developed my interest in Julia Child","review":"I read this book because I saw the film which I loved. I was also interested because I thought the book would be a lot like the film and both characters would be represented as in the film. It wasn't. Julia was barely in the book at all. At last I gave up and only read half of it. The one good thing about it is, it encouraged me to buy the book Julia Child: My Life in France, which I really liked.The book is all about Julie and her friends with some writing now and then about preparing food that sounds very unappetizing. There is little about the Julia part of the story. In fact, nothing about the book seem to make much sense to me. It's all about life with Julie, which most of the time is very confusing and often unpleasant. I didn't understand the comments which found the book \\"laugh out loud\\" \\"very funny\\" or a \\"marvel\\". I just found them boring and tedious. But the movie was very good, totally different and quite a lot of fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Running out of gas","review":"I just don't know if I can make it to the end with this one.

I wish I read the reviews before I bought this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing like the movie","review":"Pretty disappointed with this book after watching the movie. A lot of times the book is much better than the movie, in this case, it was the exact opposite. A big part of this is the excessive use of profanity. Don't let your kids pick this up around the house. Needless to say, we took this copy out of circulation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Struggle to get half way through","review":"I expected the book to be more charming focusing on trials/triumphs of food and disappointed didn't at leastoffer up a few recipes. I went to the halfway point thinking it was going to get better but skimmed ahead thenabandoned it altogether. I would agree with most of the other reviewsthat this is very disappointing and focused too much on sex antidotes of everyone in the book--it was embarrassing.And the constant vulgar language was overbearing. See the movie-skip the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful","review":"Mmmm...Biography & Memoirs? or Cooking, Food & Wine? A little of both. But it really doesn't matter what this book is about because Julie Powell can write. The account of her self-appointed task to prepare all the recipes in Julia Child's Mastering the Art of French Cooking never bogs (blogs?) down; she weaves into her book stories of Julia's introduction to cooking and her own bouts with infertility and her friends' relationship ups and downs as well as, of course, her experiments with French cooking. Delightful."},{"rating":"1","title":"One thing Julie DIDN'T learn from Julia: class.","review":"I have to agree with the one-star reviews and join the folks who just couldn't make it past the self-absorbtion, whines, and pointless vulgarity. I gave up at page 45. What kind of foodie makes comments like \\"I never eat carrots\\" and \\"then we got the eggs?\\" After all her research on and idolization of Julia, Julie still doesn't understand what it means to have true class. She's just another foul-mouthed blogger."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not For Me","review":"I saw the movie first and it ruined the book for me. (usually the other way around) My advice is to see the movie! Too much of the F-word and yucky detail of peoples sex lives. I did not finish the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Couldn't Finish It","review":"It wasn't well-written, it wasn't well-organized, the narrator's personality didn't appeal to me. I just couldn't read more about her ungrateful whining about how bad her job is (without her government job there would be no sticks of butter to cook with--that's how life is) and her too-intimate details about how her crazy her friends are. Just sounded like a blog I'd probably never read, and a whole lot less recipes than I expected.But the movie was super-good. Amy Adams, and otherwise beautiful actress, reduced herself to a homely tomboy yet still made the character likeable (unlike in the book) and Meryl Streep, of course, made an excellent Julia. This is a credit to their acting skills.Don't read the book, not even if you get it for free. Just watch the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe I spent money on the hardcover version","review":"I was excited to purchase this book and read about the daunting task of cooking through Mastering the Art of French Cooking. It was one of the worst books I have ever read. The author is a whining, self-centered, profane individual-no wonder Julia Child refused to connect with her. Living near Santa Barbara, many of us have had contact with Mrs. Child, and her joy of life and courtesy to all came across beautifully. The movie was good-the premise of cooking through French Cooking great-I bet Julia Child would have loved to meet the movie's more likeable and gracious character. I had to stop reading this horrible, trashy book not quite half-way through, then skimmed the ending. Sad"},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely lacks taste!!!","review":"I am an avid reader. I have read numerous books ranging from biographies, to vampire books, and then there's this book which quite frankly in my opinion makes Ron Jeremy look like a child's cartoon character. The ridiculous overuse of profanity in this book caused me to put the book down for good after only reading 1/3 of it. In my opinion, Julie Powell would have done better writing a satanic pornography book rather than a book about her journey with Julia Child's Mastering The Art Of French Cooking. I was greatly disappointed and I have to admit that just reading this 1/3 of the book, I'm not going to rush to the nearest theater to see the movie. I will wait and rent it and hope for the best. I also did not like the fact that Julie made derogatory comments about the mourners of those lost in the 9/11 attacks. It's one thing to not agree with your government, but by making a mockery of it, that is simply unpatriotic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could not finish","review":"I was not expecting this to be great literature or anything, but I at least thought it might be a breezy, fun summer read. I was wrong. This book is SO tedious. I found myself skipping entire sections, hoping that the story would pick up. It never did, and I finally put it down around page 50 or so. Powell is just not a good writer at all. Blogging about dinner is probably right up her alley as a writer. I saw the movie which was thankfully much, much better. The movie took out all the parts of the book that just didn't do anything for me, like her brother \\"Heathcliff\\" and her dad's birthday dinner. As a reader, you wonder why she includes all that stuff. It just seemed like \\"filler\\" to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Julie and Julia: 365 days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment","review":"What a disapointment.

Julie is incredibly whiny, and it seemed every other page she was ready to give up her project. Please, do!

The type of book that's great to escape into... grabs you from the beginning and leaves you smiling at the end.Julie is easy to recognize (she's a little bit of all of us) and her adventure into French culinary cooking is hysterical. I'm now looking forward to seeing how they capture the essence of this charming book on screen.The only bad part about this book is I kept getting hungry! Will now have to dig up some Julia Childs cook books and whip up a few treats (and laughs, I'm sure) of my own."},{"rating":"2","title":"I thought it was funny!","review":"Yes, Julie whines, but it's because her life is at a standstill! Who hasn't been in a situation in life where things get stagnant? I agree that the way she wrote about 9/11 was a little insensitive - it was cringe-worthy. But, c'mon, anyone who dares to plow their way through a cookbook such as this one, probably the best ever written, has to get some kudos! I have to admit that while reading the segment with the maggots had me laughing 'til I was crying. My only hope is that the movie doesn't make Julia Child look foolish. I hope she is portrayed as the smart, talented, remarkable woman she was. My only regret is that I didn't stand in line at the bookstore when Julia was signing copies of her last book. My loss. I want Julie Powell to keep writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does Not Live Up to Its Reputation","review":"This book was so horrid that I could not finish it. Instead of being the charming story that it is purported and promises to be, the novel is filled with profanity, disparages her poor husband, and describes, among every other vice, how the author is addicted to pornography as a child. It was so incredibly repulsive that I had to put it away and has even tainted my view of the film. If you want a good read about cooking and chefs, stick to Julia Child and Alex Prud'homme."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice idea for a book, terrible writing","review":"I am an enthusiastic amateur cook, who also loves to read. However, having grown up in US I admit I never heard of Julia Child until I married and moved here (my mother-in-law is a big fan). I thought the basis for the book to be a very clever idea, and I can see how it would be an interesting blog. Unfortunately, rather early on in the book, I found the writing to be of a rather humdrum quality. There were flashes of good writing, but they were too few and far between to sustain interest. I struggled as much as I could, but I couldn't finish it. This is the quality of writing that makes me think anyone can get a book deal - maybe even me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Self Indulgent Drivel","review":"I thought the book was going to be a fun to read chronicle of a the author's cooking experiment. Wrong. She describes selling her eggs like someone else might describe holding a garage sale to raise a few extra bucks. When she described a very disturbing scene that involved a deranged woman deliberately and publically bashing her head into the concrete, and then managed to turn it into a self indulgent pity party for herself without skipping a beat, I closed the book and took it back to the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very disappointing book...","review":"I had high hopes when first picking up this book. I had seen it before on the shelves, before the movie previews started on TV, but I passed it up. After seeing how cute the movie looked and seeing it was a film by Nora Ephron, the woman behind the great films Sleepless in Seattle and You've Got Mail, then I decided to give it a try. I started to read the book, got into it, maybe 50 pages in thinking, \\"This is cute, I think I'm going to like this.\\" I then started reading further into it and was very disappointed. Not only was it very long and boring, but the author has the tendency to not translate the meaning of what she's cooking, since all of the recipes have French names. Bless you if you can get through this book. I am an avid reader and usually will read almost anything but this wasn't something I could. Watch out for another book she has coming out in December called 'Cleaving', a more detailed of the same story told in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow service!!!!!!","review":"It took almost a month to get the book and it was not quite what I expected.

How dare this Woman use Julia Child to promote her hatred towards our President of the United States and the Republican party! I honestly tried to overlook her constant bashing of Republican but when I got to page 191 where she insulted more then half of America by calling Republicans \\"Pure Evil\\". I took that personally since I am a Republican and did this Author realise she just insulted over 50% of the population who voted in the last election for President Bush? I guess she didn't care. I've decided to throw this woman's book away, actually I think I will take great pleasure in ripping it up into a million pieces then burn it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I thought this was a pretty bitter screed that was more about her life and self-absorbed (as well as self-indulgent) negativity than Julia Child or food. I was also embarrassed for this woman's husband, whose dirty laundry was aired in a book ostensibly about cooking. I was really disappointed with the whining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated this book! Don't bother - it's horrible","review":"This book is not at all about cooking or Julia Child. This Julie Powell loves to swear which I find very offensive. I couldn't read more than a chapter before I threw the book away. Not worth donating, I wouldn't want anyone else to read this book. It's too bad that she made some money from the sale of this book. I bet that most of the people that bought this book would take a refund if they could.

This woman admitted to working for the government (yes, you and I paid her salary) and bashing the very folks who called in for sympathy or help, including those who lost loved ones on 9-11. Disgraceful... bashes Republicans... obviously another liberal freak who fills the book with low life comments about sex toys and dildos... at least the pages at the beginning (I couldn't stomach any more than about 60 pages)..The worst of all? In the paperback I bought for 13 cents at a library book sale, the first three pages are just full of fabulous paragraphs reviews recommending this book for all to read... our society's sure messed up when literary 'experts' can read and then recommend this trash... Mine goes right where it belongs.. in the dumpster."},{"rating":"2","title":"Okay book, better film","review":"The book is okay .. always interesting, but Julie's a bit tiresome with her incessent drinking and swearing, she reminds me of a teenage boy .. ho hum.

Britney Spears is the most recognized female in the western hemisphere. Bring on the movie, I guess. I'm certain it will be a hit.I have disposed of this book.

I purchased it at an independent bookstore, and didn't read it for several years. When I finally got around to it . . . well, all I can say is that I was fairly entertained. I can't imagine why anyone would actually WANT to cook that much! But I was entertained, if a little grossed out, by the story. I haven't been able to eat lobster since, and have eaten very little chicken. But I did go out and buy a lot of butter, and cooked with it more often. I don't know what that says -- all those recipes, and the thing that appealed to me was cooking with butter . . . maybe I am just not attracted to French cooking . . .I think I'll skip the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the hype","review":"I picked this up because I heard about it endlessly on NPR and trusted them to direct me to a great book. I was sadly disappointed. Julie Powell tried to tie together a series of disparate blogs into a meaningful and humorous account of a year but didn't succeed very well; I felt like I was bouncing from one story to another to another without any strong connections between them and, unfortunately, there wasn't much humor or well-rounded characters to make up for it (Julie, the one fully fleshed character, was more annoying that sympathetic). I don't recommend this at all. Believe it or not, I'm sure the movie will be better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sliver tongued author","review":"The idea and the book was a great.

The rest of the \\"1\\" reviews will suffice for explanation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rare case where the book is NOT better than the movie","review":"I got the book after having watched the movie twice. Nora Ephron's movie makes Julie Powell out to be a quirky, fun person who takes on a daunting task, perseveres through many challenges, and learns life lessons from following in Julia Child's giant footsteps. Nora also splits her screen time between the two characters, drawing interesting comparisons between the two women.Unfortunately, Julie Powell's character in the book comes off as whiny, self-centered, alcoholic, and intolerant. In the movie, Julie is thrilled and amazed that people start reading her blog and commenting. In the book she scorns her readers, amazed that anyone would waste their time. The way she mocked their interest in her blog was unpleasant, along with her lack of respect for her long-suffering husband. I read about a third of the book, but there are too many good books I haven't read yet to waste more time on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea, uncontrolled vocabulary","review":"I was very excited to read Julie and Julia as I am a fan of French cooking and Julia Child but after a couple of chapters Julie Powell's profanity was almost unbearable.

The movie was much, much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enough food","review":"I had heard about this book and the author's blog, so when I ran across it in the \\"bargin books\\" section I was excited to get such a deal on a book! In hindsight, the low cost should have been an indication about the quality of the writing, as the book was not really worth the $4,99 I spent! I was expecting a fun book focusing on her project, the challenges with cooking and other adventures that she had while cooking her way through a great cookbook, but I was sorely disappointed. The author went on and on about her personal life, her job at a government agency and her relationships with friends and family. It is more like a diary of the author's life with the cooking project being a side-note. I really would have enjoyed this book more if she simply wrote about the recipes and her experiences with them, than her life in general."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time and money!","review":"This book has very little to do with cooking or the amazing Julia Childs. It is more an account of Ms. Powell's chaotic and unremarkable life. References to Julia and Paul Childs are sparse and oddly placed. Time spent chronicling work in the kitchen (which was fairly interesting) was vastly overshadowed by incoherent rants about family and friends. Attempts at wit were forced and not particularly funny. I generally smile at chiding by opposing political parties; however, I found Ms. Powell's persistent irreverent generalization of Republicans as unemotional and \\"piggy\\" annoying. I was particularly troubled after reading the cold account of her job consoling families a year post 9/11 as \\"emotional sh** work\\". WOW - I'd rather blow my nose on my t-shirt than have this woman hand me a tissue! I feel a little defeated but will be closing this book for good on page 99. I reccommend checking this out at the library and saving the hard-earned $25."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Waste","review":"I was looking forward to this book and, as I was reading it, became increasingly disgusted. Ms. Child was bright, exuberant, gracious, and courageous. Her marriage and friendships were positive and loving. All in all, even apart from her influence on cooking/eating, she was a worthwhile person in every respect.Ms. Powell is a self-indulgent, whiny, neurotic and colossally boring brat. She treats little annoyances like world disasters, she is a miserable spouse and friend, and she revels in her self-indulgent immaturity. For her to exploit the life/name of Ms. Child is a travesty and it is a shame that she made a dime doing it.I immediately re-read the wonderful \\"Appetite for Life\\" after wading through Ms. Powell's dreck and nothing could have more clearly emphasized what an utter waste Ms. Powell's book was. She expressed dismay that Ms. Child was negative about her blog--my guess is that Ms. Child would have been understandably disgusted with Ms. Powell whatever her topic."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm glad I didn't BUY it!","review":"This was a gift -- requested and much anticipated. I'm sorry my son wasted his money on my behalf. Yes, I'm a \\"foodie,\\" and foodies are going to be as disappointed as I was in this book. I'm also an avid reader, and the premise of this book was irresistable. Ugh! I had to force myself to finish it. It had absolutely nothing to do with food, as I know and love it; it was all about the author, her dysfunctional husband/friends, her wretched living conditions, and her frequent alcoholic binges. Julia Child (whom I met more than once in my youth, since she was an acquaintance of my mother) was right to wash her hands of the whole thing. I'm donating my copy to the library. I would NEVER pass it along to a friend!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Idea, Poor Execution","review":"In a nutshell, this book stinks. It's more about the trials and tribs of a 30-year-old in a dead-end job in New York than it is about Julia Child or cooking or food in general. And the whole book is larded with profanity which serves no purpose, except perhaps to bolster the author's hipster creds. But at the end of the read, where are we? Roughly the same place we started, except in need of a shower. Because of the book's great potential, I think it's fair to call the book a huge failure"},{"rating":"1","title":"As weblog it was interesting and amusing.. not as a book","review":"I have followed her weblog for a while. it was interesting and amusing. Her weblog entries were fun to read. just day to day ramblings. She really did not care what people thought about her writing style or content. That all seems lost in the book. I can only guess that she had to please an editor and a publisher and supply more then just a journal. they wanted a bio.The weblog made her sound like a smart person with sardonic wit.

The novel bore very little relation to its title. Additionally, my wife who is more sensitive to obscene or \\"adult\\" topics found this book very offensive, and whenever I vainly attempted to fast forward past the offending passage, I inevitably encountered another. Don't buy this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I've never disliked anyone so much in my life.","review":"This book was so much less than I had hoped for and that it could have been. I love the parts about Julia Child but why did this writer include stories about herself?! This writer's life is not only boring, it's painful to read about! This woman is pathetic. I found not one redeeming quality in Julie Powell as a person and she seemed so proud of being what I consider a self-centered, high-maintenance, elitist b_ _ _ h. Her poor husband! Poor readers! I say go directly to anything by or about Julia Child and read the real thing. Get to know Julia Child...a woman of grace, courage and talent. Everything Julie Powell is not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated it.","review":"I thought the book was poorly written, crude for no purpose and full of annoying political tangents/rants. I actually didn't finish it, and I almost never do that. I also thought Julie Powell was whiny, self-congratulatory and annoying. I have found that books based on blogs don't work well. It is one thing to read an entry every day but to read an entire book is too much."},{"rating":"1","title":"A complete disappointment","review":"This book was a complete disappointment for me. I enjoyed the movie and was delighted when my book club decided to read the book. Unlike the loveable Julie from the movie, Julie Powell is self absorbed and moany. She tries far too hard to be witty and amusing and it just doesn't work. The book jumps from one subject to the next with some personal stuff thrown in about her pals who I don't really care about as they don't really add to the subject. Since reading the book I have checked out her blog and can not say that I am surprised that Julia Child did not approve. It is a great dis-service to Julia Child. I would find it insulting to have my name associated with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"For Once, Movie Exceeds Book","review":"I went to see Julie and Julia in theaters, and thought it was a great movie. Both Meryl Steep and Amy Adams were good, and they really made the story come to life. I thought this was an interesting story, so I thought the book would be a great choice for me. However, I was very wrong. The writing is awful, and sometimes I had to read a passage twice to understand what it was saying. It felt like I was having a very informal conversation with the author. It was truly disappointing, and I had to stop reading it because I couldn't force myself to read any more of it. It is too bad because it really could have been a good book, but she just isn't a good writer, so it didn't really work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dd Not Waste Your Time or Money!!!!","review":"I was truely looking forward to reading this book. What a disapointment! This author is a self indulgent, whinny, twit. Her discrption of the 9/11 victim's families is enough to make you hate her.I want my money back!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick to cooking, not politics","review":"I wanted to like the book, I liked the movie and now I'm sorry I contributed so much as a penny to Ms. Powell. Like so many people, she seems to think that political comment is appropriate in any venue. Furthermore, she thinks that politically-based insults are appropriate in a book about cooking. Not. At least the movie people were bright enough not to insult a chunk of their audience.Take all of Ms. Powell's insulting generalizations about Republicans and change the word Republicans to Democrats or Jews or Catholics or African-Americans or Chinese and see how insulting they sound. Funny how changing the target of an insult seems to make it matter more, huh?At about the 12th gratuitous Republican insult, I tossed the book back into the box to return to the library and put Ms. Powell on my personal Do Not Read list."},{"rating":"1","title":"Attitude","review":"When I first got this book I thought it would be a good read especially her escapades with cooking. And I liked the little tidbits about Julia Childs and her husband. However, I got tired of the book after sixty - seventy pages of it. I found I was angry and disgusted by her total lack of sympathy for those who were trying to contribute to the 911 memorial as well as the families who have lost people in towers. Her condescension was more than I could handle. She and her friends were a bunch of whining self-absorbed twenty/thirty-somethings that believe the world revolved around them and their happiness. In the end I could not bring myself to read any farther. That's too bad. It should have been better given the concept."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really Hope the Movie is Better","review":"This book was a HARD read. I had to force myself to finish it. I did not find Julie's character to be very interesting and she had few redeeming qualities. She was flat out mean to her brother and to her husband. She was totally self centered, with \\"The Project\\" being the center of her world for an entire year, and thinking that she should be treated as the center of the world by everyone in her life.I certainly hope the movie is more entertaining and the characters more engaging."},{"rating":"1","title":"Agree with the bad reviews","review":"The movie looks charming and I am looking forward to seeing it. The book is written by a very unlikable snobbish whiny young woman who turned my stomach early on in the book with her attempt at wit. I recently read The School of Essential Ingredients, which is a lovely book about cooking and the magic of a well made meal. I thought this book would have the same charm, but it did not. The only palatable parts of the book are about Julia. I'm glad I borrowed it from the library instead of buying it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Maggots? Are you serious????","review":"Julia Child is a personal hero of mine. Sounds like this chick could have put the booze down and left NYC is she was so unhappy. That is the lesson I got from reading Julia Child's autobiography. Julia identified an issue in her world and made a positive effort to correct it and achieved a great deal of personal success in doing so.Cooking complicated food in a great rush inside a filthy kitchen with no knowledge of cooking is not something that I want to read about.YUK!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Julia Instead of Therapy?","review":"I read the entire book but it took me 2 months to complete because I couldn't get over the authors near jumps into the deep end of self loathing and constant freak outs.

I expected more action which I did not get in this double feature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Abstract thinking in art","review":"I admit to a special fondness for Walter Foster's old publications. This book, as yellowed as the pages may be, is fun. If, like me you have done rigorous training in formal drawing and painting and mastered the principles and are very happy about having done the discipline but now want to break out, this is a really helpful book. It features several styles of work and most importantly how the artists arrived at their processes. It will loosen your artistic process right up. Originally $1.00, it was probably published in the 1960's and is still relevant today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Twisted Tale of Captivity","review":"Jack Ketchum delivers another discomforting look at the dark side of human nature. A bizarre, sadistic couple of right-to-lifers kidnap a pregnant woman in front of an abortion clinic, hold her captive and engage in various forms of physical, psychological and sexual torture. I don't know why, but I couldn't put it down. Very graphic and descriptive as Ketchum tends to be. Not for the faint-hearted."},{"rating":"1","title":"I gave it two for the try.","review":"This is my second Jack book. I read the Girl Next Door because books like this interest me and I feel, because I'm naturally good hearted, complete me. However, there were issues.1. J.K...who edited this book! This book is full of stupid typos the author should have caught. I usually put down a book after 10, give or take, but I kept reading this one because the woman had my sympathy. Misspelled words, run-on sentences, missing quotations marks, half of a repeat sentence...Was there an editor at all?2. The plot goes stale after chapter seven, is sometimes unbelievable because why isn't no one looking for a pregnant women abducted in broad daylight, and the ending leaves you confused, like was she dreaming, or what?3. The charaterization of the antagonist is, well, more horrible than the horror.I liked the theme that was played with here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Always Pushing The Envelope - Another Ketchum Classic!","review":"While there's nothing supernatural in Jack Ketchum's terrifying thriller, Right To Life, the monster in this tale - like most of his work - is all too real, taken right from the headlines of today's news. At first, I was hooked on the mystery of why this innocent woman was kidnapped and wanted to know more about her kidnappers and their motives. However, the reasoning behind their actions didn't seem as effective as it could have been. Maybe that was an easier way out instead of writing about someone doing this because of their belief in saving a precious life, doing anything they can to protect the baby that grows inside of our main character. Regardless, it was an enjoyable read and one of Ketchum's stronger works, along with The Off Season, Offspring, Old Flames, and The Girl Next Door - my favorite of his books."},{"rating":"1","title":"unreal... but it could happen","review":"I found this a not so well developed story fantastic, pretty cruel and exaggerated.. Unrealistic because of the details and how they are presented, but it's main crime could happen!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What's the point?","review":"This was over the top. I don't get the point. It starts off right away with totally unbelievable stuff happening to this woman and gets more and more rediculous. It's so unbelievable, I don't know why he even bothered to write a story around the awful things that happen to her. Why not just write down whatever twisted, demented thing you've ever wanted to do to a woman, and print it? There's no point to this story at all. Don't waste your time or money.

The magnet is strong and holds the paper clips just like a drop of water."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth the Money","review":"I was totally disapointed in this product. The retailer wasn't at fault.The problem is with the way the product is made. When round tubes are meant to fit into other round tubes-the tubes must be round! I have tubes that are flat on one side and tubes with small notches inside that prevent the insertion of the second tube. This product was impossible to assemble due to poor manufacturing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tough to put together, and a little chintsy for hard use","review":"My son was throwing the ball at a wall on our house - and the the whole house was shaking! So my wife decided for the safety of house to get him this net. We were gone when the package came, but he went right to work putting it together. He used a lot of masking tape and had a few pieces left over, and also couldn't figure out how to get the net put on correctly. I tried to straighten in out - but then my wife ended up taking the whole thing apart and put it together correctly the next day. It looks nice, but really is a little bit light weight for a twelve year old. It might be a useful toy for T-Ball. I don't think my son is using it that much. But what can you expect for this price?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"This book taught me a lot about plays and how they're written, and the different and various elements that are required to make good and well-written plays.

Two pans don't fit in one oven!","review":"I've been sold on Doughmakers products for years. I own a whole collection of their bakeware, and I've been more than happy with all the items. The last bakeware I had to replace was my muffin pans. I make double batches of cookies and cupcakes, so I ordered two of these. They're beautiful. Solid aluminum, guaranteed not to rust. HOWEVER... upon using them for the first time, both pans were dented as I tried to close the oven door, and the door did not close. They do not fit lengthwise in a standard sized large oven! If you bake double batches, you cannot place these side by side. If you only bake one batch at a time, they're fine. If you make 24, just buy ONE pan and be prepared to spend twice the time in the kitchen making a second batch. I'm more than shocked that Doughmaker's designed something with such a glaring flaw. Very disappointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hopelessly Outdated","review":"Yes, it is a pleasant, lightweight read, but contrary to some of the other reviews here, this book is not \\"somewhat\\" outdated - - it is completely outdated. Anyone who knows anything about Ancient Egypt can just look at the inaccurate information in some of these reviews and see how misinformed readers of this book will be -- for example Thuthmosis III (the accepted \\"modern\\" spelling is Thutmose from the Egyptian transliteration, more closely Djehutymose) was not 4'6\\" -- that is a measurement of his mummy, minus his detached feet and lower legs. He more likely was about 5'6\\" tall, a very respectable height for an ancient Egyptian. As for Thutmose III being a \\"hero,\\" this is a man who, solely for profit, invaded foreign countries, killing, maiming and plundering, carrying goods and slaves back to Egypt, leaving countless impoverished widows and orphans in his wake. It is so sad to think that a mass murderer is anyone's definition of a \\"hero.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Never Fit Right","review":"My son loved to be swaddled during his first months, but this product never fit him right. It would gap and he could put his arms out and eventually wriggle it loose. We tried it a few times and then put it in the donation bag. Old-fashioned swaddling with receiving blankets worked much better (and is less expensive)."},{"rating":"1","title":"A great idea with poor execution","review":"Our baby loves to be swaddled, so when she started to outgrow the receiving blankets we had, we purchased the Swaddle Me large size. It only comes in large or small. She was 14+ pounds when we bought it, so within their weight range for that size.It's a great idea, but the Swaddle Me is far far too big for her. It goes around her one a half times. It's as if the people who made the blanket never tested it on real babies. You can't make it tight enough to get that cozy feeling that is the whole point of swaddling. There is only a small space where the velcro tabs stick. I don't understand why they don't make the whole blanket sticky for the velcro (it's not scratchy) so that you could secure it as tightly or loosely as you need to.For our next baby I will purchase The Miracle Blanket instead, and that is what I would recommend to anyone looking for a swaddle blanket."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"I expected great things from this blanket since Baby Bargains raved about it. Save your money and buy an Amazing Miracle Blanket instead. The velcro is annoying, and my daughter could wiggle out of this way too easily. She never got out of the Amazing Miracle Blanket, even at 6 months (I swaddled her when we were traveling and she had a hard time sleeping). Skip the swaddleme and get an Amazing Miracle Blanket. I swear I don't work for them--it's just that the blanket design is amazing and miraculous!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not work for me","review":"I purchased this product because I liked the idea of being able to easily remove the leg pouch to change diapers. I purchased the small which is designed to fit 7 to 14 lbs. The first time I used it, I realized it did not fit my son. Although he weighs 9 1/2 lbs., the wing stretched far past the velcro fastener. My husband and I watched him wiggle his arm free in 15 minutes. I would suggest that you just purchase a regular receiving blanket. Just make sure it is large enough (about 30x40) so that you have enough fabric to effectively wrap your baby."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very snug","review":"We had received one of these as a baby gift. First it was too big. After my daughter had grown into it, she was able to get her arms out and it was never very snug, so she wouldn't like it very much. It's not a bad product, but it just doesn't work as well as a blanket."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous Product!","review":"These things are indispensable for moms of new babies. They come in quite a few colors and fabrics, so you can get ones that are appropriate for any season. We had about 6 that we used for my son up until his 8 month birthday or so when he decided he didn't want to be swaddled while sleeping and graduated to regular blankets. They wash & wear very well and are especially great for parents (like us) who never quite mastered the art of forming a 'baby burrito' with a regular blanket. I bought 2 of these for a friend with a new baby and highly recommend them!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pros and cons","review":"I have 2 fleece ones. Got one as a gift and then I bought an extra one later because baby spits up sometimes.Pros:Baby sleeps peacefully in itCan wrap the baby's arms tight so she doesn't squirmMakes breastfeeding easier -- no hands in the way!Cons:The bottom part where her legs go is not long enough-- it starts her kick-reflex and it frustrates her sometimes. I have to shush her for a few seconds then she forgets about the problem.My baby slides down into the bottom part sometimes (even though she is wrapped tightly) and the top part of the wrap starts to cover her mouth and eventually her nose. I have to re-wrap her when this happens (this happens mostly after I burp her after feedings). She does not like the process of being wrapped, so I have to calm her down.I would still buy another one of these if needed and I do plan on getting the bigger size once she gets longer/bigger."},{"rating":"2","title":"100% awesome","review":"Our baby started sleeping through the night within days (I had to wake him up to feed him), and I largely attribute it to this swaddle me. It's easy to put on once you get the hang of it, and although it looks a little like a pea-pod straightjacket, it works!! I would never have another newborn without it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Three cheers for swaddling","review":"The difference that swaddling makes is just short of miraculous and this product really does the trick, once baby fills it out. Our son is now about 11 pounds and he fits nicely into the small. We tried to use this on him when he first came home at 6.5 pounds, but it swallowed him, so we used receiving blankets. Both served their purpose, but SwaddleMe is faster and more secure. He's a little Hercules now and can easily wiggle out of a blanket.One thing - I recommend the cotton over the microfleece if you live anyplace south of the Yukon. The fleece made baby really hot at night. The cotton is breathable, but still warm.Lastly, a confession - When I went to purchase a specialty swaddling blanket, I bought this one in part because of the price. I'm glad I did. It gets the job done without breaking the bank."},{"rating":"2","title":"Swaddling is a lifesaver!","review":"Great product. I love the SwaddleMe blankets. My 3 month old sleeps incredibly well and I believe swaddling is what made this possible. My only problem with this blanket in particular is that the cotton is very stretchy and she can actually escape the swaddle most nights. We had the flannel version before this one and did not have that problem with it. I'd definitely recommend this product but I'd suggest the flannel version!"},{"rating":"2","title":"We LOVE this!!","review":"We absolutely LOVE this product. Our daughter did not like being swaddled in a receiving blanket because she doesn't like to have her arms restrained so I didn't even bother with this. She tends to startle herself awake and throws her arms out to the side and has to be put to bed all over again. I decided to give it a try one day (when she was about three weeks old) and she was asleep within minutes. Better yet, she stayed asleep for hours. She is now two months old and we use this every night - she is sleeping 8-10 hours each night. The velcro stays closed and I don't worry all night that the material has covered her nose. The material also has just enough \\"give\\" that she can still move her arms a little but not enough that she wakes herself up. It is totally worth $10 and mom, dad and baby are all well rested!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best at keeping baby swaddled","review":"I was never very good at getting the blanket to say on as a swaddle. My baby is something of an escape artist even when I did it right. The swaddle me is easy to fasten and hard for him to wiggle out of.

In addition, the non-microfleece version stretched, which means your baby can wrangle out of the swaddle - rendering it ineffective at best. They need to take this product off the shelves and rethink its design and the quality of materials used in its construction - very dissappointing,"},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning!!!","review":"We bought this item and could not wait to use it on our newborn daughter. Luckily, she was laying right next to me in her bouncy chair at the time because within 5 minutes, I looked over at her and the blanket had covered her whole face. When I lowered it, the skin around her mouth was blue.We tried it again 3 weeks later, when she was a bit bigger. Initially, it seemed fine but within a few minutes, it slid up to cover her mouth and nose again.I would not recommend this product.

I bought this item in hopes that it would be comfortable for her and easy to use. Needless to say she unswaddled herself easily and could not sleep as a result. Admittedly not all children make valiant attempts at getting out of their blankets, however my little girl was pretty intent. I never could use this item and had to revert to using larger blankets until she no longer needed to be swaddled."},{"rating":"1","title":"Other products are better","review":"If this is the only swaddle blanket you have ever used i can see saying its tje greatest thing ever, however its not my first one. This product is much more difficult to put on and certainly not as diaper changing friendly as they make it sound. You have to undo the inside velcro then attempt to put it back again after. Also, my very sneaky 7 week old easily wiggles his arms free so that his hands are poking out the top then wakes up. My kids are very long and they, at 7 weeks and only about 8.5 lbs, are already almost too tall for this product.The reason I bought these was because the halo fleece sleepers got too warm with wood heat but I must say even too warm the halo sleepers are a million times better! I got size small which my boys are swimming in amnd I can still wrap them more tightly and change them easier.These are definately not my favorite by far, I think I swaddle with a blanket better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"Love the swaddle-me- however, note that the cotton stretches a LOT faster then the microfleece versions"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother...","review":"We got this as a gift and have used it 0 times.

What's most amazing... ever since he first night I put him down in this swaddle, he has SLEPT THROUGH THE NIGHT EVERY TIME!

GREAT!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"too stretchy","review":"Our baby is wiggly and we had to wrap this very snugly. In the middle of the night, though, she would sometimes wake up scared because it was so tight. When we wrapped it more loosely, she quickly wiggled her arms out and would wake herself when her arms flailed about. Like another reviewer experienced, a couple times our baby awoke with the swaddle me bunched up tightly around her neck. That was the last straw. Our baby was 8-12 pounds when we tried it. Now we use simple squares of flannel from a fabric store."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lightweight SwaddleMe","review":"The large size was big enough to swaddle our 5 month old Grandson and lightweight enough to do so in these hot summer months. If you have never used one, pay close attention to the diagram about how to use it.

I live in the Caribbean and quite frankly swaddling is not commonly done here. The nurses do it in the hospital but it is not taught or suggested for home use. I never did it with my first child but decided to give it a go for my son.The first time I used it(during his first week at home), he slept in it ok for a while but when he awoke and found that his movements were constricted he cried non stop until I removed him from it. My mom absoluted hated this thing and compared it to being in a straight jacket and she was convinced that it was keeping it too hot.I gave in and stopped using it. I guess this is a cultural thing and may work for some but I am sorry to say it was not a hit in our home."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product!","review":"My ds was kicking himself out of a swaddle in the hospital as a newborn, but when he was having trouble sleeping at 4 months, this helped. He quickly outgrew it, but I'm definitely keeping this around in case we have another one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Helps baby sleep","review":"This product did help my 5 mo old sleep better, as she cannot move her arms around and kick her feet which wakes her up. However it ripped very soon after we got it, around the velcro patch in the center. You are supposed to pull the left part down and velcro it to the middle patch on the babies lower abdomen area. Well there are holes that are growing larger and larger each time we use it. It could have been made with higher quality stitching and material."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerous?","review":"I really liked the Swaddleme fleece swaddle that was given to us when our son was born. As the weather turned warmer and the boy grew, I decided to try this cotton one. I'm not happy at all with it. It stretches too much and doesn't keep him swaddled for long. This morning I woke to his crying only to discover he'd worked the entire thing up his body and wrapped it snugly around his neck. I won't be using it any more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best one so far!","review":"We've used a few different swaddle blankets and this is my favorite. Stretchy cotton knit allows you to wrap the baby really tight but not overheat in the summer. The velcro stays out of the way and doesn't poke the baby. You can also swaddle with one arm out. Beats the Miracle Blanket and Halo Sack in my opinion. Cheaper too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great invention","review":"I wish I would have known about these when my baby was born. And where were these 10 years ago when my first was born? I WOULD highly recommend these in whatever style. They are one of the best baby shower gifts and whom ever you buy these for will love this gift above all. Especially first time parents. But seasoned parents will love this too..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great!","review":"These blankets are great! They keep my son swaddled and happy - we have tried so many blankets and swaddlers and this is one of the only kinds out of which he can't wiggle. The cotton fabric is nice and stretchy, and it's much cheaper than the Halo Sleepsack swaddler. The small size was perfect from birth until 2 months (11 pounds), after which we upgraded to the larger size. You do want to be careful and not overdress your baby if using one of these since my baby gets pretty warm in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for your baby...","review":"I just have to say that if you have a baby or know someone that does this is the item for you. It is the perfect item to wrap your baby in to feel secure. We used to use a cloth diaper to wrap up the baby years ago but now they have come up with this and it's perfect. Get a few of them you won't want to be without it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Swaddler","review":"This is the only swaddler I used with my daughter. I had no problems with it. The only thing I would mention is that this one was a thin cotton, while the other one I had was fleece. I recommend you decide which one to buy based on the season. This one filled its purpose."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easier than blanket swaddling, to be sure!","review":"I love the soft fabric and how simple it is to use the SwaddleMe. My daughter prefers to have her arms up and out of her swaddling though, and the SwaddleMe is a little bit awkward when the necessary adustments are made (note that it's not actually meant for this kind of wrapping). If it were made just a little bit more \\"adjustable\\" I think it would be more appealing. Additionaly, at just under 9lb, my newborn daughter won't fit in it for long, so if your newborn is larger, keep this in mind. All in all though, I'm happy with the SwaddleMe and pleased not to have to wrap and re-wrap her in a receiving blanket all of the time. It's a good deal for new parents."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME for the swaddling impaired","review":"Hubby and I could just never quite get the swaddle-in-a-blanket thing figured out. No matter how snug we'd do it, our son always managed to wiggle both of his hands and arms free. This product made swaddling 10x easier, and was 100x more effective than our own efforts! Makes life MUCH easier on us both.We found the cotton ones were more snug (and stayed swaddled) better than the fleece. Regardless, DEFINITELY worth the $$. I suggest buying at least 2-3 to have on hand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed in velcro after washing","review":"This seemed like a great invention so we registered for it for our baby shower. We got one and were so excited to try it out. When we finally brought the baby home and tried to use it, it was very disappointing. First, our 7lb 3oz baby LOVED to be swaddled tightly for his naps. This didn't swaddle him tight enough to where is wriggly arms couldn't break out. Then the velcro didn't latch good AT ALL, it wouldn't stay put. We were very disappointed in this product. We found it best just to use the hospital blankets and our own folding technique to swaddle our baby snugly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dads!

Best of all, he looks like a little pea pod."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a magic blanket!","review":"The first time we used this blanket our two month old baby slept through the night. (9 hours!) It was a life saver. The only downside is that they actually come in three sizes. Babies R US online only carries the medium size. It is too big for our baby so she can wiggle out of it and one time ended up with it around her neck. (it didn't impair her breathing though)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Colicky baby? This is for you!","review":"I was given this as a gift & left it in the package for some time. As a new mommy, I thought sleepless nights were part of it, until I visited my family when she's 3 months old. I finally tried this & wish I had much sooner! My daughter HATED being put into this (it's a little tricky @ first), but would quickly nod off to sleep after she was in it. We didn't like putting her in it either, it was a last resort, b/c it felt like we were torchering her b/c we had to make it tight enough. We & she couldn't have slept w/out it on MANY nights!!! You MUST use the velcro, as it's shown. Figure it out b/c it's the only thing what will keep your baby in tight, if he/she is fidgety & strong!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth It","review":"I bought this b/c my son is not able to sleep unswaddled and he gets tangled up in regular swaddling blankets (scary!). Unfortunately, it was a waste of money. The blanket is not designed to swaddle tightly (which is the point) and my son is 9 lbs, 7 oz (clearly within the 7 - 14 lb range). He got his arms loose and they flailed inside the blanket even after I stitched on additional velcro to make the swaddling tighter. Unless your child doesn't wiggle at all, don't bother with this blanket."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great swaddle for small babies but NOT a size large","review":"This swaddle is wonderful-- when you purchase it in a size small/medium. However, after ordering the size large after my baby grew I received this swaddle in what was marked as size large. It is definitely not a large. The \\"large\\" is actually identical in size to the small/medium. I eventually spoke with the manufacturer about this and I was told that they are having production problems and currently are unable to produce a true size large of this swaddle. So don't order the size \\"large\\". This swaddle is wonderful though for a smaller baby (less than 15 pounds)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Velcro does not hold","review":"I have an older fleece blanket and it's great! But this version is really bad, velcro closures are to far, can't close them properly, Size small was still to big for my baby who's avarage size, I wish they wouldn't change this product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless","review":"Swaddling is great if you use the right blanket, but this one isn't it. It's too stretchy for a tight fit and the \\"easy diaper change\\" feature makes it too easy for the baby to kick out one or both legs, which just wakes them up. You'd be better off buying a Miracle Blanket. They're more expensive, but they actually work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Stretchy!","review":"My son lived in his Kiddopotamus fleece until he outgrew it/it got too hot. When we went up a size, I got the cotton knit, figuring it would be a similarly fantastic product. Unfortunately, I was mistaken.The whole idea of swaddling is to keep baby nice and tightly snuggled in, and the fleece did a fantastic job because it didn't have much stretch. The cotton knit can be stretched to about two times its length. My (formerly blissfully quietly sleeping) three-month-old would wiggle out within 15 minutes and wail until I'd rescue him and repeat the process. I eventually threw it out.The other drawback to all the Kiddo's is that they use velcro. So if you have an angel who will sleep through diaper changes (they do exist!) you will absolutely certainly wake him or her while unfastening the velcro. I found that the Amazing Miracle Blanket was a five-star product. Once I got that one, I even gave up on the fleece Kiddo!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Wrap!","review":"My Daughters love to wiggle and squirm and can get out of anything I wrap them in!

The velcro doesn't hold because the patches are too small, and the knit fabric is too stretchy.

First, she was too small, so I swaddled her using a traditional blanket. Then, they fit, but the fabric would stretch out during the night and she'd get her arms up and wake herself up.

I've never gotten one that did not work OK. I've used them for 4 or 5 years on various computer brands. Even have had good results using them as the pickup for a parabolic reflector for long range Wi-Fi (AKA Scabbing).This last version I received had a much cheaper USB extension cable than the original.

It's supposed to get a very strong signal from where I am, but its signal strength is always low when plugged directly into my motherboard. When plugged into a USB 2.0 extension cable, I get very good or excellent signal strength, but it will often lose the signal when under heavy load.

Unfortunately my original skepticism quickly came back to confront me. After using the device for only a few days my connection dropped. I had to unplug the thing and reboot my computer before I was able to get back on my network. I've only had it for about 2 weeks and I've had to unplug it and restart my computer probably 15 times to get it to work again. I never used to have problems in the past with my other wireless usb adapters so I have a good feeling that it's due to this devise.

It begins on a beach with a father (Kirk Douglas) and son bonding, then De Palma shocks the audience with a shootout that blazes from out of nowhere, resulting in many deaths. This is an exciting sequence, directed in a manner that only De Palma could have accomplished. Unfortunately, after that the entire film grows increasingly obvious, with suspenseless scene after suspenseless scene, all the way to the highly-touted finale, which is indeed an impressive array of pyrotechnics, but hardly anything else. For good Brian De Palma films, stick with Mission to Mars, Mission: Impossible, The Untouchables, or Body Double."},{"rating":"2","title":"The perfect movie for a drunken binge","review":"You already know the plot, so I'll get right to the meat of it. \\"The Fury\\" is one of the coolest De Palma movies there is. I first saw this movie on TNT when Joe Bob Briggs did a show called Friday night Monstervision. He did drive-in totals, and I'm sure those totals would help you now.This movie has: 23 dead bodies. 1, full-torso body explosion. 1 car wreck with crash and burn. 1 boat wreck with crash and burn. 1 car wreck with bloody civilian casualty. 1 former Playmate turned inside out.Hey, the movie sold me with those and it got better from there. How can you resist a movie where a bad guy has no use in one of his arms. Especially when a character asks what happened to that guy's arm and Kirk Douglas cooly replies, \\"I killed it. With a machine gun.\\" Now that's entertainment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mine exploded, too","review":"That's how I ended up... Fury-ous!

Some of these reviewers giving this turkey 4 stars is like saying Andrew Stevens was an acting genius of his time. I saw this flop when it first came out, and I distinctly remember the crowd walking out after saying how bad it was.Time hasn't helped this DePalma mess out either, unless you're into getting in a few laughs at the dialogue, acting and especially terrible effects. Anybody who claims this as anything close to \\"Carrie\\" needs a serious MRI done, because the closest this flop is to that classic, is the actors (if you consider Amy Irving an actress) and the extra buckets of fake blood. It's also painful watching Kirk Douglas and John Cassavetes reading lines off each other, fully knowing, it's all for the paycheck.Please, if you want to view a decent DePalma flick, pick up \\"Dressed To Kill\\" of \\"Blowout\\".

Peter was too whiny in this one and it was really irritating me. The raindrops scene was corny. The acting was horribly bad. The special effects were amazing and the Doc Ock scenes were pretty cool.

My 4 year old loves Spiderman and I took him to Spiderman 1 without any problems. During the Spiderman 2 movie there is an operating room scene that I had to cover his eyes and ears until it was over. That was probably the worst thing that happens in it.It is much more action packed than the first one, which is great. There's also more of a love story theme in this one as well. Children over the age of 8 would probably be ok, depending on the child. Younger children could watch most of it too, however beware of more violence in this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spider-Man 2.","review":"A little Better than the First, Alot Better than Part 3 that's for sure.

It is nice to know that my hubby can watch it anywhere now on his PSP."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothing Short of Amazing","review":"This film is not only the best super-hero movie ever made, but it is easily the best summer blockbuster ever. It evokes every kind of human emotion. The character development is so deep that when Peter Parker is hurt you almost feel as though your best friend is hurt. Now dont get me wrong. Just because i said the character development is deep does not mean that there is a lack of action here. The action is amazing. The special effects are quite literally breath-taking. This movie has earned a spot as one of my all-time favorite movies ever. I love this movie and i dont see how anyone can say anything bad about it. It is simply incredible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looking Forward to Spiderman 3","review":"I want to start by saying I love the Spiderman Series as well as most of these movies that are based on the comic books of my past. I've watched the original Spiderman time after time. Everyone knew after they watched the original that there would be more to come. Unfortunately no movie could ever live up to the great visions concocted in many of our imaginations. Overall I enjoyed Spiderman 2. The special effects were fantastic and the story line was still rather engaging. My only complaint would be that the visions in my head will have to wait for Spiderman 3. I totally overlooked any thoughts of Dr. Octavious. I was expecting to Harry Osborne to put on the mask and become the new villain. Unfortunately all Spidey fans will have to wait for that as young Osborne doesn't start to crack until the end of this film. Overall this film is another great edition in a fantastic series. I'm just afraid that the creators might start milking the series for money."},{"rating":"1","title":"1.5 stars out of 4","review":"The Bottom Line:Coupling a dead fish of a romance with a complete anti-climax of a superhero movie, Spider-man 2 fails in almost every conceivable way; put it this way, it's never a good sign when your villain is five times more likable and sympathetic as your superhero."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love the special effects!","review":"The special effects in this one are just as good as the first!

MEGA CRAP!!","review":"Unlike the first Spiderman movie, this one spends too much time on the adolescent turmoil of the lead characters introduced previously. Too much tension has been created between the characters Peter Parker and Mary Jane. Peter's vulnerability has been pathetically over-played.

Not only does it move ahead with the story, but the action/romance scenes-of which there are plenty-are well-done. Nice opening credits sequence, which is enough to orient those who haven't seen the first movie. There are also plenty of allusions to the first movie as well. The end is not only satisfying, but leaves a cliffhanger for \\"Spider-Man III\\", coming summer 2006. Everyone in this film was convincing in their roles. Shouldn't have been rated PG-13, though there are some frightening images. Keep it up. Better than the first one. Hope the third one exceeds expectations and brings the saga to a close, although making more wouldn't be a bad idea; but you better not push your luck.

There are just too many awful lines. \\"... you're just an empty seat...\\" \\"I've always been standing in your doorway.\\" Spiderman is supposed to have a serious side, but the script was total garbage. The actors did a good job with what was given to them, but the story just could not hold up the foundations. Overall a disappointing movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit of a letdown","review":"I guess I am in the minority. I thought the film was entertaining but I certainly don't think it deserves all the hoopla that's been going around. Visually, it didn't offer anything that was new. The plot was very different from the first but what I liked about the first one was the character development.....getting to know who these people are. In Spider 2, it seemed that there were so many maudlin moments that were unnecessary. Constantly telling the audience that things are bad. Alrgiht. I got the point. Move on. I thought the acting was very forced also. Too many tears for a comic book character. In fact, every character had some tears to shed at various points, even the bad guys, the supporting actors and the EXTRAS!!! C'mon. This is NOT heavy drama and could NEVER be construed as such so why throw it in so many times?"},{"rating":"2","title":"go spidy","review":"A good touch-up from the first spider man which i thought was good but spiderman 2 is a deffinant improvement from the original spiderman in all areas, it is obvious the graphics have been touched up, more stunts have been added and a much better storyline eg. doesn't just cut straight to the chase it shows a better lead up. Not being a big fan of marvel myself shows me how good it is and i would think that the fans of the marvel comics would greatly enjoy this. More action has been added and i think that doc. oc is a far cooler super villain than the original one which i hope does not return in the third part to the series( you'll know what I meen after watching the movie). Gets a deffinant thumbs up a must see for you marvel fans enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just 8 more minutes--an alternate film","review":"Spider-Man 2.1 isn't just the original film with 8 more minutes of footage. Many of the scenes in the film have been recut, with different footage used. It's the same basic story, but with an entirely new feel. The elevator scene is longer and funnier, the action scenes are even more exciting, and there's a scene with Jonah and Spidey's suit that is priceless.The bonus features are good, with a \\"Making Of\\", commentary, a trivia track and a preview of Spidey 3.Recommended without hesitation for hardcore Spidey fans.

I honestly don't know if the second one will be any better, but there is hope! After the phenomenal critical success of the book THE AMAZING ADVENTURES OF KAVALIER AND CLAY, which tells the story of two young comic book writers from the early days of WW II, Michael Chabon was asked to write the story for Spiderman II. If you have read that novel, you know what extraordinary ideas he has for comic book stories. There is a very, very good chance that he can elevate SPIDERMAN II to a good space. I actually read an interview with Toby McGuire where he talked about how good he thought the script was.So, keep your hopes up folks! Thanks to Michael Chabon, the second film just might be a very good one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very bad movie!","review":"In my opinion I thought Spiderman 2 was awful. It had a bad dialogue, bad acting, and poor special effects. It's kind of like watching a remake of Superman 2 and 3. It didn't seem like a superhero movie to me. It was more like watching a love story. I do not like love stories much and I was expecting it to be just Spiderman and not some stupid idiot of seeing how much his life sucks and trying to get the girl. I give this movie a D rating because the story was just plain awful. I was about to walk out of the theater during the half of the movie. Only thing that's good about this movie is the scene where the car was crashing through the window that was awesome but the rest of the movie sucked."},{"rating":"2","title":"not very Amazing","review":"Sure Doc Oc was done very well and the scene where Spidey stops the subway train was a thrill ride, but once again the slow, Peter Parker scenes just dragged the action to a screeching halt far too many times. I get that a superhero action movie needs to establish the humanity of the character, but does he have to be such a dull dimwit? As far as \\"best superhero movie ever\\" goes, I'll still stick with the first Superman and Batman movies and perhaps even Daredevil. When not in costume, the hero needs to avoid being pathetic or at least be interesting and amusing enough to overcome that state. In his first two big budget movies, Peter Parker has been neither interesting nor amusing while being far too pathetic to engender any sympathy.Better luck next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY dissapointed","review":"I had waited a LONG time to see the sequel to Spiderman. I had high expectations of this movie and I thought it would strongly surpass the first. When I saw it, I was hugely dissapointed. I feel as though the plot was rather miniscule, there was no excitment. Yes, the special effects in this movie were great, but I wish it had a bit more shock and suprise. And I'm really suprised to see all of the high reviews for this movie. I don't see the greatness in Spiderman 2.I would high recommend NOT seeing this movie in the movies.

Of the new scenes, the only ones that were significant in my view is where Mary Jane Watson discusses her impending marriage to John Jameson with a girlfriend and the added footage of the fights between Spidey and Dr. Octopus, especially on the train! The others were okay BUT weren't really missed.Overall, I still enjoy the new version nonetheless.

Doctor Otto Octavious (Alfred Molina) was great villian to Spiderman! I like the movie's story, special effects, and great action sequences! Spiderman 2 had eveything I ever wanted in superhero genre movie. I can't say enough about this film. Sam Rami did wonderful job on this project.I love it!

This movie was like watching a comic book unfold, especially the fight scene with Doc Ock and Spidey when MJ is kidnapped.

Who wants to see that garbage in an action film. There are very few fight scenes and they were not very good. Also the special effects in this movie were supposed to be awesome. THEY SUCKED!!!!!!!

I know in the comics they tell peter parker more than spidey and that's part of the reason I don't realy like spidey comics.

The story seemed to be written by a 4th grader, the cinematography was so choppy, the characters so poorly developed - and the acting was beyond weak. I actually liked Tobey Maguire being selected and thought he was a good fit in the first movie but in the sequel he seemed so pathetic. When the movie began, I jokingly said to my husband that apparantly Spiderman meets his demise by suicide since his life is such crap. There were so many sub plots that never went anywhere - the annoying friend, the annoying landlord, the annoying landlord's daughter, Aunt Mae moving out - where is a good edit when you need it?

Because really, it is EXTREMELY bad. Between the sad, predictable, badly-acted lines and dorky plotline, there isn't much to admire. Nothing in this movie made me think Spiderman was real (come on, it's freaking 2004, hire a company that knows CGI for petes sakes), nor any of the lame romance lines or any of the \\"enemy's\\" lines. I'm sure a good kid with superpowers would turn his back on someone getting pummeled. Yeah. I'm sure some redheaded [...] marrying someone else would still love a dork who acts like a hero but really ain't. Right. And please don't ask me to mention how many scenes were either rancidly lame, incredibly boring, or repeated without reason. I won't even go there.This movie sucks. I cannot WAIT for Superman [...].

I enjoyed them both immensley, but agree that Spidey 2 had more meat on it's bones and a resolution of some aspects of the story that were welcome. Digitalization done well has to be seen to be believed and the special effects in these movies are highly entertaining and a bit breathtaking. The making of Spidey Three will be a challenge, but I suspect those in charge will be up to it. Until then, these movies are stepping stones to more adventures and having that to look forward to isn't all bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Movie from a Marvel Fan","review":"If you enjoyed Spider Man, you'll love Spider Man 2. In many ways it was better than the first movie. I like the way they worked in a number of Marvel Comic book episodes; particularly the scene where Spidey walks away from his Spider Man suit in a garbage can in a dark alley. I also enjoyed the scene where he saves a train load of people on a runaway elevated train and then collapses from exhaustion. They made Spider Man very human and quite ordinary which is great.

Way to much romance not enough action this movie had nothing to do with the comics besides the spider-man no more story but they got that all wrong, when peter quit being spider-man he never actuly lost his powers he just threw his suit in the trash.Why did he lose his powers because of mary jane? The only good thing about this movie was that the cgi was really good. I really do not know how anybody could say this movie was good.

There were some scenes where he ran around with his suit but not his mask that added some interesting twists. I really liked the ending, but I don't want to ruin it for you, so you'll have to watch it yourself to find out. The second disk that was a documentary about the making of Spiderman was great too.

A few lines near the end got audible, large laughs that were, actually, supposed to be pretty serious...However, the action was fun, and the critical raves for the movie really are well-deserved.There are lots of callbacks to the first movie, but never so that you'd need to have seen the first movie to understand what's going on here.

Meanwhile, his personal relationships all go in a particular -- and predictable -- direction (DOWNHILL!!!!), he continues to get fired from jobs, his Aunt May can't pay the rent...BUT, this movie has a few surprises for the viewers during and near the end of the film...as well as lead in to what will be Spider-Man 3.(Oh, and for fans of the theme song from the original cartoon series from the 1960s, you'll hear two different versions of it -- one from a street musician and one in the credits, though they're not the original version from that cartoon series.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Comic Move EVER!","review":"I thought the first Spider-Man movie was a thrill. This one was 100x better!!! I really thought the trailers would have spoiled the whole movie because they showed way too much but there are scenes they don't show that just blow you away! Dr. Octopus has always been my favorite Spidey villain and he's perfect here! Tobey Maguire really comes to life as Peter Parker in this film. I love the facial expressions he has when things aren't going well for Peter. The story leaves room for at least two more movies and the hints at upcoming villains are enough to ensure that the Spidey series will only get better and better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunately, it's noisy","review":"I really liked this model. It played our DVDs and DivX movies very well. It started up quickly, its settings were well-designed, and it seemed sturdy.So why did I return it? Because it was noisy. We could clearly hear it running during movies. My old Liteon (non-upscaling) player was much quieter, and the new Sony and LG players we tried were virtually silent.Too bad.

Upscaling is decent but not optimal. You can see some very obvious hazing/fuzziness of distant objects. I would say upscaling quality is closer to a 720p than a 1080i (but i am no expert). Overall, for a model in the $50 - $70 dollar range i think it is a good buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Regular dvd player","review":"Easy enough to work dvd player. Had to fiddle around with the menu to set it to 1080p (does not start as default). Upconverting does improve signal slightly, but its not that amazing.

Had to change my wiring setup for my home theater to accomodate. Better than the Samsung unit I am replacing. Will probably get more units for the other rooms that dont have surround."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome. period.","review":"This was worth every penny spent, plus a hundred more. The upconversion, depending on the source, is brilliant and seemless. For Dvd sources it's amazing. Xvid and divx completely depends on your source, but it's played everything thrown at it; and I've thrown a lot at it. The USB interface is quite simple and has yet to cause any problems. Buy this player if you're on the fence about BlueRay."},{"rating":"2","title":"A tale of two DVD Players.","review":"Not wanting to commit to HD-DVD or Bluray yet I decided to purchase a upconverting DVD player to go with my new HD TV (finally!). My first purchase was the number one choice of a popular consumer reporting website, the Toshiba SD-5000.I could not get the Toshiba to work on an HDMI cable with the TV, only with conventional Audio/Video cables. After the lower tech hookup I quickly noticed that it also didn't have a chapter and minute/second counter on the display! Not satisfied with the product I returned it and purchased a Pioneer DV-400V-K. While forty dollars more expensive it is worth the price difference. Out of the box, plug in the single cable (HDMI), Go to the initial setup and select 1080P and enjoy DVD's in upconverted format. No it is not HD-DVD or Blue ray quality but it is very acceptable and 300.00 less than the forementioned. I'll enjoy watching DVD's on my 120.00 player while the dust to settles in the HD-DVD vs. Bluray battle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great player","review":"I ordered this player so I could play DVDs that were in the PAL system. It works great!

It works great, doesnt overheat, resumes where dvd left off, if I stop it. It is very easy to hook up, the Set up if very user friendly. The owners manual really helps with audio/video adjustments. You have the option of changing many audio/video settings to get your movies to look and sound better than before. Who needs blue ray and HD DVD, not me. This player really makes the 480 DVD look like 1080p, check it out for yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW","review":"I was at the store for 2 hours trying to decide between Samsung, Panasonic, Sony and Pioneer. I have always owned many Pioneer products and so I went with this one, one of the reasons was an easy remote to use in a dark home theater and for the 1080p upscaling. I've seen alot of upscaling players at this price perform, but when I got home and saw this on my 150\\" tv with my 1080p projector, wow, this comes close (but does not match) the best expensive upscalers. I am very happy with this product. I wanted the Pioneer dvd recorder, but unfortunately most dvd recorders are only 1080i.Highly recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Multi-format?","review":"I can't see how a company can advertise a multi-format DVD player that only plays region 1 DVDs. I don't have much use for a DVD player advertised to play PAL as well as NTSC that will not play region 2 DVDs. Pioneer is disceptive in their advertising and this is the last product I buy from them.The picture quality is not bad but it is not worth the price for a non-recorder DVD player. It does upconvert to 1080P through the HDMI cable. I have a 40 inch LCD it it is impossible for me to detect any upgrade of picture quality from this player set to 1080P and another player that plays at 1080I. Less expensive players give just as good a picture. So unless you own a lot of region free PAL DVDs you should choose a different player."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does NOT play MEPG","review":"This player cannot recognize any mpg/mpeg files on DVD+R and -R. I read the manual very carefully and found that it never mentions that it can play MPEG.I tried to burn one mpg, one avi, and one divx file on a DVD-R. The player can play avi and divx without any problems. However, the mpg file just never shows up. It's a shame that a DivX certified player cannot recognize MPEG. What a joke!Besides, the manual also mentions some restriction on DVD+R disc. This player would play +R disc only when it's a DVD Video (backup DVD movies)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow","review":"Disk in and out are slow than my old Poineer.

Avoid this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware...","review":"I don't really know much about these things, but I just bought two of them because Consumer Reports rated them highly. I hooked up the first one and it worked great for about 30 minutes, then it stopped working until it cooled down. I hooked up the other in another room and it works, but the HDMI connection seems a little loose. It still works, but I have to get the cable in just the right position. It does the same thing on two different brand new cables, so it's definitly the box. Maybe I just got two lemons, but I won't buy Pioneer again. Good luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning! Not all USB drives will work - only low power drives.","review":"I bought this unit for the USB port. Pretty decent DVD player so far. I had a Philips and it beats that one hands down.Unfortunately, the USB port can only supply enough power for low power USB devices. The small flash drives will work. The bigger USB disk drives powered only by USB will not. The external disk drives that also have a power connection will work. Not nearly as convenient though.I give it two stars because of this drawback. Engineering-wise, it would not have been hard to supply more power. Frustrating.This limitation is mentioned in the instruction manual (but then again who would have access to that before purchasing, let alone wonder if their drive would work)."},{"rating":"1","title":"no","review":"Bought this dvd player so that we can watch european dvds, the problem is that the player does not come modified to watch the dvds from UK right away.

Wrong! The Standard definition picture is pretty bad; I knew that from the review. The 720p setting provides an extremely clear picture; I also knew that from the review. However, the disc tracking is absolutely horrible on this thing. A tiny smudge or scrape on a disc gives this player fits. Even discs that have no apparent defects won't play. I performned an experiment: Discs that wouldn't play on the Pioneer DV-400V WOULD play on my PS2 and a $30.00 Magnavox cheapie I got from WalMart. Needless to say, I'm returing it. The one thing that did work was the USB port. I really enjoyed putting podcasts on my thumb drive and playing them through my stereo."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good DVD player for basic use","review":"Got this in a hurry when our old DVD/VCR player died. Amazing how much smaller the new machines are--this has a small footprint and is only a couple inches tall. I guess I'd just keep that in mind when you figure out where to put it--if you're filling a taller opening (like I was), it will sit right at the bottom. On the other hand, you might be able to double up, I was able to put our cable box and this new DVD player in the space that just used to hold my DVD/VCR.A couple design issues: The words and buttons on the front of the machine are almost microscopic. You'll need bright light and your reading glasses if you want to put commands right into the machine as opposed to using the remote.I was able to program my universal remote to do some of the basic stuff but I still need the DVD's remote to do some of the more complex features.In summary, good machine for the basic stuff, which is really all I use it for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Died in a week","review":"Out of the box, the DV400 seemed like a decent player -- relative to my four year old Sony, it had better menu navigation, better remote, and more playback video/audio adjustments. Most importantly, it had the USB port, and it did a decent job of playing DIVX movie files.For the few days it worked.After about a week, it started skipping, stuttering, and stalling on every DVD attempted, even some that were literally brand new.

Basically, all he's done is re-write that work over and over (and over!) again ever since.

There is enough historical research to add color. And it certainly moves along well. Many of the events are not believable, but you can say the same for James Bond. The book jumps between history and legend easily and superficially. Boys grow into manhood overnight. Women fall deeply in love by seeing someone from afar. Crocodiles are much more aggressive than in real life. But it is easy reading for passing a few hours."},{"rating":"2","title":"Birds of Prey","review":"Another swashbuckling novel from the pen of Wilbur Smith that will not disappoint Wilbur Smith fans.

Flowery language. If you are not the maritime type you need a naval dictionary to absorb the action. On the other hand a wealth of information of how England built its Empire. Wherever there was no enemy, the Brits always managed to create one. The Boers in Southern Africa are people from the same stock as the Brits. Yet they had to have an enemy in that part of the world also, so the Boer war and many other wars at the Cape, would be inevitable.

There were parts of the story that I enjoyed but I found some of the graphic sex scenes to be disturbing and totally unnecessary to the plot. Smith went into such detail during some events of the story (like the weird sex scenes) and yet the last part of the story seemed to be rushed through. I found myself interested in the story but not dying to know what was going to happen next (like I felt while reading some of Smith's other books like The Seventh Scroll and River God.) Wilbur Smith is an excellent author and I will probably read Monsoon which is the continuation of Birds of Prey. I hope to be swept up in the adventure and NOT able to put THAT one down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Takes on water page one, sinks by page fifty.","review":"Set in the world of piracy in the 17th century, Birds of Prey trips up early. Hardly surprising, when in this masculine world you've still got women 'screaming wildly and clutching their bosoms' at the sound of gunfire. Maybe they did, maybe they didn't, but the prose is more painful than any blast of grapeshot. There are far too many examples of school play dialogue to list, but if you're looking for an exciting seafaring tale, you'd do much better to turn to 'The Golden Ocean' by Patrick O'Brian."},{"rating":"1","title":"A passable swashbuckling novel","review":"This is a reasonably good novel until it degenerates into a \\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\\" story. The author did not seem to know how to end the tale, and continued from one misadventure to another. The author failed to keep all of his characters on the same time line, a problem when an author does not outline things properly. He also disposes of various characters as if he is tired of them, or does not know what to do with them, in order to introduce new characters. Perhaps a few too many dead bodies left by the wayside."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is a wonderful escape from reality","review":"For those of you who read fiction an hour or so a day, this adventure story will give you something to live for. While reading the book, I relished the thought of getting home at night, exercising, doing my homework, opening a bag of good ole patatoe chips and then the ultimate escape ... cracking the best adventure story I have ever read.

For once, this book is backed by scientific research and the results are shown for experiments such as positive and negative outlooks, overcoming illness, likelihood to die early, the list goes on and on. 'Emotional Longevity' does not indicate the length of an emotion, but rather teaches us to view things in a light that will produce a much higher quality of life, and will ultimately lead to a much healthier, longer, and more fulfilling, realistic lifestyle.

It is simply written to make it easier to understand and really breaks down some principles that we all do in everyday life.

I really like this and think that is helpful for people to understand the basic management principles and theroies. One thing that i have find very usefully in this boook is the exhibits. The exhibits have helped me understand more clearly different concepts that I would not of understood with out them. I also like the testing page that are found at the end of the chapters. They are a really big help in making sure I understand the main concepts that were covered in that certain chapter.I do plan on keeping this book after I have finished my class at the end of this semester. I will think that it will be an excellent source for me to use when I have started teaching."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helped with Management class!!!","review":"This book was extremely helpful and was pre-owned when I bought it but that actually helped me!!!

Enjoyed the book very much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Journey into Management","review":"I have been studying this textbook all semester for a college course called Principles of Business Management. When I first looked at the book I found it eye catching. They made the book look like fun. I also became interested to learn what was in the book after reading the table of contents. My favorite section has probably been the chapters on leadership. I am very impressed that the authors put so much into this section of the book. They recognize that it is the most important part of management and I agree. We can learn all we want about how to manage but if no one follows our leadership then it is worthless knowledge. I cannot justly say how this book could be improved based on the information it provides. I haven't experienced being in a management position yet so I cannot discern what facts are useful or not. I found the book easy to understand and up to date. It was honestly one of my favorite books that I've used in a course so far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Textbook review: Fundamentals of Management","review":"Here is another review for another one of my classes, Principles of Business Management. The book is a lot easier to follow than the book I recently reviewed; \\"Marketing: Connecting with Customers.\\" In addition to more fluent material, the end of each chapter has questions to help prepare the student for exams, whereas the marketing book does not. Another pro to the book is that the material covered is up-to-date, accurate, and very useful in today's management situations. 20 years ago, you couldn't really sit down and read/study a book to become a better manager, whereas today it is made possible to do so. Figures, charts, graphs, and examples are also very useful and helpful in studying for exams. Cons about the book is that a few activities or interactive CD-ROM would have made the material more enjoyable to learn about. Overall rating, 4 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Business Management","review":"I really like this book, the way it is set up, the way it looks, and the way it is presented.

The illustrations used assisted the reader in understanding the information and the terms are clearly defined. Not only did I learn management skills and techniques, but also interpersonal communication skills. The author attempts to teach the reader what is most important in the management field and doesn't talk about anything that isn't relevant to the topic. It is straight to the point and easy to read. Overall, the layout of the entire book was put together in an organised manner and specific information is easy to find from the colours used to separate the topics. I would very much recommend this textbook for any Management course."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tis is a excellent book.","review":"I feel that the textbook, Fundamentals of Management by Stephen P. Robbins and David A. DeCenzo, is a good book for the beginning management student. The book made use of illustrating it's points by using graphs. This is important for the students who are having a hard time understanding what the author is trying to say. It's hard for someone to succeed at something if they do not understand the different aspects. I would recommend this book to anyone who is planning to have a career in business."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful!","review":"Based on other reviews I had at least moderate expectations for this game. I was very disappointed. The voice acting was not good. I have played games with worse (but not many). The plot was thin but acceptable. The puzzles were generally acceptable, but often required going back again and again to old places and pixel hunt for objects that had become active since the first time (or second or third...) you were there. The worst part was that the game play CRAWLED.

Paired with a handsome, black FBI agent, Jessica becomes invovled in a a last ditch attempt to free a man from death row.Unfortunately, this is one painful read. The dialogue is stilted and the FBI characters are so grossly unprofessional it counfounds belief. The governor is a stereotypical, racially insensitive, politically incorect, sexually aggressive pig. The confrontations with him quickly devolve into insults that ultimately have no consequence. The silly subplot about freeing the innocent man on death row quickly falls into the realm of the ridiculous.On the plus side, the victims are engaging and the serial killer is fairly well crafted and a refreshing change from the run-of-the-mill slice and dicer.

The authors do more than quote old sources. They actually give it to you. When a Jehova's Witness says \\"We never taught that,\\" you will have the documented proof in your hands.

Why? The main character, Hedrock, was born immortal by a genetic accident and he has been searching centuries for the secret to immortality, hoping to share it with the rest of mankind. Why? As many old timers assert, it isn't that much fun to outlive everyone you know.What was fascinating about this piece was van Vogt's attempt to portray an immortal human. Here was a character who had access to centuries of scientific invention. Since he was the only immortal, he took it upon himself to decide if and when these inventions should be released to benefit mankind. This is a god-like chore. Who would want this responsibility? Who would want to continue their life under these conditions? Hedrock did. Which goes to show that Hedrock wasn't human. Humans all die on time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly as described","review":"Purchased this for a fun party decoration - attached it to a utility clip light to give a pink glow to the room.

All four episodes are built around a formula, but it's a workable, proven formula. The plots are well developed for the alloted time and the characters are comfortably predictable.In \\"The Train Robbery\\" Roy discovers that a local merchant is working with the robbers to take the $50,000 loot. He successfully uncovers the villans and saves the town. In \\"Ride in the Death Wagon\\" Roy escapes a sinister plot and keeps a widow from being taken advantage of. In \\"Shoot to Kill\\" an eastern city slicker is caught up in trying to deceive people with his photos, pretending that Pat Brady is an outlaw, but the tables are turned on him.

I grew up in the navy. This is exactly how it was and is. Maybe it varies by region or base, but there are still major problems for enlisted wives. Poverty, isolation, and depression ARE common. Although there are women who are able to over come these issues, it is not common. Military families deserve higher pay, better benefits (tricare is pathetic) better housing (without asbestos) and access to childcare help/resources. None of this is available which lead to very sad living conditions for MOST enlisted wives. And yes there is extreme classism in the military, anybody who doesn't see it is not on the receiving end of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Offensive and Out of Date","review":"I agree that the first chapter is enough to make an enlisted wife cry or walk away from the book altogether. Most of what I read is now completely out of date and relating to a military that is very little like what we've experienced the last 10 years my husband has been in. I think the basic assumption that will make the enlisted wife feel offended is that all enlisted wives secretly wish they were officers wives. I see little reason to read this book now-days unless it is for posterity's sake. There are better, newer books out there. Ones that more accurately paint the picture of the current military wife. Look for those and skip this one altogether!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsophisticated nostalgic trip into the past","review":"Muerto el perro... is a mediocre narrative by an obvioiusly aging Cuban exile who dwells in his memories of a country and time gone by. However, unlike more sucessful writers of the Cuban diaspora, Miralejos fails to capture and captivate a more sophisticated reading public. He rambles on with a story of very transparent personal anecdotes that appear more like a cathartic exercise down memory lane. The language in the story is a mixture of Cuban registers and some other Latin American register--possibly his editors', thus sounding more like a fake to a Cuban (Cuban-American) who is very familiar with authentic Cuban choices of words and expressions. The novel reads flat and lacks sophistication of thought and plot.

Frosty and Rudolph's Christmas in July is just downright embarassingly bad. This DVD is full of real let downs...there's a reason TV channels don't rerun what's on this set. Move on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sheer Stupidity in putting this package together.","review":"Was someone asleep when they put this set together? Not only does the promo at the beginning of Disc 1 list \\"Little Drummer Boy-book II\\" as being part of the set, it's nowhere to be found on the package. Second, Disc 2 is a write off-having a completely different film by the same name as \\"The Year Without A Santa Claus\\" in place of the Rankin/Bass classic. With it's absence, you also lose the other features on that disc - namely \\"Rudolph's Shiny New Year\\" and \\"Nestor, the Long Eared Christmas Donkey\\". Thankfully, I do have those elsewhere, but I did buy this with the understanding that it would have \\"Little Drummer Boy-Book II, and it's not there.

This could have been a 5 star set if everything had been as advertised."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silent Night!!!","review":"Loved the movies that we first watched on disc 2...but as we got to disk 3...it was the classic production of Silent Night.

It is also very disappointing that Amazon do not appear to be doing anything about this problem, as from the various reviews it has been known about for some time.

I found all of these stories to be totally outdated for today's kids. It was an inexpensive purchase, but what's worse, is that this DVD will sit around the house.

This is just inexplicable--even when this was released a few years ago, it was quite unusual for high profile anamorphic films like this to be released only in a P&S version. I'd love to add this to my collection--here's hoping a propererly framed version is forthcoming (hopefully also in Blu-Ray or HD DVD)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Widescreen masterpiece, Pan and Scan Travesty","review":"I don't know why, in this day and age, some DVD companies still think that we need every one of the thousands of photographs that makes up these movies to be butchered just so they will fit the dimensions of our TV sets. Audiences are now smart enough to realize that movies need to be shown in their original format - we're paying for the whole movie, not some chopped up version. This is one of the funniest and most romantic movies ever made, and Fred Schepsi's beautiful town and images should not be chopped in half. Please re-release the widescreen version.

It was horrible. I was forced into renting it because we had to do this Cyrano de Bergerac/Roxanne compare/contrast sheet for French. I am unhappy that I had to shell out three bucks to rent a movie I never even really wanted to see. The fact that it was a bad movie didn't help the situation.Steve Martin may think he's being clever, but really he isn't. I absolutely hated his charcter, who, despite his big nose, was awfully cocky. Now, I wasn't a huge fan of the real Cyrano de Bergerac, so that MAY be part of the problem. Nevertheless, the plot made me roll my eyes and every bit of the movie bored me to tears. Please try to find something that is actually witty and funny, like The Simpsons. The Simpsons knows how to paraody literature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Roxanne stills has the stuff","review":"Watched this on Blu-Ray for the first time in many years. While not as impactful when we saw in the first time during its heyday, it still holds together pretty well after all of these years. The story line is classic and is laced with enough Steven Martin-esque humor to keep you chuckling. The dated setting and costuming, hair styles and dialogue remind us of how far we've come since that time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally charming & enjoyable","review":"Plenty of charm & wit and comic stupidity in this.Steve Martin is absolutely MARVELOUS in this role - and the role he plays is one you'll totally love. Intelligent, athletic, brave, sweet, charming and witty. You'll enjoy the scenes where he cleans the clocks of stupid men picking on his oversized nose - he does it with total style and humor. And the 20 insults (against his nose) that he comes up with himself are pretty funny.A cute adaptation of Shakesphere's famous Cyrano - although the nitwits who make up the fire department in this little town are just a little TOO stupid for my tastes.But this was indeed overall a charming and enjoyable movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Low resolution?","review":"This is a great movie - love it.But I agree the with the comments that the \\"made for TV version\\" leaves a lot to be desired.Did anyone else notice a very grainy low resolution picture?

So much so that I've heard it all before in her earlier albums; every track reminds me of some track of her earlier works. Lyrics are generally childish.I count myself as a big fan of Enya, but this is definitely not her best work. Not on par with \\"A Day Without Rain\\" or \\"The Memory of Trees.\\" Only memorable track for me is \\"Long Long Journey\\" and that, probably, because it reminds me so much \\"On My Way Home\\" (one of my absolute favorites).Count me as disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing....","review":"The REAL reason this album sucks is becuase she's singing in English.

Just good.","review":"This is a good cd. It's obviously similar to her other work, with a few new tunes. The thing I love most about Enya is her haunting vocals, and the tunes are haunting too, but merge into the same sort of tunes. There aren't any stand out songs here, but I do enjoy listening to this overall. Nothing will ever be better than Carribean Blue and Only Time. It's been a long time between drinks, but not quite worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy this CD!!","review":"This new CD is a gem in the crown of this beautiful woman with a beautiful voice. I never tire of her CD's that I have had for years and this is a VERY welcome addition to that collection. This CD is wonderful from the first track to the last and my favorite on it is \\"If I could be where you are\\". But then, it is difficult to pick a favorite from this CD. They all shine. If you have ever liked any music that is Celtic or any music that Enya has done in the past, buy this CD!! Even for the average music lover this is one of the best, if not the best CD's just out on the market.

A Day Without Rain is her best and every track is exceptional, but this is boring with no good melodies at all. Title track (Amarantine) starts our OK but the middle chorus is awful and ruins the song. Where did that come from? Shame. Nothing else even stands out here - you can skip this one - don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing collector's edition","review":"Here we have -again- an exquisite product, as all made about Enya, again luxuriously finished, again a detailed item. The red velver case with gold stamped logos and titles is just precious. And the contents, the 148 page book, deliciously written by Roma Ryan is the big surprise of this collector's edition, full of pictures and of course including the CD and the lyrics of each song, both english and in the \\"loxian\\" language created by Roma where available.For Enya and not Enya fans, just get this one if you want to know more about the creating process of the album Amarantine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Appalled - Very disappointing","review":"I love Enya with all my heart and was anxiously anticipating this new album. I love how her music is so moving and mood altering.However, this album absolutely stunned me. It does not possess the mood of the other albums, has nothing consequential to say, and sounds more like an album of children's songs with the simple melodies and highly predictable lyrics.There are 2 songs on this entire album that I \\"like\\" but none i love.I hope future endeavors do not duplicate this horrific collection.I guess I will have to wait another 5 years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment","review":"Wow, never thought I'd write a bad review of any of Enya's work but........I'm hugely disappointed! I am also a BIG fan of her music but not this CD. The lyrics are poor and too repeatative, I find myself hitting the skip button on several tracks. I've listened to it several times but just can't warm up to but a couple of tracks. Recommend you skip this CD and dust off her older work."},{"rating":"1","title":"very middle of the road:the Sade of New age music","review":"enya is like the Sade of New age Music in that nobody can lay claim to the way they put stylings down&are able to build catelogs of material.a Proven formula that has worked. Enya's latest Amarantine sounds like leftovers from the past albums that didn't quite make the cut. very average at best.I ain't felt a Enya album in years,but like How Sade is able to maintain what she has done over the past couple of decades Enya has been able to do her thing,but this album shows a artist running short on new ideas but safe on formula."},{"rating":"1","title":"My least favorite Enya","review":"Not much new here. Enya's voice is as beautiful as ever but the songs sound pretty much the same as the ones on all of her earlier recordings. The title piece, \\"Amarantine,\\" I find to be annoying. If I listen to this track the refrain just plays over and over in my head afterwords and drives me nuts - because its just the one word Amarantine. Over and over and over and over..... AAAAAAAAARRRGGGGG! Now when I play this CD, in the interest of my sanity, I just skip over this track."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enchanting Enya","review":"If you like \\"Enya\\", you will love this C.D.. It has been years since her last recording. This was worth waiting for.

I would buy CD of hers. Excellent!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sounds from Heaven","review":"It is no coincidence that this CD was released on November 22nd., which is associated with St. Cecilia's Day. In John Dryden's Ode to St. Cecilia, he portays St. Cecilia as having a voice so pure that when an angel heard it, he appeared before her, mistaking earth for heaven. This is the best way to describe this Enya CD. I recommend this CD to anyone who wants to be uplifted to the sounds of heaven in these troublesome times!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok, if you want some meditation music","review":"I think I've figured out the formula behind Enya's songs. First take out a mad libs, write \\"light\\", \\"love\\", \\"dark\\", \\"flower\\", \\"sea\\", and \\"stars\\" in the blank spots. Add some wispy and haunting ballads, rinse, and repeat.I almost fell asleep listening to this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not uplifting like the rest of her work","review":"As usual, the composition of the pieces on this CD were done beautifully, but I was disappointed. I like everything I've heard by Enya thus far, but I hadn't listened to this CD before buying it. I found the music to be a real downer and depressing...the kind of music you put on if you need a good cry. I had hoped it would be uplifting like the rest of her CD's. Enya is very talented and everything she does is outstanding including this CD, it just wasn't the type of music I had wanted."},{"rating":"1","title":"too much pop","review":"Enya has such a lovely voice. I have truly enjoyed her music, but this CD was a big disappointment. It seemed to stray from her roots. Enya's music has always taken me to my Celtic roots, but this CD was too much pop."},{"rating":"1","title":"More of the same","review":"Having being a fun of Enya since her early works, I can only listen to her new CD with mixed feelings. Although it containes some really beautiful pieces, it is still way too convervative. I mostly love her darker eerier stuff, but unfortunately Enya seems to aim more to the average listener with those white, childish, and innocent songs. Years ago it was time for Enya to switch gears to something newer, so right now she sounds greatly outdated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utterly unoriginal, utterly un- interesting","review":"I have loved some of Enya's records before, as have most people. That is why this album is so disappointing. It is a complete rip-off. There is not an original sound or thought on it! I really wish I could get my money back. And the company that handles her should be just as ashamed for milking the cow she has apparently become. Don't waste your money...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love Enya, but not this one","review":"I truely adore Enya's music. I have almost everything she has done and listen to them repeatedly. In fact, she is my favorite choice to listen to in the dentist's chair while undergoing nitrous oxide! However, this one left me cold (with the exception of track #7, which is very pretty). The songs and music on this album lack the grace, lyrical qualities, enchantment, and ability to carry me away that the rest of her music manages effortlessly to do. One of Enyas most ardent fans, I'm sorry to say, was let down big by this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ho-Hum","review":"I've been a fan of Enya for quite a few years now, almost since the get go, and I must say I am rather disapointed with this album. It's not horrible, but I agree with other reviewers....there is just nothing new or exciting to make me want to keep playing it.I am suspiscious about the release of this CD because a few months supposedly Enya used the title track in a Japanese electronics commercial, the company who owned the product leaked the info that one could hear Enya's commercial song on her up-coming CD. This info was then written off on Enya's official website as a misunderstanding...no new CD was due out.And then lo and behold, not more then 5 months later the CD is released. Was this coincidence? Did she feel the need to throw something out there just so people could pick up the track heard in the commercial? I don't know. I hope not.I just hope that her next CD is adventerous and exciting and happens within the proximity of 3 years."},{"rating":"1","title":"All good things...","review":"I'm an ardent fan, and after 5 years was distressed to find what a poor CD she released. Everyone peaks eventually, I'm just sorry it happened to one of my favourite artists. I should have waited and bought it used."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"For all that Enya has a lovely voice, this disc is surprisingly bland - it has now reached the point for me that, on the whole, Enya's more recent discs all sound the same. I commented to a friend after the first listen that it was \\"more of the same,\\" and it is: interchangeable, tepid songs. The only ear-catching track for me is The River Sings; at least there's some life in it. Otherwise, it's another disc of echoey, uninspiring material. And that truly is a shame, since her earlier material broke some new ground. She needs to now break out of her own self-inflicted box and stretch a bit. Lesson learned - I'll make sure to hear the disc before purchase next time, since one lively song isn't enough to make me purchase a disc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaves much to be desired","review":"It seems that many would disagree with me on this, but I was very disappointed with this CD. And believe me, I absolutely love Enya! However, I still have not been able to listen to Amarantine's songs in their entirety because I find myself so irritated...not by the music itself, mind you, but by the lyrics!While Enya's music is as beautiful and moving as ever, Roma Ryan's lyric-writing skills leave much to be desired. They are extremely shoddy, cheesy, and make it seem as if she is an amateur. The only tracks I like to listen to are the opening track and the one without lyrics...the others I find to be spoiled by her bad rhymes and repetitive, boring words. I will grant that the Loxian language is nice, but that's all I can compliment Mrs. Ryan with.If you're looking for a more enjoyable Enya CD, I recommend that you look to her earlier work."},{"rating":"2","title":"I've learned to shut up... and wait","review":"Like many of you, I felt indifference on first listen to this new CD by one of my favorite artists. But I know well enough now, after feeling the same about the last three releases, to just sit back and wait... and, sure enough, I have found myself turning this on every day, more than once a day, and loving it after all. I think, in a world of downloads and one hit wonders, Enya is the last of the \\"album artists\\" and knows it. Her CDs feel almost like symphonies where it's not advisable to skip around tracks; it's like one long movement and you should just hit \\"Play\\" and let the journey begin. What first felt like droning now fits right into the whole piece like a nice dream. Maybe nothing new but still beautiful -- and, let's face it, what do we want, \\"The Enya Disco Album?\\" We all know we will get MUCH more mileage from this beautiful music than virtually any other CD we will buy this year. A true artist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Music to slit your wrists by","review":"People in hospitals in comas would get out of bed to turn this depressing dog droll off. How Enya is # 2 in Ireland in sales after U2 is much more evidence of the greatness of U2 than the quality of the totally depressing music Enya dispenses. After some 5 years since the huge hit \\"Only Time\\", this album sounds even more morose."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"The Carpenters on valium\\" says it all","review":"Di Liberto's quip sums this up. I defy anyone to tell one Enya CD from another, and this is no exception. That said, regurgitating the same set of reverb certainly buys you a nice castle south of Dublin. Living next door to Bono hasn't done anything for her sense of adventure musically, but she knows what her public will swallow gladly.The pretentiousness of \\"inventing\\" a \\"language\\" speaks for itself. In fact, spills out volumes. Perhaps she'll have a tryst with Jon Anderson and the world will implode with the arrival of their demon child. In the meantime, I'd like to think the world has moved beyond this treacle. Not so...."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Day Without Pain","review":"Almost a year after it's initial release, and because of the horror of September 11, this hack singer [yeah, right] / songwriter [oh, please] had the biggest selling piece of tripe of her career with the abhorrent 'A Day Without Rain', a dismal cacophony of synths and ooze that the world seemed to grasp onto as a sign of distorted comfort. Well, she's back...and as misguided as ever. More quasi-Celtic schmaltz juxtaposed with her archaic wheeze of a voice, it took 5 years to come up with this monstrosity. She's an insult to the true musical aesthete. My grade: D+"},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent performance by Enya","review":"I would have to say its not her Best work but still a solid album if you are a fan. Three Songs I really enjoyed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Special voice","review":"Enya has an amazing voice and each of her songs allows you to listen to how special her voice truely is. I had never bought any of Enya's music until about a year ago, and I was blown away when I listened to a little clip on Amazon.com the site suggested that due to my interests I might want it, and it was right. I have since asked for (and gotten) the large 4 CD set of her from my husband for my birthday back in Jan, and bring it in the car, to work and back home again."},{"rating":"2","title":"More of a Good Thing","review":"Enya's music progresses slowly, which in her case is a good thing. The tracks on this CD are just as heavenly and ephemeral as those on any of her previous efforts. It is funny with Enya- you expect that voice and those same atmospheres with every CD and in one sense you might fear that it will be \\"just more of the same\\" or even feel trite in some way; but it never is. She stays true to form yet evolves just enough to always keep it beautiful and interesting. This is another top notch effort from her. I strongly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One song is worth price of admission","review":"IF I COULD BE WHERE YOU AREIf you have ever lost someone and if you can appreciate an angelic voice, then this album is worth it for this song alone, the entire album is very good, its not enya's best, that title belongs to Shepard moons, but this is still a very good album. IF I COULD BE WHERE YOU ARE might very well be her best ballad ever, hard to say, but I fell in love with it. I am nearly afraid to share it with some friends of mine who would never otherwise hear it. The song will make you want to break down, if you have a soul. Music that has that sort of impact on people is powerful, and should be cherished, as should this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent!!","review":"I feel no need to write a long drawn out review here.

Looked forward to a new one. We pre ordered, it came and...Talk about non-triditional...It's boring...for lack of a better word. With the talent she has, what a terrible waste. Maybe I'm too old fashion, but making up a language along the way just to get the sounds..... In one cut the same sounds, (as they are not words) are repeated so many times I thought the CD player was stuck. I got up and gave it a wack.

I listen to it all the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice.","review":"I have to say that I'm not surprised that they chose this for the first single because it does have that mainstream appeal, although it wouldn't have been my first choice (I would have to say It's In The Rain or Less Than A Pearl should have been, simply because I love those) Not to criticize Amarantine at all, it's one of my favorite tracks on the album. Moving on to Comb of the Winds, this makes the single all worth the purchase. It's such a beautiful piece, one of the best instrumentals given to us by Enya in my opinion. The Spaghetti Western wasn't really my cup of tea. I would say add this to your collection, it's worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeps Getting Better","review":"Upon hearing that Enya was going to be releasing a new album, I counted down the days until I would be able to listen to it. So, when it was released on December 21st, I sat down and listened to the album in it's entirety in optimal listening conditions.This album does not disappoint. Upon the first listening of the album, the tracks that stood out for me were \\"The River Sings\\", \\"Long Long Journey\\", and \\"Somebody Said Goodbye\\". At first I wanted to dismiss \\"It's In The Rain\\", but like the rest of the album, after listening to it multiple times, mostly by chance (shuffle), I realized that it's one of my favorite tracks of the album. There is no bad track in this album, and is on par with a best of CD.This is definitely a wonderful addition to anybody's collection. I only wish that she would release these wonderful masterpieces more frequently."},{"rating":"2","title":"good but not great","review":"There is not perfect harmony throughout the cd. can be shocking during chill time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely gorgeous","review":"I've been an Enya fan for years, and this is as fine as anything she's done. Any devotees of Celtic music will love it. In particular, fans of Loreena McKennitt, Secret Garden, Eden's Bridge and Celtic Woman will revel in Enya's lovely vocals and instrumentals."},{"rating":"2","title":"A day without rain vs Amarantine.","review":"I am a bit disappointed about this cd. I was very anxious because i wanted to listen to a new enya's cd. Today, i listened to it and i discovered that something is missing.I dont know what is it, but it misses. Maybe, there are no the rythms of some well known songs as Orinoco Flows or Anywhere is.I loved some songs as \\"Amarantine\\", \\"Less a pearl\\" (Excuse me if i dont remember very well the songs.),and other.But if i had to choose between \\"A day without rain\\" and \\"Amarantine\\", i would prefer the first one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not her best...","review":"To be perfectly honest, I didn't like Amarantine very much, only a little, whereas I love her other albums. This is definitely not her best, and five years is too long to wait for a rather disappointing album. The songs are reminiscent (I do no want to use the word \\"rehashed\\") of her older -and better- ones. One example is \\"Someone Said Goodbye\\" which is very similar in theme and rythm to \\"One by One\\" in \\"A Day Without Rain\\". Buy it only if you're a die-hard Enya fan, but if you're new to her music, try her master-pieces, Watermark, The Memory of Trees, and The Celts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Something for everyone.","review":"A mix of Loxian and English tunes.

He is all grown up and able to torment someone to the point where I had to cover my eyes a few times. The movie is quite good for this type of low budget thriller. A twist ending that you can predict quite easily. Very watchable but be prepared for all the graphic torture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sigh","review":"this would have been a much, much, much better movie without the twist ending. A mother and father want to punish the serial killer who tortured and killed their son. Honestly, who wouldn't sympathize with that? So Mom and Dad kidnap the killer while he is being transported to a prison and lock him up in a empty cabin's basement and torture him.This is not easy for them, as they are not evil like the serial killer is, the mother especially has a hard time sometimes. Makes sense. Realistically done. Super.However, the twist ending blew everything out of the water. Now, there is not necessarily anything wrong with twist endings, as long as they are delivered and executed well and enhance the plot. In this case, it did NOT happen. It only ruined the movie and completely cheapened the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"tortured","review":"This is a real gruesom and extremely intense movie.It kept me on the edge of my seat through out the entire movie.This was a very good movie.

Lacking that, purchasers of any waterproof case should ask their hardware store for lead flashing that can be cut in to pieces to fit inside the case to obtain the same objective.The case, by the way, makes focusing and aiming very difficult when snorkeling in bright light."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"I want to share a thought I wish someone had given me before I bought this. First off you don't need any weights to use this camera while scuba diving; second the screw for these weights to be attached to the camera is no good as it is not long and tight enough and does not lock down very well resulting in me losing the weights the first time I used them. It was a complete wsate of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worked just fine.","review":"I recently used these weights with the underwater case WP-DC31 for my Canon PowerShot SD780 IS. I went on a total of 12 dives with the camera and it seemed perfectly weighted although I never tried the case without the weight to see if there was a difference. I only gave these weights 4 stars because of the difficulty I had figuring out how many weights I should use. The website listed on the documentation was a dead end so I had to search for the proper website. I found it at the bottom of the following page (take out the spaces): [...] According to the website, my camera only required one weight. I read previous reviews so I put some pipe thread tape on the screw and the weight stayed secure through all 12 dives."},{"rating":"2","title":"Expensive, but necessary","review":"These little weights are made of high quality stainless steel.

I've been looking for it for a VERY long time to buy and finally saw that the International Movie Database (www.imdb.com) has data on it and I bought it immediately on Amazon. I can't wait to watch it again after all those years...

She decides to turn the tables by having an affair with mysterious, seductive photographer Martin Hewitt. Before too long, this heated affair is not what it seems, as Hewitt appears to have a dark side which could lead to a fatal conclusion. Stiff acting, horrible writing, and contrived directing all add up to one extremely boring flick. While the film does feature rather hot sex scenes (most films of this sort do), it can not compensate for much else. Julie Strain is featured in a 5 minute cameo in a Japanese restaurant bathroom, coupled with Hewitt in a rather graphic, yet amazingly hot sex scene--which earns this film its second star. Otherwise, skip it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unforgettable and True","review":"A Jest of God epitomises Margaret Laurence's focus on characters whose stories are usually never told. The protagonist, Rachel, is a spinster school-teacher in small town Manitoba. She is stifled both by her closed community and by internalising their pettiness.Rachel's inner-dialogue sets the claustophobic atmosphere, while also being funny, frustrating and moving. Laurence's portrait of an ordinairy woman coming to terms with herself and with surroundings is flawless and highly readable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Merely pseudo-sophisto background noodling","review":"2 1/2Undercooked electronic experimentation pales in comparison to artist's more beat-driven, thoughtfully layered Prefuse 73. Here, Heron just lazily equates scatter-shot noise, mediocre, redundantly annoying Spanish vocals, and very little semblance of melody with something cutting-edge. It is not. Although the disc does work best inside pocket moments of inspired fusion, on a whole it is a lackluster release, hardly justified buying for anyone but devout fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"gooey","review":"I approached this album with great hopes of sinking my teeth into some great Catalan folk music. But i was disappointed. I listened some more but i was still disappointed. This album rarely resolves into something that doesn't sound like a yellow/grey goo.The vocals are (vaguely) pretty but too breathy and indistinct for much emotion to be carried. And the music sounds like it has been pulped and reconstituted resulting in bland characterless sound. There is some interesting subtleties - the gentle drum pattering can be engaging.Overall though an underwhelming experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for tool tune-ups and alignment","review":"I've been having some problems getting my jointer tables aligned properly, and happened upon this book by accident.

Why not try and change a little or something. Zack's voice is completly unique and trying to mimic it is almost impossible.

They are a very powerful band, with powerful lyrics and a powerful sound. So you would think they might get a good tribute, right? Nope, they don't. What they get is a horrible tribute by ameteurs(who the hell are the 'Renegadez of Funk?'). They are some rock band. But why don't they mix up different styles of music to Rage Against the Machine songs? Like some punk, rap... Anything that will be a little interesting that this garbage. Some of the songs on here are not even Rage Against the Machine songs. Yeah, they were on the 'Renegades' album, but those were only covers of songs from Rage Against the Machine's favorite artists and songs.

The singer on those clips had no energy and didn't sound like Zack at all. That ruined it for me because the music actually sounded really close to the real thing.

It's a concise retelling of the events, so that's nice. But it imparts no greater understanding or context. Among the problems: The writing is bland. The book gives almost no explanation for Enron's rise before the calamitous fall. It never makes clear exactly why Enron had to go bankrupt. This account spends hardly any time on Arthur Andersen's role, even thought it led to that accounting firm's ruin. The authors also have an odd obsession with Michael Milken, even though he seems peripheral to the Enron story. If you've missed the news in the past seven months, this book can quickly give you the outline of the Enron saga. Otherwise, save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"What went wrong at Enron","review":"The book was thrown together.

I do not recommend this book for anyone who really wants to understand what happened at Enron."},{"rating":"1","title":"no advancement!","review":"There were no ideas that were not developed by the 1960's in this book. There were a lot of stereotypical 'war stories' of stuttering. The old mantra of self-esteem, which is being proven scientifically false over and over, is trotted out and delved into at length. Additionally, a lot of work is spent on relaxation technigues, coupled with manipulating the way you think about things (called framing in the book). Basically the author encourages one to 'get over it'. There are some slick new acronyms such as PWS (the person who stutters!!!) but come on...no advancement.I'd encourage interested readers to check out the Valsalva techniques found in other books such as by William Parry. Also do a Google search - there are some interesting articles about research on the left vs right brain usage that are beneficial to be aware of and focus on."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is cheap","review":"I bought this and was highly disappointed - all the notes practically sound the same - it's incredible small - more for a child who wants to make noise.

It's about time.Except, perhaps, for his opening monologue, DeVito doesn't put a foot wrong.

(But it would be more fun on DVD.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this movie","review":"This is a really great movie. I have been waiting forever for it to come out on DVD. Devito is really good in this role. I love the way that he carries his character. A very big man in very little shoes. Peck and Miller are also a pleasure to watch in their supporting roles. And Devito's \\"Buggy Whip\\" speech in the proxy fight is fantastic. It's similar to Douglas's \\"Greed\\" speech in Wall Street in that it is an uncomfortable truth, but the truth none-the-less. I very happy that this finally came out."},{"rating":"2","title":"An amusing morality tale of business and a teaching tool.","review":"Looking for a teaching tool for undergraduates who would not have cultural contacts with the corporate environment, this film has been a useful introduction to the current corporate crazes. As Tom Wolfe depicted the markets in \\"Barnfire of the Vanities\\", this little comedy has a useful correlate in alerting us to some of the paradoxes of the business world. It is not always true that the capitalist using the 'bottom-line mentality' is the enemy of anyone but those who misuse the power and authority of managing a business. As \\"Wallstreet\\" depicts aspects of \\"insider-trading\\", OPM weaves its own morality play about the nature of \\"nice\\" when the issue is \\"performing\\" when you have borrowed other people's money. It is a good screenplay, a tight drama, and a useful experience for a college level audience. END"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great one!","review":"One of my favorite movies.

DeVito is his usual funny, and easy-going self, while Gregory Peck is a strong-willed patriarch. Very good stuff there. The weakest performance is from Penelope Ann Miller, who isn't really convincing as the corporate attorney, but the material is so good that it saves the movie. This is a 5 star film, however, it loses a 1/2 star, because of the last scene, which feels a bit tacked on. Otherwise, a smart and funny film from the director of Moonstruck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining and even educational","review":"In general, I like most Danny DeVito films.

I just tossed the DVD out, so I can't tell you if the quality is what I think it is.

The title read \\"Yoga DVD for Beginners, seniors....\\" and that coupled with the price made it an attractive product for me. I must say that after I loaded it and began the routine, I quickly found that this was not for a beginner! The instructor does not start by first giving an overview of the upcoming routine - this made it very difficult to follow, especially when you are in an inverted position and must look up at the screen to determine the next move/position.

But the stories have Ransome's wonderful ingredients of families of kids having real sailing adventures together, strong roles for girls, enough action (these are the more action-filled of Ransome's stories) to satisfy all but the jaded, and plots that don't disturb parents.

They are campy, fairly low budget flicks shot for straight-to-video. Nevertheless, I enjoyed them quite a bit.This piece of film sludge has NOTHING in common (except the budget, perhaps) with Charles Band's earlier works. There is absolutely no redeeming qualities to this poorly worked trilogy. The acting can only aspire to be pure dreck. There aren't even any good sex scenes to make up for the rest.

Get the Panasonic KP-150. It's a much better investment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chinese made","review":"Item is not made in the USA as stated in the product description.

This product has lasted a mere five months. Rarely used, it often sticks, overheats after only a few uses, and then ceases to work at all.I had hoped a sharpener of better quality would last longer, especially considering it isn't even used very often. It would seem I was mistaken."},{"rating":"1","title":"Returned it","review":"Agree with the previous reviewer. Office Depot is currently selling the made-in-china X-acto brand sharpener. Bought one and returned it after three pencils. Didn't seem to have much power, stalled the motor on the first pencil. Created nice sharp points though, just not always centered on the pencil. I'm looking for another sharpener."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusion over the model","review":"REVISED 1/2/2008: I ordered the Hunt Boston 1800 electric sharpener from Shoplet and received the X-Acto XLR Electric Pencil Sharpener. In talking with Shoplet's Customer Service department the Amazon link is attached to the X-Acto product in Shoplet's inventory. X-Acto, as well as Hunt & Boston, are now Elmer's Products, Inc. brands. I tried to research on the web whether the Hunt Boston 1800 is still made; it is unclear. This maybe the only model currently available.Shoplet issued me a full refund of the product and let me keep it. We have are not heavy pencil users and have only sharpened 10+ pencils so far. But these are fine. The pencils have pin-sharp points. Occasionally with an unsharpened pencil the sharpener's \\"auto-shutoff\\" does not activate and I pull the pencil out to check if it is sharp; but other than that, the unit is working fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Low Quality","review":"Purchased this item in March 2012 and have used it lightly over the past 5 months. Found it to be cheaply made and very difficult to get the sharpener to function when pencil was inserted. Almost everytime I used it I had to manuever the pencil within the sharpener to get the sharpening motor to engage and sharpen the pencil. While this unit works it takes too much time to manipulate the pencil to engage the sharpener. Better off with an old school manual (non electric) sharpener rather than this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not sure if hole for pencil is supposed to be almost too small...","review":"Plugged it in, sharpened pencils well as you would expect.I have not figured out the \\"over sharpening prevention\\" feature. I was able to grind down a new pencil to half its size with no problem.Noticed that with \\"ridged\\" pencils (as opposed to round) sometimes catch on the sides of the hole when sharpening, as if the hole were a tiny bit too small. Maybe that's a feature that prevents the pencil from turning while sharpening.Otherwise- it's a good solid electric sharpener."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, solid, reliable.","review":"I can sharpen a pencil within 3 - 7 seconds, and get it nice and pointy, without a wooden foreskin happening. You know what I'm talking about. You sharpen with certain sharpeners, and there's this long wooden piece that flaps over the lead, and makes it impossible to write with. The X-acto sharpener makes a nice, neat point that's easy to write with. I sharpened (in a row) a whole box of pencils, with no problems.Only reason I'm not rating this a full 5 stars is because the thing is /noisy/. And I mean really noisy. It also shakes a lot. Even though I'm compelled to hold it down with my hands, it's not necessary. However, because of how much it vibrates and shakes and noise-makes, I make sure to hold it down with my hands anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Good","review":"This pencil sharpener just arrived today and it doesn't work at all.

But with our son in grade school, and going through pencils like crazy, we felt it was time to go electric, and, so far we're very pleased with the X-Acto Electric Pencil Sharpener (1818).The no-frills sharpener does exactly what it promises to do, delivering evenly-sharpened pencils for a reasonable price. It's got a good weight to it with the added benefit of non-skid rubber feet to make sure it doesn't scoot across the desk. And, just in case you happen to be in a pencil-sharpening frenzy, it has a thermal overload feature that shuts off an overheated motor so it won't burn out. To date, it hasn't needed to do that, although we don't usually sharpen more than a half-dozen pencils at a time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Let Down","review":"I bought this for my 3 kids. I read many of the sharpener reviews and decided on this one. We used it maybe three times and after that the machine will not turn off.

How hard can it be to make a good pencil sharpener?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Trust the other reviews -- this does NOT sharpen evenly!","review":"I returned this item immediately. Like other reviewers have indicated, this does not sharpen pencils evenly. It left a sliver of wood along one edge of the pencil that you have to peel off with your fingernails.

All pencils had the evil sliver.I cannot recommend this item."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Electric Sharpener for the Price","review":"Sharpens pencils very well.

I didn't think I needed to spend $50 to get a decent electric pencil sharpener. No matter what type of pencil I try to sharpen, it always sharpens it mostly on one side, leaving the other side still encased in wood. Then, I have to pick off the wood on the unsharpened side. I also purchased an ipoint pencil sharpener and have the same problem. At work, we have a 20 year old Panasonic, and I wind up bringing pencils from home to sharpen them perfectly and then bring them home again.

It seems to overheat, but doesn't have an auto shut-off, so it finally stopped working altogether.

I know electric sharpeners aren't cheap, but I just didn't want to spring for one of the more expensive ones. I put an un-sharpened pencil in the sharpener. Nothing happened. I took it out, put it in again. Applied a little more pressure this time and got a hum out of the motor, but no sharpening. I tried a pencil that had already been sharpened, but needed a finer point. More of a hum, but still no sound like anything was moving in there.If it doesn't work out of the box, I'm not even going to try another. Packed it back up, requested a refund and sent it back.

I can't tell you how frustrating it is when you order an item (PRIME) overnight and it doesn't work. I could of easily gone to Staples etc... but that defeats the purpose of buying from Amazon which is suppose to be quick and easy at the comfort of your pc!

Unfortunately I saw them in a dive club where the atmosphere was cool, but it was hard to see anything and the sound was mediocre. Just like watching the Superbowl in person versus HDTV, there's nothing like being there, but there's also nothing like having the best seat in the house where you can see and hear everything perfectly and not get other people's beer spilled on you. This DVD captures the shows that I saw perfectly.Winger basically defines the high-water mark for hair-pop-metal when it comes to musicianship, and seeing them now is like seeing Charlie Parker in the early 50s.

I only wanted to see it because it was filmed in Cleveland and it was weird seeing familiar streets on my TV. I have never been a big Rob Lowe fan-I always thought of him as a slick pretty boy-but he actually ACTED in this movie.

Instead of sounding like a poor man's Queensryche they now sound like a metal act on par with the likes of Savatage, Symphony X, and Blind Guardian. Khan's vocals dominate this album, but that doesn't mean that Youngblood's mighty guitars should be ignored. He manages to combine great talent for rhythym with an amazing ear for leads and solos. By this point he's actually surpassed Michael Romeo of Symphony X as a songwriter (sorry Mike). However, what makes this album a true triumph is the presence of so many great guest musicians, particularly the collection of Keyboardists and guest vocalists that add to the overall sound a great deal.

Huge choruses, blistering guitars, nifty interludes, passionate singing, all of it is included in this package of a pure power and I should say progressive piece of art. A smart occasional use of female voice adds to this epic opus, so is the brilliant production.The album consists of a collection of slower and faster tracks that grab the listener entirely. All of them really stand out, and therefore it is hard to pick the best or the worst. Song writing is top notch, that is what Kamelot is known for, but 'Epica' carries the special atmosphere that really puts it on top of their previous work.Not many albums are equal or come close to this masterpiece that is certainly among the best in business."},{"rating":"2","title":"Black River","review":"Once again I had trouble putting this book down.

Alan Tudyk's portrayal as Sonny, the robot with its own personality that can choose not to obey the three laws was really good. He really is the soul of the film.I admire the fact that director Alex Proyas tried to blend a good science fiction story with a popcorn movie mentality, although it falls well short of being a classic because of that. Even the special effects, the fights, and the bots were all good. This is one of Smith's better movies (up there with Independence Day). The film works, but one wonders what could have been if Smith didn't always try for a laugh, or if they went for a darker feel. However, despite those problems, it was a fun film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining, enjoyable, recommended","review":"This is a sci-fi film with a good story, a mystery that gets solved, and some good action scenes. If that's what you like in films, you'll like 'I, Robot'.The special effects were probably state-of-the-art at the time (2004), but sometimes look a little dated now. This did not affect my enjoyment.If you look for subtle characterization and psychological interplay between characters, you won't find it in 'I, Robot', and you would not rate the film as highly as I do.The general background is inspired by Isaac Asimov's stories about robots, and the character of Susan Calvin is more or less the same as Asimov's Susan Calvin. But the story is new."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent film","review":"I haven't read the book that this movie was based off, so I have nothing to compare it with.

The evolution of robots into laborers appears to be within the grasp of modern technology, and robots beginning to take control of the humans who made them is already here . . like in space travel or microsurgery where people are unable to take manual control of the process . . . This concept goes back to RUR, the Czech play of decades ago, but, in any case, this version dissolved into a juvenile shoot-em-up. Instead of a thoughtful presentation of robots and their potential dangerous side effects, an examination of the advantages and disadvantages of these mechanical workers, it becomes a trivialized and stereotypical piece of nonsense, with the nasty corporate leader, the pretty but skeptical female scientist, the crusty and unbelieving police captain, and the hero, who survives in spite of himself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor 3D","review":"I had the original I robot and bought the new 3d version with some great expectation.

Just got mine,(on its release date),and all I've got to say is, this dvd has got some of THE best 3D I have ever seen. BAR NONE! I understand it wasn't shot in stereo, however, some of the 3D is actually better than some that were. Coulda fooled me. All other studios with your massive catalogues of dvds take notice! This is no joke. I'm thinking with most of the 3D films out there done in post anyway,(not shot with stereo cameras ),this is a no-brainer. \\"I Robot\\" looks as though it was planned shot by shot for 3D, filmed in 3D, and distributed in 3D. As my 24 yr.old son and I watched this dvd on my 65 inch LG 3D set,he said to me, \\"There's no way you could convince me this dvd wasn't originally in 3D if I didn't know it for sure already.\\"So, all you other studios need to get on board with this.

It held my interest for only a few seconds (which I think it's obvious which scene that was, I wasn't expecting that) There are special effects, but those could be created with a computer for any movie at any time. I like Will Smith, but this just doesn't do it for me. If sci-fi is what you crave, I would say look elsewhere.

I would normally purchase the Region 1 version from Amazon in NTSC because it is running at the correct speed of 24fps, but with all the extras available here in Sydney, Ive decided to get the PAL version at 25fps. Perhaps they will announce a special addition after you have already brought the U.S. version!!!! The same thing happened with the Australian 2-disc of The Day After Tomorrow - it has a separate disc with a lot more special features. Has the studio tried to fit everything on one disc and therefore removed alot of the special features? Also, because these Australian versions have only the movie on one disc, there is far less compression."},{"rating":"1","title":"I, Boring","review":"I've seen this movie three times, and still can't force myself to like it. Frankly, it's boring. Will Smith looks bored, so does Bridget Moynahan (Sylvia Calvin) and Chi McBride. The \\"funny\\" one-liners are boring, too. The only person smiling in this production seems to be the robot, Sonny. And he's mostly animated! The movie is saved to some extent by the dramatic finale, when the robots come alive and try to take over the world (what else?). But not by much. Even during the finale, Smith and Moynahan look bored and boring! \\"I, Robot\\" ends with a cliff-hanger, implying that another revolution is in the air, this time led by the nice guy Sonny. But since there's no sequel, we're ultimately left with nothing at all...Two stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"hd showcase movie","review":"this movie is a must have to really show off the capability of blu-ray and your high def tv. the picture is amazing as is the sound. i highly recommend. i also love the movie itself but that is a personal preference. a must have if you like sci-fi and want to see amazing picture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"Really enjoyed the movie, and will watch it over and over.

The combining of real actors (if you can call Will Smith a real actor) with CG looks terrific. But the plot is SERIOUSLY lacking...There are so many plot holes in this flick, I don't know where to begin. Was there any doubt after 10 minutes who the real culprit was? Once again, Hollywood's disdain for the \\"evil corporation\\" rings loud.During the big robot attack on Smith in his car, does anybody really believe that there isn't another car on the road?

We can tell right off the bat that this is a typical Will Smith ego film fest.

I found it to be bland, action-packed tripe, which failed to underlie the basic principles of Asimov story-telling; cerebral, mystery, detective - all of these styles are to be found in his books. Alas, not in this film.For someone who has never read an Asimov book, then this film as a complete standalone is mildly sufficient, that is if you like your action films set to a prediciatble formula; good cool guy, love interest, simmering tension building up to a grand finale. You get that here.Myself, I prefer something a little more thought-provoking.Like one of Issac Asimov's books, for instance."},{"rating":"1","title":"thisdarkplace*blogspot*com","review":"Hey, Will Smith, what the hell did Asimov ever do to you? This movie takes a science fiction classic and rapes it with bad acting and horrid dialog. I honestly don't understand why they bothered to call this \\"I, Robot\\" - it has NOTHING in common with the book except a couple of character names. This is a bad action movie and a slap in the face to Asimov's ground breaking work. I have no problem with crappy movies aimed at teenagers and other people who need lots of flashing lights and explosions to hold there attention but this movie is bad enough to turn people away from the book (read the book - seeing the movie won't even spoil the ending for you i promise)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware the words 'Based on....'","review":"What did I not like about this movie? Pretty much most of it, I have to be honest. Why oh why is the future always depicted as being like Times Square at 5pm on a Friday? There are always hundreds of people in the background walking in about 50 different directions. Nonsense.Will Smith Fresh Prince'd his way through the movie, weaving his Audi and/ or his motorbike through some of the larger gaps in the plot (who has their house demolished once they die? What the heck was that all about other than an excuse for Smith to escape/ defeat - once again - the robots). You hate robots for saving you? You sleep with a large, presumably loaded gun in your hands? You are a maverick cop? Come on, guys, this is awful. Straight out of the 'Will this do?' school of filmmaking.Based on a series of short stories? I think not.An awful movie that I'm sure will have plenty of 5 star *awesome* reviews from people who check their brains in alongside their coats at movie theaters."},{"rating":"1","title":"White Robots vs. Will Smith!!!","review":"Will Smith was recently in the news saying that AIDS had been created by White people to kill Blacks. I guess this movie must be his revenge for that.It has little to do with Asimov's classic story. We get the usual cop on the edge who follows his hunches instead of the rules -- GIANT CLICHE!!! -- and then we get these White robots who want to wipe out Will Smith (a sure sign of artificial intelligence as the guys is such a nauseating, smug [supply own expletive]).After this it just descends into action-special-effects Hell as any interest or storyline is squeezed out by Smith leaping around, probably supported by wires, as an army of CGI geeks try to keep up with overambitious and cartoonish special effects -- Crash! Blast! Kaboom! ...Yawn!Nevermind the robots; Hollywood actors, directors, and producers should be programmed with \\"the 3 laws of moviemaking\\" - characters, story, and meaning.

FOX/SONY has boasted about their new techniquest to convert 2D Classics to 3D classics. Note to Fox/Sony: PLEASE DON\\"T RUIN ANY FURTHER CLASSICS IN YOUR CATALOG WITH THIS QUALITY CONVERSION. I was so Dissappointed - a Great Movie in a horrible 3D presentation.Sony/Fox should take some pointers from Pixar or James Cameron for the future 2D- 3D conversion.

Shame on you Fox/Sony - Give us better quality 3D Conversions and we'll buy them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoroughly Suprised...and delighted","review":"I watched this DVD with trepidation. The previews looked like they had pretty much thrown out Asimov's basic plotlines, but they didn't. Will Smith plays a detective in 2035, which is populated by robots as delivery robots, servants, dog walkers, etc. Almost any job not requiring a lot of thought could be done by a robot.The chief robotic scientist, who developed the 3 laws and designed the first general purpose robots, commits suicide, or was he murdered by a robot? Will Smith is called in as a detective who doesn't not like or trust robots, despite the rest of the world trusting them completely. He follows the clues left to him by the dead scientist to solve the case.In the end, I could see this movie as having been an Asimov story.I give the movie 5 stars, however, the extras on the DVD are disappointing, hence the overall rating of 4 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie","review":"Enjoyed the movie but the 3d was not that great.

No, it's not perfect, but the depth of Asimove work prevent that.It is a good movie however, the scenario and dialogs are well thought out, the story is interresting, special effects are well made and, probably contrary to other opinions, I think Will Smith delivered a very solid performance bringing a \\"down to earth\\" tone to the movie which, otherwise, could have been a bit over the top. Bridget Moynahan was also very solid, on top of being a beautifull woman, so were the supporting actors.I don't know who was responsible for the decors and background, but they are fantastic, so's the soundtrack.I gave 4 star instead of 5 because, frankly, the ending was a bit to over the top, even for sci-fi.

He not only does not like robots but he doesn't trust them either. But then a suicide at US Robotics gets him involved in a case that involves a strange robot. Smith is convinced that the suicide was actually a murder and the strange robot is guilty.Smith has a hard time getting anyone on the force or at US Robotics to listen to him. Plenty of action and a pretty well laid out plot move Smith to his final confrontations with the robots and his own feelings for them.Based loosely on a series of short stories in the collection I, ROBOT by Isaac Asimov, fans of the rest of his work will see that some of the later Robot novel ideas also come into play. There are also shadowings of Jack Williamson's HUMANOIDS. This movie was better than I expected it to be based on the action-driven previews. All in all it was quite entertaining and relatively true to Asimov's robot stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable and interesting in presentation","review":"I must first say that for the most part I am not a Will Smith fan in terms of movies. I did like the Men in Black motif. In terms of I Robot I was surprised with this one because initially I did not think it was going to be that good of a movie. I must say that I stand corrected and I really liked this movie. I don't want to give away the plot, but the concepts that this movie presented in terms of artificial intellegence and the potential affects of AI evolution, of course leads to revolution as nice. I also like the conflict between characters, although I do feel that Del Spooner's (Will Smith) prejudice of robots did not have a deep enough motive. The idea that a robot in his mind would steal a purse, simply because a robot saved him instead of a child in the past, did not seem to be a logical jump. Yet, the movie has nice blend of action and suspense. I enjoy watching and re-watching this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable sci fi film with Will Smith","review":"Very good movie with great performances by Smith and Greenwood.Another play on the bad robot/good robot, bad cop/good copera, obviously borrowing a lot from films like \\"Android\\"with Klaus Kinski and \\"Blade Runner\\"Robots are hot idea in Hollywood with everything from the new\\"Robots\\" film with Halle Berry to the old early days of robotslike Metropolis.Proyas is becoming an expert in this type of genre, hopefullywill see more to come from him.Two thumbs up for \\"I, Robot\\"!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I Robot","review":"this movie is one of a kind, great story, makes you kinda think about things lol, the picture is 5 out of 5 very very clear picture.

One story had a robot that had a modified First Law because the humans he worked with were always exposed to danger. To have a story where the laws were completely violated is not even close to his original writings.When I met him in Philadelphia, I asked Isaac whether he ever considered writing a story about a robot being altered without the Three Laws. He was very adamant that he would never do that.Hollywood should also have never done that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eerie but impressive film","review":"I, Robot is an impressive sci-fi action/drama that hit the silver screen in 2004. Its stunning visual medium as well as superb plot line make this one of last year's better and most unique movies.

Hard to sit through it waiting for the good stuff. His stuff is strictly canned.I can't imagine any director with brains wanting him for a lead so one can make an educated guess that there was a deal involved. That gives the actor power to alter his part. In Smith's case my guess is his performance kept a constant eye on what the characters actions would mean to Will Smith's career and not what it would mean to the movie.

I've never seen Bridget Moynahan in anything else, and I hope the trend continues--what a bland, monotonous person.The commentary is likewise boring, and repetitive, with pretty much nothing interesting to offer... much like the movie.The only bright point would be Alan Tudyk's performance as Sonny the robot. Capable actors James Cromwell, Bruce Greenwood, and Chi McBride are all pretty much wasted in bland background roles, in favor of Will Smith's wise-cracking good cop with a troubled past cliche--I mean, 'character'.

I feel that his acting skills improved in this movie. Also, the story was said to have too many implausible themes but most movies do. If I wanted to watch a movie based on a true story I would and if I did then maybe I would comment on what was and was not plausible. I think the movie was thought provoking, action filled, good acting and a nice story line. Kept me entertained.."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Robot is like an action moive to me !!!","review":"Will Smith is an nice actor, and he can fight in this moive. But in this moive I Robot I like this part when some of the robots came out to make way in the city. But Will Smith's leanding ladyBridget Maynaham, has an nice sexy sceen as well. The robots in this picture make me screm!!! I think you sounld go and reant that moive."},{"rating":"2","title":"I ROBOT U JANE","review":"I must admit I was prepared to dislike I ROBOT, simply because of its marketing and the presence of Will Smith, who although a talented and apparently likeable young man, is not one of my favorite actors. However, I was pleasantly surprised. I ROBOT is a mindblowing exercise in technical wizardry and its borrowed Aasimov plotline is intriguing. A surprisingly buff Smith plays a tortured detective who hates robots (we find out later in the film), and is joined by Bridget Moynahan as a scientist who helps \\"humanize\\" robots in a quest to find out why one robot has apparently murdered a human--a no no in the three laws of robots. The suspect robot is wonderfully voiced by Alan Trydk (spelling) and he's a prime focus point in the film.The effects are brilliant and even though they may go over the top (particularly in the spectacular chase in the tunnel), they are certainly state of the art in their execution.Overall, I ROBOT is top notch science fiction entertainment."},{"rating":"1","title":"I, Will Smith - forget about anyone else","review":"This movie is a tribute to Will Smith's ego. It hardly resembles the book. It should be titled \\"I, Will Smith\\", starring Will Smith, co-starring Will Smith, and having a cast of some other people. The plot is ridiculous, never really being established, and it goes down from there. With a little effort, it could have been a comedy instead of just being silly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Action Adventure!","review":"A top notch crew does a wonderful job of bringing the essence of Isaac Asimov's robot stories to life. The acting and directing are great, even more amazing considering that much of the filming was done using blue-screen backgrounds and stand-ins for the robots, who were created later using computer generated figures. Bridget Moynahan pulled off her role brilliantly. She became a scientist involved in a puzzling crime, instead of looking like a strident feminist or a hot bod mouthing lines she didn't understand. Will Smith was amazing and fluid as always. Even the minor (human) characters sparkled."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great movie from Will Smith","review":"It seems like every movie that Will Smith is in is a great movie. Will Smith never stops delivering great comedy in his movies.\\" your a cat, i am black, and i wont be hurt again\\"10/10"},{"rating":"1","title":"Overhyped","review":"This movie was a disappointment. If you aren't a science-fiction fan (and maybe if you are) you don't want to see I, ROBOT. It is one of those movies that is slow to get the least bit interesting and truly escalates at the conclusion of the movie. While Isaac Asimov was a great science-fiction writer, I, Robot in its movie version just doesn't cut it. Not even Will Smith can lighten this bland movie, with the exception of the ending. It just lacks in being a truly exciting movie. It seems like for a while it is a mix of drama and science fiction, and then here comes comedy relief from Will Smith. It is way overhyped and could've definitely been better. 2 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"I, Like","review":"At first, I thought Will Smith was too comical for the futuristic Sci-Fi backdrop, but he really is one of the coolest movie detectives, due in part to his awesome black leather pants, black leather jacket, and those \\"Vintage 2004\\" Converse All Stars.Sonny's interactions with \\"Spoon\\" and Dr. Calvin are at times touching, and VIKI's stance on human protection is quite thought provoking. I think more time could have been spent on the backstory of the robots, and maybe some more character development with the humans. Regardless, a good DVD that's surely worth owning.Now, if they only made Sonny action figures..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Asimov would like it.","review":"Will Smith is Del Spooner, a robot hater. He works as a homocide detective and the movie begins as he receives a call from a hologram machine alerting him that his friend Dr. Lanning (James Cromwell) has died. Spooner immediately suspects that this was not a suicide, but a murder committed by one of Lanning's robot creations. From here, the movie packs exploration of Asimov's 3 robot laws in between some really good action scenes. Although it does not adhere to any of Asimov's tales, it incorporates the ideas of several of them throughout the film to a satisfying result for the Asimov fan.Overall, it was a really fun popcorn flick that managed to include some of the more interesting questions about man vs. machinery that have been raised in the sci-fi genre. Two thumbs up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Hd experience yet","review":"I own both formats and have viewed more movies on both than I probably should!!! I have to date been more impressed with my movies on hd dvd for picture and audio quality until I Robot, I enjoyed the movie when it came out and took the opportunity to rent the BD release and all I can say is WOW!!! the picture quality is on par with the top tier releases I have viewed! The audio (dts master) is possibly the best I have experienced, clear, crisp, lifelike surround which combined with the picture quality and to me an excellent story makes this overall experience an A+++++! If you are a fan of sci-fi this is a must have for your HD collection!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good effects, mediocre writing","review":"The special effects are wonderfully orchestrated in this film and the adapted storyline is refreshing and intruiging. However, Smith's character becomes increasingly annoying as the film progresses. His constant \\"I told you so\\" attitude is tiring and distracts from the story itself. Worth watching, but by no means a masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and good special effects","review":"After suffering through Will Smith's sleepwalk performance in MIB II, I was pleased by the energy level he brings to this fast paced fun movie. Smith lives in a world where robots are commonplace, serving humans (reminicent of the 4th Planet of the Apes movie) as nannies, butlers, and general servants. He is called to solve the murder of a scientist, who was his friend. The only possible suspect seems to be a robot. The only problem is that robots are subject to Isaac Asimov's 3 laws, meaning that it is impossible for a robot to harm a human.As things progress we also learn that Smith, a robot hater, is part robot himself, with some bionic parts. As things progress we find out that there maybe the three laws are not absolute and there may be some ways around it.There are some fast paced tense scenes and there are some enjoyable supporting characters such as Smith's mother and the lady robot scientist that Smith seems to like."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uggghhh...It hurts so much","review":"Uggghhhh, that is the noise Isaac Asimov is making as he roles over in his grave. This movie tried to be more than what it was and in the process completely destroyed what Asimov had written. This movie is just a bunch of special effects and little wise cracks from Smith, who is just so funny. For what the movie was, it wasn't that bad, but the director should of left it had that, not try to make it seem like anything more. HTe concept of robots showing emotion and man vs machine,it has been done before, and much better (See \\"Blade Runner\\" and \\"2001: a Space Odyessy\\"). The whole concept has just been beaten to death and instead of bringing something new to the table and breathing life back into the concept, \\"I,Robot\\" lays it to rest, and then steps on and smashs it some more. For a mindless summer action movie, it is above average, but it tried to be something more hten that, nad it fell flat on its face."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer beware!","review":"A rip-off from Fox. First, all should know that the 3D version of the film has been CROPPED! The widescreen film therefore loses picture information...which is reprehensible considering that this is a visual-effects film. The 3D conversion is just \\"meh\\" as well. While I'd give the film at least 3 stars, the hatchet job done to the movie by Fox makes it a must to avoid."},{"rating":"2","title":"I, Robot","review":"Will Smith has become a great action star, showing his ability to draw audiences to watch his action packed movies, such as 'Independence Day' and 'Bad Boys'. This movie is another action packed movie and is taken in the future, and is supposed to be a glimps of what could happen to man kind if machines could think for themselves. And yes, it goes on the same story lines where we struggle with our own creation in movies such as the \\"Terminator\\" series, etc. Again, we have a movie pointing the potential dangers of machine vs. man, which is the ultimate battle. Besides, some flaws in the movie, where the previews show Will saying to his boss, \\" I sure miss the good old days...when people killed people..\\" in the movie, they have the boss saying it to Will's character instead. But regardless of the few other mishaps, Will Smith's performance and personality with the great action scences makes up for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I, Will Smith","review":"Nice Transfer, nice Audio, nice F/X, bad Script. A missed chance. Yes Will, you have been working out. With all that product placement I wonder if somebody put any money. No, it is far from Asimov. The good robot movie is still to be done. Spielberg's AI was a better try. The Day The Earth Stood Still has still the best robot so far (1951). It must not be easy."},{"rating":"1","title":"great movie BAD DVD","review":"The film it's self it great. The story is interesting. The effects are great, no shock there. The DVD only has 2 special features A \\"making of\\" and commentary. Everything else on the DVD is a bunch of previews. I have never felt the need to write a review of a DVD before but I felt I had to for this one because the DVD is just about the worst one I purchased. If you only care about the film buy it. If you are like me and special features are important don't waste you money. I also worry that the might be makeing a special or collectors edition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Necessary changes to the book, even if some of the ideas are simplified","review":"Lets face it, I, Robot the Asimov text would not make a great film, even if it were a great book. This attempts to sew the ideas in that book into an all encompassing package.On the whole, it succeeds. It is not perfect, but stands ahead of most of the superhero movies of the last 15 years and is up there among the better movies of the action genre. And Will Smith makes a good transition from comic to serious role."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful tribute to a great author","review":"As a science fiction writer myself I can appreciate the creativity of this movie.

Its a good thing Asimov is dead because he would have died after seeing this horrible movie supposedly based on his novel.

The writers,directors,producers,and actors in this movie should be ashamed!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"How about \\"Oops, Robot\\", instead?","review":"Let me put it plainly: this movie gave as much of a hard time as Swordfish and A.I. combined, two of my least favorite movies in recent times. It feels like a waste of a good story and some great acting (Will Smith's) on a poor screenplay where the effects are (sometimes) the only interesting thing in the movie (the reason I don't give it 1 star only). Never mind the product placement which becomes fairly annoying after a few minutes... The movie goes into unbelievable mode far too quick, plus it has a tough time retaining your attention.For the record, I am not an outright critic of SciFi. I am a fan of the genre, but movies such as Bladerunner and more recently, Minority Report, really do it justice. And I LOVED Alex Proyas' work with \\"The Crow\\" and \\"Dark City\\", but \\"I, Robot\\" instead felt more like \\"Oops, Robot\\".

I was expecting much more than this. The story is weak and has little foundation: It's makes things overly complex just to take up time, and the whole three laws thing was just plain stupid. The movie is all Will Smith frowning and being an idiot! I was expecting exciting combat sequences, with murderous robots in an out of control society. Instead, all i saw was an over-complexified paranoia fest, with pidly little robots scenes with, and then it went right back to will smith! The only really redeemable thing about this movie that stopped me from giving it 1 stars was the fact that the visuals were so darn cool!

Events, scenes, plot, were all stretched out, probably to fit three books instead of one. And that's where it got boring, and rather weak. Not a dense, beautiful world that's brimming over with fantasy.Rather than magic, or the premise (which is exciting at first, then you wonder WHY does it take the character 250 pages to find out what the reader picked up at page 20), the book seemed more interested in fooling around with the minor differences between American and Australian English."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Black Music","review":"This is good ole black music, the way it's used to be.

Another thing that bothered me about the book was that they spent a majority of the book setting up the big problem and it all got resolved within a few pages and tied up nicely with a little bow.

I love the way she brings out the moments in our ordinary, everyday lives that are extraordinary.

The descriptions of the setting and the placement of characters throughout the narrative is excellent, and the way in which Hoffman drawn you into the narrative, so gently and naturally, that you barely notice when you become so interested in the lives of the characters. Even the movie based on this book was good, so as far as that goes I think it's a good thing. I have read other of Hoffman's novels, but this one is the one that touched me the most, with the manifold personalities of the two sisters and their relationships and lives, pretty much perfect!"},{"rating":"1","title":"So where's the magic?","review":"I read this, got done and said 'Huh?

Her talent has captured me from the beginning till the end. This novel starts with telling us the Owens women had been blamed for everything that had gone wrong in their Massachusetts town. Gillian and Sally were two of them, one was beautiful and lazy whereas another one was very responsible. Their aunts encouraged them to practise witchery but what Gillian and Sally only wanted was to escape. Though they were seperated, but finally they're back together. Practical Magic not only describes withcery, but also the \\"magical\\" relationship between the Owen sisters.The novel is charming, funny and written in great rhythm. Once you start reading Practical Magic, it's hard to put it down because of the great narrative flow. The novel is as enchanting as the movie. Practical Magic is one of her best novels and you can't miss it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intresting","review":"I will confess I picked up the book because I liked the movie. While I found that they were very different, I think that its those differences that make both the movie and the book so good.I found this slightly slow to start with but by about page 75 I was having trouble putting it down and finally finished it a 1am in the morning.I am now looking forward to reading another of her novels and hope that I find the same depth of feeling in those."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magical, Mystical and Wonderful","review":"This is one of my all time favorite books. I read it before it was made into a movie, and few books have touched me heart, soul and mind so completely.Hoffman has a great gift for weaving magic into her storytelling, quite literally. If you like kindness, empathy, and humanity in your supernatural tales, this is the book for you. The realism and everyday sincerity of this book is well represented by the term \\"Practical Magic\\".If your child loves Harry Potter and you've developed a taste for witchcraft and magic, you MUST read this book. You'll fall in love."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book, But Very Different from the Movie","review":"The author of this book personally told me that the book differed quite a bit from the movie, and she wasn't exaggerating. That is the reason I read it. The movie is one of my favorites. In the novel, the story focuses a lot more on the third generation, Sally's daughters. They really only appear as children in the movie. Although, I love Alice's books, in some ways, I liked the movie version better. It is so well done. However, it was great to read the book, because for me it expanded and deepened the story. I recommend it for everyone, whether or not you are a fan of the popular movie.Michael Travis Jasper, Author of the Novel \\"To Be Chosen\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly, this is one of those times where the movie is better than the book.","review":"The author writes with an omnipresent/fairy tale voice that sometimes works in short stories, but becomes grating in novels. The characters are bizarre, not charming, with the aunts being creepy hags, Gillian a self-centered jerk, and Sally a sad sack who raises two brats. Worst of all? No real magic is presented (at least in the parts I manged to read).I got through 28% of the book on my Kindle before I got tired of waiting for the plot to show up"},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVED IT!","review":"This book said alot of how my life is or how I believe life really is.

Not one bit. I study the occult and the occult references in the book were hazy at best, but that is acceptable since it is meant for mainstream consumption. What got to me most about this book is that there is almost no dialog, there are periods where there are three pages without dialog, without vaugely meaninful description (like say Moby Dick), but just pure nariation. The book is written from an omni-scentiant point of view, so it is hard to care very much about any one of the characters as a main character. Now perhaps it is acceptable for Clancy to have five main characters, when he writes a 900 page book, but this book being around 250, can't support the lack of focus."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Big Disappointment","review":"After being drawn in by the magical possibilities of a Rossetti painting on the dustjacket (of the hardcover) and an epigraph from Mother Goose, I was disappointed that what followed was sheer hokum. Most disappointing: the characters are based on cliched ideas. For example, the author reinforces the tired dichotomy that women are either rational and practical or wild and irresponsible. And the author's primary characterization of all the prominent females in the book is that they are stunningly beautiful, as if she has nothing else in her bag of tricks to make them likable. This is a world where a woman must use her beauty to secure the love of a handsome man before she can like herself, and that is very unfortunate given the possibilities for strong feminine characters in such a storyline. The ending is likewise predictable and cloying, which seems to be a prerequisite for authors who eventually end up in the \\"Oprah Bookclub.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Big fan of the film... not the book","review":"I first saw the film when I was 17 and fell in love with the story. So after years of being a fan of the film I decided to try out the book. The book is nothing like the movie. I set that detail aside and decided to continue reading even though it was not the story I was hoping for. The book was dull with what I feel is poor character development. So 2 months after my purchase I still have several chapters to go and no real interest continue reading. Her style of writing is annoying at times when she tries to add poetic sequences in places where you just want information. Its likely I wont buy another book from this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't finish it.","review":"I read one of Hoffman's other books, Illumination Night, and liked it well enough, though it seemed at time as if she were trying to imitate Anne Tyler with soem magical realism thrown in. Practical Magic started with some potential, but after about a third of the way into the book I had to stop reading. Her characers, and the way she staged their interactions, did not ring true and come to life. Rather, the book seemed mired in the emotional and imaginative level of a second-rate TV movie. All of which was especially disappointing, since Hoffman's original setup had some real potential- she just never realized it by pulling out all the stops and letting her tale set its own internal logic. Instead, she settled for cheap melodrama."},{"rating":"2","title":"I actually liked the movie better","review":"This book was made into the recent movie with Sandra Bullock and Nicole Kidman. Rarely have I ever said that the movie was better than the book, but I think I'm going to have to make that statement in this case. The events in the movie and book were markedly different and I just liked the way they played out in the movie a bit better. Plus I felt that the book left out the theme that I felt was most important in the movie - the community of women coming together, united in a common goal, even though they had shunned the Owens women before. This part just isn't in the book at all. The Owenses take care of their problems all by themselves. But the book was good for itself, as long as you don't have the movie to compare it with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, fun read!","review":"Read this book on a cross-country road trip and it was really enjoyable. Couldn't wait to read the next segment when I switched off from driving. Great characters, great story, very engaging. Almost nothing like the film, but if you go into the book knowing that, you can enjoy both the film and the book based on their separate merits. Both have things to offer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really didn't like this","review":"Anyone that loved the movie, will not like this book. I have seen the movie more times than I can count, so I was excited to get this book. I was very disappointed. The aunts really do not have a place except here and there. The closeness of all the women was just lacking to me. One of my favorite parts of the movie is what led up to Jimmy's death and the solution. So not in the book. The magic is just lacking. Sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unlike some, I loved the book...hated the movie","review":"I found TURTLE MOON and SECOND NATURE at a used book store and have been an Alice Hoffman fan ever since.PRACTICAL MAGIC is one my favorite Hoffman stories because of the quirky characters and off-beat plot.The movie, however, did the book no justice, except in the casting of Stockard Channing and Dianne Weist as the 'aunts.' They were dead on. Sandra Bullock and Nicole Kidman just didn't do it for me.If you want a good read for the beach or a stormy summer night, this book is for you. Hoffman continues to turn out quality work...she's one of the best.Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The movie was better, and the movie didn't thrill me.","review":"You've read the summary, so I'll just cut to the chase. First of all, loved, loved, loved Hoffman's 'voice' and use of language: Gillian's passion for her new biology teacher lover melts all the butter in the house, a woman pounds on her lover's door until she literally breaks her hand -- Hoffman is very good at powerful, evocative images, at gliding on the surface and gazing at the tempestuous emotions below her.However, everything else about this novel began to irritate me before long. Hoffman was obsessed with pairing everyone up, down to the last obnoxious teenager, and the only romance that held any appeal for me was the one between Gillian and Ben. Gary (Sally's love interest) was boring and entered the story much too late for me. (He doesn't seem to be a very good investigator, either.) Also, the swearing seemed unnecessary, as if it came out of a different book. I might try Hoffman again, but I won't be re-reading this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hoffman's best book","review":"I've read nearly all of Hoffman's work, and \\"Practical Magic\\" simply aces them all. The characters are well shaped, the story lovingly crafted and the writing style is evocative and lush. Those who snipe at the \\"mistakes\\" she makes in occult lore are missing the point. She's not out to write a textbook in witchcraft. Hoffman writes about the unseen and mystical events that hide beneath the mundane goings on of everyday life--and she does so with vivid imagination and unrestrained verve."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magical","review":"I liked Practical Magic. It was a good book with great characters. I know it isn't a favorite of other people, but this book was a great window to the world of the Owens girls. Sally was amazing--as was Gillian. The great thing about this book was that the characters shifted so seamlessly and the plot was weaved so well into the book. I didn't want this book to end, but when it did, I realized reading it made me a better person"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Delight!","review":"Once again, Alice Hoffman has given us a delightfully charming story that starts out as a fairy tale and becomes true life extraordinary.

It's lush, sexy, funny, and sad. People don't just fall in love in Alice Hoffman's novels. They stop eating. Their hair changes color. This magic fills Practical Magic. Saw the movie? Terrible.

This one was a bummer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I have no idea how they got the movie from this awful book. It had such potential, such a unique and interesting setting, but went nowhere, did nothing! Every time it seemed like the author was moving towards something interesting, some plot point or twist, she'd just let it DROP! None of her build-ups went anywhere, leaving the plot empty and pointless. She just let everything hang in the air with nowhere to fall. And then she tried to cover up her lack of writing ability by putting an f-bomb about every other page or so. I always thought the movie had a couple of little plot holes in it, but now I know what they were working from, and the movie totally SAVED this shallow story.This is one of the ONLY times I have ever liked the MOVIE more than the BOOK! Ordinarily, I would recommend a book over its film counterpart, but in this case, I would tell anybody to watch the movie and stay far away from the book! What a staggeringly disappointing novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"I DID NOT LIKE THE BOOK, COULD NOT FINISH IT","review":"I have seen the movie and love it. I also have the soundtrack to the movie and love that. I got about half way thru the book and just stopped. I did not like the authors writing style, from a third person point of view. I could not get inside the characters because the book was not told from one of their view- points. Also, it did not flow smoothly for me. The story jumped around and did not unfold evenly. I was very disappointed. This is one case where the movie was much better than the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"wow this book was great!","review":"i had watched the movie before i read the book! and the book and movie are so different from each other. the movie leaves out alot of details which the book has to make it more interesting and entertaining. i personally like both movie and book but i think the book if u like detail and well thought out ideas and stuff u should get the book than see the movie! this book was awsome so reality like written!!!!!! go buy it:)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry Alice,.....","review":"The movie is better than the book.

After I saw the movie, I decided to give it another shot because I loved the movie. I could not believe how poorly written the book really was. The author goes back and forth between present and past tenses. She abruptly changes character viewpoints without a transition so you think you're reading about one character only to find she had changed to a different one. Very confusing. To make matters worse, she stops action right in the middle with long narrative flashbacks. The movie was a huge improvement over the book, and I actually liked it a lot. Now if I could only learn to fly off the roof..."},{"rating":"1","title":"should have been better...","review":"I have always liked the movie with Nicole Kidman and Sandra Bullock and I was expecting a very satisfying read. Unfortunately, Practical Magic proved to be a disappointment with its bland characters, loose plot and childish, simplistic tone. Gillian and Sally are one dimensional and mostly just pathetic. Although Sally's daughters are better portrayed than the grown up characters, teenage depression is simply not enough to save a lagging story. Jimmy and his angry ghost, the aunts, the conservative little town the girls grew up and Sally's love interest have very little place in the book and this does not help either.The only real success of the novel is Alice Hoffman's ability to \\"feed\\" magical realism into an impossible place such as the lower middle class American suburbia. Still, this does not compensate for a story that has no charm within itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved the Book... hated the movie","review":"This is a great book and it is a real shame that the book got turned into some Hollywood poltergeist movie.

I'm about a quarter of the way through and I'm not sure I'm going to bother to finish reading it. I'm finding the writing style a bit slow and where the movie was charming and characters were lovable, even with their flaws I'm not finding myself unsympathetic to any of the characters in the book. I'm not compelled to learn what happens to any of them because i just don't care about them. Each character is described as being totally selfish in their own way so i haven't bonded with any of the characters enough to want to read about them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent, but I've definitely read better novels","review":"Though the time periods and character viewpoints jump around too much, this novel about a NE family of psuedo- witches is full of lush, evocative description. I enjoyed the many descriptions of food, plants and weather, and agree it is similar to Like Water For Chocolate.However, I also agree the plot is somewhat weak, the women too obviously beautiful and somewhat lacking in real personality. This I would blame on the disappointing lack of dialogue in Practical Magic. The men are basically flat. Lust seems to be more important than love--the author seems to want to drive the point home that you cannot escape lust/love no matter how hard you try. I didn't really learn anything from this novel, especially not anything to do with Wicca, witchcraft, or New Age philosophy.Overall it's a pretty good read if you're not too fussy."},{"rating":"1","title":"I just finished the book........","review":"and after mulling it over I think that the book was OK, but not great.

There was barely any magic in the book and it didn't seem like much of a love story, Gary only shows up near the end.

They're the ones people cross the street to avoid...the Owens women are witches. Raised by their two aunts, Sally and Gillian Owens grow up to be polar opposites. Sally is always practical and straight-laced; most concerned with keeping the lives of her two daughters as normal as possible. Gillian, on the other hand, is a free spirit...perhaps a little too free at times.This story follows Sally and Gillian through their trials and tribulations with life, love, and death, and Hoffman's wonderful storytelling makes it, simply, magical! Wonderful twists and turns lurk around every corner of this funny, touching, and at times, dark story...brimming over with themes of compassion, redemption, and inner strength. Playing on every human emotion, Hoffman has struck absolute gold.If you've ever seen the movie,forget it, and pick up this wonderful book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't recommend this book","review":"My niece, who LOVES Angelina, was expecting a baby sister, so I was excited to find this book.

My 3-year old niece does not yet know that concept, and I sure didn't want to be the one to introduce it! On the next page Angelina has a tantrum and completely trashes her room.

I felt this was the weakest of all the books in the Angelina series due to a number of reasons: the adults seem to ignore Angelina without reassuring her from the beginning, Angelina says some very harsh words about her baby sister and uses the word \\"hate\\" which I deem too harsh for my preschooler to hear [she has no real concept of what the word means as she hardly ever hears it used], and in the end Angelina throws a full-scale temper tantrum, destroying her room in order to vent her anger which also seems a bit extreme.My 4-year-old and I love the books in the Angelina series and it's too bad that this particular book was written without too much thought put into it.

It includes a fine series of chapters explaining the history of the Acadian people (Begnaud was an Acadian in a whistle stop) and of all the major players and of Louisiana history. In a short set of chapters the author gives us both the history and the interest. By the end I was sorry to see it finish - but I learned a lot about both the \\"crime of the century\\" and also the context of the events. It was hard to put down - even when I came to the end. Arceneaux did a thorough history but also took care to make it a fascinating book."},{"rating":"2","title":"More Spark than Malice","review":"A well woven tapestry of the history and sociology of the Acadians of Louisiana, the South in post reconstruction years, and the genealogy of the authors family all neatly tied together in the telling of the tale of a murder which at the time was an international sensation even though it took place in the back waters of Louisiana. William Arceneaux is a smooth talker in person and has proved himself a skillful writer and clever story teller. There is one vignette on euthanasia that you may not want to read because it will haunt you when you wake up in a dark room at 3 o'clock in the morning. This an entertaining, even educational, well conceived and organized book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mighty compact Vacum","review":"Great product for the price. This has great suction and ease of use. The only thing I don't care for is if you vacum for a long time, the machine tends to get too warm. Other than that I love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Panasonic canister vac. mc 3920","review":"This product failed the second time I tried using it The on-off swtich broke.Panasonic MC-3920 Canister with 5-Stage Filtration, Aqua BlueThe nearest service center for Panasonic is 20 miles away. Hardly worth my time and mileage to get it repaired plus the surly repairman said I have to have a reciept which I can't locate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Buy!","review":"I bought this 3 years ago, and it still works fine until now. Honestly it exceeded my expectation this vacuum cleaner cleans very well with good suction, for all 3 different homes, one with tiles, one with carpet, and now laminate floor. I use it almost everyday, I lived in Miami and now reside Hawaii, we take home sand quite often. For the price I have no complain, although I'd like it better if the handle were adjustable, but that's not really a con. If mine were ever broken, I'd buy this very same thing again."},{"rating":"1","title":"it's not broken but it keeps falling apart","review":"The long tube that's supposed to nest into the longer bits of the tube or the attachments does not fit well enough. During ten minutes of vacuuming, I probably have to pick up falling pieces about three or four times. The two attachments (a brush and angled-looking thing) also fall off (as does the head of the vacuum) and do not fit easily back into their holding place in the canister. The canister doesn't roll so much as gets dragged behind you since it constantly flips onto its side. The vacuum also takes up a surprising amount of storage space since the tube loops out from the body. In addition, the vacuum is difficult to get in and out of storage because the tube merely rests in place so it gets easily knocked over. There is also no good way to carry the vacuum when not in use. I really really really hate this vacuum."},{"rating":"1","title":"On/off switch broke","review":"Nice vacuum. Easy light but poor quality. The on/off switch broke after 6 months. Also cord is too short.Closest repair center is at >20 miles. Not worth the effort for a $60 vacuum. Doubting whether to buy the same one again of a more expensive Miele."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great hat, poor service.","review":"This item was ordered the afternoon of Dec. 19th 2012 as a Christmas gift. They shipped the item Dec. 24th! Didn't receive it until January 2nd. Cap is perfect fit and excellent embroidery.Different color was purchased separately, knowing it was late but still as another gift for the holidays. (Red with yellow flame cap) Ordered on Dec. 21st. Shipped on Dec 27th. Received it January 5th. Cap was frayed at not less than 5 spots in the embroidery. Pay for shipping yet again? Not worth it...Very irritated with this vendor"},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't last long!","review":"Save your money! It will be strong at first, but won't last anywhere near the original battery power. You'll be lucky if you get several months out of this thing. I wound up charging it as much as my old one that was dying. It's smarter and cheaper to just buy a new phone when it's time to re-new your plan, like I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"DuD","review":"This was a nice looking timer but right out of the box was a DUD.Would not work at all at first.Then it started working after bending the a/c prongs a bit.Ran about 6 hr. with pump and it got hot and quit.Will trash this as its not worth going through the return crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor quality and zero manufacturer support","review":"Very disappointed in the quality and performance of the Intermatic P1101 outdoor timer. It does not turn on by itself because the on mechanism is too strong or stiff for the timer to overcome. If you physically turn it past the set on time it works correctly, but does not keep accurate time - it shuts off over 1 hour earlier than it is set to turn off. I have tried many different set points, both on and off and it is the same result every time. I have sent Intermatic technical support several emails regarding this problem and they have not responded. I called several times and finally after 5 attempts I was able to get an agent on the phone, he asked many questions and gave no solutions other than that I should go buy a new one (this one is only 1 month old and still under manufacturer warranty but no advice or offer of assistance was given. Never buy intermatic products again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chinese Junk !!!!!!!!!","review":"I've tried everything possible to make this unit work. I had no success. I found an old unit which was a model P1101P built by INTERMATICINCORPORATED that was built in Spring Grove Illinois, USA. Not built by China I'm using it!!!!!!!! I want nothing more from CHINA !!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good replacement","review":"Bought this timer to replace the previous one I had for 10 years which finally gave out. This timer is Identical to my old one. Works great."},{"rating":"2","title":"enjoyable 5th","review":"I don't know if this is the definitive version of Bruckner's 5th, but I really enjoy this release. The sound quality and balance are excellent. The reading is controlled, but dynamic. This has to be the most difficult Bruckner symphony to critique because it is definitely a most unusual work, but I love it! When I want to listen to the 5th from Bruckner, I usually pop this one into my player. The Thielemann 5th (on DG) is also excellent, but it is sadly not SACD even though the sonics are still excellent. If DG decides to release the Thielemann on SACD I will definitely buy it, but I would still keep this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Such poor quality!","review":"I guess I should have known that the quality of the movies on this DVD would be poor. But I was stoked to find 3 movies that I love on the same DVD. Great movies, very poor quality.It would be more wise to spring for each movie seperately."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Value","review":"I almost didn't buy this DVD when I saw the first review, but I have bought quite a number of titles in this Popflix series and I have always been pleased with them.This Cary Grant package is a great value. You get three of Grant's classic comedies for the price of one DVD. The quality is good. It's not up to contemporary film stanards, but these are after all 50 year old movies. Given their age, the quality is fine and it is about what you would expect.On the whole, it is an exceptional value and well worth acquiring.BR"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality","review":"This is a very poor quality dvd! I don't recommend buying it. For example, the picture in Charades jumps up and down the whole time. I have the video version of Charades and it is an excellent picture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Picture, Great sound","review":"Before I bought this TV, I went to the consumer reports web site. This TV is listed as a best buy (for 32\\" TVs) so I bought it. The picture is great, as is the sound. This TV has the high end flat screen, but is not cluttered with interesting buy relatively unuseful features like Picture in Picture (PIP loses coolness after 1 week). So what you get is a great TV for a great price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good when using video sources","review":"The picture is fine when using the cable jack, but when watching a DVD or VHS hooked up through the video in jacks, there are white vertical bars on the screen. They are very noticeable when the background is dark and especially when watching a wide screen DVD with the black areas on top and bottom. I took mine back and was going to try another of the same model, but even the demo in the store I was in did the same thing. I eventually bought a different brand because of this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice little plant","review":"I bought this plant for a new freshwater 20 gallon aquarium I set up at work. My African Dwarf frogs love it, and at least one is often hiding underneath the lower leaves. It is shorter than 8 inches (maybe if you stretched it out it would be that long). Other than that it looks great and I'm happy with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good for a betta","review":"I purchased this because we have a betta and silk plants are recommended so as to not tear their fins. I was disappointed at the quality of this plant. The plant we received has plastic burs and is missing some leaves. Only the leaves are \\"silk;\\" the stem is hard plastic. I also couldn't find anything on the package that actually said the plant is \\"silk.\\" The leaves are not super soft. The one I received doesn't look as \\"full\\" as the one pictured. I won't be returning this because it's not worth the hassle but I will not be putting it in our betta's tank."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Green Shipper","review":"Average for a plastic plant. I would never order again because of the huge box it was mailed to filled with plastic air protectors. Extremely wasteful. No green shipper here."},{"rating":"1","title":"silk ?

It looks cheep and is cheep . sorry I ever bought it as its going in the trash"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"This movie is just plain awful.It doesn't make any sense and it is so boring.It can't get much worse than this movie.On a scale of 1-10,I would give a 2.I would have given it a 1 but since David Arquette is in it,I'll give it one extra point."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS WON'T MAKE YOU HAPPY","review":"There are bad movies, and there are badder movies. And then there are simply TERRIBLE movies. This is one of them, an indie that can only serve to prove that MOST (not all, now) indies are movies made by intellectuals who think they have something important or 'artsy' to say, but manage to say nothing. This abominable film is one of the worst movies I've ever suffered through. A plot that makes no sense whatsoever with performances that are stifling and unbelievable, and no semblance of coherency at all. David Arquette should start being a stay at home husband for Courteney, and Ally Sheedy needs to retire. As for Clarence Williams III, he should stay in retirement and watch THE MOD SQUAD or something more productive. Nothing saves this awful mess."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hardcore","review":"This is one of the most ground breaking debuts albums that came out of the West coast underground in the early 90s.

Worked for about an hour before it started stuttering. Sounded like air or something was caught in the impeller, but its perfectly clean, the pump is submerged completely. Pulled off the impeller to see if anything was caught, but it was perfectly clean. The Danner Mfg website is of no help. Also for the 1 hour or so it did work, the output was much less than expected (barely more than my 300gph we were replacing). All in all I'm quite disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pondmaster Mag pump 9.5B","review":"Purchased a Pondmaster Pump 9.5 as a replacement pump for my Koi pond. Their product is very cheaply made and does not last much longer than their warranty. Shortly after being in use for a little more than a year, the shaft in the impeller broke due to being made of plastic. This is the first impeller I have seen using plastic! This product is not recommended! Replacement parts are available but the cost does not warrant replacing. What will you receive?

My only criticism is that I wish all three (?) books could have been combined into one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh, Mr. Poe...","review":"The best thing about this is that it was free. I love Edgar Allan Poe and his poetry/short stories, but it being free and portable on my Kindle makes it all the better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindle edition is awful.","review":"Occasionally, and especially in non-English words, some letters are replaced with random punctuation marks. Annoying, but can usually be figured out with context. What's really frustrating is that significant and often pivotal portions of the story have been COMPLETELY EDITED OUT. See if ' Fall of the House of Usher' makes any sense to you with Roderick Usher's final, climactic line entirely omitted, for example. Almost all verse and quotations have been omitted as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"this volume for kindle is garbage","review":"But then again, what do you expect from a free book? every single punctuation mark in the book is replaced with symbols like @ # $ % ^ & * ( ).... Whoever the hell made this version for the kindle needs a good slap in the face."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy the Kindle Edition!","review":"The Kindle edition was obviously digitally scanned and MANY characters have been replaced by question marks or blank spaces. It makes the text very difficult to read, especially as Poe liked to pepper his short stories with quotes in Latin, Greek and French. I highly recommend Poe's short stories - it's just this edition that stinks."},{"rating":"1","title":".","review":"not a kindle fan. downloaded because it was free. didnt redownload the app on my new phone and anyways, this was all mised up, pages not in order."},{"rating":"1","title":"Find another version","review":"Like the others here that have noted the missing portions of the text (including the entire poem missing from the middle of Fall of the House of Usher), screwed up words, missing quotes, etc. I was highly annoyed by this.

His work is timeless, his imagination is brilliant and his language is lush and rich. True masterpiece!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Get out your magnifying glass","review":"Get out your magnifying glass and decoder ring cause you're going to need them to read this book.Actually under sufficient magnification and in the right light it looks like an old typewriter font with a really bad ribbon and then shrunken and shoved together.I am over 50 but I have brand new glasses. My wife is younger and does not ware glasses. She took one look and laughed.The paper stock is unremarkable but the largish format looks like it might be just the right size for a bird cage.

Good science fiction, and good literature."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wouldn't bother","review":"While I found the idea of the book interesting, the execution was boring in the extreme. I'd be reading along and then find myself thinking about something else altogether (like, say housework). I think if the author had stuck to fewer, better developed characters, it would have been much more satisfying. As it is, it reads more like an outline than a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"It doesn't make sense","review":"I rarely flame a book, because I know what it takes to put one together. However, The Bridge doesn't make sense for so many reasons. The characters are not real. I cannot imagine a mother committing suicide right after giving birth. It is not realistic to believe food would start flowing back to the cities after a pandemic virus wipes out 4 billion people. And who kept the power grid running during this disaster?Yes, there is a sci-fi premise regarding first contact (sort of), but humanity tends to react a bit differently in the light of megadeath than what was depicted here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really SF","review":"This is more of a popular fiction novel with a science fiction theme than a true science fiction novel. It is hard to explain the difference, but it has to do with the way that the novel sets up the characters and progresses through the plot, and the writing style itself. The idea is a good one, but the presentation left me cold. Maybe I'm just a \\"literary SF\\" snob, but if you are too, you'll be disappointed in this novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Their best yet","review":"The first time I listened to \\"Lullabies\\" was on an 11-hour flight to London so I had plenty of time to relax and let the music sink in. After my first listen, I couldn't believe what I had heard. The album seemed so boring and slow. After so much excitement from hearing Little Sister, I was incredibly disappointed. Yet I wanted to give it another shot. So I did, and I ended up listening to the album at least 15 times during my one week stay in Oxford.It's now my favorite QOTSA album. I used to think Rated R was their best, because it had the most diversity but I just think Lullabies is a more cohesive album, and a creepy one at that. It definitely has a grotesque, nightmarish quality to it. I really can't get enough of it. I was too quick to write it off, but it gets better with each listen. Favorite song: The Blood Is Love.For the full experience, listen to it in the darkest room you can find with a good pair of headphones. Mind blowing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good follow up to a great previous effort","review":"While it doesn't have the hooks of Songs for the Deaf or the riskiness of Rated R, the new brew from Homme and crew does what its supposed to - make my neck sore, my hands crampinto permanent devil horns and my neighbors call the cops. There are plenty of gems on this disk, contrary to a previous review, but some will sparkle more for the die-hard fans than the newly baptised. Lullabies to Paralyze will probably bring more followers into the fold and undoubtedly they will find even more inspiration in the previous gospels of the Queens but it will not convert them as quickly or as plentifuly as did Songs for the Deaf, which owes thanks in part to three great singles, two great videos, and a hell of a lot of coverage by the media surrounding Grohl's much hyped return to the stool. As for those of us that have been here for a while, the dark forces of the desert rock are strong in this one and shall feed the masses until the next serving."},{"rating":"2","title":"new lineup - and it dont matter","review":"stoner rock is great, although it is almost non-existent today, fine with me, i got all my kyuss and qotsa albums to feed my need for the desert blues!!! i heard the whole album, and must say that it will go down as another classic QOTSA albums. and its even better than songs for the dead, since it doesnt have those radio interruptions, which i sucessfully edited out with an mp3 editor.-i suggest getting your hands on; QOTSA self titles album, rated R, songs for the dead and to see where QOTSA came from, get yourself best of Kyuss album, where josh holmes was the lead guitars, and u will see that he pretty much keeps the same style on almost everything he lays his hands on.-desert sessions is also quite interesting glimpse of crazy rocknroll, since they record a whole album in less than a month, 9and10 were recorded in like a week or so.-what happened to nick? he was a craziest drug induced bassist -right next to nicky sixx"},{"rating":"1","title":"No Nick, No QOTSA","review":"After several listening attempts I'm convinced that all the songs on this cd were leftovers from the last desert sessions. Nick was, without a doubt, the creative force in this band and his lack of presence is noticed on every song. Songs for the Deaf offered a glimpse of great things to come, but all good things come to an end. An exteremly boring and average desert sessions, then a slightly less boring and average Eagles of Death Metal, and now this. I can only be thankful that PJ Harvey doesn't moan and wail on this cd. Keep your finger near the fast forward button, or just stick with the old stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"This CD is so overrated.......","review":"Alright, it's getting two stars because there's two good songs on it, and that's the ONLY reason it gets two stars. This CD and this band is so over rated it makes me sick. If they would have been around say 20 years ago, they would have fit right in with their 80s hair band sounding drivel. The lyrics aren't bad, there's a few lines that make you go HELL YEAH, but for the most part, BOREDOM sets in around the 4th or 5th track. And only lets up on one or two songs. So I've already let it go to someone else who wanted the CD but couldn't pay for it. I'll stick with my obscure bands that no one has ever heard of. As for this CD, the best thing about it is the cover. SO, goodbye QOTSA, until next time......."},{"rating":"1","title":"the album title says it all...","review":"After just playing the album through for the first time before writing this review, I realize I haven't given what I just heard much time to sink in, but since first impressions are everything, I'm gonna share mine. This album is boring, it has no emotion, it all sounds the same, and the title was right on the money...\\"lullabies to paralyze\\", because that's all this album will do to/for you...put you to sleep. I don't quite get why a a lot of the american public has a boner for this band, because if this album has anything to say about it, there's some poor tastes in music out there. Have I heard crappier music than this? of course. could I make a better album myself? of course not. but for the hype that surrounds this band, this is unacceptable."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE!!!!","review":"I hate this album!

While it is different than it's predecessors, heading even further in the direction of Songs For the Deaf as far as conception and overall sound, this album ROCKS. Just listen to songs like Little Sister, Medication, Tangled Up in Plaid, and the long space-outs Someone's In the Wolf and The Blood Is Love. Heady (and heavy) stuff!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the good stuff, come on y'all, and take a little bit","review":"For all of the NIN fans who think that \\"change is good\\", listen to how it's really done. After beginning to listen to \\"Lullibies to Paralyze\\", the first three tracks had me worried . But it would get better. Much better. If I were to rate tracks 4-13 only, they would easily get 5 stars. Up until \\"Songs for the Deaf\\", I really did think that Josh Homme, whom I have been a fan of since his beginnings with Kyuss, could do no wrong. I thought that half of \\"Songs for the Deaf\\" was killer, but there was half filler too. But with his new album, Homme realy does show that he is on top of his game as a songwriter. If you don't like this, you're just not getting it. Your loss. And as I fade away..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get a clue","review":"This cd is great, but the Amazon.com reviewer, Aidin Vaziri, is obviously not informed about the band of which he writes.

This album is pretty boring, especially by Kyuss and previous QOTSA standards. There just doesn't seem to be any creativity in any of the songwriting. In most of the songs, it's the same riff or lick over and over. There are practically no bridges, tempo or melody changes in the course of any of the songs. And there is really no edge to most of the songs. They seem to just drone on. Only Medication, Everybody Knows That You're Insane, and Tangled Up In Plaid save this album to some extent. Overall, extremely weak."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a letdown!! Don't waste yer $$","review":"Big fan of Kyuss. Liked \\"Restricted\\". LOVED \\"Songs\\"- thought it was brilliance. But this, sorry to say, is a total disappointment. Where's the aggression? The melody? The balls? The hooks? the SONGS?? It's like Homme took all his most repetitive ideas and made a messy, boring joke just to see who was still listening. There's the odd good riff; he's talented, after all. But mostly it's totally flat. I hate it. I'm giving my copy away. Spend your dinero on the new \\"Corrosion of Conformity\\" instead, it's MUCH, MUCH better music.

It is brilliantly produced and the song-craftmanship is fantastic. There are so many different audio colors and tracks going on within each song that you can't possibly get everything on just 1, 2 or even 3 listens. The DVD version is a must as you get to see highlights of the album being made track by track. The songs are all fantastic and a bit more \\"mature\\" than their previous efforts. Some are really quite \\"haunting\\" in atmosphere - really unexpected at times, and very, very cool. The previous QOTSA CD's are all great albums, but this one is by far the most cohesive and well executed. Nick O. really is not missed at all except for his spastic vocals - I was surprised at this as he's been such a partner to Josh for so long. All in all a fantastic cd that is a must for your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"A step behind \\"songs for the deaf\\" but yet quite good","review":"Now QOTSA, is pure Homme, just Homme and nothing but Homme but im certain that QOTSA have been Homme since the genesis of the band and that collaborations from Olivieri and Lanegan and Grohl have just provided interesting elements to the music recorded in previous albums but \\"the Queens\\" basic element is definitelly Homme and this time \\"Lullabies to Paralyze\\" is the chance he have to prove that and he have done just fine, maybe not in the amazing way we knew before but fine, very enjoyable cuts we can appreciate here, \\"burn the witch\\" ,\\"Everybody Knows That You Are Insane\\" and of course \\"Little Sister\\", it just worths the money spent for this cd, maybe for the next record Homme should recruit the formula included in \\"Songs for the deaf\\" and the result as we already know will be even betterHM"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good","review":"What a great album. Someone's in the Wolf is an incredible song, as are Insane, Little Sister, In My Head, Plaid, and Burn the Witch. The album like mentioned above is a tale of two sides.After songs 2-8 is loses some steam, but those songs in and of itself make for a great album. While it does not hold the firepower of their debut(but not many do) it is superior to both Rated R and Songs for the Deaf.QOTSA are the most gifted hard rock band of today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Cool!","review":"Okay, some of the long time fans of QOFTSA are not sold on this becase Oliveri is gone. While Oliveri is a great bass player I can honestly say I do not miss his \\"death metal\\" vocals. Granted this CD is different from \\"Songs...\\" but still great. It took me a couple of times through before this CD really struck a note with me. Now I really love it. Lullabies\\" is not as heavy overall as \\"Songs..\\" but I feel as a whole these songs in a lot of ways are stronger. Check out \\"Burn The Witch\\". Listen to this tune a couple of times and you want be able to get it out of your head. Totally cool groove on this song. As I said it is different from \\"Songs...\\" but still very good. Check it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"i love this album!","review":"This album has got a creepy quirky feel that I like about it. I actually get into this more than \\"Songs for the deaf\\", because I find it a bit less easy listening and more experimental, which is the stuff I like. While there may not be an anthemic \\"no one knows\\", tracks like \\"medication\\" \\"little sister\\" \\"in my head\\" the 2 haunting \\"tangled up in plaid\\" and \\"someone's in the wolf\\" and the gorgeous \\"i never came\\" certainly make up for it. I haven't listened to Rated R yet but am tempted to. Josh Holmes and the band rock. The departure of the other guy is not a problem for me. Quite on the contrary I enjoy more Josh's singing than Nick's screaming, and I don't think Queens have lost in bass...Dark, twisted, everybody knows that you're insane!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Troy is very underrated","review":"It is an amazing album,i love it, the inclusion of troy takes the music to another level, buy it!

I always thought of this album as the lesser of the two, but the more I hear it I think it's just as good. It's not really \\"metal\\" heavy, but there's a heaviness to it, some slow churning rock. I suppose that's why they're tossed into the stoner rock genre alot. They kind of epitomize it. The lone hit here \\"Little Sister\\" is actually one of my least fave songs. I wont go through the other tracks here, they are all mostly good.

Queens of the Stone age are one of those bands that has staying power, even after losing one of the founding members, Joshua Homme shows that he still has the touch. I recommend this cd to anyone who likes this style of music."},{"rating":"2","title":"QOTSA minus Nick........","review":"is still good, but I think what made QOTSA so awesome in the first place was the diversity of the vocalists. Lets face it, Josh is a great singer, but he can't sing low and gritty like Mark and definately can't scream like Nick. The different vocals are what kept anything from sounding the same.Even though it is my least favorite QOTSA album, it is still great and has some amazing songs, the best being Tangled up in Plaid."},{"rating":"2","title":"It takes awhile to sink in, but once it does you're hooked!","review":"When I first heard this album, I was like WTF?! Now I can't stop listening to it. One thing I find odd is how the song \\"The Blood Is Love\\" is getting somewhat poor reviews. In my opinion it is the best track on the album - I simply can't get it out of my head. I don't think it's possible to top \\"Songs for the Deaf\\", but this is a perfect step in another direction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally some new QoTSA","review":"It took me 5 or 6 times to really get in the flow of this album, but after I let go of the fact that's it's quite different from their previous efforts, I'm finding a breadth of familar Queens and some great new sounds. The excellent lyrics and vocals of Tangled Up In Plaid and Broken Box, and the catchy guitar riffs of In My Head and Little Sister are just some of what I've dug so far. Good stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Be Patient With The Record, It Will Payoff","review":"For you Queens fans, I'm glad that they didn't make a \\"Songs For The Deaf\\" Part II. While \\"SFTD\\" was more of hard rock record, \\"Lullabies\\" incorporates a lot more different influences. \\"Burn The Witch (Swamp Boogie), \\"Someone's In The Wolf (Led Zeppelin), \\"Broken Box\\" (Love & Rockets !!) and the string of three hard rockers (Medication, Insane, & Tangled Up In Plaid). As usual, Josh's pyschedelic and Cream influences are splattered throughout the record.Complaints: \\"In My Head\\" and \\"I Never Came\\" are filler. \\"Medication\\" almost sounds like a \\"Feel Good Song Of The Summer\\" rewrite. Joey Castillo is still their worst drummer and his drums really have been mixed down in this record.It's great record to listen to at 1 in the morning. Be patient with the record as a whole and make sure you sit down and give the proper time to give it a good listen alone. Without a doubt, buy this record !!"},{"rating":"1","title":"like a broken record","review":"a couple of the songs are good, but most are so repetitive that the album on the whole is just boring. these guys need to take a Learning Annex class on writing a bridge or something."},{"rating":"1","title":"The older stuff was better","review":"The CD is ok.

After the brilliant \\"Songs for the deaf\\" they release \\"Lullabies to Paralyze\\". Why do I say \\"they\\"? There is no \\"They\\" anymore. There's only Josh Homme with some session-musicians. Songs for the deaf had Nick Olivieri, Mark Lanegan and Dave \\"bleepin'\\" Grohl! Nick Olivieri's absence takes away their edge, Mark Lanegan only sings the intro, and well the new drummer is NO DAVE GROHL!!!The sound leans toward the Debut album. But it's not as good as the debut album either.I think it could have been a lot better if only Nick had stayed, I mean everyone knew Grohl & Lanegan wouldn't stay permanently. But losing Olivieri? He gave them that edge. Homme is more of a \\"tripper\\". As we can hear on this album. Still I like the single \\"Little Sister\\" and there are more catchy tunes here. But it should have been credited as a Josh Homme solo album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Raises important issues and offers viable solutions","review":"I read Robert Frank's book, Luxury Fever, right after finishing Barbara Kingsolver's new book, The Poisonwood Bible. I recommend both and I recommend reading them in this order. Kingsolver points out the callous and self-serving nature of middle and upper-class America in a very emotional way.

It's because we're making poor decisions on what we spend money on3. We'd all be happier if we paid a lot more taxes.No joke!He makes passing references to the failure of centrally planned economies, but doesn't appear to have drawn any real lessons from them.

It's written on the level of teenage romance novels, but I doubt if any teenagers would find it any more engaging than I did. This is a story of an educated, older man approached by a young Navajo woman with aspirations of attending college.

What this means is that if you pull up on the cap and turn, there is a friction battle between where the spinning top contacts the base of the cap and the nubs against filler neck. Guess which has less friction... the nubs against the filler neck. For this design to work, the cap would need to spin on ball bearings, or something else that has less friction then the nubs against the filler neck.Bottom line: If you pull up on the locked cap with gentle to moderate force and turn the cap, it comes right off.

The cover is nice (hard) and there is a string to mark your place. There is also a large list in the front of often overlooked things to be thankful for on the days that you're having trouble coming up with something. However, I was unable to actually use the journal for the simple fact that there is not enough space to write! Each day only provides 5 lines and the lines were not enough for me to write a complete sentence across, even writing small. I didn't want to limit my ability for expression each day, so I bought another gratitude journal that provides an entire page for each day. You could really use any blank journal also, as the journal itself doesn't have prompts or any necessary information."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Tool For Enrichment","review":"This lovely book is perfect for recording those small (and large) blessings that truly constitute abundance. Some other reviewers have found fault with what they found to be limited space. But I think they've missed the point. This book never claimed to be a journal in the usual sense. When I write down a phrase or sentence describing something for which I am grateful, it opens the door to a realization of more and yet more things for which I am grateful. When I'm feeling low, I sometimes go back and read earlier entries and find myself smiling and experiencing again the joy of gratitude. Just this morning, I was reading some old entires and this phrase came into my mind: Happiness is a renewable resource. That thought in itself is a blessing to me.

It has room for the camera, and pretty much nothing else. None of the stock accessories like charging cords and such fit in it, much less any add-ons you may have bought or blank DVDs. This means you'll need a second case for all your accessories. I suppose it would be ok for a day bag if all you wanted to carry was the camera, but it just doesn't cut it as a main storage bag.Second problem: the battery is a joke. It is about half the thickness of the stock battery that comes with the DCR-DVD 505 (which itself, is two steps down from the highest capacity battery Sony offers as of 5/06). I don't even want to speculate on how quickly it would run out.In short, this kit is useless for the current generation of cameras.

The author has a good sense of humor, which makes this book more readable and not so boring in such the painful task of studying for GMAT. Only drawback is that quantitative section problems in the real one are more difficult (better say, more time consuming) than the ones that come in ANY practice test.

(This is my opinion, Mr. Camping has not said this but because of his teachings this idea does not seem too foreign) It could be that the 7th seal was opened in 1994 and for 5 years there will be a period of \\"silence\\" or perhaps the calm before the storm. The number 5 is significant in the bible (1/2 hour or .5 may equal the grace of God). It seems possible that God, in His mercy extended His grace for unbelievers for 5 years since 1994 which would bring us to Sept-Oct. 1999!

But, I became confused after he started asserting that he knew when Christ would return, since by this time I thought that he did have a deeper understanding of the Bible than most. To me, it was quite clear that from Matthew 24:36 - But of that day and hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels of heaven, but my Father only. So, I bought the book anyway to see what was said. So, people are willing to believe Mr. Camping's complex manipulations of the scripture and ignore the clear teaching of Matthew. I understand Christians' desire for the return of Christ, but that has been the case for over 2000 years. Now I read that Mr. Camping is asking people to leave their churches.

That should be enough of an evaluation. But if you insist...Hiroshima Mon Amour is equally beautiful and baffling. The challenge of the film is its narrative structure, which fluidly blends past and present through bursts of flashback. You might say that the form of the film is a cinematic attempt at capturing the mechanism of memory at work (who can really know if it was a successful attempt, memory is a subjective experience).Marguerite Duras' screenplay is chillingly spare, but a subtle beauty, Sacha Vierny's cinematography, with all its graceful tracking shots is the work of a master, and Emanuelle Riva and Eiji Okada, the handsomely paired couple at the center are played with tenderness and sympathy, and eventually a bitter edge. Alain Resnais pulls them all together for a film that is something of a revolution."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Haunting Dream of Love","review":"Not everyone will appreciate this highly subjective study of two emotionally wounded lovers in the aftermath of war, but please give it a chance.

I watched it for my film class.It was very slow, but the music helped push it along. The music helped set the mood for the graphic images it portrayed.I found the plot confusing, all the changes in time made it hard to follow. It was like a documentary gone bad. I think the love story made it cheaper, especilally since it was an affair.I did like however, the tie ins with the affair and the bombing. That was creative, although not a film I would sit at home and watch on a Saturday night."},{"rating":"2","title":"Be kind to your follow reviewers","review":"When I first saw Hiroshima Mon Amour back in late 70s, I hated every minute of it. To me, at that time, it was the worst movie I had ever seen. The story was out of focus, the characters looked pale and without any emotions. But it was then.Now, after more than 25 years, after a heartbreaking episode of my life, I begin to appreciate the subtle theme that Duras and Renais wanted to convey : It is not easy to forget a person's past. What I want to say is, for those who find this movie hard to swallow might try to watch it, say, ten or fifteen years from now, maybe he or she would have a new perspective about the movie or his life, for that matter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misguided, to say the least","review":"The Bottom Line:A film that seems more like a project from film school than something people would still praise a half-century after its release, Hiroshima Mon Amour is a bizarre combination of romantic narrative and documentary about the atomic bomb which fails completely to find a compelling reason for its own existence; one of those films that people praise primarily because it's different, without looking to see if there's anything of substance behind the iconoclasm of the director, this is a film that should be viewed only by those who wish to study the cinematic equivalent of a dish which combines candy corn and foie gras.2/4"},{"rating":"1","title":"i love japanese genecide","review":"some french felluh made this film about a script written by some lady of french inclinations. it was made with people talking and followed them on set and in sichue. some people like it.some people don't. see it and see for yourself. as bob dylan said: \\" that's the way the cookie monster...\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Movie review","review":"Wanted to see the performance for best actress oscar again in preparation for this year's selection.

I don't know what type of genre they are trying to become, but the hard rock vibe does not work well with Scott Russo's voice. I don't know what I expected, but this was not it.

On Elva, we saw some good old fashioned punk-rock laced with some slightly harder content. Also, it had some pretty good lyrics. I picked up 'Here's to the Mourning' expecting it to be more of the same, if not slightly harder. What I got was dumbed down, \\"why can't I be on the radio?\\" modern rock. For example, the lyrics are just inane, making no sense, merely trying to rhyme wherever it seems like it needs to. You'll hear nothing really new here, just some tired riffs and progressions that you've doubtless heard before in other places.On the plus side, this IS Unwritten Law, and some of the songs are undeniably catchy and good to bounce your head to.

Secondly, it seems to only fit Ipod Mini's correctly. I had to jam my 20g in there and it kept sliding out. Good luck with getting a 40g in there... Next, you can't use the click-wheel on the Ipod behind the thick plastic screen so forget about volume control or skipping a song. What a huge rip off.

I would have rewound the tape, but was tired and ready for this project to come to an end. How can so many people like this?! What about a story for crying out loud?! The most interesting scene is when Bibi Andersson freaks out and repeatedly slaps Liv Ullman in the face. It's kind of over-the-top--something you'd see in a Saturday Night Live skit.

I expect to have more luck with RICHARD PEVEAR AND LARISSA VOLOKHONSKY translation published in PENGUIN BOOKS 1997, since I pre-viewd it one of the on-line libraries."},{"rating":"2","title":"don't let them tell you you need to know russian.","review":"all that stuff about how this book is \\"inaccessible\\" to americans is totally ridiculous. this is an incredibly accessible book -- almost on a par with catcher in the rye or something like that for accessibility. it's a hilarious, incredible fable that ANYONE can enjoy.ask anyone who's read it (who isn't trying to show off that they know russian.) this book will stay with you forever. totally fun and breathtaking."},{"rating":"1","title":"BUY A DIFFERENT EDITION!","review":"As a few other reviewers have said, this edition (Classic House Books, paperback) is horrible. The Master and Margarita is one of my favorite books. I purchase a new copy and re-read it every few years. I purchase a new copy each time, because when I'm done I pass the book on to someone who's never read it. I decided I was due for a re-read, so I bought this. I wish I hadn't, because I'm not even going to be able to read it. The typos, byzantine punctuation and formatting are way too irritating. This book deserves to be enjoyed unreservedly.Please, read the book, if you haven't. But buy a different edition -- preferably the Mirra Ginsburg translation."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is an intellectual's delight.","review":"The Master and Margharita is a treasure chest of wild, creative thought and enthralling characters. I recommend it to anyone, particularly those tired of reading painfully dry Jane Austen or Emily Bronte novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great book, poor translation","review":"The Master and Margarita is indeed one of the best written books ever. Unfortunately Glenny's translation leaves much to be desired. It reflects none of Bulgakov's witty, quirky, beautifully flowing style, and reads more like a verbatim translation of a theological treatise."},{"rating":"1","title":"The middle path...","review":"I am taking the middle path with my view that while the book possesses some poignant prose, it's essential message is one of antiChristianity. As a practicing Theravada Buddhist (who, unlike others, knows enough not to say \\"God bless\\" when pure Buddhists have no god) I must say I was taken aback by the antiGospel presented in the tale of Pontius Pilate. Pilate is a fascinating character. Yeshua, on the other hand, is presented as quite the opposite of his Jesus of the Gospel counterpart; Yeshua is fearful to the point of cowardice, bumbling and idiotic, he dies violently, does NOT rise (key difference with the Gospel, that any fool with the most remedial knowledge of the Gospel would know), and ends up a corpse buried with other common criminals. How this can substitute for the Gospel, how this shows Jesus coming off fine is WAY beyond me. This is an antiGospel. Those who are not Christian wont be offended. The book is fine fiction, but not to be taken seriously."},{"rating":"1","title":"creepy, dark, blasphemous book","review":"If you want to feel creepy, weird, dark and half-way insane, please read this book - it's perfect for that. I also thought it was blasphemous."},{"rating":"1","title":"God, evil is boring!","review":"Unequivocally a heap of putrid, sickening tripe...a collection of overrated, overwritten, underimaginative, repetative fatuousness. Bulgakov is the complete antithesis of Russian greats like Tolstoy, Dostoyevsky and Nabakov. Bulgakov's characters are predictable, his plots uninteresting, his descriptions jejune and redundant. If I could I would give it zero stars. Waste of time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Syntax, Spelling, and Lack of a Translator","review":"I would be careful purchasing this edition of The Master and Margarita. The lack of a translator was apparent with misspelled words (haze, spelled ha2e), poor sentence structure (often lacking a verb), and the spacing was not indicative of who was speaking.I have since gone on and purchased the edition by Picador and find it an entrancing read. I realize now how much I missed out of the first three chapter of the edition I purchased from Amazon by Classic House Publishing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this version of M & M","review":"The Master and Margarita is a wonderful book, a masterpiece, but this version is so flawed that it's hard to see the jewel underneath.I bought this copy because I'd lost my last, almost worn out paperback. It is so full of typographical errors that it is nearly unreadable. Spelling mistakes, no spaces after punctuation, too many spaces after punctuation, odd use of conventions (quotation marks, colons, etc) make this apparently slickly produced book (nice cover photo, by the way) appear to be the work of a first year keyboarding student without any proofreading abilities.The errors are so numerous (many per EVERY paragraph) and so distracting that I am unsure whether I can finish the book before I chuck it in the recycling bin. I hope I can give it zero stars. If I have to select \\"one star,\\" believe me, it doesn't deserve it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad batch or poor editing...","review":"My Russian husband bought this book for me because he had researched and decided this was the best translation. While this may be the case (I don't know about that), the typos in this book are ridiculous! It is literally hard to get beyond the first chapter because of them. Excerpt complete with typos as seen in the book: \\"As to his teeth, he haid platinum crowns on his left side and gold ones on his tight. [...] Right eye black, left ieye for some reason green.\\" I admit that I am particularly sensitive to this kind of thing, and I understand one or two errors getting by an editor, but this book is riddled with them and it makes it difficult to read, at least for me since every typo is like a hiccup in the flow of a sentence."},{"rating":"1","title":"A lousy edition of a great book","review":"I bought this book because I had worn out a previous copy from several re-readings. Needless to say, the book is worth reading, but I strongly suggest obtaining a different edition from this one. The production quality of this book is zero! Multiple typos in just the first 5 pages, a clumsy typeface, sloppy spacing -- obviously somebody just printed out a poorly produced text document that had never been proofread. I have given the book to a resale shop because it was so bad that I couldn't stand to read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"bootleg edition","review":"Do not purchase this book published under ISBN 1442133171. It is a scanned and poorly OCR'd copy of another translation. The bootleggers didn't even proofread this before \\"publishing\\" the scanned edition via CreateSpace. So many typos, the letter z is often swapped with the number 2, etc. Don't get me started on punctuation, esp. pertaining to dialogue.
