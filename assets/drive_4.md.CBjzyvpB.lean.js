Do I have to go through this to see Cher?\\" Well, I was never more glad to have to eat my own words; this was quality. The acting was excellent, the plot was great, and my mom and I fell in love with Johnny, the dreamy, no-good baker portrayed by Nicholas Cage. Cher was also great in her role as Loretta, the repressed widow resigned to marry some mamma's boy without loving him. That part of Johnny and Loretta's night out, when they accidentally meet her father and his mistress at the opera was so good, I rewinded the tape and watched it again. And Loretta's mother dining with the stranger... well, those are the highlights, but on the whole it was a wonderful movie. If you're like me and don't like most romantic comedies, just give this one a try, you'll probably be pleasantly surprised."},{"rating":"2","title":"I have to admit...","review":"I've watched so many widescreen DVDs now that getting a full screen DVD is disconcerting, to say the least. I'm sure somebody somewhere had their reason for not publishing a widescreen version. One way or another, this alone gives this particular purchase one less star. The movie itself, however, is awesome. At some point, you forget that you're watching a full screen DVD because you can end up getting wrapped up in this modern day New York Italian love story. If you've not seen this movie, don't expect your ordinary Romeo and Juliet romance. This is not R&J. It's just an outrageous love story that happens to also be a comedy."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best movies ever!","review":"Funny, brilliantly directed, witty script, dead-on depiction of the Italian-American family.

The story is about an italian-american family who is involved in the wedding of Loretta,a forty age woman played by a stunning Cher. The event is a chance for every member of the family to come to terms with their own lives.The script is delicious and the performances of all the actors is great,especially Vincent Gardenia in a grotesque character of the unfaithful Loretta's father and Olimpia Dukakis in the shoes of the strong and understanding Loretta's mother.Watch it,you won't waste your time!3 Academy Awards winner:Best Actress (Cher),Supporting Actress ( Olympia Dukakis) and Original script."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awe-Struck","review":"Nicolas Cage, Cher and Danny Aiello are involved in a strange 3 way love affair. Two brothers who do not speak to eachother fall for the same woman. Set in modern day Brooklyn, this story of lust and love is surrounded with the Italian/American flavor that is the thread of Danny Aiello's best film work. Throw in Olympia Dukakis as Cher's ugatza mother, and Vincent Gardenia as Cher's Sfachima father, and funny things happen. Add a star if you're from Brooklyn, add 2 stars if you're Italian.

The replacement is very slightly out of sync of video and audio at the end of movie. Shows poor quality control."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite movie of all time","review":"This is a screwballed comedy that delivers. Everyone can empathize with some the characters dilemmas. From the widowed character Cher plays that longs for a married life and almost ends up with the wrong guy, to the Mom (Olympia Dukakis) that looks for a single answer to a big question (Why do men chase women?). Every character plays both their practical side and their romantic side. This was the heart of the movie. We all opt for the practical, but hope for the romantic (moonstruck). I've seen this movie over ten times now and I never get sick of it. Especially, the final scene at the kitchen table."},{"rating":"1","title":"Caricatures","review":"All the men are stupid jerks who screw up their own lives and the lives of those around them.

No wonder my wife thinks this is the best movie of all time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor use of DVD technology","review":"This review is not about the movie in general. There are enough of those here already. However the DVD was very dissapointing. Purportedly the sound was upgraded to Dolby 5.1 Surround. The sound instead is washed out and the volume difficult to maintain at one level. Often volume needs to be increased to hear the actors and then reduced again as the background music swells. Almost as bad is the video. It's as if they produced the DVD off an old, beat up print. Small flashes of white and black spots continually appear throughout the movie.I bought the DVD at a reputable retailer, but it plays like a bootleg."},{"rating":"1","title":"no wide screen","review":"The thing is DVD is all about wide screen.

First off, it featured classical music. The classical music used here was not your regular run of the mill hits that we have come to cherish, but Italian classics. This could be good or it could be bad, it just depends on your taste for C music. In my case this music never struck a postitive nerve. I guess my taste for classical music is to love the big hits of the masters. You know the million seller tunes.I really felt like this music was a waste, as far as my individual needs are concerned. The only song I really got any kind of charge from was the non-classical piece \\"Moonglow\\". It really stole the show in my opinion!In all fairness, I can not ask anyone to buy this cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst movie ever!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This movie sucks big time. It was so boring, dull, unfunny and a piece of garbage. Please do not waste your precious time or waste your money on this sorry excuse for a movie.

I don't understand how cher got an oscar when Glenn Close was nominated for fatal attraction. Again I repeat, THIS MOVIE IS A WASTE OF TIME, DON'T EVEN BOTHER, IT MADE ME SICK.

Did I mention widescreen?This film must adamantly be rereleased as a special addition in widescreen with full attention to detail then it will deserve five stars. Until then stick to video and save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moonstruck","review":"Nominated for the best picture Oscar, and winning statuettes for co-stars Cher and Dukakis, this movie overflows with charm and humor. Cher hits all the right notes as the bewildered Loretta, but Dukakis comes off best in the tricky role of Rose, a rare woman who's as wise about herself as others, and faces a challenging personal situation with grace and dignity. A flavorful, heartwarming delight from director Norman Jewison."},{"rating":"1","title":"Moonstike","review":"I received Moonsturck and The Seven Year Itch for Chritsmas ordered from Amazon. I love this movie and was excited to see it on blueray. When I played it you get as far as the 20th Century announcement and then a message comes up that if you have any problems viewing the bluray go to .... then the screen stays black. Going to the suggested website was not helpful. My niece sent it back to Amazon who was quick to send a replacement. Sadly, the replacement is doing the same thing. I have no problems watching other blurays nor The Seven Year Itch (ordered from Amazon at the same time and looks and sounds great). I don't know if both blurays came from the same manufacturer. She will be contacting Amazon about it, since they won't speak with me because I didn't order it.

Another hopeless romantic film that you just can't get enough of."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moonstruck-A cheesy classic tale of love","review":"This movie is great! Nick Cage when he was younger and Cher when she was...well...anyhow...they both look great and the story is clever and well built on the same grounds as La Boheme, a Lover's classic Opera tale. Cameos by a lot of great actors of our time. The roots of the Catholic Italians in New York is intriging...and the whole issue of age and it's timelessness...Definitely one for the collection!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great movie, bad DVD treatment.","review":"A cute, romantic comedy. Great scenes of Manhattan and Brooklyn. Very good character development, and Cher and Nicolas Cage work very well together. Olympia Dukakis does a great job as an emotionally deep, morally strong mother with a sense of humour. Great music too, though the 5.1 mix was not very dynamic. Sound stays mainly in the center channel, which itself was muddy, making dialogue difficult to follow at times. The video was pan and scan, which ruins it in my book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely POOR reproduction quality for \\"HD\\" Movie","review":"It's a very interesting movie and since I was involved with a large, close knit Italian family for several years, there were many parallels to real life based on my experience...not a bad thing at all. Very enjoyable.On the rental: In addition to having to restart the movie 2 times, the supposed amazon's HD version of the movie is such poor quality it looked like an old VHR quality so that was very disappointing to watch a blurry picture. I did register a complaint though I doubt there will be a change to this particular offering based on the response I received.This was my first and last movie rental from Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"great movie","review":"Great fun.

You may not be aware, BUT, mercury never leaves the body, unless you remove it by means of medical treatment removal; look that method up as well. Mercury is not good for your child, no matter the amount, I am a mother and involved in science. Take my advice and try something a lot more organic and mercury free.

Huggies Pure & Natural, which shed lint all over my baby's bottom;2. Huggies Snug & Dry, which also shed lint in addition to leaking at night;3. Pampers Sensitive, which is also a great diaper that I used for his first few months. It is just more expensive and we no longer needed the \\"sensitive\\" option.Overall, Pampers Baby Dry are great. The only downside is that the tabs can sometimes rub the thighs. Pampers has remedied this by adding \\"wings\\" to the front sides to protect chubbier thighs from the plastic tabs.

We just switched him up to the size 4's, and no more issues. These are the first size of diaper that I found he grew out of before getting closer to the upper weight limit.

My son is breast fed and he's not on solid food so a diaper labeled \\"baby dry\\" SHOULD have done the trick but instead it is un-absorbant and thus very leaky. Even if the diaper hasn't shot the poo up my baby's backside while he was playing then when I place him on the changing table, it is sure to do just that, creating a mess.

I came to USA last month and since I had always used pampers, I went for pampers diapers again.To my dismay, the quality is so low but I thought that it would atleast work well. I have noted that it doesn't last for more than 5 hours. I put the diaper on at 830PM in the night and must change it at around 2 AM in the morning. One day night I didn't change his diaper at 2 and I woke up at 3AM when my son woke up crying, I was so shocked to see the diaper gel lying all over the bed.

Unfortunately, the deal was too good to be true. My daughter consistently pees out of the front when she wakes up in the morning. During the day, these diapers are fine because she lets us know when she has peed. I wouldn't put them on at night. They tend to leave little opaque pebbles on her butt. As for the sizing, they tend to run big with tabs made for newborns. I would use these at daycare or in the diaper bag because you can get 5-6 diapers in a small bag. Right now, I would rank generic diapers from HEB (I live in Texas) better than Pampers."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened pampers?","review":"I've been diapering babies for the last 12 years straight and have always loved pampers. My kids are sensitive to other brands so I have to use the name brands and pampers never lets me down. Until this box. I have purchased this brand/size/box count before (months ago) with no problems but for some reason every single diaper in this last box leaks. He is soaking wet every time I put one on him. It doesn't matter if he's awake or asleep he's soaked through his onesie, shirt, and pants as soon as he goes. It's almost as if there's nothing absorbant in there. The urine leaks through the entire outside cover. I thought maybe it was the baby at first so I kept using them but after switching back to cruisers and another name brand in the same size no leaks at all. Now I have a huge box of expensive diapers I can't use. Not happy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pampers diapers - have they changed???","review":"I was tired of the tabs on luvs and decided to go back to pampers, but when I tried both the cruisers and baby dry diapers this time around, they both gave my little guy diaper rash (they didn't do that a year and a half ago). The baby dry didn't do it as bad as the cruisers. I love pampers products - both the baby dry diapers and the cruisers as well (great fit, quality product), but they are useless if they give your little one diaper rash.

I just got back back from walking around the grocery store with baby poop smeared on my shirt because of these silly diapers. We've been using Swaddlers since birth but for some reason, between size 3 and 4, we switched to Baby Dry... He's never had many issues peeing through diapers during the night or #2 blow-outs but we've had something happen everyday with these diapers. Today's blow-out on the way home from work was the final straw. They do not fit as snugly around his thighs, and I think that may be causing the leaking issues. During the night, the pee soaks through the top on the front. He's a pretty thick baby so I'm blaming the diapers!I am switching back to Swaddlers Sensitive today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick to swaddlers","review":"I'm a new mom and was first I introduced to pampers swaddlers at the hospital...nice fit, wetness indicator stripe, no leaks, good absorption. Well I ordered a case of babydry by mistake thinking they were all the same. I was wrong. The baby dry are ill fitting, poorly constructed diapers that don't even need a wetness indicator because you'll see it all around your baby's sheets!!! You have to always make sure to fasten them up high and tight if not they'll leak. Also if your baby has runny stools good luck. Sometimes they'll catch it other times they won't. I also don't like how they have a plastic bag feel to them. Maybe it's just me, but my rating stays a one star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I bought these not knowing that they are Pampers \\"bargain\\" brand.

I loved pamper's Cruiser but Baby Dry no longer keeps the baby dry. It gets saturated very quickly and sometimes leaks. With Pamper's Baby Dry diapers, you will have to change diapers very frequently (on an average every 3 to 4 hours) as it will hold just one pee then start to sag. It is cheaper for more diapers and I thought it was a good deal but you get what you paid for. I don't understand why so good quality name Pamper brand started producing so poor quality product. I am no longer ordering this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"New born diapers","review":"I ordered these new born pamer diapers in advance so I would be prepared for when my baby came.

On a baby who is still on breast milk, the diapers resulted in feces going up their back and stomach, which soaked clothing, blankets and whatever else she happen to be touching. Our daughter's onesie was completely saturated in fecal matter, so we had to cut it off of her as to not get it on her face while trying to pull it over her head. So we lost $50 and a onesie, had to wash the bouncer, blanket, and my clothing, but we gained 276 useless diapers. It seems like you'd be better off using a handkerchief instead of Baby Dry diapers. I could only imagine the damage if she were on solid foods.

Now that my little guy is a toddler and walking all over the place, I wasn't sure if I would have to \\"upgrade\\" to the Pampers Cruisers, but these work perfectly fine and flex with him as he walks and toddles about.The diapers do swell, but they are pretty absorbent and I have only experienced a handful of leaks and thankfully no poop blowouts as of yet.No rashes or skin irritations experienced with this diaper and using the Amazon subscribe and save has saved me money and delivers these right to my door."},{"rating":"2","title":"pampers","review":"great for the money.

My son has been in Huggies for a long time and I thought we would give these a try since the price is a pretty good deal through Amazon. I'm sorry I did. These are VERY thin diapers and the quality is extremely poor. These are definitely not the baby dry diapers I used on my older son a few years ago. These are completely white, no design at all. They used to have cute Sesame Street designs on them. The sides are not very stretchy and the diaper easily gets pushed down by clothing. We have had leaking at night because of this. Also, when the diaper has been on for a while (like at night) it's like the diapers shreds a bit around the leg openings. I assume this is due to rubbing against clothing for extended periods of time. I will NOT be buying these again. I'm sorry I bought such a big box since most of these will go to waste. Pampers Cruisers however, are great."},{"rating":"2","title":"These are not bad","review":"I was a little bit of a diaper snob a couple months ago & had to use the premium diapers.

I liked the feel of them & they were less bulky then the Huggies. I never had leaking problems with either ot them. My mother in law bought me a package of the Baby Dry size 4. I just thought these were Pampers cheap diapers & they wouldn't work as well but I was proved wrong! We've been using the size 4 for my 12 month old for a month now & have never had a leakage problem. They are not as soft as the Cruisers but they are not terrible either.

I purchased Pampers Baby Dry (or should I call it Baby Wet?), all I can say is that it didn't work at all. We have to change diapers every 3 hours both in the day time and night time. Definitely a waste of money and we had to throw out half box of the unused ones.My 12-month-old boy usually sleeps through the whole night.

Most of the time, they work great. However, if the diaper gets too full, they just burst and the absorbant material goes everywhere (about the consistency of little bits of tapioca). It is very difficult to get all of it off of my daughter without giving her a bath, and I worry about what chemicals it might contain. This has probably happened three times in the last two months (only putting the diapers on at night). I am going to stop using them now.

It would stay dry for 4 hours maybe. These things leak (not overflow); that is it I sit my baby on my lap, after a while my pants will be wet. Moreover 90% of the time the bed will be wet in the morning, unless the baby cries in the middle of the night and I use that occasion to change her.In the end these babydry diapers are MORE EXPENSIVE than the Cruisers due to the fact that I have to change my baby a lot more often.

I couldn't wait to get rid of these !! EVERY Morning my son would be soaked through the diaper, sheets all wet, and very smelly ! These hardly hold anything through the night ! The name is not fitting what so ever ! I actually can't believe that Pampers would even put their name on something like this ! The diaper is thin, cheap, and honestly a headache!

I just upped my almost two year old from Baby Dry 4's to size 5's, expecting no big change, just help with her volume increase. Something has definitely changed! I first noticed a new chemical-like smell I never smelled with any previous Pampers Baby Dry. Then my daughter quickly developed a diaper rash. This child has never had a diaper rash a day in her life before this. I was still hesitant to believe it really could be the Pampers (they're so great! no leaks! so cheap on Amazon! I've ALWAYS used them!), but finally bought some Seventh Generation diapers to try, and the diaper rash vanished. MAJOR BUMMER!!! Why ruin such a great product, P&G?

Unfortunately, I saw that I could buy these for a few dollars cheaper and decided to try them out. They do not work. We have been using them for about a week and EVERY time my son has a poopy diaper, it's a complete blow out. Even when he is upright, it somehow leaks out the top of the back of the diaper. We had been using the Swaddlers and only had one blow out in 4 months. Maybe these diapers work with older children with firmer stools, but they do not work at all for us at this age. Besides the constant blow outs, these diapers have a plastic, cheap feeling. Pampers should be ashamed to put their name on them. So, instead of saving a few dollars, I'm now buying new diapers even when I have around 200 of these diapers left."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"I signed up with subscribe and save and receive a case of pampers every 2 months or more frequently.

We got a pack of these from a neighbor and they worked the best of all, so we've stuck with these. You can tell how wet the diaper is by feeling how inflated the diaper is. Wish I was using cloth diapers but that didn't really work out for us due to logistics (no washer) and I wish I had a more \\"natural\\" choice, but others are more expensive and don't work as well.

I stopped using them when they added the Dry-Max, because I heard so many bad things about it. I switched to Up&Up, which I like a lot. I was afraid my baby would have a bad reaction to the Dry-Max. I was under the impression that Baby-Dry didn't have the Dry-max in it. It doesn't say dry-max on the box, anyhow. I got a great deal on a huge box, so I decided to try them. I started using them on Monday, and by Wednesday my son's behind was broke out and inflamed. So now I have 130+ diapers I won't use. Of course, not everyone will have the same problem. But I've tried several brands: Huggies, Luvs, Fisher-Price, generics, etc. and my son never developed a rash.

I will never buy Pampers again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Baby is not dry in Baby Dry, Prefer Swaddlers","review":"I have been using Pampers Swaddlers for my son (now 13 months old) and highly recommend THIS brand of Pampers. My goal was to order the same brand from Amazon but the only brand available on Amazon was Pampers Baby Dry diapers so I decided to give it a try, because after all, it is still made by Pampers, a name I trust. I do NOT recommend Baby Dry diapers. My son would stay dry in the Swaddlers but ironically he was soaking wet in the Baby Dry diapers. The diaper does not hold the wetness which would become saggy once wet and leak up the front, so he would be wet all over, in his diaper, his pjs, and his bedding, overnight in this diaper.

We would literally go through 5 diapers in 10 minutes! We decided to go with Baby Dry for the daytime and he's so content! We still change him often but we aren't wasting diapers on an eyedropper full of pee anymore.We like them better than Swaddlers for a couple other reasons: they are perfumed but not as heavy as Swaddlers are (which my husband HATED anyhow), there is no indicator line but it is still very easy to tell when they are wet. Baby dry are thinner and trimmer than the Swaddlers were but absorb better.Downside: they are blue on the absorbent side - they make the poop look EXTRA gross."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pampers Baby Dry","review":"I am not a fan of the pampers baby dry. I have a 16 month old and when the diaper gets wet it starts to sag in the bottom to the point where it looks funny and I am sure is uncomfortable for her. The fact that she is such a mover I think makes this not a great diaper for her age. The pamper cruisers are great and that is what she is wearing now.

The fit!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Baby Wet","review":"I don't normally write reviews unless I feel strongly about them, positive or negative. I feel so strongly negative about Pampers Baby Dry that I felt compelled to write this review. These diapers leak all the time. And not just when they're full- they leak even when the diaper is brand new and dry. They leak so astoundingly bad, that it's as if there is no diaper there at all. It surprises me, because I've actually had a great experience with Pampers Cruisers. I thought Baby Dry would be just as good as the Cruisers, but that hasn't been the case. I'd imagine that because every baby's body is built a little different, different diapers will fit better than others, so not everyone will have the same experience with the same diaper. All I can say is that, for my son, Baby Dry is about as bad as they can get. I'd go with Pampers Cruisers instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceptional diapers.

My daughter wore the size 4 Baby Dry diapers and I decided to switch to the bigger ones. My daughter's weight is 26 lbs and the size 4 was just too small for her. As she started gaining more weight she began growing out of these diapers because later on she started having leaks from the diaper at night. I decided to go with the bigger size 5 and that it should be better. Well they are great because they are bigger, but the problem is that they are too big. There's space between her body and the middle of the diaper. So when she pees, at times the pee just comes out on the side instead of the diaper. The connection between the body and diaper is not good. I'm sure when she gains more weight the diapers will be great again. Overall I like these diapers a lot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pampers Baby Dry All Wet","review":"I purchased 204 Pampers Baby Dry Diapers. They are different from ones I have bought in the past.

They sag in the back with only a small amount of liquid in them. My husband is begging me to go back to our old brand, which I am promptly going to do.

So I think Baby-dry may be the same good. So I ordered some online, but am very disappointed with its design. The first time my 21-month-old wore it, it left a red mark in his thighs. One big design problem with it is the strip that adheres to the front side is not elastic, so it makes it impossible to auto-adjust itself, and is not suitable for an active toddler as it may cut into the skin. I have to return the product as I just can't use it on my son!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"These diapers are terrible. I'm not sure the diapers in the box are actually Pampers.

But after I lost my job I started buying the big boxes from Costco that are the kirkland brand diapers (which are basically the Huggies). I purchased these because of the price at the time with free shipping and the price of gas it turned out to cost just as much as those did. Well I will not be using these diapers for him anymore! They do not hold anything in! He goes to bed with a new/fresh diaper every night and by the time he wakes up 8-10 hours later he is completely soaked through! Never once did this happen with the Costco brand diapers...or pull ups! For 2 weeks now he has been soaking through every night and that is without liquids before bed!

All the past papers from size 3 to 5 are so good that I found the baby dry diaper is the best on market and Amazon did give great price for it.Lately, I got a box of diapers those are very different from what I used to have. The box size is 172 diapers instead of 156, for which I guess it is the new packing, but should be the same product. Unfortunately, I was wrong. The diaper is very different. All the diapers give out so strong smells that gave me headache. The smell is like the bad play mat or some foam you could find in the cheap way. I then ordered a replacement, and the same thing happened. I have to return. And I guess I would not buy diapers on Amazon anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"total useless..","review":"this is one of the worst diapers we ever used.

So I still have to continue to wake her up in the middle of the night to change her. Which sometimes can be a HORRIBLE task! I do feel that they have the best fit for the size though..

Unfortunately, since they've gone up in price for us since Amazon changed their Amazon Moms program, we'll probably switch to Luvs Ultra Leakguard, which we've found are almost identical but cheaper.

The first time I used this we saw the leak all over his dress and we thought we haven't dressed him perfectly. But that's not true, every time we used this diaper there is leak almost 4 times out of 5. We are not at all happy with this product. Before using this we tried Cruisers and that one is perfect.

It handles big bowel movements well. It's never leaked. My baby has not had any kind of reaction to the diaper. The only reason I give this diaper 4 stars is because Luvs does the same thing for much cheaper-- in this case about $15 cheaper for the same amount of diapers. Luvs does have a powder sent which I would not prefer if money were no object, however it's not too strong and is worth it to save that amount of money per box."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pampers dry max cause our baby to have a rash","review":"Pampers are good quality, pretty good protection against blowouts, etc. But we have two complaints. First of all, there's a mesh on the inside that sticks to baby's bottom pretty consistently. Worse, for us, the \\"dry\\" part is because of chemicals in the diaper, which caused our baby to develop red, rashy skin very quickly. We've since read that this is a common issue with Pampers, especially \\"dry max\\". Overall, I would not recommend these to a friend. Huggies and others have worked far better for us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dry but not the best choice for size 1","review":"Props:- The diaper actually does a good job on dry out.Cons:- It is too thin to hold watery poop- It does not have a wetness indicator.Definitely not a good choice for new parents.

She has wet her car seat, chair so many times already having baby dry diapers on. We decided to go back to Cruisers. They were the best for my daughter.

I don't know if the diaper is totally to blame because he does sleep on his stomach some of the time and he is a super soaker at night!

Even though I was changing my son extra time during night and diaper was not really full, he would ended up in the wet bed. I realized it leaks when he sleeps on the side, but it not suppose to happen. I guess I just got defective box. I bought pampers cruisers for overnight use, and used baby dry only for day time.

I bought a huge package of these and I wish I hadn't. First of all they always leak. My son will fill up one of these diapers in no time and he always leaks pee out the sides and up his back. Second, because they don't hold much liquid, his poops also spill out. They leak poop up his back and around his legs (and he does not have skinny legs. He was born 9 pounds.) The diapers aren't that soft either and they have caused my son to get diaper rash. I assume its due to the fact that they're not very absorbent and that they're not that soft.

DON'T BUY THESE!!","review":"We've used Pampers diapers since our 7 month old was born. Once our son turned 6 months old, the diapers no longer came close to providing the absorption needed to keep him dry through the night. Without diaper issues, he is sleeping through the night. However, the diapers begin to leak around 2am and by the morning both he and his crib are saturated. The \\"Dry Max\\" technology is nothing more than a marketing gimic. It clearly doesn't work and provides even less absorption capacity than the previous formulation. Save yourself the headache and buy a different brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smell terrible, leaky and expensive","review":"The only reason I gave these diapers 2 stars is because they prevent diaper rash if you aren't able to change a wet diaper right away. Otherwise they're awful. The baby powder smell is overpowering and stinks up the baby as well as the baby's clothes. They're also leaky at night because of the lack of padding in the back, so if the baby lays on his or her back while sleeping, protection is unreliable. They don't work for 12 hours at night like the package says. I've used Pampers in 2 other countries--Japan and the Philippines--and the American ones are cheap looking and stinky like the ones sold in the Philippines but cost more than the Japanese ones. The Japanese ones are unscented, don't leak at night, and are cheaper than the American ones sold in stores. The only good thing about buying them at Amazon is that you can get a better price on them, but in my opinion they're not worth buying no matter how cheap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality diaper!","review":"We've tried close to every brand of diaper available - even store brands. We've had a lot of success with Pampers diapers. Our daughter is tall for her age and has a longer torso. With some diapers it is difficult to find one that fits high enough, preventing leaks. These seem to fit her well, no leaks! Also, for as thin as they are, they seem to be very aborbent.We had been using Costco's Kirkland brand diapers because they were a good value diaper, and were not unhappy with them. However, after I enrolled in the 'Amazon Mom' program, I am able to get these diapers shipped to my door on the schedule I choose, free shipping, for less than I was able to buy the same quantity of Costco's brand. Impressive! We're able to get a quality, brand-name diaper at a big-box-store price.Since enrolling in the program, we have switched back to Pampers and are very pleased!"},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING","review":"Having used Pampers for the last year and been very happy with them I was more than shocked when this last box arrived and the absorbency pad was half as thick as it used to be. Needless to say - my son can't even make it through a nap without soaking through his diaper let alone the night time. I am now switching to Huggies in hopes of not having to get up at 3am to changed a sopping wet, screaming child."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"I tried these because I used Pampers Swaddlers and Cruisers in the past and liked them (before switching to 7th Generation diapers temporarily because of concerns over my baby's skin sensitivity). The price enticed me to buy these, and I was really disappointed. They felt cheap and the performance was poor. LOTS of leaking, in my opinion. Her sheets and clothes all smelled like urine continuously. I couldn't wait to get rid of them. I bought Cruisers in the same size to replace them, and they were a lot bigger. Just an opinion, but to me I'd rather pay more for diapers that work better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gave my baby a rash","review":"We have always used Pampers Swaddlers and loved them, but they only go up to size 3. Now that my daughter is 14 months old, we needed to move her to size 4. I ordered an economy pack of Pampers Baby Dry diapers and she has a terrible rash. I don't think she has particularly sensitive skin, either. We've tried Pampers Cruisers before and will definitely be moving back to those. Although, I don't like this particular product of Pampers, it's the only brand that doesn't leak for us!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst one to date","review":"Got two kids have used tons of diapers from various brands big and small - but was never appalled at its quality like my experience with this one. These diapers invariably leak on a regular basis and seem to have very little absorption capacity. Its hard to believe that this comes from Pampers, I have been pretty satisfied with them in the past. I hope this is a one-off, but it does make me a little apprehensive picking up Pampers again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pamper Baby Dry are more like Pamper baby wet!","review":"I have a 2 Year old boy and ever since he was born I use Pampers because they where the best product that work. I started with Pamper swaddlers, baby dry, cruisers and night time pampers. For the 36 months of using this product I had a couple of licks as usual but recently Pampers Baby Dry are not the same. THE DIAPER QUALITY HAS CHANGED; they are thinner and feel just like any generic brand diaper and they don't hold up to 12 hours as they claim. After using many diaper brands I chose Pampers because I had less licks but now it doesn't matter. I'm very disappointed because I spend a lot of money on diapers that are not up to the price. My Son's Baby Dry Diapers is just as good as generic diapers now. After 36 months o buying the same diaper I noticed the difference on the quality change; thank you Pampers Inc for making a despicable quality Diaper for a higher price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would not recommend...Frequent Leaks!","review":"I purchased Pampers Baby Dry size 4 thinking it was a good price for the Brand Name. However, only a couple hours after placing the diaper on my baby, it began to leak through the front panel. The diaper was hardly full, but my baby's clothes were damp. These diapers definitely don't make it through the night either. All the diapers in this box have been this way. Maybe my Pampers box was a just a lemon. Good luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy CRUISERS instead; these leak too easily.","review":"I bought a pack of the Baby Dry diapers for what I thought would be for night-time use and use our Cruiser subscription for day use. We have a 20-mos boy and we do not like the Baby Dry at all; my son has woken up a few times with urine soaked shirts and shorts so aside from being unhygenic, these diapers just lack the quality or thickness that the Cruisers are so we'll be cancelling our subscription for them. LOVE CRUISERS for day and overnight use though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest diapers, second to Cruisers","review":"Everyone has the diapers they swear by. This work great like the cruisers, but for some reason my daughter tends to get a little red (early stage of rash) when wearing these and we don't get the red with cruisers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Buy for diapers","review":"We've used Pampers Baby Dry for about three months now for our daughter and we really like them. She's never had a problem with them and they hold a lot. She's sleeping about 10 hours at night partly because she is very comfortable and she can last the whole night on just one diaper. It's pretty full when she wakes up but her skin still seems mostly dry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rash after using","review":"We usually use the huggies pure and natural, huggies snug and dry, and pampers swaddlers (both older type and the newer dry max). We used another baby's diapers which were these pampers baby dry, and my son got huge rash splotches in several areas. I had heard about parents complaining about rashes and thought it was only a concern for babies with sensitive skin, but in 10 months this was the first time my son got a rash from the diaper. Glad we don't have a box of these around to throw out! I can't comment on how effective the diapers are on wetness and containment since we don't use them regularly."},{"rating":"2","title":"great diaper, but we needed the cruisers for our mover and shaker","review":"I have had excellent experience with Pampers since our now two year old (26 pounds) was a preemie (3 pounds 15 ounces). The Baby Dry are just another example of the excellent quality diaper Pampers provides no matter what the size of your child. Our daughter does have a slender shape (little hips and butt) and these diapers have held in everything until she started moving around more (which is when we switched to Cruisers). We have also only experience two diaper rashes (very minimal) while using Pampers. I have tried Huggies and Seventh Generation and Kirkland, but Pampers has consistently worked the best for our daughter over the last two years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Baby Dry = Baby Wet all the time!","review":"We decided to try these diapers this go around. I made a big mistake by buying a huge pack! Every morning our Son wakes up soak and wet from him peeing through the diaper. As a matter of fact it is 11:30pm and he just woke up crying which he never does. We went back to check on him and his Jammies were soaked along with his bed. We will never purchase these diapers again! We have always used the Pampers Swaddlers and we will be spending the extra money and staying with those."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I purchased the Pampers Baby-Dry because it advertised that it would keep baby dry for up to 12 hours - it didn't keep her dry for even a 3 hour nap. For an entire week, every single time she would wake up wet - her clothes were wet, her bed was wet, we had to change the sheets twice a day and her clothes even more. It was a disaster. We went back to using Huggies, even though they were more expensive. The time and energy we took laundering and changing everything made the price for Huggies worth it and we haven't had a problem since we switched back to Huggies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pampers vs. Huggies","review":"And the winner is......... Huggies.Pampers overnights makes a promise it cannot keep - '12 hours of overnight protection'.Not long after I began using pampers overnight I noticed my son was waking up wet. The kicker - when he wetted himself and his dad after a mere 5.5 hours with no diaper change on a long road trip. (Oops). I even tried plastic underwear - but even that could not help. .I finally figured out if my LO had more than one bottle the diaper merely could not handle the output. Yikes. I thought I would take a chance and try huggies. It's been a week and so far no complaints. He has even woken up dry after having a second bottle in the middle of the night with no diaper change. (tsk tsk but as any mother can tell you, do not mess with a sleeping baby or you will live to regret it). I will keep you posted on any changes!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely happy with pampers baby dry","review":"Received from amazon within few days of ordering the product, though it was standard free super saving shipping.

I do not reccomend!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaks, doesn't absorb odors either. Go with Swaddlers!","review":"Going from Swaddlers to these was a HUGE mistake. The name \\"baby dry\\" should be a joke, because the diaper gets damp very fast, and ALWAYS smells like pee. It's not my baby either, I have to change out the diaper about twice more than normal and most of the diapers are barely heavy. Seems like such a waste... should've bought the smaller amount to test first. It's odd how the same brand could have one type vastly superior to the other. Again, go with Swaddlers, we had ZERO issues with them. \\"Baby dry\\" is a lie."},{"rating":"1","title":"It leaks","review":"We used Swaddlers size 1 and thought would changed to this for size 2 to see what's the difference. We found that this one leaks! It also has a little chemical smell and the size isn't as big as Swaddlers size 2. Pamper Swaddlers is much better in our opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pampers Baby Dry diapers don't hold nearly as much urine as Huggies","review":"Our daughter is 22 months and we just got a box of Size 5 baby Dry diapers. We can't use these at nighttime and we have to check her diaper frequently. If she drinks a lot of water, the urine leaks right out of the diaper.My wife had me order another box of Huggies Snug & Dry Size 5 immediately. We'll try to use these ones up, but when we run errands or go to church, we will use the Huggies.I do not recommend these diapers at all. It's not worth the $0.03 difference per diaper from Huggies.

When out with gramma, they leaked after 4 hours of wear. We normally use cruisers and they have provided us consistent coverage and have never failed.

These said that they were for overnight protection and would last 12 hours. When I opened the package I was surprised to see that these are thinner than Swaddlers and plastic feeling. I can handle that as long as I don't have to clean urine off of my daughter, her pajamas, and her bed every morning. She sleeps 12 or so hours some nights, but still wakes up for a feeding on most nights. When she woke up after 7 hours for a feeding, her clothes were soaked. Very disappointing.

She ever peed through the diaper on a 2 and a half hour flight. Not sure why they are called baby dry, but they sure don't keep her dry at all.

Terrible, terrible, terrible.Someone ought to track down and berate the bone-heads who thought this would be an OK design, right after they track down the bone-heads who sell unabsorbent baby towels (don't get me started on that).I would review further, but I have to go try to get poop stains out of our clothes, carpet and couch.

I bought the Pampers Baby Dry because they had a good deal going, so I thought I would give them a try. With \\"12 hours of overnight protection\\", what's not to like? The first night I used these, I found my son's entire frontside wet in the morning. Okay, so it's hard to find a really good overnight disposable. Maybe I should have bought one size up from his usual. I thought, \\"I'll just use them during the day...\\". Well, after just 1 nap and about 3 hours in the diaper, again soaked. What a waste!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome overnight diapers!","review":"To be honest, when I first read the box (when my son was a newborn), I thought to myself, why would I ever keep my baby in one diaper for 12 hours (ewwwwww!) but the second he began sleeping through the night, I figured it out (hah!).These diapers are great and we have never had a morning blow outs, despite our son sleeping 12+ hours a night and definitely releasing a lot of substance into the diaper during that time. Moreover, he tends to roll several times at night and gets up and plays actively in his crib for a while (before we realize he is up) and even so, with all the movement, bouncing and a full diaper, there haven't been any leaks.We've put him in other diapers overnight and he's blown through all of those."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Pricey!","review":"We purchased these for awhile because they were the only diapers that would stand up to the \\"blowouts\\" but let me tell you the Target brand diapers are the same quality for SOOOO much less $ If I had any advice for people getting Pampers or Huggies it would be try Target brand they are the best I promise you won't be disappointed.

I'm a huge fan of Pampers and have used them with both of my children; however, these were absolutely not worth the money! Every single time my son had a dirty diaper it leaked everywhere!!

These were hands down the best diapers we have tried during the first year. After our daughter outgrew the Swaddlers we tried Pampers Cruisers and were a little disappointed, however the Cruisers did their job of keeping everything where it was supposed to be. I saw the reviews for Baby Dry and thought \\"hey let's try these and see if they are better than Cruisers\\" BIG MISTAKE. We received the diapers yesterday and have already had multiple leaks and overflows. These diapers have almost no absorbency and need to be changed approximately every 2 hours for us. We made the mistake of using it overnight and the entire bed was soaking wet this morning.These diapers may work for some, however I can't believe that they would work for many considering how little they can hold.

Our son isn't overly wet, due to regular diaper changes, but these diapers couldn't even contain pee for a 2 hour span. In addition, when he wakes up his pajamas smell like he had an accident, due to the thinness of the Pampers. And yes, more often than not he was wet through to the pajamas, sheets, etc., and if he pooped overnight, he was rewarded with a sopping wet diaper, a wedgie, and poop leaking out.

I had tried Huggies and they weren't as great as I thought that they would be (being a new dad). The Huggies didn't fit correctly for my baby and would create problems for me. Tried to save on some Wal-Mart brand diapers and they just didn't cut it. I could tell right away that the Wal-Mart brand were \\"economic\\" for a reason, you get what you pay for. Last but not least, I tried a CVS brand I had bought prior to the baby being born thinking, hmmm, I will take advantage of this offer and show my wife what a great dad I will be. Well, I don't think the outcome affected what she thought of me as a dad too badly, but the CVS brand gave the baby a rash.

I was looking for something more absorbent, and having tried another type of Pampers in the past and was satisfied, decided to try these. He soaked through them every night for four nights. They were completely ineffective. On the plus side, they smelled nice and were softer than Huggies. I didn't want to waste the one that were left, so we used them during the day. A few days later, my son, who at 14 months had never had a diaper rash, got a terrible, painful rash. We stopped using the Pampers immediately, but it took over a week for the rash to clear up. So, having read other reviews telling a similar story, let me caution new users that it's a gamble. Will these diapers give my kid a rash? Maybe. Maybe not.

She was using Swaddlers until she got to size 4 and I bought these. They SUCK. The pamper seems harder and the strip on the inside isn't as long. And to top it all off, it gave more poor child a rash. Luckily I didn't get stuck with all these pampers because a friend of mine used these on her daughter and they were fine. I'll be switching to the sensitive brand since they come in swaddlers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Value!","review":"I love these diapers. They feel soft and rarely leak.

You can not beat the price on this site its pretty amazing. However, I have noticed that with each order it takes longer and longer for them to arrive. Its pretty annoying that they cant seem to get them here any faster and so dont wait to order them if you are going to need them within the next 2 weeks order them cause chances are they will take that long to get there. Pretty sad but with the price I guess they have to mess you up somewhere. I was disappointed because I went off the last time I ordered and the amount of time they took and this time it took 3 days longer. So I had to run to the store and pay full price :(All in all great product Pampers always are but be careful ordering from here when your in a rush!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hate it!!!","review":"At first, I thought it was just one or two diapers that have sand like in them but it's actually the whole box of diapers that have sand in EVERY DIAPER. But I willing to give it another try. Unfortunately, the 2rd and 3rd boxes were still the same (still have tons of sand like in every diaper). The changing table and crib were filled with tiny sand like everytime I changed my baby diaper. It's freaking me out cause my baby is super active and she's at the stage where she puts everything in her mouth. So, no more Pamper Baby Dry for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"These diapers are terrible, they leak and make my baby smell like urine.

Anyday!","review":"I was loyal to Pampers until Costco had a deal on Huggies and i decided to give Huggies a shot. I was not disappointed, but, the biggest difference between the two brands is that Pampers are MUCH SOFTER than Huggies. Pampers felt more like fabric while Huggies were very plasticy and felt like an itchy material. HOWEVER, huggies are much more absorbent and dont get as bulky as pampers.

My son is now 5 mo. old and we've been using Pampers Swaddlers Dry Max diapers since he was born (you know, with the blue wetness indicator on the front). However, these are NOT Pampers Swaddlers Dry Max. These are thinner, do not have the woven material inside the diaper and are not nearly as absorbent as the Swaddlers. My son has leaked out of his diaper the last 5 nights... these diapers simply are not absorbent enough to contain a night's worth of pee. We rarely had this problem with Dry Max.

We have not experienced any leaks with Pampers, as opposed to store brands or Luvs.Our daughter is highly prone to diaper rashes, and with the Pampers Dry Max, we've noticed that her rashes have decreased significantly when wearing these diapers. The diapers absorb so much liquid, and keeps it away from our daughter's skin! The one gripe we have with Pampers is the scent - their diapers are generally heavily perfumed. If your kid makes a big stink, this may not be a bad thing - we just didn't care to smell our daughter before we heard her enter a room (deposit or not!). Outside of that, these diapers are fantastic! Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible!","review":"We went from Swaddlers Sensitive to Baby Dry and were so disappointed after less than a week that we gave them away and went back to the Swaddlers.

Now he's never had a diaper rash, and all Ive ever used to keep him dry were the swaddler and baby powder but with these diapers I started using desitin just to keep the urine off his skin. They also couldnt hold in his poops. EVERY time he pooped (not exaggerating) it was a complete blow out, down his legs, up the back of his clothes. We NEVER had this problem with the Swaddlers. I also have to agree with the post about them being too thin, feeling recycled and rough against babys skin.

I changed my daughter tonight at 6:15 and it's 8:15 and she's soaked through to her clothes. And every single morning after sleeping a full 10 hours, she's got wet sheets and blankets.

Also when they fill, they sag so terribly. Our toddler quickly learned he could easily reach in when they were saggy and mess with his poop if he had any.

Pampers has consistently given us a diaper that we can count on not leaking. Store brands, Luvs, Huggies have all failed us multiple times, just leak really bad or tear easily.

I ordered three cases to take advantage of a promotion Amazon was running. But the diapers I received must be old stock, before Pampers put the \\"flex\\" stretchy sides on the Baby-Dry diapers. The older expiration dates on the Rewards code confirms this. Maybe they've gotten rid of the old stock; then those newer diapers would rate 4.5 stars.

They're shorter so you can't adjust the fit as easily, and the waist is always loose--with a boy that's a very bad idea because he tends to get his clothes wet through the TOP of the diaper instead of the sides now.

I can't stand that! I've never had a diaper perform like this one does. I WON'T be ordering this kind again, that's for sure!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment","review":"After reading the baby dry reviews, I bought a pack of 228--BIG MISTAKE! They feel ultra soggy after 2 hours (the other brands do not) and I can't even go without changing her after her early morning feeding. When we do change her, it seems like the diaper isn't wicking the moisture away properly as she seems a little damp (yes, even after just 2 hours). I'm dissatisfied that the box says 12 hour protection, when it really maxes out at about 4 hours. Even my husband asked me why I bought the crappy brand :( We absolutely love the swaddlers and swaddlers sensitive--they both make it through the night (anywhere from 8-12 hours) for my 3 month old daughter. I'm a little disappointed in Pampers right now because we have loved all their other products, but now I feel like I'm stuck with 200+ diapers that I paid for and probably won't use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best diapers, best Price","review":"Pampers are the best diapers we have tried, and this is the best price online or in-town ;) thanks for the free shipping with amazon moms / prime/ subscribe & save ;)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth it on amazon - Happy and Dry, Never had an issue","review":"My son has worn these since moving out of the infant diapers and we see no need to change.

When Cruisers was unavailable online, I thought, the Baby Dry can't be that much different, they both are made by Pampers, right? WRONG!! I have been washing wet bed sheets and pjs every single morning for 2 weeks since my toddler used the Baby Dry. It can not hold anything. I had my son pee in a clean Baby Dry standing straight, waited for a minute, then took the diaper off. The pee was dripping out from the diaper. It was the worst diaper we have ever tried. I heard that Pampers changed the Cruisers to be thinner as well. I am giving Huggies a try now.

My son had been wearing Huggies size 3, but I thought these might be worth a try. My husband and I now have a joke that our son has been crawling in the cobwebs again. These diapers fall apart and the fibers look like little spiderwebs hanging off his little bum. Sometimes we find our son plucking the \\"webs\\" off his diaper like someone plucking a chicken. I would not recommend these diapers, especially for active babies."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really want to like it","review":"I really want to like it. It is certainly better than the Huggies I bought before but the quality is no where close to the pamper's cruiser we have been using. It is good if you knew you will change diaper frequently as it will hold just one pee then start to sag. I haven't run into any leaking issue yet as I now use it only when I knew my baby will not stay with it for long. We use it as temporary diaper that is why I still give it a two star rating. It is cheaper for more diapers, you get what you paid for."},{"rating":"1","title":"No leaks but stinky and saggy...","review":"I used this diaper for my 2 year old and once she urinated in it once it would sag half way down her leg.

They have a low threshold as far as how much liquid it can hold before they start to leak. My daughter wakes up completely wet whenever she is wearing Pampers, but not when she's wearing another brand. In addition, the tape on these diapers is not great, so the diaper often comes undone by itself, which can create quite a mess at an inopportune time."},{"rating":"2","title":"good but swaddlers better","review":"From our personal experience we really prefer to use the pampers brand over others, if your struggling for money and stuff buy the biggest bulk box of baby drys from here because they're the cheapest per diaper I've found.

I've tried many different kinds of diapers on my son. Pamper's Baby Dry are the worst I've used. They don't hold much at all! I've been lucky and my little man sleeps through the night, but these diapers can't stand up to that (even when he was only 2 months old)! Every night they leaked. I couldn't stand it. I had to buy a different kind of diaper to use at night time until that package of baby dry was gone. My favorite diapers have to be either Pamper's Swaddlers, or Huggies Supreme Natural Fit. The only thing is, the Huggies seem to run a little bit smaller than the Pampers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great diapees for my little one!","review":"My daughter is currently 4 months old and I am definitely a Pampers fan. She started off with the Swaddlers, but I have moved over to Baby dry on occassion... depends on what is on sale at the time. I really like the BDs, and I actually think they absorb wetness much better than Swaddlers. The only thing I don't like is that the aqua color shows through her white onesies. Swaddlers are much more subtle if she's wearing tights and a dress.I haven't had one tear yet, FWIW.Also, there are two different kinds of BDs. There are Caterpillar - Flex (or whatever it's called), which is what I currently see for sale at Amazon.com, but there is also a non-flex version.

They cost more than other diapers, but oh well I was hooked.I got the grand idea in my head that \\"Oh, baby dry? they must work even BETTER than swaddlers, DRY is right in the name!\\"Wrong. In a swaddler my kid could pee 2-3x and no leakage. In the baby dry, I don't know what it is about them, if she got to peeing a second time? Good lord get that thing off of her quick or she's going to leak or please no zues, oprah, or a tiny baby jesus, don't let her poop because it IS coming out the back even if I have her in a size too big without the back rolled down.I ened up using these as Daycare diapers, because there she got changed ever hour (No worries, I usually check her ever 2 hours max or at the first whiff of poop at home but that wasn't enough for baby dry)Not ever getting those things again and if they're gifted I am regifting."},{"rating":"2","title":"These have never leaked","review":"We have 2 year old twin boys and sometimes it's just hard to grab them to change them. We have not had any problems with leakage, even overnight! Our boys sleep 12 hours and these diapers last!

Pampers are very thin, meaning you can get more of them in the diaper bag, and it's easier for baby to move in them. They fit well, especially around the outside of the thigh, where leakage is most likely to occur. The absorbancy is far superior to off-brand diapers -- they don't balloon up and leak until they are VERY full. With the Amazon mail option, they are much cheaper than I can get in my local stores, even with coupons, and home delivery is wonderfully convenient."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Diapers!","review":"I got these diapers for my son, he has used them before and did great with them.

We primarily use cloth diapers and our cloth diapers work well for nighttime (11 hours) but sometimes I just hate waking up to that ammonia stink. I decided to try some different kinds of disposables to see if I could find a brand that would work all night without a change. We tried Seventh Generation and Nurtured by Nature, and they work off and on. I thought I would finally give some Pampers a try and see if the package was right. It says these are good for 12 hours. Not for us! They leak worse than the chlorine-free disposables and stink like powder. My son's closet (where these are stored) now has a stinky powdery smell. Some people might like this smell, but to me it smells bad. I decided to use them up by using them during the day and they gave my son a horrible rash.Never.

The smell was terrable and my Dad had to get the hose and not only beat my uncle he also had to hose down our poor cat. I called up the manufactor trying to get them to pay for the damages. They refused!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"diapers on a budget","review":"I like to purchase Pampers Diapers from Amazon. I get a much better deal for the amount. The diapers work well for our son.

All pamper has going for them is their name!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!!","review":"I love Pampers diapers, and this is the cheapest place to buy them by far!! I used to shop at sams and when i switched to amazon moms i saved $20 a month, not much but a lot with a toddler. We tried every brand out there and every one of them leaked exept for Pampers. And with this price, why buy off brand?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Never Again","review":"I decided to try these diapers instead of the swaddlers to save a few dollars. Needless to say that was a mistake. They claim to keep baby dry for up to 12 hours. My little one can't use these to sleep through the night (6 hours). I don't recommend these at all. Spend a few extra dollars on the swaddlers, you'll make your money back on the $ saved on extra laundry they cause because they leak."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaky diaper...cheap - use Cruisers instead!","review":"I decided to buy this over the cruisers since i'd save a few dollars and get a few extra diapers at the same time.

No more leaky diapers."},{"rating":"1","title":"good price, bad quality","review":"I buy these diapers through subscribe and save, so they come out at reasonable price.

I've been using these diapers for three days and they have been nothing but stress to me. These diapers truly leak even if they are not full. The material that they are made of tear very easily if I even carry my 22 month old daughter the wrong way. I was completely dissatified when I used them when she was a size 3, and I'm upset that I allowed myself to buy these again. They were only a few cents cheaper than the Huggies Snug and Dry which don't leak at all. I used to have great respect for Pampers but I refuse to waste my time with the company to call and complain. I am embarassed to give these to someone, and will end up just donating them."},{"rating":"2","title":"This vs. Huggies Snug & Dry","review":"I liked that these were a lot softer than the Huggies Snug & Dry. The Huggies feel stiff and too much like paper.Absorbency wise, I tried both of these overnight and the Huggies had better absorbency.Overall, I like these diapers. They are soft and absorbency is pretty good. I'll keep using these since Amazon has a great offer. Can't beat this price."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's okay.","review":"It's okay. It's the convenience of having the diapers delivered to home, and at a reasonable price. The diapers are okay, though a tad smaller than other equivalent size 3 diapers.

The diapers I've been ordering monthly (Subscribe and Save) for a long time came and when I opened the plastic packing, they appeared to have been pre-wet. They had that crunchy, beady texture that diapers get when they are exposed to water. Of course, the whole reason I have them on order monthly is because I need them regularly and these came just in time-- I had run out of diapers. I have 3 kids, 3 and under and I can't easily get to the store to get more diapers so I had to use these gross diapers on my daughters AND now I have to return them to get a refund?? Something is broken with this system."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst diapers EVER!!!!!!!!","review":"These diapers literally FALL APART at night.

It is very thin, flimsy, feels really cheap, but it is sufficient to hold a medium-size mess during the day. However, it leaked all over every single night no matter what we tried. I would actually test different diapers every night, and this one would always have the most leaks all over. Cruisers did a bit better, Huggies did as well (actually as bad) as Cruisers...but, still there were leaks every night! If you are used to Swaddlers, be ready for a huge disappointment! This diaper cannot be used overnight. Our boy is 13 months and 24 lbs,and is long. Even tried a size bigger as it was suggested. Had to go back to Swaddlers...size 4 (sensitive-the only type of Swaddlers in 4) and no more leaks! There are never any leaks with Swaddlers!!!

Half way through the bag, we noticed that the sticky tabs weren't sticky. The diapers weren't staying on.

We are going to switch back to the swaddlers and hope that solves the issue. They may cost a little more, but hoping they keep our daughter dry.

My son is almost 20lbs and these days he likes to roll around a lot. These diapers have poor absorbancy and they are constantly leaking. I am very careful whenever I put diapers on. The Velcro must meet each other in the front and I make sure everything fits securing around the back, legs and hip. These diapers will do it's job during the day time. But during the night time (when my son sleeps on his tummy off and on), they will leak. Every morning when I go change these, the pee is up to this chest. I have to change his clothes every single morning. Extremely frustrating.Prior to using these, I was using the Kirkland (Costco) size 3 ones which was actually doing a fantastic job. Me being curious and always trying to find something a little better, decided to try Pampers Dry. Can't wait until the package is done, then I will for sure go back to Kirkland."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for my Baby","review":"I've been using Pampers Baby dry ever since my baby was 2 months old.

Even when she sleeps through the entire night and wakes up soaked, they hold an enormous amount of liquid!I tried the cruisers once, now that my daughter can run around, but I like the baby dry still. I find that the stretchy waistbands allow the diaper to fall down when she's active, but maybe that's not the case with everybody. Since these are looser around the stomach they also seem more comfortable, and my daughter doesn't rip them off immediately like some of the other stretchy brands."},{"rating":"1","title":"new combo size 1-2 is the worst idea papers has come up with","review":"these diapers are basicly the same as a size 1 but the problem is that you can't get something comapable to a size 2 , I ordered size 3 after these no longer fit and the things are huge and constantly leak .hope pampers sees this and goes back to old sizing because pampers are the best for leaks etc but this stupid 1-2 combo is insane !!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Really good diapers!!!","review":"I've used pampers with both my boys and they're wonderful, no leaks, last thru the night and they love the disigns."},{"rating":"2","title":"works... that's what matters here","review":"Pampers are our sole brand in this house.

These are not as absorbant as the pampers swaddlers, and since it's a diaper, that's pretty much its main task. I didn't experience any liquid leakage, but solids were problematic. Any more detailed description will probably prevent this review from being published...2. These diapers do not have the wetness indicator lines that are found on the swaddlers. I didn't realize that those lines were so useful until I subscribed to these (used to get them at Target).Anyway, these two reasons are sufficient for me to cancel my subscription after two shipments.This review is by no means related to Amazon's subscription and shipping service.

However, now that my daughter is in size three, we found that we needed night-time diapers for her to wear to bed. She leaked through these quite a few times. Once we got the bedtime diapers, I loved these diapers for daytime. They're not too bulky and wear really well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality - new design?","review":"I am a long-time Pampers buyer and have never had a complaint before, but my latest batch of baby dry must be either defective or a new design. The tabs tear off of the diaper with the tiniest amount of force. Which means as I'm diapering my wiggly baby, I sometimes go through three diapers before I get one on that stays intact. Very frustrating for such an expensive product.

I bought them, hoping that they would keep my daughter nice and dry all night long when she sleeps for 12 hours. When she woke up in the morning, her sleeper was wet and her skin was very wet as well, inside the diaper. The diaper did not keep her dry like it claimed it would. Her Pampers Sensitive Swaddlers kept her way drier then this diaper! When she wears those all night, they soak up everything and her skin is still pretty dry the next morning. I will never use Baby Dry again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible diaper","review":"I got these diapers because I had a coupon. Big mistake. It felt like it took forever for me to get through this one pack of diapers. I almost threw them out completely. They have hardly ANY tabs on the size so they are too tight on my little one.

Except, that I prefer Safeway brand diapers because they hold overnight and are slightly bigger than Pampers. But, the price is comparable to Amazon.com. Delivery, on the other hand was horrible! Box was totally ripped, torn and almost all the diapers were exposed. Deivery by UPS and I took a pic. Very disappointed Amazon didn't put box into another to protect the cheap box the diapers are orginiall packaged in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Constant Rash","review":"Great price for this product, but it caused both of my kids to have rashes.

These also don't have elastic in the back waistband of the diaper...another really nice feature in other brands."},{"rating":"1","title":"Every poo is a blow-out","review":"I began using these diapers for my newborn, but was sorely disappointed to find that the diaper offered little protection for anyone holding my baby when she had a poo. Perhaps she is oddly shaped causing the diaper to fit poorly; however, she seems perfectly normal to me, so I am guessing it is the fault of the diaper. Every poo was a blow-out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just don't like it...","review":"When DD was first born I used Pampers Sensitive and I absolutely loved it. I've tried Costco brand, Pampers, and Huggies. I thought I would go back to Pampers since I had such a good experience with it. This Baby Dry line just doens't work for us. The diaper feels overly moist after she goes number 1, and it doesn't actually seep through, perse, but it feels a little moist and it's not a very pleasant feeling. But one pro is that it's thin so it's very portable. Other than that it was a big BUMMER for us :("},{"rating":"2","title":"Just as good as any diaper","review":"After 5 kids, we used all kinds of diapers.

I hope that this doesn't happen to anyone else and that whatever has changed is fixed quickly. For now I will switch to Seventh Generation.Last week I received my box on my doorstep and due to the new frustration free packaging, couldn't open the box with my hands anymore due to all the tape on top of the box.

The Baby Dry ones are horrible! They are rough and hard and do not stretch AT ALL, not to mention my son poops up the back of them about every other day. So if you are debating between these and swaddlers/sentive pampers go with one of those they are so much more absorbent and softer!"},{"rating":"1","title":"CHEAP! DO NOT BUY!!","review":"I bought this product because it was less expensive than the Pampers Cruisers and I thought it might a comparable product. WRONG!! Simply picking up the product, you can tell it isn't made as well and has a more plastic feel to it. I only gave it 1 star because I couldn't give it a \\"0\\". By the next day, my son had a diaper rash like none I have ever seen. My husband and I have practically had to hog-tie him to put ointment on his bottom or even bathe him. He even cried when he was sitting. We switched back to Cruisers and he is healing, thankfully, but still has marks two weeks later. We will NEVER buy this product again. Do not walk, RUN from this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wet every morning","review":"We used Pampers swadlers and loved them. When we switched to size 4 we decided on Pampers Baby Dry.

I'm so glad I didn't buy them. I received them as a shower gift. They have a plastic duct tape feel to the top portion and they left my son's skin very moist.

I stick to Pampers Swaddlers or Pampers Cruisers, depending on which size you are using."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bothered Baby Skin","review":"I usually love Pampers, but the Baby Dry Pampers really irritated my little boy's skin.

I have always used Pampers diapers, and think they are far superior to other brands. Until, that is, I tried these Baby Dry diapers! They leaked like crazy! Not onece or twice, but every time I used them! If I didn't change the baby IMMEDIATELY after them getting wet, it would soak straight through the diaper and wet her clothes!

These pampers have done a fine job for our little one and I have no complaints. We have used cloth, but with the recently larger and more frequent poopin going on the last few months, with the addition of more baby food, these diapers make things easier for me. The other benefit, of course, is they soak up more of the liquid stuff as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great diapers","review":"I am a new mom and have mostly been using Pampers Sensitive diapers and some Huggies.

Since I read they don't have Drymax, I thought it would be okay to use. Within the first day of use, my child started getting a reddish rash. It went away as soon as we stopped using these. My feeling is that it is due to the blue colored absorbent material and/or the scent. I did not realize the diapers had a scent, since I was used to the EB diapers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best for us","review":"These Pampers have been the winners for our son - no leaks, super absorbent, easy to put on.The equivalent Huggies were a disaster - no matter how tight we put the Huggies on him, he managed to wriggle around and get some pee out of one gap or another. So he needed a new onesie for every diaper change....In cloth diapers, we have to change him as soon as he pees or poops, because the cloth diapers are not as absorbent. He's not used to the wet feeling, and he does NOT like it! So we use one cloth diaper a day, just to give him a break / change of pace.If not for these Pampers, our lives would be a lot less pleasant right now."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT last the night","review":"I bought these based on the reviews and the price.

Pampers beats all of them hands-down. Well worth the miniscule higher price. With other brands, I experienced significantly more leaks/blowouts up the back. Also, they leaked pee around the waistband area. I've never had the leak problem with Pampers. Pampers aren't perfect, but I have far fewer out-and-up-the-back leaks with them and they feel and look like nice, high-quality diapers. The ONLY thing I don't like about them is the ill-placed color pattern at the inner thighs and upper back areas, as it appears at a quick glance that poo is seeping out when it's not!

Size is pretty accurate as well.My problem with these diapers is the green color on the inside (that touches baby's skin), with strong chemically smell.

When I saw the lower price on the Baby Dry, I was thrilled to pieces and thought it would be a great buy. These are the worst diapers we have ever put on our child. I have to change him much more frequently, I have seen more \\"soak through\\" episodes (the best was on my lap, in the middle of church), and he is clearly uncomfortable, pulling the diaper away from his skin.

He doesn't even wear them that long before he has stringy diaper hanging off. I tried to chalk the first box off as maybe its a defective box or that he is so active. But after 3 boxes I know longer believe it. It doesn't leak, but just seems to fall apart (hard to describe) no matter if he's worn them for 5 min or longer. I can't wait until he is fully potty trained so he won't need them anymore.

It works great for my now 6 month old. He started out with swaddlers when he was a newborn. I switched to baby-dry when he turned 3 month. This diaper barely leaks. Only time it leaked was when he slept too long and I forgot to change him when he got fed once. It was over 12hrs, so I'm sure no other diaper could do any better.Some might not agree this is not the cheapest, but when I was searching for new diaper, this Economy pack for subscription price was the cheapest (per diaper price). I even compared with other brands and from stores like Sam's club. It is really convenient to use subscription service for diaper.

Even if I literally run to change her as soon as I hear her poop, it still regularly squeezes up and out all over her back and clothes. Most days she messes her clothes at least once. I'm going to try something else because this is just ridiculous (and gross!)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Diapers For Our Kids","review":"I realize that not every child is the same. Some may have allergic reactions to some brands or some brands may hold in leaks better. I have three children aging from 2 months to 4 years and they all use Pampers. We have tried other store brands and name brands, but they either leaked, caused a rash or just fell apart after use and wouldn't stay on. Pampers seems to stay on well, even on my active children who jump and roll off of everything and run all over. My four year old only wears diapers at night (as does my 2 year old recently) and they hold whatever both of them can throw at 'em, and some mornings, its completely full. But no leaks!

I tried these diapers because of the positive ratings and I am VERY disappointed. The diapers are rectangular and not good for a cruising baby. The front of the tabs turn under so they sometimes leak out the side. Also, they say they are suppose to last 12 hours. My daughter usually sleeps 10 hours straight at night and by morning the diaper has \\"sweated\\" pee through the diaper and through her pajamas and I've even had to change her sheets. I go through a lot more diapers with these because i have to change her very frequently. For some reason the Pampers Cruisers with dry max gave my daughter diaper rash so I guess I'm buying Huggies next time."},{"rating":"2","title":"We love baby dry!","review":"We are strictly a Pampers family. We used swaddlers until my son grew out of size 2-3s then we went directly to cruisers. We had a few leakage issues with cruisers, when my son would roll to his belly in the middle of the night, but were happy with them in general. A few friends of ours had been using baby dry's and metioned that they loved them (and that they were a little cheaper than cruisers!) so we decided to give them a try. And we LOVE them. We have not had one overnight leak! The only complaint that I have is that the tabs are made a little cheaper than swaddlers & cruisers, and a few of them have ripped right off as I'm fastening the diaper. I've just learned to be a little gentler with them, and we haven't had a problem since.

The especially good thing about this Giant Pack is that it comes with more diapers than the non-Giant Pack. That means you run out of diapers less often, and that's a good thing.

When I got back home and my box of Pampers was waiting for me, I noticed the difference the first time I changed by baby. Was so happy to go back to the best brand. I have four kids under six, and have always had at least a couple kids in diapers at a time (even three at a time once!) and have been using Pampers Baby Dry for each one. Pampers have that yummy baby-fresh scent. Also the other brand that I was using (A store brand that people love and I don't know why) would immediately droop down the instant my baby made once. It made it look like her diaper was ALWAYS loaded instead of just a little wet. The Pampers are much more stable."},{"rating":"1","title":"HATED these pampers! Don't buy","review":"I purchased these Pampers from Amazon for my 7 month old. These pampers have the ability to burst open in the night while your baby is sleeping. When my daughter woke up the next morning, the pamper burst open on her belly. The padding inside the pamper was released on her belly on several other occasions. I didn't have this problem with Huggies. I will NOT purchase Pampers ever again. This is a hazard and they should be recalled."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's great!","review":"Pampers baby dry is great! My husband and I absolutely love it. It's very absorbant.

Nothing has changed, but the list price was ~$43 and increased to $51 within two months! This is a overwhelming increase. I don't know what is going on, but you can see the price comparison between other vendors that the Amazon price is significantly higher than Target or Babies R Us.

I thought they also had dry max since they said baby dry. I am now having at least one leaky diaper every morning and have had 3 diapers I had to throw away because the tabs tore. This has never happened. My twins are one and in size 3 diapers. I have tried the cruisers which seem to be ok. I'm not sure if it is just the lot I have or this line of diapers.

Maybe it's just too intellectual for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Leaves of Grass","review":"Having read only tid bits, here and there, from Leaves of Grass, I found that it was full of truly unique American poetry. Whitman definitely achieved his goal of becoming a truly innovative poet. The fact that he rarely uses any type of meter, rhyme scheme, or exaggerated rhetorical devices almost says that he has mastered the basic fundamentals of poetry and surpassed his peers. He is so far above the simple and frequently used methods that he must create his own fresh and new style of writing. I found Leaves of Grass to be a lot to grapple with as a high school student, especially his philosophy pertaining to Deism, and yet, it was most intriguing and made me want to simply delve deeper into it. I look forward to completing Leaves of Grass and recommend it to anyone looking for truly original forms of American poetry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the 1855","review":"At least as available for the Kindle, this is not the 1855 edition.

Ms. Gibson's soprano sing-song doesn't make it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fallen Leaves","review":"Although he may be as genius as he is, Walt Whitman is just random. His structure and development are atrocious, leaving us in a cloud of confusion. His lists, names, and metaphors can only be described as random thought. And don't even get me started on his comma use. That's how my little sister writes for crying out loud! I mean, don't you remember? You'd get lucky if you found an \\"and\\" in there somewhere. Granted, he did revolutionize poetry and writing as we know it. However, certain selections for his ever famous Song of Myself show that he can sure describe those bodily actions that he seems to love so much. I can cut him some slack, probably because he's a romantic writer, but his random stringing of words, phrases, and lists do his poetry injustice. Poor Jonathon Edwards would be turning in his grave..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whitman Glorified?","review":"Whitman Glorified?Whitman's descriptions of nature are inspired and his style exudes with the same passion as his subject. Yet, his self-absorption overshadows his talent. Whitman's poem, \\"Song of Myself\\" takes up a significant portion of the book, Leaves of Grass. Here, Whitman keeps no points in reserve, but spends 52 sections \\"celebrating\\" himself. He feels he, as man, is the great panacea. He suckles at its mercy until it fills not only his subject matter, but influences his technique and his structure as well. His intriguing mind leads the reader along, until disappointment is found in another laborious passage expounding god status and the call to ascend to his level of distorted thinking. Whitman's momentary descriptive nuggets are lost in a sea of narcissism."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"How come everyone constantly praises Shakespeare, Keats, Whitman, etc.?

Walt Whitman's \\"Leaves of Grass\\" is an old favorite of mine, so I looked for Kindle editions. There were 31 matches to my search, though not all of them are the actual book of poems. My complaints about this offering start with the absence of a table of contents. Whitman didn't title the poems in the original 1855 edition, though he did in subsequent editions, but a table of contents could show the first line of each poem. Beyond the lack of TOC, the edition is not identified nor is the \\"publisher,\\" which makes it difficult, though not impossible, to associate a rating with a specific offering."},{"rating":"2","title":"a classic of American poetry","review":"No doubt influenced by the free verse of ancient Greek poetry, Walt Whitman wrote about 19th c. America in the same way that the ancient Greek and Roman poets wrote about their own time and world.

The typesetting is not ideal.

Yes, as another reviewer mentioned, all the major players are here- for about 15 seconds each. Most of the winning performances are truncated to the last few seconds. There are few reaction shots. There are no interviews with athletes or experts. There isn't any of the special coverage shown during the games.

If you know what day the event you are looking for took place, that would help. But there's still no guarantee that it would be included.It seems that this DVD is meant for casual viewing.

If that description and the subsequent Emmies aren't enough to whet your appetite, I'd say this is just that much more scary in the post-9/11 era. Not a well known TV movie, but it seems even less like fiction now with its urban nuclear terrorist threat and non-stop news coverage of the events.

This movie rates as one of my all time favorite kung fu movies, and I own about 100 or so.The print isn't very good. The subtitles are hard to read. The story is among the most complicated and convoluted, especially for the non Cantonese speaking. But who watches a kung fu movie for plots?What I really enjoyed about the movie is that it actually shows what the Chinese cinema could actually do. It has tremendous battle scenes. Despite the poor print quality, the movie has some fantastic visuals.The movie is not a documentary. The movie is not an \\"imagined documentary.\\" A lot of things seem to come out of left field.

Many various legends of certain types of \\"secret\\" Kung Fu have existed for centuries in China and the chinese audinces are not so confused by the plot line.If you suspend you dis-belief this is a fantastic, fuuny, deadly serious, bloody tale of sweat revenge; betrayal and ultimate victory for the underdog. I can't find a better movie that works on all these levels.The english sub-titles are washed out by the background in some frames but can be gleaned if the movie is watched enough which you are sure to do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only if you like flying people","review":"I gave 1 star for Jet li, cause he is my favorite, but a guy in a boulder shooting him with lightning? Come'on, this movie is bad, Jet li is the man and Chingmy Yau is hot!, but this movie was just bad, too much flying. i dont know what these people are thinking giving it 5 stars, NO WAY not even close, see fist of legend thats 5 stars!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor","review":"I'm a HUGE Jet Li fan. I love great kung fu movies. This is not one. There is NO kung fu at all. The rest is a surreal dream that includes a guy chained to a boulder and a guy that gets stabbed and asks why he was assassinated. It may be worth a laugh, but that's a stretch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantasy/Martial Arts Extravaganza","review":"This movie was made to be a fantasy/martial arts movie, and it delivers as promised. I have a very extensive collection of Martial Arts movies and I can honestly say that this movie is one of my top 15 favorite movies. I gave it a 4 instead of a five because it does go a little overboard with the fantasy element, but not enough to distract you from the fighting, and believe me, there's a lot of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"confusing, but entertaining","review":"This movie is hard to follow. But, the action is terrific. I think it should have been longer to explain some of the story. I recommend this film for its incredible action and quick pace. This movie has it all except a cohesive storyline. But, that probably adds to the charm of the film. Other plotless films turn out boring, but this one is throughly entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine Fantasy 'Fu","review":"This film is a real giggle. When I watch it, I feel as though I am witnessing some extravagent daydream by an imaginative pre-teen. The effects are really over-the-top, & the things I found most humorous about it were probably not intended as such. Nevertheless, I have watched it several times and I find it very appealing on some level. Jet Li is really sort of wasted in this flick, because so much of it is \\"magic\\" & \\"super secret final techniques\\" that his real martial arts ability is not truly showcased. One feels that anyone else could have played the part... kind of like finding the special gismo that turns ordinary kids into Power Rangers. Still, it is worth having this film in your collection, especially if your funny bone is tickled by the weird and offbeat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lord of the Wu Tang","review":"This movie is the best Jet Li martial arts flick I have ever seen. The story starts out with action and leaves you wanting more. The little bit of disappointments were that its subtitled and some parts are unreadable & that the ending left me hanging. From beginning to end it was great. I even tried getting the DvD version but it got put on back order and then never came. If you like this movie you might also want to try The New Legend of Shaolin."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you liked the Matrix...","review":"I stumbled over this movie on a movie channel in a hotel in Bali, at about 3 o'clock in the morning, and I watched the whole thing.Crazy kung-fu story, over the top acting and more Matrix-like action sequences than you can shake a big stick at. The plot may be hard to follow, but if you want plot, watch Meryl Streep. This movie is about kicking ass, and believe me, everyones ass gets kicked. Different fighting styles satisfy the amateur kung-fu-ist, and the over the top wire movements make this seem more like a live action manga.If only the ladies in this film had agreed to nudity, it would get five stars. Oh, well....Seriously, one of the best in the genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Money","review":"Like others I took a chance on this hoping for a different angle on a first person sim, or management fight game, and should really not have bothered. The gameplay is pretty straightforward, but even with a 256MB video card, the graphics are pretty bland, and the gameplay slow. It's also another game where there are too few levels of play to actually be able to achieve all the game has to offer. For example, there is a good interactive section of equipment, fighting slaves, upgrades and impressive array of weapons, but financial constraints and sheer playing time invloved make them almost inaccessible. Another main complaint would be (for me at least) an easy boredom threshold - this game could have, and should have been much better, despite the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, but not much is new","review":"Everyone else tells the details, but this really said nothing new and has little that is new. The untold plot had already been told in the movies and this only reenforces it. I personally disappointed with episode 22 with the fact that the music which really made the secene so memorable was dimmed down alot. I'm not saying this dvd is bad, I'm just saying I would think about it a little bit more on how you spend your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Welp, time to give away my Director's Cut fansub.","review":"In one word: awesome. I've seen these cuts before (btw, episode 24's WILL blow you guys away, lol) and on DVD, they're even better. ADV has finally completed the Eva series with this and I'll be darned if it ain't their best seller in DVDs. Episode 21 don't have much. Episode 22 is the best Asuka ep. The part where there's hooded figures around her are pure horror & creepiness. Episode 23 rules all, because of the foreshadowing of the End of Evangelion. It also tells who created Rei. All in all, even if you got the original release of Collection 0:7 & 0:8, these new releases are well worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"best modern reggae album","review":"This NYC group has authentic early reggae/rocksteady sound.

He originated the Myth of the Ungrund, but Boehme placed the entire myth under God's control. His work on the Ungrund led to Berdyaev's existential view of God and was foundational for the meonic nothingness found in Berdyaev. \`The Way to Christ' might be hard for modern readers to connect with, but if readers take the time to soak in the word, it can add to a person's spiritual journey. The language will not always be obvious or understandable, but Boehm wrote in a context that was very different from 21st century Westerners."},{"rating":"2","title":"Game Changing","review":"Besides the Introduction, I have only completely read the chapter on the Sand Creek Massacre so far, but it should be noted that the account is extraordinarily sympathetic to the acts of Chivington, his men, and the other officers, and offers a convincing rationale for the attack. It should be read by anyone familiar with the usual condemnations of the government's and individuals' actions for an eye-opening alternative point of view. It appears that the other nineteen chapters, each describing a different battle, are much more sympathetic to the Indians. All have the added fascination of being written by an author who lived at the time or within a generation of those events, and read like newspaper accounts and editorials. Recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgusting and poorly written","review":"Trick or Treat sounded like a great book from the blurb on the cover, What I found was vile and disgusting. I kept reading thinking it must get better. But no. It never got better. What I found was that the ending proved how really poorly written this book is--the author had multiple threads going. At the end, she dealt with none of them and ended on an improbability that only left more improbabilities. This is the only book I've ever consigned straight to the trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"battery replacement, wtf?","review":"For those of you that haven't bought Polar, be forewarned that in order to replace the batteries, in either the watch or band, you will have to ship the device back to Polar.You cannot replace it yourself. You cannot go to a watch shop and have it replaced. You MUST send it to Polar.This process will cost you around $50 and you will have to go without your watch for several weeks.Since you can buy a Timex with similar functionality for around $60 and replace the battery yourself, or go to any local watch repair store, I highly suggest you go with something less stupidly designed."},{"rating":"2","title":"I never learn how to sew these videos help","review":"These videos are fabulous my daughters and I learned how to sew using only these videos.

Most of them are much, much better. This book suffers from an overload of the author's rambling commentary on society. After the introduction to jealous husband, you have to slug through 100 pages before you begin to get into typical Travis McGee action. The action is often illogical, and too often Travis - err - Gavin stumbles into old friends at the most unlikely places, bailing him out of trouble. Sorry, this one just didn't click for me. In many ways, it reminded me of the Pale Gray for Guilt story, but there was much less action in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Middle of the pack, lesser Travis, but good enuf","review":"So the consensus is thumbs down.But, even though this isn't MacDonald's best, and even though there are indeed strong--I would say uncharacteristic--elements of misogynism in some of what Travis does to a particular woman for detective purposes, and even though the antagonist is so psychotically evil as to be unlikely to have survived past his teen years (much less prospered as a super-rich international corporate executive), and even though some of the McGee cultural observations seem pedestrian and heavy handed, it's still John D. MacDonald and Travis McGee.As one of the reviewers remarks, it may not be one of MacDonald's best--perhaps his teenage kids were acting up or protesting the war in Vietnam and his wife was verbally abusing him in that timeframe (1971)--but it is certainly memorable....For my complete review of this book and for other book and moviereviews, please visit my site [...]Brian WrightCopyright 2009"},{"rating":"2","title":"Book review - A TAN AND SANDY SILENCE by John D.

Any McGee will do if I'm bored, and there's nothing else around to read. This puppy didn't really grab me until about page 66; even then, I could pull free anytime I wanted.

It really is \\"ironic\\" fun, as someone mentioned, and only for those who are tolerant enough to handle a bit of fluff and not have a coronary about it. I thought it was pretty amusing. It helps if you're into sailing and sunny ports. Be that as it may, I am surprised that no one has commented on the \\"theme\\" song. It features quite prominently in the beginning, introducing us to the two English lasses whiling away their evenings singing badly in a sleazy Gibraltar sailor dive; and towards the end of the film, it introduces the final twist... with a vengeance. As it turned out to my delight, \\"You're leaving me\\" -- the title of aforementioned ditty -- was an almost direct translation of a song called \\"Porque te vas\\" by Jose Luis Perales, one of my favorite Spanish singer-songwriters. Great song, really! Silly performance, though. I'm almost a bit curious what JLP got out of it..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass the Dramamine.","review":"Watching this, you just KNOW that important bits were edited out to protect the current reputation of Ms. Hurley. The ending just comes out of left field - adding to the impression that something was taken out. There are hints of a more than sisterly relationship between the two female leads but not enough to shore up the finale.

I had to sheepishly explain to my wife why we had just wasted two hours of our valuable time. I had read some reviews that indicated that this movie was actually worth watching.Nothing could be farther from the truth! This movie was dry and boring the entire way through. And the suprise twist? An alien encounter would have made more sense.And the ending... If a story has to finish with a paragraph explaining or expounding the ending, then there is definitely something wrong. Unless a story is a true story or added for humor, beware of movies that end with a paragraph on the screen. It means that even the writer didn't like the screenplay.The only redeeming factor in this movie is that you get to see Elizabeth Hurley's chest, albeit from the side only.Anybody want to buy a slightly used copy?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cuba Lives!","review":"This Cd is a great chance to know the Afro-Cuban Music in your best executations.

The game is virutally unplayable out of the box and requires you to download at least three (thus far) giant patches that still don't fix everything.

Bob Bremner was indeed a gentleman, and he treated other scholars with an irenic spirit even when he disagreed with them.

Although, in the beginning, I did not particularly like Hewitt's interpretation of Audrey, after I watched it a few more times, her performance grew on me. I now find myself watching the tape weekend after weekend, hanging on her every word, waiting to see what happens next.(even though I have it memorized.) The story is amazing with all the different love struggles that she goes through. My favorite moments are all her proposals and break ups. I think that anyone who likes a good Romantic flick would love this movie. It is definately worth the watching."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT!","review":"I loved this movie!

Definately!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Can this BE any more wrong?","review":"As a huge Audrey fan I was disgusted to see that Jennifer Love Hewit was cast to play Audrey in a biopic. Not only does JLH not resemble Audrey in any way but JLH can't act at all, in any fashion. I see this as just another chance for JLH to be overexposed as something she is not (i.e. actress, singer.) If you buy this i recomend burning it when your done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jennifer Love Hewitt flops as Audrey Hepburn","review":"Jennifer Love Hewitt doesn't look a thing like Audrey Hepburn. I truely believe that the producers and casting directors made a terrible call casting Hewitt. The actress who I believe reminds people of Audrey as well as looks like her is Natalie Portman (who is an exceptional actress). Natalie would have made a much mcuh better Audrey Hepburn."},{"rating":"2","title":"A job well done","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. This is probably the single hardest job an actress would take on. I belive that people are expecting to see the actual Audrey Hepburn. That is not going to happen. Mrs Hepburn is regarded as the best actress of all time, and to think that Jennifer Love Hewitt can have the same performance is not logical. But Ms Hewitt does a wonderful job of capturing the charm and grace of Hepburn in a way I don't believe that any other young actress could do. Who else could pull off this part? In my opinion, no one else has even close to any resemblence to Hepburn compared to Hewitt. I believe this was a wonderful film and it made me even more interested in some of the classical Hepburn movies that I have not previously seen. Give credit to Hewitt for tackling such a hard film and pulling it off. A job well done."},{"rating":"1","title":"BLASPHEMY","review":"How could anyone think that Jennifer Love Hewitt looks or acts anything like audrey? who in thier right mind could see this gangly, ungraceful, talentless, squinty has-been as one of the most beloved actresses/humanitarians of our time?

For while I actually liked JLH well maybey not like but I could stand her after seeing this movie i lost all resepct for her. I don't think any one could play her, though I think Winona Ryder in some ways reminds me of her though doubt she'd do a TV movie. Jennifer Love Hewit maybe admires Audrey Hepburn but I still think doing this movey was bad idea. She could of helped UNACEF that's what Audrey Hepburn probaly would want to be remebered for. They didn't mention that at all (okay five second of UNACEF) they only showed two films she made and Audrey Hepburned made 27.

While the film is whimsical and pretty to look at, a documentary film or biography on the late actress would be far more capable of telling the story. The title role was horribly miscast, and while Ms. Hewitt tries very hard, she lacks the age, grace and wisdom to conquer such a role. I was very dissapointed in the picture, especially at the fact that they dedicated three hours to such a small portion of Audrey Hepburn's life and only ten seconds to her work with UNICEF (the best ten seconds of the film). While Hewitt fans are sure to enjoy her in a role that was very obviously tailored for her, I urge people in search of the \\"real\\" Audrey Hepburn to look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flawless!","review":"Jennifer Love Hewitt shines as actess and humanitarian Audrey Hepburn. The flashback techniques is really quite empresive, and Hewitt brings charm, grace, and real drama to this part. It shows all important moments in the actress' life and tells you more about the actress."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Ain't No Hepburn!","review":"Jennifer Love Hewitt is clearly not Audrey Hepburn, she doesn't even come close, but, I will concede that she did a great job at producing and starring in this made-for-TV-movie. It takes us from Audrey's childhood all the way to one of her many defining moments - the filming of Breakfast At Tiffany's.It really is a pleasant film to watch. Although the script can be slow at times, I feel that it honors Audrey's memory. Even her son approved of this biography.Ultimately, I'd like to say to those who bash Ms. Hewitt for starring in this bio-pic, I'm glad that she used the fame she has to introduce Audrey to a younger audience that possibly would have never learned about her otherwise.I give this movie four stars because of Emmy Rossum's incredible talents. I wish her and Ms. Hewitt many more successes."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little Girl in Playing Dress up","review":"Whoever cast this movie sure made a big mistake choosing Jennifer Love Hewitt. She might play a sweet teen but sure couldn't fill the shoes of Audrey Hepburn. She looked like a child playing dress up. This little girl obviously didn't do her homework. She never captured Audrey's elegance and free spirit. It would take a very special person to play such an extroadinary person like Audrey Hepburn. Actually I think they should have found an unknown that would have brought a fresh look into the the life of Audrey Hepburn. Even the character that played Capote didn't convince me. I felt the movie as a whole looked as though it was thrown together which made me bored with the whole process. I felt nothing. Since Audrey Hepburn was a big screen movie star this movie should have been made for the big screen not T.V."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why Did They Choose HER?!","review":"I saw this movie on television. I was really excited because I thought it would be interesting and Audrey Hepburn is one of my favorite actresses. Well...This movie was AWFUL!! Why on earth would they pick Jennifer Hewitt to play Audrey Hepburn. Natile Portman might have been a better choice. As others said, the girl who played the younger Audrey did a pretty good job. Perhaps Miss Hewitt is a better actress in other shows and movies, but not this time. This movie could almost be classified as a comedy! She didn't even keep up her fake Audrey voice throughout the entire movie,and when she did use it she sounded like Audrey with one word 'CAT'.The actors who played Gregory Peck and William Holden were a joke; they were awful and didn't look or sound like either Peck or Holden. The movie showed none of Audrey's later life. If you missed seeing this on television,you didn't miss much. If you still want to see this, rent it; you might be sorry if you buy it first."},{"rating":"2","title":"this movie is delightful","review":"I think that jennifer love hewitt is agreat actor and she shines in yhis movie. I think this is one of her better movies. I recommand this movie to everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"OF COURSE Jennifer Love Hewitt isn't Audrey Hepburn.","review":"But she does a damn good job. And it's obvious that she loves the role and the opportunity to have played her. The negative reviews she's gotten just aren't fair. She certainly gets points for attempting this, and if you'll give the movie half a chance, with an OPEN MIND, she might just prove to you that she's a very good actress.If you're expecting Audrey, or wanting to compare the two of them, that's just not fair to anyone. I'm glad to have seen the story done so well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible choice to play Audrey","review":"Very disappointing! They could have chosen a more poised and sophisticated actress to play Audrey; Jennifer Love Hewitt's portrayal is an insult; in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hey, Jennifer Love Hewitt was not that bad in this movie...","review":"Jennifer Love Hewitt did a not-too-bad job in portraying Audrey Hepburn although she was not able to grasp everything about Audrey. Speaking the truth, playing Audrey Hepburn is a gambling, a risky task in every sense. I don't think that there r more than very few ppl who can really carry the mission, and we can't expect that we are going to see a facsimile of the best actress in the Hollywood history. So, at least, we should give Jennifer some applauses for her courage to take the role."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not at all Audrey Hepburn","review":"JLH did a terrible job at portraying Audrey Hepburn. She seemed depressed most of the time and the insecurity depiction was too much. JLH looks NOTHING like Miss Hepburn so I don't konw why she was given that part. She does not have the elegance or the grace of Miss Hepburn, and she did this head shaking thing waay too much. Her accent was off most of the time, and her singing (although it's good) sounded nothing like Miss Hepburn. They should have played a recording instead! Overall, I was disappointed and, as others have already said, Natalie Portman would have been a much better Miss Hepburn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Audrey quality acting!!!!!!!!!","review":"Sadly, this movie is suppose to be the story of one of the greatest acting and fashion legends of \\"all time\\".

This TV biopic was built around Jennifer Love Hewitt, not Audrey Hepburn. Technically speaking, it's innacurate and skips over many important milestones in her life, and totally omitted her life beyond Breakfast at Tiffany's! For a good watch, try the A&E biography. At least it's accurate, and shows actual pictures of Audrey. This biopic crams all 5'2\\" of Jennifer's busty little self into replicas of Audrey's stunning and world-famous costumes, just so she (JLH) can over-reenact Roman Holiday and Breakfast at Tiffany's, probably the only two Hepburn films she bothered to watch before casting herself in this $7 million budget stinker. Not for respectful Hepburn fans, totally for Hewitt fans who want to see her in more tight outfits and clunky lifts that try to bring her up to Hepburn's 5'7\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hewitt is horrible. Story is inaccurate! The list goes on.","review":"First, I will give Jennifer Love Hewitt some credit... She did a wonderful job at slaughtering the story of a true film icon. But then, what do you expect from the co-executive producer who just happened to cast herself in the lead? Hewitt makes no secret that she's an Audrey wanna-be, and this movie just shows how hard she'll try (and how much money she'll spend) to be Audrey.I agree 100% with the reviewer that mentioned she would have rather seen a \\"documentary style special.\\" So much of the 'Audrey Hepburn Story' is not even accurate and I think its a shame!

I did not put it down until I finished it. I have read all of Douglas's & Olshaker's books,and as usual the information presented in the book is well researched. The book is well-written and Douglas's behavioral analysis on each of the subjects is brilliant. What I found most compelling was the way in which Douglas and Olshaker paint a vivid picture of life during the times of the Ripper, Borden and Lindbergh cases. In this essence, the book was quite visual. This book is a must read for any Douglas fan or anyone wishing to experience his expertise for the first time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"This book is great. Mr. Douglas is obviously a very credible researcher and he is also a very good author. From Jack The Ripper to The Zodiac Killer, from Lizzie Borden to the Boston Strangler this book is covering all the great unsolved cases of the last century.I'm giving this book 4 stars because of two things: The very controversial chapter about JonBenet Ramsey, and I thought Mr. Douglas should've shared a little more of his wisdom about the Black Dahlia murder, this part of the book was way too short.But overall this book is a must own for all True Crimes investigators/fans. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very interesting","review":"This book has informed me of things I have never known.

This book is a rehash of earlier works. It may be interesting to those who don't know much about profiling. However, Mindhunter is a much better book than this recycled effort, which seems to have been written primarily to justify his support of the Ramseys. Regarding the Ramsey case, he presents a few credible scenarios incriminating Paty and/or John, and then immediately dismisses them as \\"absurd\\". His ego seems to have created quite a blind spot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading rhetoric from self adulating Douglas","review":"Typical Douglas, in his self aggrandizing style, makes himself the authority on all crime related topics. If Douglas could downsize his ego, it would make it easier to read. For example, despite what the police, the state, and even his former colleagues in the FBI considered about the Ramsey case, Douglas \\"alone\\" has it solved -- i.e. the parents, from whom he took a substantial sum of money for his \\"consultation\\", are innocent. Incredible that Douglas makes such a conclusion, even though he wasnt privvy to the evidence, as the FBI was and who came to a markedly different conclusion about the parents' involvement.A waste of time to read this book. I have to agree with McCrary and Ressler, two greatly respected FBI profilers, that Douglas has gone Hollywood."},{"rating":"1","title":"an open letter","review":"Mr. Douglas has done a great disservice to his profession by his work on the JonBenet Ramsey case. His self-serving and patronizing chapter on the case is incredible. I knew very little about the case before reading this book, and Mr. Douglas certainly offered no credible insight into the matter. There are so many holes in his theories that I am compelled to completely disregard his opinion as entirely motivated by ego. Others have defended his integrity by pointing out that at some point in the case he refused payment for his services, but it sure was useful to have the Ramsey's cooperation for the purpose of writing this book, for example."},{"rating":"1","title":"John Douglas Sold Out","review":"John Douglas sold himself out to the Ramseys. Acting as a paid consultant, he met with them and reviewed evidence and the crime scene. He criticizes colleagues and other law enforcement that believe the Ramseys are guilty. Mr Douglas did not work for the Boulder police or the D.A. so the evidence he reviewed was that which was made available by the Ramseys.If this isn't tainted, I don't know what is.The rest of the book rehashes old cases and does not offer any new information. It's a waste of time and money. Mr Douglas should be ashamed of himself for selling out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring but had many details","review":"I thought this book was very boring.

For most of the chapter, Mr. Douglas spends his time attacking the theories (and character) of other credible law enforcement officials who have called him out for the illogical findings he presented while being paid by the Ramsey's lawyers. Frankly, it's a little embarrassing. You blew it, John...and you know it.Just glad to see others posting similar comments about the final (and regrettable chapter) of this book.

The music sounds like it is looped and Cassie sings like she's half asleep. There is no emotion or intensity in this song at all. NONE. It's just bland and dreary.

But vocally, it was the most boring delivery that I have heard from a top 10 hit song ever.Her vocal is so thin and her delivery sounds like she doesn't really believe what she\`s singing.The lyrics sound sexy and flirtatous yet she bring none of that to the table.Take Kellis for example, while she may lack some vocal prowess, but she has that naughty come on vocal performance.This is to be the worst single of the year.The other one is Rhianna \\"Unfaithful\\" (I loved her Ponce de Replay song, but ballads are not her thing)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ew","review":"Cassie is so bad, she has to resort to stripping down to her panties in her video clip to get music sales.

It burns off the bottom portion and creates a finished look that is quite tacky considering that you have to clamp down on the braid longer than you might expect just to \\"cut\\" it.

This book is not good at all. I have the first one, which is amazing, but this one is so not aesthetically appealing to me. The cover made me think it would be a bunch of artists like the first but in this one they are more computer based artist and artists who paint far more loosely.

Also, I am 5'9 and the dress hits just below my knee. I love the satin finish and matching shawl that comes with it. I do have to get the top tailored slightly because it's too big for my 38C size.

Definitely order at least one size smaller than the size chart states.I was expecting the optional straps to be easily attached with hooks, as has been the case with all of my other strapless dresses. However, they come with nothing to attach them, and you need to sew them on if you want to use them. I wish the bowing (to maintain the shape) ran down the entire dress and not just the top. The dress also seems thinner than other satin dresses I have owned, but you get what you pay for.In all, after a little alteration, I think it will be fine for the occassion.

If you are unsure or uneasy about ordering a size, go by the size chart measurements. They are completely accurate.

The extra small fit very snug, and that's good since I didn't want to have to fashion straps to keep it up under my graduation gown. But I won't have to worry about that. It fits perfectly, and the colour is exact to what it shows on the website, though it is a BIT darker -- nothing drastic of course.

Second, they DO run big, but my bm's got alterations for 25 dollars or less and that's STILL cheaper than boutiques. Third, they're very high quality, boning for support, and just so darn pretty!

The only issue I have is wanting a little shape to the bottom, so I'm having a bit of tulle put on the slip so that it will bell out a bit.

I actually ordered two other styles of dresses from this company when I purchased this one to make sure I had a dress suitable to wear for my occasion. I was pleasantly pleased with all of them. They all fit well. I purchased Mediums (my measurements are 34-29-41, pear-shaped) and this dress flatters my figure. I will be purchasing others.

Personally, while watching \\"Sleuth\\", I kept expecting Jon Lovitz to pop out of a closet and yell, \\"ACTING!\\"If a few of the props in \\"Sleuth\\" look strangely familiar, they're from original \\"Twilight Zone\\" episodes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mystery galore!","review":"How can a film be this good? You are in thrall for the entire running time, pulled right into the house with them. Michael Caine and Laurence Olivier are on target and the supporting cast is stellar, as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Michael Caine made his grade with this tour de force film!","review":"To deal with that prodigious and proverbial actor named Sir Laurence Olivier is far to be a piece of cake;on the contrary is a big challenge to any actor; and Caine did it without major hindrances. This movie is part of the great tradition of the grateful British literature - nourished by Sherlock Holmes and Agatha Christie among the most renowned ones - featured by this well known cerebral handle of clues and riddles that challenge the spectator, when a tricked man invites to his wife's lover into a diabolical trap. But the point is who will get the last laugh on whom?A memorable tour de force all the way through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!","review":"This is a great movie - I have it on VHS and I saw it on Broadway. The DVD version is shovelware! No bonus material at all. No subtitles - no alternate languages - no bios - nothing! It is listed as the widescreen version, but it is presented in standard format with the picture and credits running off the side of the screen. To add insult to injury, you have to turn the disc over midway though the movie. Wait for somebody to bring out a better pressing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A masterpiece","review":"This movie, pure theater in celluloid, is really a masterpiece. If I could save only ten films to see the rest of my life, Sleuth will be one of them. It's extraordinary how Olivier and Caine play their roles in this embroidered, strange, peculiar and unbeatable script. A rare jewel. Don't think twice: buy and see this film and do word of mouth with your friends... spread the buzz. There's nothing like this, nor even remotely."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Director!","review":"Joe Mankiewicz seems to be one of Hollywood's great film directors, but he has not enjoyed the Renaissance of appreciation given to many other filmmakers of the 1950s. All About Eve and Sleuth are among his great creations. He almost worked with Laurence Olivier 20 years earlier in another movie.

(I live here, so I can say that!) until, in Part II, they set sail for Hawaii on David Dulalley's Golden Cruise.On the high seas, surrounded by luxury & ulterior motives, marriages start cracking at the seams, seductions occur around every corner, & deceit winds its bitter tentacles around the charming & the loathesome, the naive & the lecherous, the suave & the desperate.THE LETTER WRITER is quite absorbing -- a tad heavy on the financial intricacies -- a lively parable about greed, foolhardy optimism, vanity & the struggle to understand what truly matters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great look, compact, brilliant!","review":"I found that the Hercules DS510B was beautiful in looks and was stunning.

The other issue is the wheels don't swivel, so you can basically just go straight with them, which almost never happens when you are moving appliances.

St. Germain's dangerous yet compellingly compassionate character completely drew me into the story and I've since been reading my way through the rest of his history. Ancient Rome's excesses and casual disregard for human life is sharply contrasted with the vampire's compassion and loyalty to the people around him. His essential \\"humanity\\" is shown most in his relationship to Olivia, the horrifically abused wife of the villian, who becomes one of the enduring loves of his life. If you've never before considered reading a vampire novel you'll change your mind once you've met St. Germain."},{"rating":"2","title":"A crucial book in the St. Germain series","review":"I have been reading this line of novels for about five years, and have often had to read them out of sync since they can be very hard to find at the chain stores (and I have no good local stores to go to). I must say that this book should be one of the first that you read if you are beginning the series (which I HIGHLY recommend). The story is set in Nero's Rome and introduces two of Yarbro's main characters (Roger and Olivia) to the story arc. The writing is magnificent, and the attention to detail in the historical background is wonderful. Rome is portrayed as a wonderfully alien place rather than \\"Americans in Togas\\" that some historical writers seem to go for. I have a few more Yarbro novels waiting in my read pile now (Thanks Amazon!) and I can't wait to read more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite so far of the Saint Germain series","review":"The third in the Saint-Germain series, this book is set in Nero's Rome and explains the origins of several characters previously introduced in the first two books. Of the 3 I have read, this one is definitely my favorite, but I do have a soft spot for Roman history. That said, it's also the first time I've noticed some historical inaccuracies, which really irked me. As usual, I bogged down in the letters at the beginning of every section, and eventually skipped them altogether."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"I received one item wrong ( different color), called glassware pro and I am in the process of exchange it.

Synapse Films who brought out a Reg. 1 edition of \\"Vampire Circus\\" is supposed to later this year put out \\"Hands of the Ripper\\" and \\"Twins of Evil.\\" \\"Vampire Circus,\\" in otherwise a great presentation, was printed too dark and one must adjust the \\"Contrast\\" button.

Anyhow, like everyone else I'm wowed especially by Lena Horne and by the Nicholas Brothers dance sequence.

Bill Robinson was great as usual. Lena Horne was fab-u-lous in her rendition of a broken hearted heroin, singing about her long lost love, while watching the storm at the window. And that storm scene was the icing on the cake. It was fantastic!. Cab Calloway was a treat, the way he stepped out on stage in his wide brim fedora, long watch chain smacking the floor, and that all- time stunning zoot suit; singing Geechy Joe. This film is a must see, and buy, if you are a classic cinema collector."},{"rating":"2","title":"One never knows, do one?","review":"This has to be one of the best musicals ever. So much talent packed into one film! It's like a time capsule of the 40's swing era.You like dancing? Well, watch Bill bojangles Robinson tap. Or watch the unbelievable Nicholas brothers do their acrobatic number starting out on the music stands of Cab Calloways band. Torch songs? Lena Horne. She never looked or sounded better. Jazz with a little comedy? Fats Waller with Benny Carter on trumpet doing a great version of \\"ain't misbehaving\\" and issuing his famous line \\"one never knows do one?\\" Blues? Ada Brown singing with Fats Waller spitting out funny quips between lines. And the finale with Cab Calloways big band(featuring Illinois Jacquet on sax) doing an extended version of \\"jumping jive\\" shows how exciting swing music can be. All in all,this is a wonderful tribute to the black music of the period and a great starting point for anyone curious about the swing era."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let's be truthful","review":"Let's be frank: This is a terrible movie. Racial stereotypes, as one might expect from 1943, abound, and they are demeaning to say the least. The plot is so weak it barely exists. The acting is dreadful. The choreography is lousy. And the heart of the love story is between a 65 year old man and a 25 year old woman. As for Robinson's dancing, well, the Nicholas Brothers are the stars in this regard. And what exactly were Cab Calloway's talents? There is a positive side to the movie: It is Lena Horne. She's a delight, and there are three standard songs in this film. Horne deserved better, and in time her great talents would be recognized. Stormy Weather should be seen in its historical context: Blacks were needed in the war effort, and this was a very rare nod to some of their entertainers by a major studio."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Storm","review":"By far- i must say, this must be one of the best movies during its time with an all black cast.

Almost like I got an advertising piece that gives you a teaser of what the book is about so you can buy it.Please understand, this has nothing to do with the option method which sounds great and I wish to know more about.

(The battery being sprung is pushing against the o-ring)anyhow, get a kid near it, and it's fragile setup basically ends up in two pieces in the water, and water in the motor, and days drying out... after a few times of this happening, the motor has started to turn slow (probably starting to rust inside).If the company could redeisgn this to get a positive locking to the pieces, this toy would be a home run, but as it's stands, it's really just a great idea stuck with a poor design."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality, not sharp","review":"These chisels are not sharp out of the box.

This version of the greatest programmatic orchestral music of all time is simply terrible -- utterly uninspired and passionless, both in the solo piano and orchestral versions. The tone is muddy throughout, and I don't think it's the engineering: pianist and orchestra just seem listless in a piece that should leave listeners awed and thrilled. The pacing is all wrong. No definition in the percussion. The brasses sound bored. Listening to this is like reading Cliff Notes of War and Peace. Either the performers didn't understand this music or they didn't care. The best version remains Toscanini's with the NBC Symphony Orchestra: even with 1950s recording technology, scorchingly brilliant."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME","review":"This is an awesome artist ... i came in contact with her when we were both young... we were both in a musical named Grease .. one day i just happened to look online to see if she became something and here she has a cd out ... this is a great cd EVERYONE SHOULD BUY THIS ALBUM ... its great ... if you love Ani Defranco you will love her .... its great and i dont say that about everyone ... not just because i knew her once apon a time but because she is a great artist...buy this album u will love it"},{"rating":"2","title":"It works","review":"I'll start with the negatives:As someone else wrote, the tip-to-tip measurement isn't 54\\". I just measured mine, and it's around 42\\". That's a big difference. False advertising, I think it fair to say.Also (as the other writer wrote) it's odd that the sock (which fits around your light) is centered in the diffuser panel. Most everyone's lights are offset a bit (the shaft fits *next* to the light, not the middle), and so to get it to fit, you have to bend the umbrella quite a bit (which then deforms the reflector, because the umbrella is the reflector).Now the positives:That said, it does work, and the photographic results I've gotten are very good. All things considered, it's a good way to add a pseudo-softbox to your lights, for about $70. Better options are available, but they cost more, may be heavier, and take up more space. So, I view this as a good low-cost option, for those who aren't ready to plunk down thousands on a more sophisticated system."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great light but terrible quality manufacture","review":"You'll have read all the reviews about the quality of the light from the Softlighter, which is astonishing.

If one believes that God alone is Truth, then one can read with confidence, The Supremacists. The author, P. Schlafly, is on God's Wavelength.The Left have sought for more than 50 years to control our nation. They cannot do it by the ballot box so the revolution is therein by judges, as we have seen in the past decades but even more so in the past years (Mass), judges making rules/laws whereas they were meant only to INTERPRET the laws.Their revolutionary rulings have and will continue to cause a great divide in the Culture War, which will define us as a nation that will live forever, or go down the sad pages of history as so many nations before us have gone, e.g., Ur. of the Chaldees, Babylonia, Persia, Alexandria, Egypt, Rome, mighty Rome, she merely disintegrated from within.History is making its torrential mark on the world, and let us not be asleep while it rages."},{"rating":"1","title":"A nice way to flood the courts with rightwing fascists","review":"Not recommended for non-neoconservatives who believe in true justice.

Phyllis is in her typical form, blasting judges for such things as ending segregation and protecting human rights. Like another reviewer said, past the title there is nothing new. If you want to see where people like Reverend Pat Mahoney, Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell get their ideas of how to destroy this country by breaking down the balance of power so that they can build a murderous Theocracy, this book is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not convincing and overly political","review":"I knew mrs Schlafly's ideas from reading her columns at townhall, and this book therefore taught me nothing new.

If you feel that our Judicial system is flawed because it is not being held accountable - wouldn't that be an argument for more checks and balances not less?So then what is this really about? I believe that the author is afraid of social evolution (as evidenced by her other books.) Although I don't understand why she is - without it she couldn't be an author, lawer, columnist, AND be the mother of six. Anyways, she would like to replace our judges with know it alls like herself. She does a good job of presenting the facts that back up her agenda, but she misses any evidence of how the system that she proposes would be doomed to fail.

I laughed. I thought it was a joke. Too bad it wasn't--I've read that one too. Mrs. Schalfly does it again with her most recent book, telling only one side of the story and basing her argument on the Word of God, to which she apparently has more authority than anyone other than the attendees at the Last Supper. This book is definitely worth a read--it shows the serious conservative flaws with the cry of \\"activist judges!\\" Once again, all she's really done is shown the world that what she's saying really isn't worth saying at all. But God Bless America for recognizing her right to say it. Read it, but don't buy it. Check it out from your local library."},{"rating":"2","title":"CORRUPTION--ITALIAN STYLE","review":"This Damiano Damiani policier seems to fly beneath the radar of critical attention. It doesn't say anything new really, but it says it a very stylish way. The duel of wits between Franco Nero's straight-arrow (and slightly priggish) prosecutor and Martin Balsam's fed-up cop is entertainly presented, and although the denouement is predictable, it really couldn't happen any other way. Marilu Tolo also does a nice job as a reluctant witness who scared to death for very good reasons.\\"Confessions of a Police Captain\\" is no masterpiece, but it's the sort of solid workman-like entry that makes the study of film genres so very entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"excellent movie - poor quality","review":"this movie with its magnificant cast and its thrilling story could be recommended like all films made by master-director Damiani - but I suffered when watching the story because they sent me a copy with a rather poor image-quality (like a view through strong softening lenses)...a pity.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprises for an experienced baker","review":"I've been baking for more than 30 years, and I thought I did OK - as did my family.

I'm not enthusiastic about the way the book is set up, because I have to keep flipping back and forth from the filling to the crust until I get her crust recipe memorized. There are some recipes that are quite simple, but are presented in a complicated way.

Her recipes are very exact, they specify ingredients frequently by brand name, baking techniques, and even which bakeware to use. I find that if I follow her recipe EXACTLY, the results are spectacular. However, following her recipe exactly takes a lot of time, if you take any shortcut, or delete a setp, then the results are less than average. I recommend this book for people who want excellent results and are willing to invest a lot of time, effort, and money in their baking.

I used the recipe from \\"In the Sweet Kitchen\\" instead and the crust came out perfect.And some of the recipes are not nearly as imressive as they look. The only recipe that I've made that received any \\"wows\\" from my guests was the tiramisu tart, and that wasn't until the third time I made it when I made significant changes to the recipe. A few of the recipes were huge disappointments.I would highly recommend \\"In the Sweet Kitchen\\" or the Cindy Mushet book instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Devil's in the details.","review":"The recipe instructions are inconsistent and ridiculously overcomplicated. \\"Great\\" pumpkin pie, for example. The instructions say to bake the pie directly on the oven floor. If you have a gas oven that heats from the bottom, you are getting nothing but a burnt pie (thanks for a Thanksgiving failure, Rose). Designer Apple Pie is nice, the trick of boiling down the apple juices is slick. But the cream cheese crust? I've had better results from the Joy of Cooking recipes. Her recipes are too fragile to be reproduced consistently. If you are off by a degree in the oven, or off by a minute in the timing, forget it, your pie is ruined. Other pie recipes are less sensitive. Working with her crust recipes is like walking on eggshells.I've been making pies for 20 years. I can't say the details that make Berenbaum's recipes so complicated make her pies much better than ones I've made in the past from other cookbooks. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sigh!","review":"I've had this book since year nought. But I have never made anything from it. Having said that I currently have cubed butter and a flour mixture in the freezer. My first stab at making pie from this tome. Obviously my rating of 2 stars does not reflect the quality of the recipes. It's reserved for the wonderful folks at Scribner. I think Ms Beranbaum might be the world's most gifted cake/pie/bread maker but she certainly needs a bit of help when it comes to picking a publisher. My 'Cake Bible' fell apart very quickly as the pages couldn't wait to detach themselves from the feeble spine. This has not happened to my pie bible coz as I said, I've never used it. The sections are not very well organized and having to refer back and forth is annoying. A couple of those built-in bookmarks (like the Gourmet cookbook) would have been so helpful. Anyway, I can go on all day but other reviewers have beaten me to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the novice","review":"After reading just a couple of her receipies, I discovered this book is not for the faint at heart when it comes to baking. Although when I watched her on an early morning program, I gathered there was a more balanced experience of receipies. Her citation of types of flour is simply more information that I was interesting in having and boardered on what one might call flour snobbery. So far, the only method I have regularly incorporated in my pastry baking is her reference to chilling. So as all is not down the pastry funnel, I will pick and choose a few more receipies now and then to try."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad recipes--buyer beware","review":"This book has some good baking TIPS, but many of the recipes simply do not work.

It deals with a mother comming to accept the loss of her comatose son. Clay, the last story, was also very insightful and interesting. The old sculptor of the story struggles with his obligation to \\"scan\\" his brain for the sake of future generations having access to his knowledge or the dignity of a natural death.This is the kind of science fiction that I love and hope to see more of.

It's surprisingly easy to get any of those three just slightly wrong, and easy to miss that they aren't quite square. And the result if ANY of the three \\"moving parts\\" is even minutely \\"off\\" is coffee all over your counter and floor.

Of course it is not really fair to compare a film made in 1939 (Rathbone) with one made 40+ years later. So this film must be evaluated on its own merits.Richardson is a terrific Holmes and it is disappointing that he only made one other film from Doyle's \\"canon\\".To purists of Doyle, be warned that the script introduces a few character not found in the original but they only add to the story-line.And yes, Dr Watson is not played as sharp as say, Hardwicke's characterization (in the Granada series) but overall he is entertaining.The highest marks for this film go for production values, direction, and cinematography. All are superb.Recommended for collectors of Holmes films"},{"rating":"1","title":"Monotype Baskerville","review":"A disappointing movie: cliché-ridden directing, cardboard scenery, and acting that I feel is now dated, despite the presence of the great Ian Richardson and a young Martin Shaw.

Like seeing Michaelangelo's David, climbing the red rocks of Sedona or listening to the giggles of a four-month-old, hearing this disc leaves one with a sense of well-being and light, knowing that the Universe is not just a random play of molecules after all, but a deliberate dance of infinite possibilities and joy.Coltrane pushed and pushed himself his entire life, but here he just pushed his ego aside and let it flow.These are not merely musical notes.

Truly A Love Supreme.I guess you could say that I dig this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"A BORE SUPREME...A BORE SUPREME...","review":"I bought this CD. I listened to this CD. And then I listened again, and again...ad nauseum. I get jazz. I love jazz. I \\"get\\" spiritual jazz. This music is a load of crap. It is boring, goes nowhere, and I fail to see why, when so much brilliantly done spiritual oriented jazz has been created, one would rather kneel at the alter of such mediocrity. That Coltrane may have advanced the modal boundaries of jazz/sax does not a great (or even good, evidently) album make. Trance-inducing offerings by Szabo, Tjader, Byrd, Hubbard, Hancock, Hutcherson, Horn and many others actually DO achieve the accolades unrightfully heaped upon this monotonous drone of a squak, so forego the lip service paid this and pursue those players for genuinely moving soul food if you, too, are able to listen to the MUSIC with your ears, instead of the hype."},{"rating":"1","title":"Received vinyl record in two pieces","review":"I was very excited to receive \\"A Love Supreme\\".

BOOOOOOO!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I Don't Understand Why This Is So Loved","review":"I have to disagree with the majority of folks here who consider this cd the jazz end all. I find it grating, and darn near unlistenable. I have built a small but quality jazz library the last few months. Miles Davis, Dave Brubeck, Kenny Burrell, Grant Green, Cannonball Adderley, Stan Getz, Chet Baker, Wes Montgomery, Bill Evans and Thelonius Monk to name a few. This guy is by far my least favorite. His playing on Miles Davis cd's I have and with Monk is largely enjoyable and I know he's a giant. But this stuff?. The live recording on disc two was so grating I couldn't make it through. It sounded to me like a bunch of Geese being slaughtered. Give me the other guys anytime."},{"rating":"1","title":"talk about navel-gazing...","review":"Okay already, I'm convinced you have chops! You don't have to keep trying to impress me...or each other...or yourselves...This album encapsulates the fatal flaw of jazz music, the element that is relegating it to the dustbin of history: form over substance. Nobody will care about the technical achievements of these guys in 100 years (not many do now except those who confuse self-obsession with depth). There are moments, especially the middle section, where Coltrane and co. hint at some melodic structure, some level of aesthetic appeal, but inevitably a stylized flourish ruins everything. I suppose it's good that someone pushed the 'repetitive droning and squawking' envelope, but do you really want to listen to him do it?Art reaches out, speaks to the universal, appeals to the heart. Jazz excludes, speaks in code, demands analysis. I prefer art."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perplexity","review":"I like this title, but I do not understand why people is so excited about it. I mean, for the sixties it was really a breakthrough, I guess. But now there are many sax players that can play better than Coltrane, they are much polished and straight. I think about Kenny G., for instance. His rythmic session is much more regular, whereas Coltrane's session seems sometimes to loose the beat. And also Coltrane is not really precise... But the title is interesting at least as an historical recording, a first step towards the perfection of todays players."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice!!","review":"Love the new vinyl but I'm still waiting on my other one.. Where is it??But I digress.. I love my new vinyl!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A study in spiritual ecstacy.","review":"For all those seeking the ultimate jazz experience this is THE album. Man seeks for meaning by finding the beautiful aesthetic. Coletrane has helped all of us to find that moment and to think the moment was recorded. A Love Supreme stands right at the border between beauty and chaos. While many later avant garde works and even the later works of Coletrane run past that border and become difficult to listen to, A Love Supreme remains in the realm where the listener is allowed to enter the experience of the artist. A Love Supreme is the ultimate jazz album THE CLASSIC!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Love Supreme Indeed!","review":"This is an amazing recording that deals with spirituality and an unconditional love that we should all give to each other as humanbeings. This recording is flawless including the extras that are included on the bonus cd which includes his only Live performance of A Love Supreme as well as many outtakes which includes Archie Shepp who was a close friend and collaborator playing his screechy Sax on the alternate recordings of Acknowledgement. I think everyone should buy this recording it is very creative and innovative for 1964."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Pinnacle of Modal Jazz","review":"John Coltrane is at his best on this recording. Some people dislike it because they believe it is excessively serious, but to me it is deeply emotional and even joyful. It really takes an open mind (and concentration) to enjoy this CD properly, but it will more than reward the listener for the energy he expends.Musically, it would be absurd to attack this recording; the writing, improvisation, and interaction are flawless.One word of warning: If you are someone who listens to music for simple entertainment or background, this is not the CD for you. Listening to this CD in the background would be like reading yourself to sleep with James Joyce's \\"Ulysses\\".It really boils down to how you see music. Some people just don't think of music as being a deeply expressive artistic outlet, and that's fine - but they won't enjoy this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"A SLICE OF HEAVEN","review":"What's better than \\"A Love Supreme\\"?

It's not quite perfect although at only three taut tracks the quartet seems at a precise alignment between excess and restraint to promote such holy themes, parlaying the album into an experience unique to his dense catalog."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Jazz Album","review":"Until I checked the amazon reviews page, I had never met a single person who had heard this album and didn't absolutely love it. I'm not saying that the single star givers aren't entitled to their opinion, but my experience is that my large swathe of Jazz Fan friends would unanymously give this 5 stars. It is not hard bop, but it is beautiful, whether you invest in the spirituality of it or not. This is one of the great albums of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coltrane Supreme","review":"Absolutely outstanding, many words have been written about this man but he and Miles Davis stand alone as the giants of the original modern jazz era.

Many of Coltrane's phrases repeat the same notes over and over. This can be clever once in a while, but over and over, it's just annoying. The first number is torture if you like melodic music. There's no connection between the phasing and the rhythm. Again, is this supposed to be clever? If you subscribe to the idea that \\"weird is genious\\", then you may like this CD.There are many sax players from this period who have better tone and phrasing. Coltrane's tone is like listening to someone sing while holding their nose."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coltrane in peak form.","review":"When he made this album, John Coltrane considered it to be his gift to God. It's certainly worthy of that status, having some really amazing instrumentals, including, of course, John Coltrane's masterful saxaphone playing. I'm a drummer, and I can testify that this album is also a prime example of really skillful jazz percussion. If you're looking to start a really fine jazz collection, this would be an important album to include.If you liked this, I recommend Coltrane's \\"Giant Steps.\\" It's a little bit less serious, slightly more bouncy, but of similar excellence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moving music","review":"This disc ranks as one of the most moving recordings these ears have ever heard. The haunting chant of the chorus during the title track really allows a listener to feel as though they were there in the studio. It is amazing what Coltrane did with just instruments and skilled musicians. There wasn't any electronic amplification or sweetening here. One has to wonder just what would have been accomplished if they were allowed to utilize some of the equipment at our disposal today. \\"Acknowledgement\\" is a rolling tidal wave of emotions.

Having said that, \\"A Love Supreme\\" is an astonishing album and one that all serious listeners should own. It stands out from Coltrane's earlier modal works by its devotion to the spiritual aspect of music, an element that also dominated his work in free jazz. Trane plays beautifully and very distinctively throughout, his keening sound alternately gliding over and colliding with his remarkable rhythm section. If you're considering buying this album, stop considering it. You'd be crazy not to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good","review":"This album represented a shift on Coltrane's part to longer songs and looser song structures.

There's not many details on this listing yet, but from the cast list it appears to be the 2005 movie. So, instead of what I was hoping for, Lassie fans get a release of a recent movie, which is already available on DVD(ASIN: B000ICL3ME), with an impostor playing Lassie. Please Classic Media, start releasing full season sets of the classic series with complete uncut episodes in chronological order!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Inexpensive.......but cheap","review":"Fits ok.

Uh, let me correct that, no rest is given when one of the Comet Blaster orbiting satellites is hit by a piece of space debris. There's no way for it to be saved and it's too big to burn up in the atmosphere so it must be destroyed before it hits the Earth. As two Comet Blasters man a desperate mission to rescue the space stations crew, Shizuha, Ayamo, Mikaze, and Karin set out to vaporize it.The two episodes on this dvd really didn't do much for me. They did not extend the story of the original series or bring anything new to the show. Instead of meteors, we have a space station. It was a little funny but I think that Stratos 4 is pretty much played out. Unless you take it in a different direction and get away from the whole meteor blasting business. This is kinda like a skimpy dessert after the main course."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice one - primarily white floral","review":"I don't find Pure to be very green but it is floral. It opens with a white floral POW!, likely the lily & freesia combination, but it quickly mellows into a soft, soapy floral. JB78 review is spot-on with his review of Pure as a sheer floral that's marine fresh. Pure was launched about the time as Happy & Pleasures, but I find Pure to be more likable nearly 15 years after launch.Pure is one of those fragrances that is easy to put on & easy to wear.

Many will know Moya as the first lady of Celtic music, the voice of Clannad and older sister to Enya. \\"An Irish Christmas\\" is a collection of Christmas carols celebrating Moya's beliefs in the Nativity. The good thing about this CD is that there are two songs added that where not included on the UK release but the bad thing is Moya's two original songs from the UK release where not included on this CD. My favorite song from this CD is \\"Carol Of The Bells\\" which is perfect for Moya's haunting vocal style. Her song \\"Oiche Chin\\" Galic for \\"Silent Night\\" is sure to be a hit as her two children sing with her on it.

Easy to follow and understand without all the intellectual jargon, also very enriching. I enjoyed this book and think it deserves the 5 stars.

Not bad directing Mr. Banderas; You may have another artistic venue or outlet, yet. There are two stories simultaneously being told here. Yes, they are both effective and do meet at the end of the road for purpose and not filler.

The subtitles are passable, not that bad. The English dub is still horrible...but then again there has NEVER been a good Dub of any Initial D stages. The video is present in 4:3 widescreen format, not 16:9 as indicated on the DVD cover.

This is to warn people who care about such things that Funimation is flat out lying on their DVD boxes. They claim that the DVD's are 16:9 and they're not, they're 4:3 widescreen. Instead of filling the entire TV or even having black bars on the top and bottom, I have black bars on all four sides of the screen and it makes it useless to watch this on a large TV.

It plays back regular tapes fine, it is fine to watch TV through the VCR, but if you want a VCR to tape your favorite TV shows (and you don't want to get a headache when you watch them), this is NOT the VCR for you!!!I called Sony and they didn't care.

The \\"ghost\\" in question is NOT invisible, and is not really a ghost. Also, the shadow of an ape appears on the main title card. (Don't ask me, I'm only the reviewer.) The various plot twists contain no supernatural or science fiction elements, and yet are even less plausible than those of other Monogram horrors. The director, Joseph Lewis, displays almost none of the talent he showed in his later films. Only the presence of Bela Lugosi makes this one worthwhile. The role of \\"Dr. Kessler\\" is a Jekyll/Hyde character, so Lugosi is playing a normal, likeable guy during most of his screen time, which makes this one of his more unusual roles.

Usually people that do not like you do not like themselves and you remind them of something that they are not and never will be.I passed it on to someone else. If you buy this keep in mind that if you love yourself, to not care what someone else thinks becomes second nature.

I would not recommend this collection to anyone who likes sensual and sexual play between women. There were some scenes with incest and rape. I did not get very far in this book, about the first 5 stories, in an attempt to find something worth my time.

As another reviewer mentioned, there are no background and bibliographic references whatsoever. I would at least expect approximate dates and publishers of the original texts.My guess is that they were written by a man familiar with Victorian erotica, but some time after the era ended. One clue is that one story describes the woman as a \\"lesbian,\\" a word which didn't come into popular use until well after the Victorian era. Sexologists began using it in 1889, but it is really doubtful that a writer of common porn would be aware of the most recently published scientific writing.On the other hand, the stories are entertaining as some ridiculous little pieces of erotica."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't do timeshifting with my Mitsubishi","review":"This product I got yesterday doesn't do all its features when connected to my Mitsubishi 62525.

Plus, the 1 lb weight is not nearly enough for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"vice grip and cheap material","review":"I am a thin woman and after a few minutes of wearing these, my hands turned blue. So tight. I paid for the darn things so I tried to wear them on my walk, but I was worried that a few more minutes more would mean amputation. I ended up carrying them home. I agree with the woman who said these felt like little useless bean bags. More like little torturous little bean bags."},{"rating":"1","title":"poorly constructed","review":"Well, I was worried when I read the review saying they didn't fit over large hands. I have pretty large hands and I had no trouble getting them on. However, they started leaking sand during the first use! I can't recommend these. I'll use them until they fall apart which probably won't be too many weeks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Product misrepresented","review":"Discription says 2-2pound wrist weights.

My watch is heavier than these!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too small!","review":"I recently purchased these wrist weights, thinking I'd be able to use them as ankle weights. I couldn't get them over my foot, but this was completely understandable because they are in fact wrist weights. This would have been fine were it not for the fact that the weights don't even fit over my hands! I am quite skinny, and pretty small, so even when I tried my best to get them on my wrist, I was cutting off my own circulation.I don't know if it was just me or some kind of fluke, but they were definitely too small, and I can't use them so I will be sending them back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unrealistically Small","review":"Even for a small woman such as myself, these wrist weights are so tight I can barely cram them on at all... let alone keep them on and exercise without damaging my skin! These should be advertised as weights for a child because they do not fit an adult - even a small slim adult."},{"rating":"2","title":"wrist weights (one lb each)","review":"I'm very happy with this product, for me right now, they are perfect. The 4 rating is twofold however, one I can see how many people might not even be able to get a wrist in. I have small hands and had to struggle (but I like the snug fit), others probably couldn't even squeeze in. And also the material feels great, but looks a little dicey. The seams are already straining quite a bit with the struggling, I could easily see a rip in a few months of regular use. At 10 bucks though, I wouldn't mind an investment 3 times a year if need be. Anyway, great product, could be a tad bigger with sturdier material around the sides. But for right now, these are exactly what I was looking for to add to my cardio workouts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ordered 2 pair and both leaked at the seams","review":"I love the size and comfort of these.

I would not buy these or recommend to anyone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap Cheap Cheap","review":"The day I received these they tore open and the little beads and grannules on the inside started to come out, not to mention I have about a 5 and 1/2 inch wrist and small hands and it is very difficult to slip these on over my hands onto my wrists. I dont see how anyone with larger hands and wrists could wear them. My advice is dont waste your money because once they tear it is not worth the shipping to send them back!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"WAAAY TEENY TINY","review":"These were so tiny I could just get them over four fingers. Box says \\"one size fits most\\". Most what? teenage girls? (I'm not a large man, I'm a petite adult woman, fit wasn't even close.)It's really appalling that amazon doesn't a MODICUM of info for items like this (like what's the diameter, the fact that there's NO stretch factor built into these at all.I've learntt my lesson. go to web sites that provide some info for purchases of this kind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never quite worked for me","review":"I was really excited about adding these to my cardio workout, just to add a bit of weight without feeling it too much. That was the idea anyway. The issue is they didn't fit well, and there was no way to adjust them. I'm a 6'1\\" tall woman with the proportions to go with the height, so I'm not dainty. These were tight on my wrists from the start. I wore them a few times thinking with use the material would stretch a bit, but the material just came apart at the seams and the sand inside started to spill out. Even then it wasn't THAT tight, I wouldn't have thought it would just fall apart. Even if they did fit I imagine they wouldn't last very long.For smaller people these will work out fine, but for people who are more robust, including most men, these simply won't work out very well. I wish the adjustable kind came in lighter weights."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Happy","review":"As soon as I opened the package I knew something wasn't right because there was sand inside. I put them on later in the day and there was sand on my arm. I finally found the hole in one of the weights. Not happy to say the least."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't like them","review":"Can't say if this is a good product or not but the really got in the way while I was typing on my computer at work. My doctor suggested them for my tremors but they where to uncomfortable for me. You may like them for what you are using them for. Not a negative review this is more a personal choice review."},{"rating":"1","title":"A pile of gravel","review":"I hardly used them and they come apart at the seams and the gravel comes out. A waste of money. After using them maybe ten times I have to throw them away.I wish I had read all the reviews here of people that had exactly the same experience as I did! Hardly used and they already fall apart! Sometimes they already leak sand when they arrive!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Get ready to play pick up.","review":"If you have large/thick wrists do not purchase this product. Each weight is a pound of tiny beads inside an oddly shaped design. Think of an oval that is thick on only two opposite facing curves. The given picture shows the thick sides but the surrounding edges are very thin.Cutting to the chase there is a high probability that the cloth will be cut or worn out very fast and you will have tiny beads leaking and spilling everywhere.Look elsewhere for wrist weights."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grrrrrrr-___-","review":"I was actually disappointed with these thing; after the second time I wore them, the little rocks were coming out from the were its sown together at. And its very annoying having a thousand little rocks in your shoe walking around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Valeo 2 lb wrist weights","review":"I am unable to put my hands thru the opening. The opening for the wrist is to small (approx 1 3/4 inches )and the weights are non adjustable. They may work best for someone who has very very small hands. But for the average size person I would not suggest these weights. Maybe the company should use stretchable material or add velcro to make them adjustable. I rated this product a 1 because of the feel of the material and the overall size of the weights. I am going to assume that if I could get them on, they would be very comfortable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Small","review":"It hurts my wrist to slip this on and off. It would have been much better if it had a velco strip or something where you could wrap it around the wrist instead of having to force it on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comfortable","review":"I agree with the other reviews that you have to have thin wrists for this to fit/be comfortable.

Maybe ok for someone with very tiny hand or a kid but not for the average adult."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way Too Small!","review":"Do not ignore the previous posters complaints about the size of these weights. I did! I'm a woman with a wrist 6.75 inches in diameter and I wear a size 7 or medium glove. These weights are extremely hard to get on and very uncomfortable to wear. I really think they are only suitable for a child or a very, very small woman.Also the weights I received do not look like the pictured item. Valeo seems to have changed the entire design of these. Maybe they were better before? The pictured item seems to have a larger diameter in the opening. The ones I got desperately need some elastic or something."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what I was looking for","review":"These are just what I was looking for. I bought \\"Turbo Jam\\" and wanted to get their \\"sculpting gloves\\". However, $50 for 1 lb gloves seemed excessive to me. So, I picked these up instead. They stretch and fit fine on my wrists. I use them around my hands, while making a fist. They work great and seem durable and well made."},{"rating":"1","title":"too small","review":"Very hard to put on, they are not very big, and I am a slender petite woman with little hands & wrists, but it feels like I am scraping my skin to get them on and off, do not care to wear them at all.

Going to see if I can return them or resell them myself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good only for the first few days","review":"So i purchased these weights a few days ago and they appeared very comfortable.

The quality is great, and the material is soft. However, when people say small...they mean it! I am a petite size 2 and they only barely fit. I actually got these for therapy use for my one-year old's ankles and these were the only one-pounders I could find. They fit my chuncky little one just perfectly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some chapters were good, some were bad, all in all just okay","review":"I got this book as a free gift for attending a CRM conference. Some of the author's points are valid--the book was probably written before a lot of this material became obvious. (One of these days, I'm going to find a book that says \\"People issues don't matter if your company's managers don't have a customer focus or your firm doesnt have the necessary IT infrastructure in place.\\" Can't wait for that.)I worked for Lucent in the 1990s and would swear that we coined the phrase \\"People Process and Technology.\\" Anyway, it's been worn pretty thin. The tone of the book was a bit pedantic and stiff and so I found it a bit hard to to get through. I like Paul Greenberg's and Jill Dyche's CRM books much better, though, and would recommend them over this one, along with a new book called \\"Why They Don't Buy\\" by Max McKeown that is definitely the go-to book for CRM automation!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lamp reflector","review":"This is a great price for an item for a very difficult to find flashlight.I will definitely purchase again from this website"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware, only Castillian spoken here","review":"This set is fine if you only want to learn Spanish in the Castillian accent.

I have not played the game in a while, and this CD made me want to play it again. I especally liked \\"Inside Ganon's Castle,\\" which is Ganon's theme played on a pipe organ.

It's the best one out of the N64 soundtracks."},{"rating":"2","title":"excelent","review":"this cd is great. if you are a zelda fan you need this cd. i got it when i was recently in japan. its great music just the same as the games music."},{"rating":"2","title":"ZELDA!!!","review":"Oh Yeah, this is it. The Legend of Zelda Original Soundtrack. Chalk full of all the classic songs, Like Zelda's Lullaby, Serende of Water, Potion shop. It has all those songs and more.

For all Zelda fans or even those that like music this CD is definately a must have for any collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Recommend It","review":"This CD is a complete compilation of all the songs from TLOZ: OOT. For the most part I like it, but it has some drawbacks. See, when Ocarina of Time first came out, I bought the soundtrack off of Nintendo, which only had 29 songs. Obviously, it hardly contains every song from the game, but the ones on this track are so much longer. Example: in my CD, Track Number 25, Gerudo Valley, runs through the 'verses' twice and then concludes, whereas on this CD, it only runs through once. Acually, it does that for most of the tracks. Zora's Domain on this CD is only about a minute and a half, while mine is longer. I recommend this CD to anyone who is a devout Legend of Zelda fan. It has everything on it, I was thrilled (I especially liked the Temple tracks). They arranged it well, though I think one of the tracks is repeated somewhere. Anyway, I think it's worth the money. GO FOR IT!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"the best music for the best videogame","review":"This Cd contains every track you hear in the video game.

It states \\"ages 12 and under\\", but play it almost every day with my 6 year old daughter. While she needs coaching from time to time, this is a strategy game that a young person can play that will adults will also enjoy. All but one or two of the times I have played this game it has only been with one other player, so I cannot talk a whole lot about how good the game is beyond two player. But in the two-player game, even a novice player can pick it up after one or two games and be very competitive. This game requires each player to adapt strategies to his or her opponents moves, so each game requires original thinking and planning. I highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys a quick, competitive strategy game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I am so disappointed with the Eebee DVD. I bought it based on a review in Parents magazine, and also from the reviews posted here. I feel Eebee DVD's are geared for first time parents, when their babies are just starting to move around.

Not even little Eebee himself could hold my toddler's attention."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Quality and shipping time","review":"I would like to thank the seller for the great quality and the fast shipping :) i really liked your service"},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointing entry in the Frommer series","review":"I travel extensively and am a fan of Frommer's guides which I generally find to have a nice assortment of options in varying price ranges. The volume on South Africa however, was a great disappointment. If Frommer's were to be believed, you had to pay $200 and up for a decent hotel room. Fortunately I have often traveled in South Africa, enjoyed its reasonably priced accomodations, and knew such prices were nonsense. I stayed in Cape Town, Johannesburg, Durban and other top destinations in season for less than half that much. The guide also overlooked destinations a bit off the beaten path and proved of so little use to me that I didn't bother to pack it home with me. I strongly suggest the Eyewitness guide instead or just surf the web for tons of great information from the South African Tourism Board."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great guide to South Africa","review":"In December 99 we used Frommer's 00 South Africa for a nine day tour by car through the Western Cape -- a good test for relevance and comprehensiveness.

It turns out to be impossible to navigate and is difficult to use as a guidebook.

Sadly it is impossible to return this Kindle book.Bought Bradt and Rough Guide in paper format as replacements. Will not use this one.Found this Kindle book to be worthless and as a result it got a bad rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment.","review":"We are fans of Frommer's Guide books from previous trips and choose this book from Amazon.com without reviewing it the old fashioned way - browsing through the pages/sections. Too late we discovered the book barely mentioned our destination points: Pretoria (Tshwane), and a private game reserve bordering Kruger National Park. We missed the 'where to dine' suggestions and places of interest in/near Pretoria, which have been particularly helpful in the past.In addition, we found at least one map reference that sent the reader to a page that had no corresponding text to the map cross reference. We ended up leaving the book at home."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome !!!!!!","review":"Without any doubt,Cat among the pigeons is one of agatha christie's best.It is an awesome book.The story is set in an English bording school,Meadowbanks.I really love this book because the story is set in a school and agatha portrays the character of the teachers very well.I was happy POirot did not appear until the second murder had took place because i found him very annoying in the other books.However he really was a genius in solving the puzzle,which is fit for experts..Overall,Cat among the pigeons was immensely enjoyable and it is a must read!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT MYSTERY THAT CONTINUALLY HAS YOU GUESSING!!","review":"This is definitely my favorite Agatha Christie book. The element of a girls' school murder was classic. It was good without being to deep. Also, no matter how hard you try, you cannot guess the end, unti Mr. Poirot explains of course. Personally, I liked him not being in much of the book because it took a school girl to find out the mystery. I recommend this to anyone who wishes to read a frivolous, exciting, and definitely intersting book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh.","review":"An interesting story, but the author tried to do too much in 400 pages. Too many characters and too many voices resulted in a somewhat awkward tale full of flat, one-note caricatures. At first, I found it somewhat misogynistic, as the first hundred pages lacked a single female character that wasn't a monster, a nutjob, or a complete waste of oxygen; as I read on, I realized that the male characters weren't any better, there were just more of them. Being un-Christian, and especially un-Catholic, I just didn't \\"get\\" a lot of the horror aspects of this book, either. Ho-hum, the Succubus is killing someone else now, next? This is the author's first novel, though, so maybe the next attempt will be better. Not a horrible book, but not compelling enough to take with me to finish on a plane."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it all!","review":"As a fan of the horror genre I am very often forced to sit through a book by a well known author that although has the major affect of scaring me out of my wits, rarely gets deep into my own personal life. Mr. Marano has succeeded where others have failed me!From the moment I picked this book up, I just couldn't put it down until I finished the story.The story of two Princes of Hell each trying to take over the world was as gripping as it was frightening, and left me wanting more from this author. His style of prose was just amazing.Of course the real good stuff is the emotional roller coaster you get the privilege to be on from almost page one!This book takes you everywhere, from sorrow to hopeful, and taking little pitstops at each emotion along the way.With characters I could really feel for, the struggle for Earth was just a beautiful mix of great insight and moments of pure suspense.Pick it up if you can, it's a great read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs a good editor","review":"Interesting concept, some interesting characters, but too much.

Move on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Damnation by Disjointure","review":"I enjoyed the storyline and charactor development. It should have been a 'good read' but was, for me, spoilt by cumbersome presentation and 'arty' expression. I was looking for a story which the theme promised but it got lost in the litteray world. Why can't these writers present ideas and thoughts simply? Complexity does not equate with 'quality'. I also deplore the trend of many a horror novel nowadays having to have a statutary gay component. What's wrong with a bit of plain old spine chilling with a touch of straight on the side?When I finished this story I was not desperately looking for another by the same author! Compare this to \\"The Stake' or \\"Crota' which where fun reads."},{"rating":"1","title":".....eh....","review":"it was well written and i probably would have enjoyed the plot had i been able to follow it. i lost interest before the end and lost the book...no sweat off my back. it was nothing special and it would probably be better going to the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, pointless, meandering","review":"Mr. Marano's story wanders...and wanders... and wanders. His characters don't interact, and their development is pointless. This book is fully 200 pages too long. How long can the demons of Hell just sit and stir to existence and still keep our attention? Not 250 pages! There are some good moments, such as the Succubus inhabiting the mouse, but they are few and far between. The premise of this novel was so very promising -- I was very excited to read it. And I was let down completely.

There's a lot of power and swirling guitars, and the melodies just knock you flat. Enigk's soaring tenor is at its most tremendous here.

Great CD.On another note, I think it's funny that a previous reviewer, Heidikakis from NY, lifted almost all of her(his?) review from pitchforkmedia.com...Why would someone do that?

William Goldsmith's drumming is amazing and his energy is not to be beat. Anyone who says that they're too quiet don't know anything about quality. This is quality few ever hear in music.They are talented and emotional and willing to experiment. More experiments with intense, emotional music will be on the next album. If you like this, check out Diary and the Pink Album."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Day That Sunny Day Died","review":"When I bought this album, I felt like crying. My favorite band, Sunny Day Real Estate, had reformed and I was thrilled. Then when I actually heard the CD, it was just a slap in the face. Sunny Day sounds nothing like they did in \\"Diary\\" or \\"LP2\\" anymore. They are more of a rather watered-down alternative rock. \\"Every Shining Time You Arrive\\" is definetely a great song, but there's no other song on the CD that would make you want to buy it. Let's face it...Sunny Day is dead, but what they did in their first two CDs makes them legendary."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm sorry","review":"This album is just plainly a dissapointment. Half the album is brilliant and the other half, well they should have just put this out as and e.p. with only half of the songs. Sure Pillars, Every shining time, and How it feels to be, are brilliant. But they are ruined by 100 million, Two Promises, and Roses in Water. I expected this to be their best album (after hearing Jeremy's solo album, which is a must buy) but it just turns out to studio, which means not that much emotion. Sure Jeremy is screaming, but there is nothing in his scream. Maybe Nate was more important than they'll admit. The emo is only slightly there and that is what they are EMO! Not alt-rock. Don't start with this one. Buy Diary, and hear what one of the most promising bands of all time used to sound like. Maybe they shouldn't have gotten back together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"This album was a huge disappointment for me. Buy diary.

If we hold this play in high regard, then we dramatist's need to reevaluate our standards. Chekhov wrote a play that will make you not care an inch about the character's or their situation(s). For him to think that this is a comedy makes you wonder if he understood the point he himself was trying to make. The characters are pathetic and they'll make you pity them - not because of their predicaments, but because of whom they are. I do not recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Timeless","review":"The Cherry Orchard was me first experience with Chekhov, and I was surprised at the depth in this 49 page play. By no means would I considered myself a \\"literary expert,\\" but this was very readable and you can pull a lot of the deeper meanings and its context in Russian history by yourself. I was confused at a couple people who write that the simply couldn't understand it and it put them to sleep! It's not THAT tough! If I could understand and appreciate it, almost anyone can!What I like most about Chekhov is that he doesn't simplify his characters. He's a realist in this sense. Lopahkin and Trophimof each have admirable and detestable characteristics, just like you and I. While it may be set in the tumultuous period prior to the Russian revolution, the ideas and the discussions this play provokes are timeless.Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Anton chekhov's \\"the cherry orchard\\" is captivating.","review":"Anton chekhov's \\"the cherry orchard\\" is a captivating, but somewhat confusing tale of an aristocratic household that comes face to face with adversity. His impressionistic portrayal of characters delivers a power packed package of meaning that both appeals to and appalls every human heart. Through a subtle messages and powerful passages chekhov purveys his sentiments about a world that is tainted by a dark cloud of selfishness. Although the play itself is tragic-like the characters are not tragic. They seem to blindly stumble upon the pages of life accomplishing absolutely nothing. Through checkhov's genius they still remain human, with dreams and fears like the rest of us. It is through these characters that chekhov's beliefs are made known."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is a very BRIEF! but very lucid and fun to read!","review":"You defintely can judge the book by its cover on this book. I really liked it a lot. I used this book as a reference tool to teach my philosophy/ethics class in college. This is defintely not for the serious philosophy student, but a very nice introduction to the ideas that dominated western thought throughout the Greek/Roman world that has come to us today. It also treats postmodernism, and the ideas that dominates today as well.

I am a former fundamentalist, so I might be expected to have an apostate's bias against fundamentalism, but these authors are not only inaccurate but almost comically biased. The authors claim that the fundamentalists' belief in the truth of the Bible is \\"borders on idolatry,\\" that fundamentalists are \\"often parasitic\\" and define themselves not by belief in their scriptures or truth, but by their opposition to \\"other approaches.\\" Instead of examining the mainstream Christian fundamentalist beliefs, the authors simply define all fundamentists as having \\"a totally closed world view,\\" and damn all fundamentalists by guilt through supposed association with the Ayatollah Khomeini, David Koresh and the Taliban.Lastly, the title is misleading, especially when sold in secular stores, as mine was.

There is another type that is steeper. They do connect, they are just not the same pitch.This is an excellent set to be able to get enough roof tiles to actually cover the roof of a house. It is a bit expensive, but it's not too easy to go about it any other way.The doors and windows are a very large scale. They're just fine, too, if you like this size.

Some disagree and think his vocals are TOO OTT but it all comes down to personal opinion. It's like a metal opera that is very dramatic. It can go from vengeance to a very emotional state from song to song and it takes you on a journey. You know those crazy Italians. They're intense in everything they do and it is all over this cd.

Penn and Fox give first class performances in the film not to mention the brilliant supporting cast. This film is far superior to others of the genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie is a disservice to Vietnam vets.","review":"In 1967 and 1968, I was squad leader in Vietnam in the 25th Infantry Division. This is yet another Hollywood movie that portrays Vietnam combat vets as perverts, and heartless killers. Nothing could be farther from the truth. War is brutal and ugly and the Vietnam War was no exception, but young Americans served honorably in Vietnam as Americans have in other wars. Yes, these things may have happened, but they were the exception and not the rule. It seems that most of the movies I've seen focus on the same negative themes. If you REALLY want to know what the war was like, the only DVD I could fully recommend is \\"Dear America, Letters Home from Vietnam\\". This DVD contains actual Vietnam War footage, which is mixed with letters home read by Tom Berenger, Robin Williams, Robert Deniro, Michael J. Fox, Martin Sheen and many others. Please see this video if you really want to begin to understand what combat vets experienced and how they conducted themselves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disturbing and Engrossing","review":"If you can ignore the stale acting by Michael J. Fox - and that's not that hard - you'll discover a terrifically powerful and wrenching Vietnam drama. More personal then most, and one of the few to offer up a believably rounded portrait of the Vietnamese. And, of course, Sean Penn is riveting. Directed by Brian DePalma, the movie has a graphic, pictorial forcefulness that recalls his work in \\"The Untouchables.\\" Not a hit when it was released, but well worth seeking out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Michael J Fox shines....","review":"This is Michael J Fox's at his best.

Sean Penns acting in this film will go down in history as one of the great and mighty pieces of overacting and caricature.

Due to death threats from the comrades he turned in for their crimes, he and his wife decided not to have children. At the time, they felt that the risk to their own lives and any family they might start were too great. Fortunately, nothing ever came of the threats, even after the rapists/murderers got out of prison. But this gentle, compassionate, loving couple was kept from having a family due to the shadow on their lives.American servicemen are just as guilty of such atrocities today. We've already seen stories of how they rape their own female comrades in Iraq and Afghanistan. No wonder the people whose countries we occupy hate the \\"Ugly Americans.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"the only movie to take American evil as its subject","review":"Brian De Palma took advantage of the post-Platoon glasnost to put this mini-My Lai centre-stage, and made Casualties of War the only Vietnam film to make American evil its subject. Though he softened its horrors after appalled previews, it was a flop, of course. No surprise to all non-Americans. An important movie, shunned by too many Americans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Land of Confusion","review":"Interesting film set in Vietnam brings up the whole issue of morality in war. Can morality exist in war? Is there such an animal? In such a graphic film depicting death, carnage and rape where does one draw the line? Penn is excellent as usual but Fox probably cast for his mere presence, as a character of virtue may be the real casualty here that diminishes the impact of the director's intentions. This film contains one of Ennio Morricone's best latter scores."},{"rating":"2","title":"War","review":"I think that stories like this happenes in the time of War .The only think is that we did not enjoy this moivie is thatyou can tell that Penn is acting especially during that rapescene where his face get all blushed .

But in the end I think thatits great and that one should give it a try"},{"rating":"2","title":"Painfully Good","review":"For many years I avoided Viet Nam era war movies. It seemed hollywood was never able to present a reasonable portrayal of the period. This movie never seemed to grope with that problem. I've read reviews of this film that criticize Fox's acting (both his ability and style), trying to say he's no different in this film than in his prior comedy roles. Nothing could be further from the truth. Fox delivers a powerful yet believeable performance in Casualties of War. He becomes a seasoned combat soldier while at the same time retaining his humanity. I will also agree with other reviewers who have pointed out that this movie is one that leaves you feeling drained but remains one to keep because it is full of emotional content, superb acting, and a well told tale."},{"rating":"2","title":"good vietnam flick","review":"casualties of war showed us the meaning of the title! m.fox did a great job in this one!if you like war storys,this one should be in the top ten list!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great purchase","review":"Great encyclopedia for a researcher.

I liked Xenogears, I liked music by Mitsuda. But this album combined the Xenogears songs and the magnitude of Mitsuda's work into a rather lively, fluid, and beautifully rendered celtic-themed album. All the songs from first track to last is filled with celtic-style renditions of the game's songs at their best. And all the low-quality midi voices you heard in the game has been turned into a glorious vocal performance on this album. Every tune seemed to have a life of its own, making this album have a unique personality.

Since my patent leather shoe days, I've been widowed (young), lost my father (young), raised six children...no heartache or challenge has been too great, as I have been comforted and strengthened by this two thousand year old faith Gina Cascone so glibly dismisses.

If you don't believe, then the book will look silly. If you do believe, then the book will make your beliefs look silly. Kind of a no-win situation. I found it boring.But, more importantly, can we stop publishing books in which \\"suspense\\" is created and maintained by telling the story from two or three perspectives, then breaking up these stories into three-page fragments?I swear, I almost grabbed a razor blade and cut the book up so that I could reassemble it into a coherent narrative."},{"rating":"2","title":"Is the Pope Catholic?","review":"The Third Secret is a timely piece of fiction by Steve Berry. The book is about alleged appearances by the Virgin Mary throughout the last 100 years. Father Colin Michener, the Papal Secretary, is brought into a potential conspiracy by his mentor, Pope Clement. We find that there has been a conspiracy by past Popes to cover up a part of \\"The Third\\" Secret\\", which is part of a Marian appearance. This secret part would allegedly contradict present church doctrine.This is a nice work of fiction, based on a good bit of truth. If you like Dan Brown, you will enjoy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sigh","review":"I wish the Catholic bashing would stop; perhaps a way to do so would be a real 3rd secret. I finished this book just because I took it as total fantasy. If you put aside all the preconceptions about doctrine, Catholic history, etc., and are willing to just go for a ride without expecting the thing to make \\"Catholic sense,\\" the book can actually be rather enjoying in its plot. Of course, the actual 3rd secret (which has been revealed by everyone reviewing the book here) is ludicrous, but entertaining if you can set aside everything else. So it's what you expect; a Steve Berry novel, which has its own universe. You should expect to get what you know you are buying from this author, nothing more."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment and, in the end, a waste of time","review":"I kept reading past the midpoint of the book, hoping that this was not going to be another liberal-inspired jab at the Catholic church. But, as the end wore on, sure enough all of the liberal jargon found its way in to the final chapters, pro-choice, homosexuality is OK, female priests, married priests. This is suppose to be a novel, but I hate to see an author play fast and loose with factual history to satisfy a political motive. This book is a waste of time. My first Steve Berry read, and my last."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"This book is rife with misconceptions about the Catholic Church and is a disappointing read for anyone with even the slightest understanding of marian apparitions. The suspense builds until finally, near the end of the book, the missing portion of the \\"third secret of Fatima\\" is revealed. The problem is that the missing portion of the secret is preposterous and unbelievable, making the climax of the book a disappointment.I am surprised that best-selling author Steve Berry would produce a book that is so poorly researched. He has lost credibility with me and I will never read another of his books.Beyond betraying the author's ignorance of the Catholic Church, the book was poorly edited and had many typos. At one point, the name of even one of the main characters was misspelled!While many would find the book's suspense compelling, I thought reading it was a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't Finish It...","review":"I began reading Steve Berry's books in order. The first two were fine. The Third Secret was just absurd. I got almost to the end and just gave up. Very rarely will I not finish a book once I get into it. I can overlook some implausability and use my imagination when reading, but this was just too far. I thought Dan Brown's Demons & Angels was pretty farfetched at the end, but The Third Secret is even worse. I am not particularly religious, so it wasn't that I was offended by the book. I stopped reading Mr. Berry's books for quite some time after this book. I finally decided to pick up with his next book, which is much better so far.I recommend this author, in general, for some light, entertaining reading, but skip this installment."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm weary of Berry's re-writes of Christianity","review":"I've now read all of Berry's books and although I mostly enjoyed the story lines, I progressively grew weary of how Berry re-writes his own version of Christianity into each one. I realize this is fiction, but each story seemed to try harder to change some truths about Christianity. I read The Third Secret last, and finally have decided to stop reading Berry's books. Writing about Mary, the mother of Jesus, visiting the earth and telling us that heaven approves of homosexuality and that abortion is just fine if that's what the mother wants??? I realize that not everyone believes the Bible. But if you do, these two issues are clearly defined as sin. Interesting that in his \\"Writer's Note\\" at the end of the book, he discusses what is fact and what is fiction...but absolutely fails to mention his own fictional words he put into the mouth of Mary. Decent story until this ficticious third secret is revealed."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Third Secret","review":"Awaiting the new Dan Brown novel, left me in search of similar fare. Thank you Steve Berry. Sure, there are some flaws in his historical facts and characterizations, but it is still an intelligent read. There is also plenty of action for those readers who enjoy a fast-paced novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fans of Da Vinci Code will enjoy...","review":"Let's face it, most of these books are getting a bad rap. Everything is being compared to Dan Brown's Da Vinci Code. While certainly and unarguably the best religious thriller around, Steve Berry, no doubt, delivers a first-rate action packed thriller. This will keep you on the edge of your seat. A must read if you are searching for the next best religious mystery!"},{"rating":"2","title":"recommended","review":"I don't know much about Pope Clement XV, the Vatican, and the Church, but I was completely satisfied after reading this novel.

A quick read that keeps the pages turning. I enjoy these books immensely - but this particular book is a little far fetched for me with heavenly appartitions and such.Having siad that, it is great entertainment, and provides enough interesting historical tidbits that it remains classic Berry and a good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't normally write reviews of books I didn't finish, but...","review":"... the first dozen or so pages are crammed chock-a-block with most every anti-Catholic cliche you can think of. I didn't continue to find the rest of them. It's as if the world-changing reign of John Paul the Great had never happened. I know it's only a thriller, but I just didn't buy the set-up, YMMV."},{"rating":"1","title":"Far-fetched","review":"I enjoyed Berry's two other novels, despite reading reviews which complained that both books were too far-fetched and improbable. I do not mind suspending reality to read a book or to watch a movie, but this book took things a little too far! I am Catholic, and maybe that is why I found Berry's third secret revealed at Fatima and subsequently hidden by the Church too unbelieveable. There were several parts to the secret, and if Berry would have limited its scope, the book would have been more compelling and believeable. The portion of the secret that deals with motherhood is just totally improbable and Berry just goes too far with it. Also, it is too trite that the villian in the novel is always able to figure out the protagonist's next step. This book starts off well, but attempts to accomplish too much, which makes it difficult for the reader to suspend reality and enjoy the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Build-up for Nothing","review":"If you don't mind the liberal propaganda and the way Berry totally ignores any Scripture that contradicts his agenda, you may enjoy this book. It is a page-turner. However, when the third secret is finally revealed, it is quite anti-climatic after all the build-up it was given. I was expecting something apocolyptic and got the Democratic platform for social policy instead. Conservative Catholics and all Christians who happen to believe the Bible is true will find the book offensive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing Electrifying about this Secret","review":"Father Michener is plagued with worry for his dear friend and mentor Pope Clement XV.Clement is concerned with a starling secret that is hidden in the archives of the Vatican.

No, the only reason why I kept turning pages was because I was highly expecting a blow out a secret to end all secrets but once reveled I was sorely let downInsights on the Vatican was nothing more than the writers own opinion which makes this book a decent fiction read , one that you can take on a long airplane trip to pass away the timeblah"},{"rating":"2","title":"Weak Ending, but I would recommend this book.","review":"It was a good read. Weak ending. I've read worst. His other two books had better endings, however, up until the end it was good. The history lesson was useful. I would buy this book again.

It's political entanglements and characters mirrors our contemporary world. He weaves a highly interesting combination of clerical fidelity, celibacy controversy, love story,and church politics with an overarching mystery thriller. Definitely a fast read and worthwhile ride."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh","review":"To preface: I am not religious and I am politically liberal. This book was terrible! The beginning was up to par with all the rest of the novels you can pick up at the grocery store, which warrants a couple of stars, but the ending was terrible! The third secret was just a bunch of the author's political views shoved into the mouth of the Virgin Mary. I was disappointed that I read three-quarters of a book's worth of build-up only to have such a ridiculous climax."},{"rating":"1","title":"3rd Secret is a waste of time","review":"True the first 64 chapters are an interesting read but then you get to the end of Chapter 65 and finally read the Third Secret of Fatima you waited all these pages to see you want to toss this book in the trash! I finished it today and I couldnt help but think this author finished the entire book and then inserted a few paragraphs of very badly written political agenda items and attributed them to the Virgin Mary. You honestly go huh?? They are so out of place and farfetched. Dont waste your money. Its not 1/1000000th as good as the Da Vinci Code."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disapointing stumble","review":"I had looked forward to this book, as I enjoyed \\"The Romanov Prophecy\\" as a fun summer read. Unfortunately, Berry's allowed his religious and social views to turn his latest book into a screed. The hero's antagonist is a cardinal that believes in priestly celibacy and other traditional Catholic dogma, which makes him not merely wrong-headed but a scheming, blackmailing, cartoon villain who does everything but twirl his mustache as he ties the heroine to railroad tracks. The \\"secret\\" that Barry's concocted is intended to be \\"provocative\\" in the model of \\"The Da Vinci Code,\\" but instead the revelation manages to be both hilarious and (there's no other word for it) blasphemous at once. Save your time and your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Third Secret: A Novel of (not that much) suspense","review":"The Third Secret is another entry in the Vatican intrigue genre. It has the usual elements: Vatican conservatives the usual bad guys vs liberal Catholics the usual good guys. The \\"Third Secret\\" refers to secret revelations given to Marian visionaries at such places as Fatima and Medjugorge, the existence of which is historical fact. If there is any suspense in the novel, it is not with the plot which is remarkably predictable and derivative. The only thing that kept my interest was waiting to find out the actual content of the third secret(s), at least according to the novel's author. In the end, these proved to be rather predictable too, given the author's religious inclinations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak Work In The Style Of Angels & Demons Or The Da Vinci Code","review":"How many stories can intrigue in Catholic Church spawn?Berry tries to imitate Dan Brown (which is also, admittedly, his own basic style) but he really falls flat with this work.Stock characters: a moderate dying pope, a somewhat secret liberal investigating priest, a conservative Catholic powerful priest/villan who is willing to murder to achieve his aims.It all culminates in a real religious \\"truth\\" that shows that the powerful interests in the Church have really been working against the true will of God (in this case through various Marian appearances) for decades.Not to be a spoiler, but the ultimate \\"secret\\" wasn't all that exciting either. My own personal views are pretty much in line with Berry's so this is far from a political statement. It just wasn't that much from a thriller perspective.This one can be given a pass. The lackluster plot sinks this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Smooth Ride thru Vatican & \\"Proof\\" of God..!","review":"An aging German pope sends our hero, Michener, on a mission to find the true hidden secrets of the message given by the Virgin to the children of Fatima in 1917. Meanwhile the Pope's Secretary, a scoundrel of the highest order, has his sights set on his life long ambitions of becoming the next pope. In a breathless search through medieval papal archives and to Bosnia, the site of the latest Mary apparition, we are led to a nifty grand finale, as all the pieces fit together to a final \\"Proof\\" of the Virgin's Mary's Reality, and God's existence as well. This is a lively ride thru Church/ Papal history with interesting characters and settings to match, and I admit I breezed right thru!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Scandelous and Preposterous!!!!!!","review":"And I am a recovering Catholic now Episcopalian! Also,a registered Democrat with moderate to liberal views!Part of the argument we on the religous \\"left\\" as it were have with those on the far religous \\"right\\" is that they seem to want everything clearly outlined and defined. Like taking the bible verbatim. With the exception of the ten comandments when was anything said in the Bible or by Jesus as clear as a bell??????That is we, on the left think the Bible was divine inspiration not divine dictation. There is just no way the Mother of God would clearly say all the things the 3rd secret is suppose to reveal and so clearly in the syntax of the day now in the 21st century!!!!!It was an interesting point that the author had Clement be a pope of German birth and the book was probably started long before Benedict's election. The stuff on St. malachy's predictions was interesting too althought probably a fraud."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong Hero","review":"This book was, according to various sources, written in 1999, so it is hardly intruding on Brown territory esp in regard to the book Angels and Demons, which also deals with the election of a Pope. Compared to the Brown books its lowkey version of events makes it actually rather effective. Unfortunately it ends up making the same mistake as the Brown book, its villains turn out more worthy of sympathy than its heroes. In particular the Cardinal Alberto Valendrea, who Barry is determined to paint as such a scoundrel, won my admiration far more than the unhappy Colin Mitchner and his colorless girlfriend. Both the Father and the Cardinal are contesting over the content of the lost Third Secret of Fatima, which in this reviewer's opinion might as well have stayed lost. The book's a good airport read, but there's little of serious import about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reviews by Nan Kilar and Bobby Miller","review":"The author states this is a fictional work with some incidents and characters based on historical fact. As a non-Catholic, I found the book very interesting; die-hard Catholics might be offended by it.Colin Michener is the papal secretary to his mentor and pope, Clement XV. Clement keeps returning to the private papal archives more and more because something bothers him. He sends Colin on a journey that leads him to more and more trouble and mystery. Clement's archrival Alberti Valendrea, papal secretary of state, and his accomplice, Paolo Ambrosi, do nothing to promote peace and harmony...just death and a return to the dark ages of the church. The third secret reveals surprising directives that popes have been ignoring for years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Suspenseful Novel","review":"Let me begin by saying this novel is in no way similar to the DaVinci Code as teased on the cover. However, it is a good suspenseful story that made it hard for me to put down. Although fictional, the story is built around a number of true facts. I enjoyed the author's very visual descriptions of locale and scenery. I also liked the characters. However, I did find Ambrosi a little hard to believe that he could have elevated to such a high position in the church, but this is fiction. The writing has me interested in reading other works by this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Author: do homework","review":"It is difficult to understand why this book has been rated so highly.The place where the Pope spends the Summer is spelled incorrectly throughout.

Trivializes current political / social / religous arguments to an insulting degree."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Ending","review":"The book was suspenceful throughout and I enjoyed it so much that I could not wait to get back to it, but the ending was less than satisfying and boardered on \\"corny\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"In the Trash When I Finished","review":"This is one of those books that leaves you feeling as though you have had several hours of your life stolen from you, and sadly will never get the time back. The characters in the book do not keep in character. Not many pious devout priests would just decide to fornicate and not feel any guilt,or overnight completely lose faith. Berry did a reasonably good job of researching the Marian apparitions, and Vatican terminology, but he knows absolutely nothing of Catholic theology. Shame on whatever Catholic schools \\"educated\\" him. They failed. As another reviewer aptly put it, the ending was so blasphemous that it was almost humorous. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great factual read","review":"Great factual read. Very similar to dan Browne style novel. If you like dan Browne you'll love Steve berets well written to the point novel. Great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"third secret","review":"Steve Berry has become one of my favourite authors. The Third Secret does not disappoint, Get ready for a thrilling ride."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good but frustrating","review":"This book deals with the ever fascinating subject of prophesies, the vatican church, and corrupt officials. The book does not have a good grip on the suspense it tries to create, but actually aggravates the reader, and frustrates him. The plot is different from the usual 'Da Vinci Code' type books, but it could have been handled much more efficiently. In all, this book is good for reading, but is definitely not a keeper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Intriguing but EXTREMELY disappointing.","review":"The Third Secret follows the typical suspense/thriller model. It is adequately interesting to keep one reading. The early pages filled with interesting bits of information about the Vatican's history. However, (And I won't give away the secret) at about page 350, the book takes a dive. Steve Berry apparently thinks that no one will object when he shoves in his personal views on divisive church issues. But whether you agree with him or not, the revelation is completely unwarranted. I suppose Berry was trying to set his religious thriller in the same vein as Dan Brown's \\"heretical\\" books. In the end the book devolves into a treastise of Berry's personal views, presented in a way that debate is impossible. That added to the absolutely deplorable behavior by the story's protagonists (which Berry makes no attempt to challenge) makes this book a disappointing read at best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting","review":"As a Catholic I guess I could be offended by the \\"third secret\\",however I chose to believe that most of the church standings on most issues are man made, not God inspired. I remember as child waiting anxiously for the revelation of the \\"third secret\\", when it was announced by John Paul 11 I was disappointed, I expected more........and that is how the story goes.I have read all 3 of Steve Berry's books and this is by far his best. But before you get all bent out of shape this, this is just a story, a work of fiction. I really enjoyed it and lovers of historical fiction will too."},{"rating":"1","title":"offensive to Christians","review":"Each to his own taste, but I wish I'd read some of the negative reviews here before I wasted time and money on this book. The only \\"secret\\" revealed in this book is the author's personal, overt political pro abortion and gay marriage agenda. Seriously, if you are a Christian, do yourself a favor and just skip this ridiculous attempt to make fun of your Christian beliefs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Read","review":"This is the second Steve Berry novel I have read, and this was certainly better than the Amber Room. The plot is intriguing and the story held my interest through the end of the novel.The downside to this novel is that the Third Secret isn't all that shocking, and for the second straight novel, there's a five letter word to describe the personality of the lead female character. Is Berry a misogynist or was he going through a divorce while drafting these novels?Also, the antagonists are almost cartoonish. How or why did these individuals become priests in the first place?"},{"rating":"1","title":"The \\"Politically-Correct\\" Secret","review":"I truly enjoyed a good portion of this book. I read it quickly because I couldn't wait to find out what the Third Secret was. But, I was so disappointed. The secret revealed by the Virgin turns out to be liberal, politically-correct nonsense. I could barely finish the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The absolute worst....","review":"I have never been so disappointed with a book. This one had some real potential, it actually kept me interested (not engrossed) through the first half. That's when things started going down hill - and fast.This one went straight into the garbage when I finished it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"You have got to be kidding","review":"The book was pretty well written, but is typical in that the conservatives are the evil ones and the liberals are the good guys. How tiresome that plotline is!! But the unforgivable sin is the third secret. It is just plain stupid. Any one who knows anything about Catholicism will just laugh off the third secret. It is just wishful thinking by people who want their Catholicism in the cafeteria style. I stopped reading it after that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yet another anti-Catholic propagandist has surfaced","review":"It is sad that the author undermines what could be a legitimate plot and wastes no time to subdue it by pushing his personal anti- Catholic, pro-abortion agenda, in the most offensive of terms."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit unbelievable","review":"This book targets some very political issues right at the heart of the Catholic church and then (here's the unbelievable part) one of the Cardinals engages one of the priests to kill other priests to maintain the status quo and ultimately become pope.

I felt he tried too hard and the story was not as interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Truth\\"","review":"The characters in Berry's novel seem to be computer generated, as does the story itself. Once again, the evil Catholic Church has hidden the \\"truth\\" from a blind & stupid laity, who must be recued by the liberal elite. Those priests, bishops & nuns who have failed to live up to their vows due to their exclusive knowledge of what \\"Truth\\" is, i.e. \\"situational\\".Berry quotes extensively from scripture in this piece of work. He even quotes a scripture that makes his whole story just plain silly. \\"What you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven & what you bind on earth, will be bound in heaven.\\" Guess he overlooked that one because, after all, most of us loyal to the Church, are too dumb & blind to \\"catch it\\". I'm an old woman now, so I'll just stick to my ongoing conversations with Jesus through the Eucharist, the rosary, & just plain \\"listening\\".

The first two thirds of the book was written well. The book bviously puts the Catholic church in a very bad light. The mysterious untold portion of the third secret (which is what keeps you reading the book) was so bizaar and completely rediculous that it blew away any semblance of believability that the reader may have had up to that point. What a severe let down. Fiction of this type has to retain some trace of believablity even to the end.

As a fallen-away Catholic, he probably did his research by listening to the lies and misconceptions promulgated in anti-Catholic websites and chat rooms. It is very clear that Steve Berry has major conflicts with the doctrine and rules of the Catholic Church and justifies his leaving the Church by writing about how horrible and evil it is.I was unable to go through much of the book because of the overwhelming anti-Catholic bias. This novel is just one more of the many novels that will be used by anti-Catholic bigots in their attacks on Catholics and Catholicism. Don't spend your money on this garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"predictable vactican thriller","review":"while this plot line may have some twists and turns that have a newer spin, this book isn't \\"new\\" in terms of a fast paced thriller. Mr. Berry does keep the reader engaged, but with so many other books on the market with similiar plot lines centering around the Church, well, one can see the ending before it actually happens. The characters are pretty much stererotypical, the woman hard-boiled woman who has lost her faith and so forth and then the \\"love interest\\".However, if you need a good read on the plane or while traveling, pick it up!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't live up to its potential. . .","review":"The Third Secret is a very good story; unfortunately its written in a mediocre manner. The plot is shallow and poorly developed and at times, obvious. Its more akin to the work of an amateur than a published author. Although Berry seems to have stumbled while penning this work, the editor has badly let the reader down; errors in prose, style and consistency are too numerous to mention.I suggest those who wish to read Berry's work wait for the paperback edition or visit their public library. The Third Secret is a poor waste of hard earned wages."},{"rating":"1","title":"the third secret","review":"I enjoyed berry's novel,The Amber Room, and thought this would be worth reading. It wasn't!! The plot was well done,but when it came to the revelation of the \\"secret\\", I moaned and wanted to toss the book across the room. What a letdown!! I literally laughed out loud and thought just another liberal minded person wrote this book. Very disappointing"},{"rating":"2","title":"INTERESTING WHAT IF NOVEL","review":"What if the third secret of the miracle of Fatima would upset the Catholic Church as we know it? That is the premise of Steve Berry's take on Vatican politics, papal infallacy and faith itself. Some Catholics may take much offense at the way the pope and the cardinals are portrayed, as truly there are some evil ones in this book. There is blackmail, murder, lies and deception and the overall portrait of the church is certainly not a pretty one. Father Colin Michener, who is secretary to Pope Clement XIV is sent on a mysterious mission to uncover the facts behind Marian visitations. He is joined by an old lover, an atheist reporter named Katherine Lew, and finds himself in danger at every turn. Much information is given on the miracle at Fatima and the mechanism behind the election of a new Pope. The writing is good and the plot holds your interest. Issues of celibacy, homosexuality, abortion are all addressed. A thought provoking if somewhat disturbing read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Borrowed plot + absurd conclusion = Big Disappointment","review":"Being a big fan of the genre, I had read quite a few of Steve Berry's books and enjoyed them up to this point. But after reading The Third Secret, I will never read another Steve Berry book again.The plot line borrowed significantly from the likes of Dan Brown in his DaVinci Code and Angels & Demons books without providing anything original besides a ludicrous conclusion. When I finally arrived at the conclusion that is so terrible it felt like I got punked by Berry, I physically threw the book down in disgust.I have never read such a terrible book in my life.Goodbye Steve Berry!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My review","review":"I am a big Steve Berry fan and have read all of his books.

Homosexuality is O.K. 4. Abortion is O.K. So much more could have been done with this book.

As soon as I was finished I drove over to my parents house to give it to them to read!There are some many mysteries surrounding the sightings of Mary, the mother of Jesus and putting them into this book with its conspiracy plot was magic. Although it puts some aspects of the Catholic Church in a bad light (and I'm Catholic), it is a work of fiction to be enjoyed on that level!

If you think pyramid schemes are funny or if you are a big fan of the Shank then you will love this movie. I admit it is low budget and straight to DVD but it is funnier than a lot of big budget blockbuster comedies that I have seen. Phiffer does a great job in his role as the big business entrepenuer. The plot is original and there are some really hilarious scenes. If you think about it, there are some parts of the film that really ring true. I grew up only seeing the TV edited version of the Shank and didn't know about the rape scene(Which is an important part of the plot) until much later when I saw the unedited version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amusing, worth seeing for free","review":"We were able to see this DVD for free, which is an appropriate price for a silly movie based on the adventures of two stoners. Their goal is to watch THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION and start their own business based on an infomercial. They enter rehab to see the TV, get caught up in some other crime, basically wander around. There are one or two very funny scenes, one that I found extremely disturbing and offensive, and a happy, if implausible, ending.If you already have pay channels and it's on, or if someone else offers to lend it to you, it's not a total waste of time, but don't spend money to see it."},{"rating":"1","title":"this movie sucks","review":"Just got done watching it and...yeah, pretty horrible. There were a few moments that made me slightly chuckle, but that's about it for the laughs department.

I was very pleasantly surprised with the clever design, humor, and fun colorful illustrations drawn by 'Dilly'. It is really aimed at older children (maybe 7-11), especially the humor which is right on for that age. It is great for younger kids too if you don't mind your 4 year picking up expressions like 'gross me out' and 'punky' (which are now common expressions in our house). My daughter is an early reader and this book motivates her to read independently or at least pore over the pictures a lot. I look forward to the sequel re. Dilly's camping experiences."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extreme Disappointment","review":"Don't purchase one of these - their are better options at Amazon.The first one (which was shipped very promptly) refused to accept a charge after a day or so.

In Expendable, he has created a new and exciting universe peopled by characters who breathe and live between the pages. Some aspects of this book were predictable. However, it is still a page turner.I found it interesting that he wrote this book from the viewpoint of a female. It is written in first person perspective.The book is also a study of human nature and behavior. It has some funny bits, some poignant bits and a lot of great imagery. This is an excellent book. Honestly, it is one of the best \\"first\\" books I have read.Right after this book, I read \\"Commitment Hour\\" also by this author. Gardner's second book, it is also well worth checking out, if you can get past the premise. I'll also write a review about that book."},{"rating":"1","title":"two dimensional characters and plot","review":"This book has a novel premise and that's about it. This might have made a good short story, but as a novel it is completely uninspiring. The characters are all cardboard cutouts who inspire no empathy. The plot consists of one unbelievable deus ex machina turn after another. The contrived mini-chapters with the giveaway titles are annoying. The natives of the planet Melaquin have no depth or ingenuity behind them. Don't bother with this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very, VERY good book","review":"EXPENABLE I thought was a very good book. I normally don't like science fiction but James Alan Gardner is a very good author. EXPENDABLE is truly one of the best books I've ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing and naive","review":"Basically I agree with John Clute's assessment of this novel. Mr. Gardner is a fine writer, but has a knack for using really dumb sociobiological explanations. Let us hope he has mulled through consequences when writing COMMITMENT HOUR. He deserves another chance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strong beginning, but..","review":"The first few chapters were original in content and writing style. I was intrigued and reading on in hopes of high \\"original\\" adventure. Alas, the author quickly ran out of his promising creativeness and the book turned into an amalgam of other sci-fi books. It felt like reading Ringworld meshed in with some others. My interest was lost and I skimmed through the latter two thirds of the book without losing much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hurray for a protagonist such as Festina Ramos!","review":"I found this book by luck; it was misplaced on a bookstore shelf. First, I liked the use of a person of color as the protagonist: someone who just happens not to be white. Second, I found the planet Melaquin, and its native inhabitants, uniquely intriguing. The only part I found difficult to buy is her \\"deformity.\\" I, too, am a woman with a port-wine stain on my face, and I've never thought of it as a deformity. I've never tried to hide it. Perhaps hers (I can't recall) was over more of her face than mine. Nevertheless, I was sorry to get to the end of the book. It gave me the same kind of strong-woman-on-a-harrowing- adventure-pleasure as the movie \\"Aliens 2\\" did. I want more of same."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice.","review":"This book surprised me. For being one of Gardner's first books, its a great one. He tosses around tons of different concepts and ideas with ease. He paints a vivid picture of of a universe in which \\"The Technocracy\\" regulates lifeform's behavior by eliminating all of the non-sentients. This in it's self makes for some pretty interesting rules. In this story, the main characters must not only deal with these rules, but also bend them. And the way that happens mixes a recipe that isn't your typical sci-fi fare.Very interesting stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Let's hear it for the ECM!","review":"I've known Jim for a while now. And I suppose that might colour my impression of this, his first published full-length novel. Fortunately, it doesn't need to.This is a wonderful book. The characters are believable. The story is fluid and while there are number of things that aren't explained (no Trek physics! Yay!), it isn't necessary for you to understand how FTL works or YouthBoost...noteven the folks in the story understand it.Festina Ramos, our heroine, is a real person. Not in the sense that she exists in our reality...I don't know if she does or not, nor, in the long run, do I need to. But in this story, she's alive and real and very full of that vitality that makes you care about someone.Read this book. Really. If you like SF. If you like strong, believable characters. If you want to kill a day reading.Just go read it. It's worth it, for whatever you're looking for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clever, very clever","review":"This book has a clever plot, a clever story and is very, very witty. The book consists of sections of one or two pages, at most, which simultaneously tell the story, give insight on how the main character thinks, and provide a witticism of some sort. At first it annoyed me, as I prefer a more continuous prose, and the witticisms were making it hard for me to concentrate on the story. :-) But this book is so good that this soon ceased to be of any importance.This is very good science fiction. If you like science fiction in general, you'll like this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Liz has just got it!!!","review":"WOW!!! Liz keeps you rockin' with guitar licks and a great voice.

As usual, he is skilled not only in making science concepts comprehensible but bringing into vivid detail the *story* of science -- how we know what we know. It even includes the occasional philosophical discussion.So why the low rating? Because this book is twenty years old. I had assumed that the reprint would maybe have some updated material, but it doesn't. This is effectively a book on the State of Cosmology circa 1983.Don't waste your money on this. Ferris's own Whole Shebang is better written and more up to date. You might also check out Lonely Hearts of the Cosmos, which is a very similar book but far better and has been updatee for the most recent discoveries.

It starts out okay, but as you go along, it just becomes what other reviewers have noted - a very opinionated, biased piece. But even more than that, the book stops reading as history and more as narrative mishmash of events with the ever present biased commentary.I hate putting books down once started but it took me the better part of two years to get to the end of this. I could only take a few pages at a time and then I'd have to set it aside for a while.Anyway, all I can say is this was a major disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was this written in the 1970s?","review":"I recently read Theodore White's books on the Presidential campaigns of 1960, 64, 68 and 72. I was thinking this book would be a good read to keep going in chronological order... I don't want to quit reading too soon but the book has a tone that makes me wonder if it was written in the 1970s.. It is incredibly dated and the author appears to me to be clearly pushing a very conservative viewpoint. He seems to be selective in what he talks about and does quite a bit of editorializing. Don't think I am going to bother finishing it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly Recommended!","review":"The best thing about this book is that it quotes extensively and piquantly from the writings and speeches of Jack Welch. The intriguing list of \\"29 leadership secrets\\" (which could have been reduced to ten) is more selective than secret, given that Welch has been preaching them loudly from a very prominent platform for more than 20 years. However, the book will be valuable to Welch neophytes and to fans who want more Jack, or the essence of Jack. Author Robert Slater assumes a certain familiarity with GE's history and initiatives, and sometimes refers to them without explanation. Welch long ago transcended management to become sort of a leadership prophet, and his utterances are sometimes paradoxical, if not contradictory. He says nurture people, but downsize; he says cut bureaucracy, but implement a paperwork intensive Six Sigma program. We promise that somewhere in here, you'll find a managerial principle to fit almost any occasion. What more can you ask of a handbook?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Royal Kiss","review":"Overall A Royal Kiss was pretty good. It shows you how anormal girl can meet the boy of her dreams.

With this new system coming upon us I feel that when things that won't work on your old TV should state that it would be obsolete after a few weeks. I'm a senior and had no idea that this would or could happen. However, the service and cooperation of all was superb. The customer from whom I dealt with was so friendly and helpful and gracious as well as Amazon themselves. No complaints!!!

About 2 months ago, the hardware stopped working and I called Tivo. They told me that the warranty had expired and that I was on my on to buy a new one (no discounted replacement). So I bought a second series 2 at full price, and then recently found out that it is not supported by the NetFlix movies on demand service. Tivo told me that I could upgrade to a Tivo HD but, again, I would have to do this at full price. So the bottom line is that Tivo doesn't provide any discounted upgrade options for customers.

If you are NOT using a Cable or Satellite box, chances are you will NOT get surround sound from this device.I was running the coax cable directly into the TiVo, with the outputs going directly to the A/V processor, similar to my VCR and TV. My VCR and TV are both producing surround sound. The TiVo was only able to send a 2 channel signal.I spent almost 2 hours on the phone with TiVo customer support and they were not able to help and just continued to claim that TiVo supports surround. However, on TiVo's own website in the customer forum, I found dozens of entries with issues supporting surround.This appears to be a design flaw."},{"rating":"1","title":"TIVO","review":"The TIVO arrived in good condition and was easly to install.

It didn't record all of the shows we set up and sometimes you couldn't access the shows that it did record. It has been wonderful using our new TiVo!! It has been 100% reliable with recording and playing shows. With our wireless adapter, TiVo connected easily with our computer, where we can access our digital movies, images, etc.The TiVo on-screen menu is very user-friendly and there are plenty of videos from TiVo to help get you acquainted with many of its features.

I REALLY felt taken for a ride on this, as they referred to it as a \\"service plan\\"-- well, I don't have a \\"service plan\\" on my oven, and it works just fine.

Tivo did not notify customers and have not addressed the issues on their web page. Soooooo.....save yourselves a whole lot of headaches and hair pulling. Don't buy this unit. Also consider before you buy the upgraded models with cable card readers....because I have researched this and have found that there are lots of problems with the cable cards. You have to have your cable company install them, which you will be charged for and there is a monthly fee for the cards. When I called and cancelled my Tivo service, the rep offered me an upgrade model for $99.00.....this should have been an upfront offer to all of those, like myself who purchase the Series 2 dual tuners with the good faith that the service would always be available. Shame on Tivo!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tivo is much better than your cable company's DVR","review":"Tivo is a great service and well worth the extra costs compared to the cable or satellite company DVR. It works well, is reliable, and will truly change the way you watch tv. The downside to all this is that most Tivo boxes (except for the expensive Series3) all rely on analog cable connections. This will be a problem in the future, as cable companies move away from analog systems and to digital systems. (Of course, there are work-arounds, but they aren't very elegant or cost effective). As long as you know this limitation, and that the future of the Tivo Series2 is limited - it's the best thing since sliced bread and well worth every penny!"},{"rating":"2","title":"TIVO ROCKS!","review":"After using a DVR from the cable company that was \\"state of the art,\\" I yelled: GIVE ME BACK MY TIVO!\\" Tivo is the easiest, most user friendly, wonderful experience anywhere!

I can not get Tivo to work with the wireless adapter I bought from Tivo specifically for my Tivo make and model. It works 10 minutes out of 24 hours on any given day.

However, eventhough it was easy to hook up, as soon as it was it started conflicting with our HD channels and it messed up our sound. Also, it goes on rampages taping shows at random and quickly filling up the given 80 hrs. I figured the sound problem was probably just loose audio wires which I checked time and time again. I called the tech support where I waited on hold for almost an hour then they told me that sometimes the audio feed would fragment and they offered to replace the Tivo if I shipped it back in its original box... More effort than its worth.. Should've gotten the Charter DVR. I dont recommend this product if you have a cable box."},{"rating":"1","title":"The point of Tivo escapes me!!","review":"I bought this so I could share movies and vids from my computer to the tivo and play them on our TV. You still need to pay for a monthly subscription thou. You also need to pay for some software to enable you to do it.

I did not purchase it for the TIVO system, but to use it solely as a DVR hooked to my computer. Consequently I had to purchase the yearly service of $129.00 just to be able to use it for my purpose which I feel is unfair. I did not choose to send it back due to the shipping costs of returning it and also that they allow you to use it for two weeks without purchasing the service. I didn't hook it up right away due to being on vacation when it arrived. I was too close to being over the return point as well. I feel it was unfair to advertise this product without foreclosing the fact that to use it simpley as a DVR you still need to purchase the high cost of TIVO."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not all that it is cracked up to be!","review":"TiVo, when new is a great toy. But after the first year I questioned it's worth before renewing the subscription. What did it do? It copied programs, provided a program schedule, provided speed control Slowmo etc. and would record shows following what you choose. If you have cable or satellite you already have a program guild and after a few months of use I turned off the selective recording, ask it to record football and any program with foot and ball gets recorded and in less than a week your 80gig is clogged. So I let the service lapse figuring that I could record the programs manually, if there was ever any over time it always cut it off. Well no, if you do not subscribe that function is turned off and your TiVo unit becomes a boat anchor. No if I decide to get into the DVR market again I will use the Satellite of Cable DVR, same functionality for the same about the same fee and I don't have to pay hundreds of dollars for a boat anchor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tivo 2 dt","review":"I just got the DT box to replace 2 tivo series boxes. Basically you get the same box with the excepttion of recording 2 shows. For me was better because now I pay only 1 bill insead for 2 boxes.But tivo has been very slow to release better boxes. If my cable company would have a better box that doesn't crash I'd be using it. Thee box has 2 tuners, HD, more space and etc...Tivo 2 dt is not worth it for new subscribers. But for returning tivo users then yes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work with antenna TV","review":"The picture thru the tivo unit was fuzzy. Maybe the Tivo unit is not designed to receive antenna TV. The Tivo unit made all chanels come in fuzzy. Also I didn't like that you could not use any of the functions without a Tivo subscription, but it seems that without the monthly subscription the whole thing is useless. I am now very happy with a standard DVR that does not require a monthly subacription and works much like the old VCR used to do but without the tapes. The unit I ended up with is thebrite-View BV-980H Digital HD DVR (for Antenna and clear QAM use) ,with 320GB HDD Built-in, EPG Supported,Time Shifting - Black.

The network card went bad, so they sent me another unit, which had a hard drive failure within one day. I got a second exchange and was told my extended warranty would not cover the replacement unit and is void after the 1st exchange.Brandon the customer service person was no help at all. I will never buy anything with a tivo logo again."},{"rating":"1","title":"died 2 months out of warranty","review":"For 14 months this product worked great. Then it died. It was not dropped or otherwise abused. TIVO's response was that they would replace it for the cost of buying a new one.Even though it broke so quickly, TIVO is worth the price we payed for the box and the service. If the cable companies could come out with a DVR that was as capable I would rather rent it knowing that if it broke it would be replaced for free.The box itself is rather bulky for the electronics that are actually inside it. The unit could have been designed a little better to make the overall size smaller.Hopefully you get a better box than we did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stop!

There was only one Ethernet signal in the bedroom so we installed a wireless router. The Tivo needs either a phone hook up or an Internet connection. Since she didn't have a land line and no Internet connection in the living room where she wanted her TV we had to purchase a wireless UBS adapter in order to pick up the signal. Also, had a problem with the security of the router not matching the adapter but once we changed the WAP setting to WEP we were able to complete installation. Once set-up, it seems to be working well.

I prefer using the TiVo DVR to the DVRs my local cable company rents. One of my favorite features is that when you fast forward or rewind, this DVR compensates for that split second it takes from the time you recognize the end of a commercial and the time you release the fast forward feature. TiVo builds in a slight \\"jump back\\" feature, which the Comcast's DVRs don't have. I also like the TiVo Desktop software which I've installed onto my home computer. With my home network, I can transfer shows from the DVR to my computer's hard drive."},{"rating":"2","title":"hooray for TIVO!","review":"I gave this to my wife for Christmas and now we are both hooked on TIVO. Basically, just like everyone says it will, it changes the way you watch TV. Bye-bye commercials. See ya stuff we don't want to watch. Now we really do watch only what we want and we get to watch it on our schedule. Having said that, the reason I did not give it five stars is the setup is quite an undertaking. The hooking it up wasn't too bad, but the oodles of menus that follow take a while, and when we got to the part about linking it into our wireless network it went over our heads. We still have yet to get that feature to function. Even after you purchase separately the wireless network adapter, it seems as though the network itself must be set up in a pretty specific way. Luckily you can still do it through the phone line as well or we would be up a creek. Overall I would say that TIVO makes me happy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly what I needed!","review":"When yet another VCR died on me, I decided it was time to move on up to digital.

I can even watch something else that was previously recorded at the same time!

Personally, I would prefer to go back to my cable company's DVR - the box costs me nothing but the monthly fee which is half of what TiVo charges.TiVo has TERRIBLE customer service!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"can do anything with it unless i buy more","review":"without internet, an external network adapter from tivo and a subscription the only thing i can do with this is pause and rewind live tv, the dvr cant work without a steady internet connection for the box. Due to copyright laws tivo has to erase cirtain recordings in order to preserve the time limits of cirtain shows. So far i have not been able to get live tv to go through my tivo box provided by comcast, so our provider wants to send a tech to my home and charge us $30 to take a look at things.

So for that one-week they charged me $109.50 and said it was an early termination fee. Even the Cable Company is not that bad beware of the moneygrubbers.

Although clever in places, witty in spots, I found this book a quick read primarily because I wanted to be finished with it quickly. The characters were brittle and unsympathetic. The scenes artificial. The book flowed like a swift stream, confident even cocky in places, but lacking the kind of depth that makes you want to dive in and swim."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bad boys meet bad girl","review":"25 years after the seventh Earl of Lucan clobbered his wife and killed the nanny, he shows up in Paris at the office of psychiatrist Dr. Hildegard Wolf. But she already has a patient who claims to be Lord Lucan. Will the real one please prove it? And what about Hildegard, who really is Beate Pappenheim, a fugitive fake stigmatic from Bavaria? The author has great fun twisting things around between these three bad people, at times coming close to the Keystone Cops. But blood will tell, with murder, with stigmata and with the British nobility. This book does not make much sense, but it is good fluffy fun.Amusing sideline: Bavaria had a well-known stigmatic - Therese von Konnersreuth - who \\"practised\\" there from 1925 until her death in the 1960s. She was never accused of fraud but, to this day, Rome is rather sceptical."},{"rating":"1","title":"repetitive and boring","review":"this comes from someone who knew nothing of the legend of lord lucan.. but still.. from the opening of the story i was intrigued by it. however, the book is constantly repeating the few details that it shares with us on the crime and lord lucan's disappearance over and over again. i felt the book to be very incomplete. the key word here is repetitive.

Not one, but two men claiming to be an internationally-famous criminal. Spare, sophisticated prose and dialogue. But I just couldn't make myself be interested in the characters or the plot.I can't be more specific without revealing more of the plot, but I just couldn't feel that the plot was interesting or believable. The characters were so sparely drawn that I just couldn't care about them. Perhaps if I were a Muriel Sparks junkie, I might be more excited, but I just wasn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Contrived...","review":"The chase for Lord Lucan was beyond unbelievable. It seems like everywhere they turned, Lucky appeared as if the story took place in the confines of Bermuda ... not Scotland, London, Paris and Africa.Secondly, Lucky having a double made little sense. I failed to see the upside of Lucky having a double ...can you imagine all the effort and repair that went into building that ruse? Clearly, the double was an unsustainable burden from the start (no wonder Lucky wanted him dead).Yes it's a satire ...but that doesn't allow for utter contrivances. This books only saving grace is its brevity. Given it's blatant shortcomings, I hope the positives the book has garnered here are not token.

I also want to praise the writing (I cannot fathom how the commentator just below me could miss this) which is spare and elegant and makes every word count. You don't need to know anything about the Lacan case -- I had never heard of him prior to reading Aiding & Abetting -- but it helps to be interested at least somewhat in the British aristocracy. That class' bizarre double standards and pure unconsciousness about certain flaws has never been brought out better. In fact, Sparks' illustration of the aristocratic attitude is scary in its amorality.A very entertaining and representative novella and a terrific introduction to Sparks' work."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I was excited to find a Christian-based sitcom to enjoy with my children.

Shirley writes about of being a newly wed on a Circus train, learning the ropes and class system of Circus life, living on the road and about the friends the bride made among the performers and side show acts. What better training for a woman who later became one of Hollywood's top Press Agents than sharing your life (and car) with wild and dangerous animals. O'Connor's perspectives and insights into the Circus culture can be appreciated by circus fans or anyone who likes a good autobiographical story. Her idea of a bad day was when she (literally) lost a heard of elephants in downtown Hollywood. I found myself smiling and laughing my way through this book. Buy, borrow, or check this book out of the library, it is a great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awsome mixes","review":"Not 13, really 19. Anyways. Hardcore Heaven 2 is another great collection of UK Hardcore music. You get your Happy, Gabber, and Freeform all together. Seems like ppl are still stuck on saying that Hardcore is 140 BPM, we dont live in 1991 anymore! Your Happy Hardcore alone goes around 170-175 BPM.SY starts us off with a nice bouncey mix, with some dark curves in there too. Brisk give us a pounding mix of HHC & Gabber. Kevin Energy is all Freeform.Hardcore Heaven 1 & 3 are better than this, but it's a must have for anyone's Hardcore collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must Read for all Riders","review":"Riding Logic is a fantastic, well-written, easy to understand book on riding. It's better than most current books as far as explaining riding theories. I wish I would have discovered it a long time ago but I'm very glad I have now. Museler initially discusses the rider and how many people have a misconception on what the proper seat is. Then he moves to the horse where he discusses all the stages of training from how to teach your horse to be obedient to your aids to why the horse acts out. He further explains various lessons, going through the gaits, forehand and bending exercises. Then he ends with thorough details on jumping and equipment for the rider and horse. It's just a really amazing book. I recommend it very highly!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for adding flavor and vitamins to food!","review":"We use this on almost everything. It works great with Tofu, and also makes a very tasty and creamy pot pie when mixed with vegetables. The nutritional content makes it ideal for not just Vegans and Vegetarians, but all people who are looking to add flavor and remain health conscious.A very simple recipe that I use on a regular basis is to cut Firm Tofu into halves or quarters, squeeze the water out as much as possible. I then coat with Braggs Amino Acids, and yeast flakes. This gives it a very good texture and taste."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Tasting Yeast Flakes","review":"We use Brewers Yeast for added flavor/texture on popcorn and other foods.

Item arrived on time in perfect condition.You may not realize this product is HUGE! It's nearly the size of a container of oatmeal! VERY reasonable for the price, especially considering how much this stuff costs in a small spice container from whole foods.This is my first experience with nutritional yeast. The taste by itself kind of reminds me of those mystery fried chips you get at fairs sometimes.The product was sealed and even I could tell it was very fresh.I'd buy again."},{"rating":"2","title":"great product!","review":"First off, this is a Huuuuge container! Bigger than I was expecting (about the size of a canister of oatmeal). Second, but most important, this nutritional yeast if yummy!! I had been buying in bulk at Whole Foods, but in my opinion this brand is better. Is is so fresh that the taste is better and the texture is awesome, almost with a little crunch to it, something that the other kind I used never had. Would definitely recommend it for sprinkling on veggies, popcorn, or using for all those yummy vegan \\"cheese\\" recipes."},{"rating":"2","title":"So Much Better Than the Dregs From the Bulk Bin","review":"This nutritional yeast is the same stuff that you can find in the bulk bins at many health food stores. The upside is that it hasn't been pawed through by a zillion shoppers before you and the canister that it comes in is so much sturdier and easier to store in your pantry than the flimsy plastic bags found in most bulk food aisles.The reason that I gave it four stars instead of five is that it is the \\"small flake\\" nutritional yeast instead of the \\"large flake\\" that I prefer. Plus, although it has a good \\"cheesy\\" flavor and is great for using when making vegan dishes or as a topping for popcorn, it does have a very slightly bitter flavor to it that in my experience, some other brands of nutritional yeast don't seem to have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deliciously Cheesy!","review":"I've tried many different brands of nutritional yeast flakes, and these are by and far my favorite! Thank you KAL for such a superior tasting product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't use this in place of parmesan cheese","review":"The taste is not what I expected - I expected it to taste good and I didn't like the flavor. I mixed it with pesto because I normally use parmesan. It ruined the pesto. Not a big fan of it as a cheese replacement, however, I'm using it as a nutritional supplement for home-made bread - the flavor doesn't come out in the bread. So for nutrition it's good, but not so good for taste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yeast Flakes","review":"Not sure what all to do with these...not working that well on popcorn...surely does not taste like a cheese substitute.

I had read reviews other omnivores liked it, and it wasn't just for vegans or vegetarians, so thought it would be better than it is. The quality of the product seems fine - even flakes and nice color, but oh, the taste is something that ruins oatmeal or anything else I've tried it in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nutty flavor","review":"Thanks to nutritionist Kimberly Snyder's book The Beauty Detox Solution, I changed the way I eat. In her book, she recommends substituting cheese for Yeast Flakes. Expecting a cheesy flavor, I was surprised that this is more of a nutty flavor. I read all of the reviews so I knew the expect this. I love putting this on my salad and have no complaints that it doesn't exactly taste like cheese. I will add it to my popcorn next time just to see how the flavor will taste then but for now, I'm 100% satisfied with the quality and taste of these yeast flakes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Item","review":"Nutritional Yeast is one of the absolute essentials of a Vegan lifestyle, in my opinion. This product provides that excellent, nutty, cheesy flavor in a great size package. I will be buying again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tastes great!","review":"Being a vegetarian, nutritional yeast is a great way to get nutrients. This product tastes great!

You can thank me later :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best i've had thus far","review":"This nutritional yeast is great over popcorn with a little sprinkle of olive oil! It is packed full of b-vitamins and amino acids: A definite super-food! Great value compared to my local store, where I'd have to pay the same price for only half the size. I would recommend this product to anyone looking for an effective health food supplement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Popcorn, Spaghetti -- More, Please.","review":"I bought this for the first time on a whim about three months ago. Love it, love it, love it. Love it on popcorn, crave it on my spaghetti (with a touch of parmesian cheese added to it). I eat spaghetti for lunch maybe four to five times a week now (no sauce). Don't know if that's good or bad, but I heap the nutritional yeast on it and love it. I'm definitely not a vegan (not that there's anything wrong with that, I just love me meats), but I feel good that this product is so full of nutrients. I don't know how it compares to other brands. I bought this brand first and it tastes great to me, plus the price is cheaper than some others out there, so I figure, why buy anything else?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dream Trip to Alaska","review":"Take advantage of a superbly produced Video and Narration! If like us, you have never been to Alaska, you can enjoy it's grandeur through the Lens and Narration of Cliff Fenno in such a way that you will be convinced you are actually taking the trip with he and his wife. The author obviously has a deep love and respect for the Wildlife and the Alaskan Wilderness that he so expertly captures on the video.

Well, they're back, only they're called Proper Boxes! The sound is nowhere near as bad as on those Complete Duke Ellington 1925-38 sets you can buy in Germany for about 20 dollars. Those sound like they were recorded in a toilet over the telephone. But this set is certainly not all it could have been. Somewhere I read somebody ask the question \\"Proper versus JSP?\\" That's not even a question. JSP's have fantastic remasterers doing their best. This set is only serviceable. But the music is wonderful and many of the tracks are almost impossible to find. So you have to get it. Should I review the music?

The others were ok, again in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Huge Fan","review":"Monique was a bit to much. Didnt really enjoy her on the mic. Loved Paul Mooney piece it was way to short.

In this novel he punctuates the naivete of optimism in a cruel, corrupt and bellicose world. In developing this theme Voltaire satirizes the philosophy of Leibniz who contended that earth is the best world possible inasmuch as it was created by a benevolent, omniscient, all-powerful God. Voltaire mercilessly ridicules Leibniz and his philosophy as simple-minded and unrealistic. Voltaire uses wit to mock the practitioners of bigotry, superstition and tyranny. This is a fairly easy read and I would recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The point","review":"I totally missed the point of the novel.

The first time I was on a classic literature spree at the school library (I spent two hours a day carpooling; what else was there to do but read?). The second time was for a French Lit class, so I got to read it in the original French (always fun; there are some puns and idioms that just don't translate well). The third time, I'd found it used at the university bookstore, so I finally bought myself a copy (in English, this time). Every time I read it, I find it funnier and more accurate.

But after re-reading it, I've concluded that while Voltaire has a lot going on in this story, there is a simple formula directing the action: Candide meets some people. They do him wrong somehow. On the verge of death Candide escapes. Rinse, repeat.I still love reading the early chapters, they are comical masterpieces. I see Cunegonde in an entirely different light now than when I was younger. Candide and Pangloss are still naive morons, of course. And I have new found appreciation for Martin.Overall, Candide is great fun, but can get repetitious. Best read in one sitting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Irony and wisdom at its finest way","review":"The story is an ode to optimism, in spite of all. Is everything that happens in this world for the best? This is the main philosophical question addressed in this book, and Candide will try to prove you that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heavy Handed","review":"Candide may have been something in its day, but as a modern reader only marginally versed/interested in 18th century France, I found reading it to be rather dull. (Before I get comments about how I'm stupid, I would like to point out that although I sometimes like to read classics for fun, my career and focus has always been in the sciences)Like other satires I've read, Candide seemed heavy-handed and flat. The philosophy of optimism is silly! Absurd things happen! Cue another character who only stands for symbols and has no real personality!This is why I don't read satire very often.I gave this two stars rather than one because I recognize that one may potentially get a chuckle out of the some of the ridiculous situations, and that someone more well acquainted with the particular philosophies may find Voltaire's criticism more entertaining. And it only took one day to read, which I suppose is a mark in its favor as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Satire","review":"Writen hundreds of years ago it's just as true today as when Voltaire wrote it. It pokes fun of all members of society from philopsophers and priests to politicians.Definetely some of the greatest satire written. Right up there with Johnathan Swift."},{"rating":"2","title":"Witty, bitter, savage... but in one word: Wonderful","review":"Initially I began reading Candide to prepare for an in class argument about theodicy and the existence of God. I thoroughly enjoyed this novel. It's funny and tragic all at the same time while reflecting how total optimism is truly naivety. People wondering how this book pertains to the present time, just look around. War, rape, murders, famine, suffering of innocents, disease... Voltaire reflects all those things in his work. For someone to say Candide has nothing to do with society today shows they are being blindly optomistic. Candide is great and thought provoking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Daintily philosophical, extremely funny","review":"Voltaire has a knack for satire. Candide is an excellent example. If you are familiar with the philosophy of Leibniz, you will find this book somewhat philosophical. It makes fun of Leibniz's belief that this is the best of all possible worlds because God created it. It is also just a light, funny read. I particularly enjoyed the part with the eunich and the old woman."},{"rating":"2","title":"Candide","review":"The story of Candide greatly affected the way I perceive occurances on a daily basis. I've always lived with a very optimistic outlook on life, assuming things will always turn out for the best. After reading the tragedies young Candide had to cope with and the way that he handled them, I realized that such a naive approach to life could be very dangerous. The proper amount of optimism is always good because it keeps hopes alive, but being irrationally optimistic in certain circumstances can often result in dire consequences."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great book, TERRIBLE translation","review":"Candide is my favorite book, and I've read it multiple times in boh french and english. This is by far the worst english translation I've come across. It makes absolutely no attempt to preserve the grammatical structure of Voltaire's original, and consequently much of the irony and wit is lost. Read Candide, but not this copy.The Signet edition is not bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Timeless magnificence","review":"Indubitably one of the most prodigious philosophical luminaries ever, Voltaire amazingly, although not surpisingly, continues to resonate to new generations even today. Candide, albeit a short work, emanates incredible power. When first printed, Candide subsequently was banned by Louis XV for fear of rousing the proletariat. Upon reading Candide, one can, without doubt, ascertain why. Voltaire stresses resilience, realism, and an eschewal of blithe trust and optimism.For a short work, Candide provides more outrageously absurd events than one would deem possible. Voltaire's unremitting penchant for humorous and farcical satire makes this book an absolute necessity to read for anyone who possesses a keen mind and is up to the challenge of profound literature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs to be written in new style english","review":"I disliked the book very strongly. If it was in new style english and brought out the meanings in plain words it would have been so much better.It took me reading somethings 4 or 5 times to understand its real meaning, and sometimes after that it still didn't make sense to me.

I doubt it. I am a sad clown, I say. Even when he criticizes the French he does so in a, how do you say, french way. Oui, oui! So come, bring along your Jerry Lewis video tapes and we will read this very french book together. It is frencher than a Quebecer at a Steisand concert. Frencher than Little Richard at an amfAR banquet. Frencher than Richard Simmons at a french pride parade. Read Candide and you too can be a very french sad clown.

The reviewer said that the book is no longer applicable to the world because Voltaire's fight had been won: that is to say religious intolerance and ignorance have been banished. I never agreed with that reviewer's assesment. In light of September 11, my disagreement is further entrenched in my body. Religious ignorance is still running amuck in the hills and desert dunes, and right in our own backyard. Has Voltaire's war been won? No, I don't think so. We're in the middle of it right now. Candide helped take the religious fanaticism out of Europe, perhaps some new translations in arabic and whatever languages are spoken in Afghanistan should be dropped from the back of planes along with the bombs. The book would probably have a better impact. What's the cliche? The pen is mighter than the sword."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh...","review":"Well, this had been on my list for some time.

Some critics may say that Harvey has stereo-typed his characters and that may be true but who, in this day and age, DOESN'T fit into a stereo-type.

This is good for people tired of reading what is wrong with the environment. The Man Who Planted Trees is kind of like a sophisticated Lorax book. Anyway, buy this book and enjoy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for both children and adults","review":"The book basically is a story about how even a single person can make a big difference in the world. If you want to make the world a better place, you can start with onself. Although the odds may seem overwelming, persistance and patience prevail. It proves that brilliance is necessary to explain complex issues simply.The video is also excellent for children below the reading level. It is a kind of stop animation done with pastells, I really like how the artist makes a beautiful simplistic video explain an issue that could be construed as complex."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great story","review":"This story was meant to be Jean Giono's gift to the world, but the publishers took over to make money.

A quiet hope for the future, resting on the solid principles of classical learning, humanism and sound ecological thinking.Reading this book is like a run through the forest, like diving in tall grass and listening to crickets during summer.

I knew nothing of either of the performers or the composer, but I am a fan of Danish song so I thought I'd give it a try.The songs are wonderful (the first two songs on the disc are among my favorites) and the singing/playing is top notch. Inger Dam-Jensen is an established singer of both art song and opera. Her work on this CD truly extraordinary, not only technically but in terms of interpretation as well. Mr. Teglbjaerg (pronounced Tile-byehr) does a fine job at the piano.Composer Peter Heise lived during the time of Schumann and Brahms, and though he isn't as famous as either of them, his songwriting ability counts him among the best. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I was looking for music to exercise with and this CD did not meet my needs, I am not sure who would like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"a wonderful book","review":"I picked this off of a library shelf merely on the merits of the title, and was pleasantly surprised at how readable and fun this book was. The author Fossel has a fine writing style, and swings back and forth from personal anecdotes to technical details within the space of a page. No photo's, but there are some fine drawings that complement the text. The material is very sound, and occasionally made me think about concepts that I was familiar with in fresh new ways. Good practical information, but also ample amounts of philosophical rumination (almost all of which I happen to agree with).Primarily concerned with retrofitting older houses in the New England area, although the ideas and concepts apply to any cold weather climate.Read this book on a cold night, next to a crackling fire, and have a hot drink at hand."},{"rating":"1","title":"An interesting prospect","review":"A small band of children in Florida are trying to scrape up a living in a burnt out dead town. A plaugue (nuclear holocaust, diesease....whatever) killed the adults on the planet which indirectly lead to the death of nearly all the children as well. These 7 children (the oldest being 17) are fighting to make a living when a strange teenager (around 15) appears on the doorstep.He calls himself \\"the Anchorman\\" and intices the children into a wild journey to find a man named \\"President\\" (kinda corny dontcha think?). The journey is laced with strange happenings and interesting appearences but has a killer cliffhanger at the end.This book could have been very good, but was far too wordy. It spent far too much time trying to make stories, rather than developing the characters and the plot. On the hole, a rather disappointing start to a series. This review is by a 15 year old avid reader........who is definitely not impressed."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Kindling needed more sparks","review":"This is the story of a group of children left to survive on their own after a virus (hence the series title \\"fire-us\\" - which is virus in baby-speak)has killed most of the human population.Some parts of the story are interesting. One of the older kids, Hunter, spends a great deal of time searching for food in old stores and houses. The dialogue between the kids, however, is tedious and boring. It is also very difficult to believe that children would end up acting the way the main characters do in this story.If you want to read really good survival stories, then try reading Philbrick's Last Book in the Universe or Robert Swindells' Brother in the Land."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book Was Good","review":"This book was amazing The way the author made it sad and very exciting. The book made me want to read even more. But why were the adults the only ones to die instead of the kids. The book could've been better and more sad and exciting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"I finished the Kindling last night, and loved it soooo much.

Once again, the production values, and Richardson's warm and impeccable performance carry this flick. Cheri Lunghi (Queen Guenevere in EXCALIBUR)is a winning and winsome damsel-in-distress and David Healy's Dr. Watson is a great improvement on his HOUND counterpart, being much more realistic in the role. Of course, there are a couple liberties taken with the original tale, and the culprits are revealed rather early in the film for my taste, but it doesn't get in the way of a solid and entertaining thriller. If you're a Sherlock Holmes fan, I would definitely recommend this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"This one's a dud also","review":"I don't know what these other reviewers are thinking of. I'm a fan of Ian Richardson but he's awful in this and this version of the story is likewise awful. Save your money because it'll be a waste if you buy this tape. I know, I know, you'd think he'd be great at this role but it's a big disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Short and Sweet","review":"Great little overview of this amazing missionary's life. It is a very slim vloume at only 128 pages and can be read in an evening. I wept several times while reading it and recommend this book to all. It is a great example of the transformation Christ works in a man. It is a great portrait of a heart that is in fire for Christ and His gospel. It is an excellent introduction to missions and what a missionary must be like. The suffering this man went through will bewilder the mind as the uncompromising passion and dedication to seeing Christ proclaimed challenges the depths of your soul to live every moment as if everything depended on it. Can't say enough about the work God did in this man. This should be required reading for all Christians. As a note, I do plan on getting To the Golden Shore as it goes much more in depth into the life of Judson than this short but inspiring read."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOOW!....Best book I ever read...","review":"I will never foget this book, mainly because it was the first romance novel I ever read. JULIE GARWOOD IS AN AMAZING WRITER. This book was full of intrigue, heartwarming romance, suspense, adventure, and danger from the beginning to the end. Gillian is sweet, strong and very brave. Broddick is Macho, sexy, sexy sexy!!! did I say sexy! ^^ courageous, and sweet (when he is around Gillian). They make a PERFECT! couple. THE OTHER TWO CHARACTERS: Brigid and Ramsey ( he too, is gorgeous-sexy-sweet and, falls in love with Brigid). THIS BOOK WAS SO AMAZING, I WAS DISSAPPOINTED WHEN IT ENDED!! If you are looking for a romance novel, THIS IS THE BOOK TO READ! WARINING: Do not read this book at night, because you will not be able to sleep. :) :) :) ^^"},{"rating":"2","title":"wish it was longer","review":"I loved reading about Ian and Judith again. One wish would be that it was a wee bit longer. Ahhh, Mz.Garwood please go back to historical romance!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you've read one, you've read 'em all......","review":"I suspect if you're a Garwood fan you will enjoy this novel. To me, her novels are all too similar. With Ransom, she takes the reader yet again into the highlands with a bit of mystery, adventure, clan-loyalty, and romance. Actually, the romance aspect is debatable b/c attraction is NOT romance as far as I'm concerned.Garwood's characters are all the same, she merely changes their names in each of her books. I'm not saying they are dislikable, just redundant. Other reviewers boast this is Garwood's best highlander romance; if this is true, I am not interested in reading any others. It wasn't awful, it was just the same old stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why does everyone like this book?","review":"I have always liked Julie Garwood (until the Roses). But this book is pretty lame. It has echoes of her past style, but is vastly inferior. The first few chapters were so confusing that I checked to see if pages were missing from my book. I tried hard to like it, but how many times can you read: Brodick; Yes Judith; Gillian; Yes Brodick; Ian; Yes Ramsey; Did Ms Garwood need some filler? No one talks that way. I was quite disappointed, but read it anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"...jusr miserable","review":"This book promotes everything that a woman should not be: stupid and submissive. I am sad for Gillian, I am totally repulsed by Broderick - a possessive and rude pig, and I am bored by the book that reaks of a day-time soap (you know what is going to happen 10 pages in advance). I am sorry, Ms. Garwood if this is an ideal love for you for it surely seems like an abuse to me. I am truely sad that women still find books like that exciting and interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many characters","review":"I read through the first 50 pages of this book, and I couldnt keep up with all the characters. I Did not read the first book \\"The Secret\\", and maybe it would have been easier to keep up with if I had. Either way, it was just way too confusing."},{"rating":"1","title":"dreadful...","review":"possibly the worst book I have ever read...her history is not good-being English the term \\"Pa will paddle my backside\\" is not really something that a modern English person would say let alone someone supposedly born in the reign of King Richard. It just grated so badly that the rest of it left me cold, I love historical romances/fiction but please make some effort to get the time period even remotely correct!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It made me very sad...","review":"Good God! This was the first book of Ms. Garwood I ever looked at and I swear it will be my last! I can't believe something so shallow and unbelievably cheezy still gets published! All the characters do is look at each other, sigh, rapidly hug and kiss and realize over and over and over that they are in love...It was so tacky I couldn't force myself to finish. This is housewife's bliss! All that's missing is Fabio on the cover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annette, CA","review":"My aunt persuaded me to read this book. I am not a big fan of Romance but I gave it a try. Did this book change my mind about this geanre? No, not really. The characters seem very undeveloped - the author told us upfront what they thought and felt rather than letting them convey it through their actions. Brodick is very rude and primitive. All that comes to mind is that he talks \\"gruffly\\" - that word was used 98 times to describe him (and that is only where I bothered to count). As for poor Gillian, she is just too irritating even to talk about. To wrap it all up -- NOT an interesting read. (Sorry Gulie Garwood..)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Garwood Romance Mystery","review":"I really enjoyed this novel.It was my third Garwood read, The Bride being the first. I have to admit that the first chapter was pretty confusing and I almost gave up trying to understand the story line. However, once it became clear as to what was going on I was hooked,and it was oh so hard to put down. It had a complex but thoroughly enjoying plot that was very witty and mysterious with the missing Arrianne's box. Brodich is very much an arrogant but endearing leader who met his true soul mate in Gillian. They complemented each other completely.This book had a lot of characters and a bewildering start. But don't give up. I think this is Garwood's best yet!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved the book, and couldn't put it down!","review":"Julie's newest book was the best yet. I have read every single one of the books she wrote, and never have I been disappointed. Gillian and Brodick are what each of us hope to find in love.

A good tale, but not much excitement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"I read The Secret just before reading this one. It was a wonderful lead-in to Ransom. I couldn't put this book down. I feel in love with Broderick and Gillian. And it was great to include Iain & Judith Maitland. You always wonder what happens to the characters in the other books, and it's great when you see what happens to them."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love Julie Garwood","review":"I have only read 2 of her books first I read Ransom and I just finished The Secret I would never suggest you to read it in that order read The Secret first and then read Ransom YOu will fall in love with the characters so quickly. Julie Garwood is so good at adding humor and romance and drama into her novels. These two novels compliment each other and once you pick these books up they are hard to put down. I promise that they are a great buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"I can't wait for Ms. Garland's next book!","review":"I have been reading Julie Garwood ever since The Secret was first written and I have been eagerly anticipating Ramsey's story. I loved the book - but I could not help feeling a bit disappointed that Ms. Garwood did not include more of a rich tale about Ramsey and Bridgid. If she had to have two romances in one book, I know that I would have bought a book that was twice as long with equal emphasis on both romances.Ms. Garwood, if you read this, please continue with your Scottish romances - I am now fascinated by the Highlands and its brave, courageous people!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivating!!! You'll never put it down.","review":"After having read The Secret and falling in love with Ian, the main character, I couldn't wait to read Ransom. I wasn't disappointed.

But wanted more story about Ramsey.","review":"I really loved this book, but I had been waiting since \\"The Secret\\" for a story that I hoped would focus on Ramsey Sinclair, as he was written to be the more \\"irresistible\\". I enjoyed Brodick but didn't find his character in \\"The Secret\\" to be that exciting. At any rate, \\"Ransom\\" is well written and I did enjoy reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"on the edge of your seat","review":"Gillian claimed to be Brodick's bride to spark his curiousity. He tricked her into marriage to claim her heart. What Brodick didn't know was that in order to claim her heart, he had to give her his. He had to show her he cared.This is a truly heartstopping romance, one that I found I couldn't put down. It's about the brave, stubborn young Gillian who is the only key to finding King John's beloved jeweled box, and the only key to the toughest Hilander Lord, Brodick Sinclair's heart"},{"rating":"2","title":"Garwood keeps getting better!","review":"I love her books and this one was no exception.

Thank you for the stories that women can daydream to."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't get it","review":"Seriously, 200+ thought this book deserved five stars? This was my first Julie Garwood book and will be my last. I enjoy dialogue between characters, but seriously-- 10 pages of dialogue between the heroine and a six-year-old? The characters were superficial and the amount of dialogue was way overkill. If they hadn't told me the book was set in Scotland and they didn't frequently throw in the word \\"Laird\\" I would have had no idea. There was no culture, no historical authenticity... I agree with another review that said it read like someone's very first novel, and a bad one. I ventured outside of my normal genre of historical fiction and this is what I got. I'm only giving it two stars because it wasn't HORRIBLE, but definitely cliche and boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Book I have read in a long time!","review":"I love Julie Garwoods books and this was one of the best yet.If you have read The Secret, then this is the book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh!@ I was bored!!!","review":"I haven't read a Julie Garwood in 10 - 20 years. I did enjoy some; Lion's Lady, The Bride, and even \\"The Secret.\\" But, nothing has changed with her historical novels. Still flaky and almost child-like heroines. This was a long and ridicules story. Sorry Julie, I have out grown your historical novels. I still think she is a talented writer, her contemporary novels are not that bad. Sorry . ):"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pages out of order","review":"The kindle version has a few pages out of order, which is incredibly frustrating.

I informed Amazon about it but don't buy the digital version until it's fixed."},{"rating":"2","title":"a fine read","review":"It was really good but Ramsey was hardly in it and it bothered me his appearance was only described as handsome and nothing more. And the girl was so dumb if she'd stop declaring her love for Brodick for two seconds maybe she'd realize she was married. But she was cool apart from that flaw. I liked where the story went."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ransom","review":"Ransom by far is my favorite of all Julie Garwood's Scottish series.

I was happy to revisit the characters of Judith and Iain again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Reading","review":"This book was great. I loved the characters, the story line, and all aspects of the book. I have read every book Julie Garwood has written, and she has not disappointed me yet.

Keep writing about this area Ms. Garwood and keep books of this calibor coming to avid readers like myself. I personally Thank You."},{"rating":"2","title":"And, A Note To Julie Garwood","review":"I'm one of those people who says she wouldn't be caught dead with a romance novel. Imagine my surprise when a friend loaned this to me and told me it was a mystery, which she knows I love and I finally relized it was a romance! Julie Garwood lovingly developes her characters; she interests, involves and excties this reader and tells me a wonderful story. I ran right out and bought the \\"prequel\\" \\"The Secret\\" wherein we meet the Maitland clan and many of \\"Ransom's\\" characters. My note to Ms Garwood is, 'Please, please', take us home with Gillian Buchannan to the places and people she has not met, and keep us in touch with the Sinclairs and the Maitlands. A trilolgy would be such a joy!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another wonderful story from Ms. Garwood","review":"It's hard to choose which one of Ms. Garwoods books are the best. This one is no exception......It keeps your attention from the very first page. I love how you can read her books and know the characters from other books and catch up on what has been going on with them yet if you have'nt read any of the other books you would'nt know that they are not new characters. I can't wait for the next book!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing Text","review":"I have a weakness for Julie Garwood books, and repurchased this book in Kindle format after buying the original version many years ago.

Extremely annoying -- will be returning this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Adventure Book I have Read in a Long Time! 5 Stars","review":"I am so impressed with the novel, Ransom , by Julie Garwood. The main characters Gillian and Brodick were such a delight to read about. They were so funny together. My favorite scene was when Father Flanaggen announced to Gillian, Brodicks trickery. I laughed so hard. Julie Garwood brings the characters to life with this read. I felt I was watching it the whole time. I am going to read this one again in the near future. And I don't ever read novels twice. Pick this one up, you will be glad you did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Julie Garwood's best book yet!","review":"I loved this book! This is one of those stories that I really hated to see end. The characters had wonderful personalities and I found myself laughing out loud quite often.

You don't even have to like historical. Excellent story. I have read this so many times my book fell apart and I went to buy hard cover."},{"rating":"1","title":"TSTL Heroines ...","review":"I bought the new Kindle version of this book. Believe it or not, I just started reading Julie Garwood and have liked her work for the most part. I loved The Prize and The Bride. Lions Lady was okay. I did not like Ransom at all. The heroines both seemed weak to me and the heros were always in control and getting the better of the heroines. The heoines never stuck to their guns on any issue and there were several badly needed \\"hero grovels\\" scenes missing. Honestly, I didn't feel the love. Oh well. I'm thinking of trying the Secret just to fill in Judith and Ian's story, but I'm not sure I'm interested anymore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast paced- great read!","review":"I do believe Julie Garwood is quickly becoming my favorite Romance writer. This was the 2nd one of her books I have read and I am headed to the library to get another one. But I messed up. I read Ransom and now am headed to get Secrets, which is opposite of how I should have read them. There is love, humor, sadness, adventure, etc. in Ransom. I loved Brodick being good looking but not with the the best of personalities, infact he has a hard personality. Gillian was strong, beautiful, carrying, and devoted. It is a great read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good (but not Great)","review":"This book and \\"Come the Spring\\" are well written, but aren't as funny as her other books.

Maybe next time..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth waiting for!!!","review":"Julie Garwood is one of my favorite authors. I loved this follow up to The Secret, however I too was disappointed that Ramsey and Brigid did not have their own story.

I would recommend this book to any romance reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved the first half","review":"I was held completely enthralled through the first half of this book. i loved the setting and it's description. I loved the heroine and the 'wee lad' she took under her wing. My only problems with it were that, for me, there weren't enough love scenes, and they arrived too late in the story...and the fact the author decided to throw in another couple into the mix, without fully fleshing out their story. I think Ms. Garwood should have stuck to her main protagonists and left the other couple for another book"},{"rating":"2","title":"First of many books I will read by Julie Garwood!!","review":"I got this book by accident, I was in a group of books that a coworker left for to look through. And after reading it I was just captivated by it all and wanted to read more of julie garwoods book. The story was just wonderful and all that I love to see in stories.I loved how ms garwood told the story about guillans father and his death and how her and her sister were talken away. It was wonderful and helped later in the book to already understand things and not have to wait to find out why this or that was going to happen.My favorite part of this book was when guillan finds out that she was married on a horse. \\" A horse, I was married on a horse\\"? It was just perfect..I look forward to reading all of Ms. garwoods book and hope that she will be writing for a long time to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved this book!!!","review":"It was a wonderful well written Book!!!

(though i will say, it seemed like once alec was safe at home, gillian didn't really think all that much about him. from what i discerned of her character, i would have thought she'd be thinking about him more in the story, but he's barely mentioned after he's back w/his parents. and i totally agree with everyone who said that bridgid & ramsey could have had their own book! julie! write another book about those two! they were so much fun!) this book really takes you in & you feel like you know these people. very well written & developed characters. thank you, julie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read","review":"Ramsay Sinclair and Brodick Buchanon, make a reappearance in this new novel as the heroes. Both now Lairds, they must discover who plots to harm Ramsay's young brother. In the process they meet two remarkable women who disrupt their lives and teach them about love. Fun to read, with a lot of action, adventure and ludicrous dialogue between these feisty women and their oh-so-stubborn suitors, this book keeps you turning the pages. However...Aside from the fact that all of the characters fall in love too quickly for me to keep track of, this book was a great read with the exception of the weak ending. Ms. Garwood, made the women appear both weak and weepy, when those words are a far cry from their indomitable characters. A better attempt could have been made to keep the characters true to form."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Let Down To much like all of her others","review":"I was looking forward to reading another great book by Julie Garwood, what I got was a book that had flat characters and didn't make me feel anything the way her other books have. Maybe if I hadn't read her other books and hadn't expected so much of this new one I would have liked the book better. The bottom line is I am sick of all of her heriones getting lost and having no sense of direction. And if one more wrings her hands together I think I'll scream! Miss Garwood needs to start to give her heros and heriones new personalities and stop having them all share the same traits and act alike. The only reason I did not give it one star was because the story was there, but the characters were not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ransom","review":"I like Garwood's books; they are usually fun, romantic and easy to read and this was no exception.This book is the second of her Highland series and - though I do recommend reading all of them in order - I actually would suggest not reading them one immediately after the other because eventually you will find them a bit repetitive ( in the type of characters - that is incredible beautiful heroine that falls in love with the tough and handsome highlander that resist to admit he is in love - and also in the writing style and descriptions ). I found that if I mix these books with other author I always enjoy them better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ransom","review":"Good story wish it would continue into another story line. Love this book but where is the next one to follow"},{"rating":"1","title":"Kind of hard to believe","review":"This book was harder for me to get through than most. I found it a little plodding and contrived. The historical content and language were poor - I prefer to read historical novels that at least attempt to keep with the language and characteristics of the time. This one did not. I found Gillian to be a little weak in just succumbing to Brodick's wishes and getting caught or in trouble whenever she didn't. Some central characters, such as the little boys who were the initial start of some of the trouble and Gillian's sister Christen, were not dealt with to my satisfaction. It is almost like they were created, then forgotten and then brought back again just so they could be wrapped up.While I won't say this is a bad book, it was somewhat disappointing. Be prepared to suspend your belief and get through some plodding moments and you can manage to enjoy this book for the most part. I just didn't after a while."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad but nothing compairable to The Secret","review":"Loved the caraters but was hopping to see Ramsey in his own book.

I have contacted the author and publisher to voice my option on this matter."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of her very best!!!","review":"I loved it!!! If you loved The Secret (and Julie Garwoods other medieval stories) you will love this one just as much-- or more. You can't help but read it all at once. It's too good to put down and totally worth feeling sleepy over the next morning because you couldn't. I can't wait to see who's story we get next...."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Loved it!!!!","review":"This is definately one of my all time favorite books and although I'm only 15, I have read a number of them. The plot, characters, and dialouge are well thought out and well developed. The book, Castles, comes before this in the series and it is also very enjoyable. If you haven't read this book, do so."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful & Captivating!","review":"As a new reader to Julie Garwood I found myself falling in love with her books even thou this was only her 2nd book I had read. I lost myself in this story for hours and couldnt put the book down for anything. It was beautifully written and I felt as thou I knew Brodick and Gillian by the end of the book forever. I hope she continues to write more books in the Highland settings due to the fact the Lairds time period was fascinating. It was very enjoyable and I would highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ransom","review":"I've read every book Julie Garwood has written. I started in paperback and have watched her books go to hard cover. It's a testimony to how much I enjoy her books, that I can't ever just wait for the soft cover. I rush out and get the book the day it releases. Ransom lived up to all of my expectations. If they asked me to pay twice I would have. The characters are engaging and the dialogue is witty and intelligent. The romance is sweet and romantic in spite of the Buchanans reputation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lush setting, action story sets up romance","review":"Gillian is summoned by the man who murdered her father when she was a child to determine the location of a stolen treasure. As she tries to find a long-lost sister who may have the treasure, Gillian turns to Scottish chieftain Brodick. As he tries to help her find the treasure and save her uncle, she unwittingly marries Brodick, who has decided he will simply take what he wants, a tradition of his people that does not sit well with English-born Gillian. His strength and bravery win her over, however, as the two take on all of England to clear her father's name and restore her family's legacy.This is a well-spun tale. Although the Highlanders are a little edgy and rough, and Gillian keeps changing from flimsy damsel in distress to fighting, serious-wound-enduring heroine, I liked the pair and their many cohorts. Not a believable story in many respects, but an entertaining one."},{"rating":"2","title":"ONE OF THE BEST....LOVE IT","review":"WELL THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST FROM MS GARWOOD. JUST LOVE IT...... CAN'T WAIT FOR HER NEXT BOOK ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Down-to-earth, first-hand advice","review":"The author relates wonderful, realistic first-hand experiences. It was a nice companion to the more clinical, medically oriented books I had. It was like a girlfriend was telling me exactly went she through--no judgements, no child-psychology mumbo jumbo, just what it's like to bring home a new human being that is totally dependent on you.I bought this book 5 yrs. ago when I had my son and have purchased it several times since as gifts for pregnant friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated this book ...","review":"If you've read anything else, don't get this book. The information in here is SO general that it could be applied to just about anything. The book lists quick explanations of what will happen, but no information on how to respond to what you'll experience. Additionally, there were frightening statements in this book letting me know the author was no expert on the subject of baby rearing. I was exasperated to read her thought that babies should usually be placed in the backseat of the car. I think that everyone knows that is the ONLY place to put a baby in the car. Though, I'm afraid unknowledgeable people will read this book and think it's ok to do such things as put a baby in the front seat of the car.If you've read ANYTHING else, you don't need this book. In fact, if you haven't read anything else, you still don't need this book. Don't waste your time or money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cutesy Poo from La La Land","review":"Maybe a lot of people enjoy being addressed as though they're just a little bit dumber than this 1st time Mother, but I did not. The author writes as though becoming a mother is akin to being left alone in the nuclear bomb assembly room without an employee handbook. As a first-timer I needed more specific information and less hand-holding from a fellow neophite.

However, I think that the low brass could have been louder (especially during the important tuba part in the first movement). Movements 2 and 3 were really good, but there is some random coughing during crucial sections of these movements. The last movement was too slow during the fast sections and too fast during the slow sections (like the ending). However, Masur delivers the BEST Capriccio Espagnol I have ever heard. Movement 2 was lovely, and the solos were outstanding in movement 4. This copy has great sound quality, but it also muffles the low brass in Scheherazade. For a great Scheherazade, get the copy with Leonard Bernstein directing the New York Philharmonic. It's not perfect technically, but it has got it where it counts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heads up- more of a packet than an actual book","review":"I agree that this is a valuable addition to the small library of books for working mothers. But a heads up-- this is more of a bound packet than a book. It has a photocopied-type cover and looks like it was printed on a standard laser printer with double spaced Times New Roman font.

Dad explained that the farmer before the war had been a successful engineer, but had lost everything when he was forced to go to \\"the camp\\" - a tragedy and great waste. I've been haunted by that guiet farmer ever since, so it was with enthusiasm that I began Stubborn Twig, the story of a Japanese family's American experience.Stubborn Twig is well researched and chock full of details about the Yasui family. Reading their story should be compelling. It's not. It's repetitious, tedious and a slow, difficult read. The last 50 pages, the third generation, is a mix of biography and sociologist psycho babble. So why read Stubborn Twig? Because it's an important story, an American story that has much to teach us, and one that shouldn't be forgotten."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very readable inspite of interesting subject","review":"The subject matter is very interesting and the research was obviously thorough but reading it is another matter.

I didn't feel like I had done a workout, because I hadn't. The DVD that comes with Bob Harper's kettlebell you buy at Target is better. That one gives me a workout. If you want a workout with kettlebells, do not waste your money on this one. I should have sent it back and asked for a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"This DVD is a waste of money. I brought this DVD based on the 5 STARS reviews; the reviewers must be Lisa's friends and associates. There are no instructions for variations of levels. The DVD says so many reps for beginners, intermediate, and advance; but, there are no cues as to when and what levels should be doing what. There is no consideration for a learning curve or alternate ways of doing certain routines. There are way too many breaks for such a short workout routine.

Lisa is making hand over fist on this DVD at the buyers expense."},{"rating":"1","title":"All rest no work","review":"This is the worst DVD - total waste of money!

It seems to give good instruction, but that's about it. The workouts aren't much of a workout. There are three minute rests between moves. I could drive to McDonald's and eat a cheeseburger before she starts on the next one. I guess you could hold the remote and keep fast-forwarding, but I have better things to do.

KettleBell's + Lisa Rock!"},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of time and money","review":"This DVD is awful. I have never written a review, but after 5 minutes of this DVD I couldn't believe I wasted my money.

There is no need for all the breaks except to waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to the workout?","review":"The entire DVD seems to be more instructional than anything else. There isn't much of a workout at all. In between some of the movements there is a splash on the screen while a huge amount of rest time goes by and this is where you are told how to workout using what has been demonstrated. And by told it says that if you are a beginner you do this many sets and if you are intermediate you do this many and if you are advanced you do this many but that is it. There isn't much to follow after that. Even the warm-up in the cardio section leaves you cold.All in all I am still in search of a basic kettlebell workout that requires a little bit of effort. I was hoping this was it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst kettlebell dvd out there","review":"Don't waste your money.

I was used too spending hours lifting weights and doing cardio. I was skeptical in the beginning when starting exercising with kettlebells until I saw my body transform. I bought Kettlebell Bombshell DVD to get different kettlebell workouts. This DVD shocked me! Amazing instruction and well-paced exercises to take you to the limits of kettlebell training. I drain with sweat and still can only do one workout per day. Lisa is an amazing instructor and role model. She is always available if you have questions. How many DVD exercise instructors offer that kind of support? Lisa is definitely a \\"bombshell\\".

Lisa herself has communicated with me a few times to check in to see how I was doing and that impressed me a lot. Being new to exercising, I was not sure what to expect from this workout. Lisa's introduction on how to properly use the bells was great and is a workout in itself. I started out using a 10 lb. weight, even though she recommends 15-20 lbs. for women. The workouts are long enough so you feel it, but not too long as to interfere with your daily life. I am impatiently awaiting the second DVD from her. The only thing negative I can say is I wish I would have known what weights were recommended before purchasing. Overall, the exercised are great and really work different muscles than if you just used regular free weights. There are 3 workouts, upper, lower and circuit and all leave me feeling like I got a great workout."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the time or money","review":"I purchased this dvd hoping for a complete kettlebell workout.

CGI is ridiculously cheesy (typical of a SyFy movie), far too many closeups of the actors' faces on the outside shots (clearly an attempt to conceal the fact they are on a movie set) and SPOILER ALERT! the worst \\"robot Hitler\\" CGI you can imagine.Nothing that happened in this movie surprised me one bit, and it is clear to see why Dominique Swain's and Jake Busey's careers circled the drain at least a decade ago.The only reason why I gave this film TWO stars instead of ONE is because the premise of the film attracted me: Nazis trying to restart the Third Reich from (insert place here).It's good for a few mindless laughs.

But thee are features on pre-production, cast & location and one on the main production. Each one is all of about 5+ minutes long.And there's a commentary track.But those are about the only special features and hardly salvage this stink-burger.Overall, I'll rate this one a 'pass.'

I like some of the Asylum films because they are fun and SOMETIMES are pretty good. But after recently seeing IRON SKY this was painful to watch.The sets were pretty much non existant using warehouses for all the interiors( don't think a cinder block wall would be found inside a UFO).The only effects that worked were the air battles at the end and the \\"machine\\" Mengele is trying to get to work.

Not sure how 30 seconds of a musical number can be called a song. Portions seem to simply cut off in mid sentence. There are no traditional Christmas songs so its only a \\"sing-a-long\\" if your kids are familiar with the previously released Veggietales Christmas videos.

It is true that the author, apart form being a very fertile textbook writer, has a very thorough approach when it comes to derivations and mathematical explanations. However, in doing this, he obscures the physics contained. The author insists on very thorough mathematical explanation without reference to intuition, making the topic more about mathematical derivations then physics. The mathematics is not complicated, it is just tedious. He does not leave anything to be done by the reader, turning the learning process into an effort of understanding how the author thinks and how he thinks you should understand the topic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very fun and original!","review":"Scrapped Princess is a very fun show that is perfect for all anime fans! its very original, and fun even for the parents to watch :D"},{"rating":"2","title":"for my daughter","review":"My daughter loved these dvds so much, we have ordered every set, not to mention it comes with a figure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great emergency light/charger","review":"I bought this as a refurbished item and it wouldn't charge the battery if it was plugged into the bottom, only if the battery was detached.

The new unit works flawlessly.You get a very bright lantern and 6 LED lights beneath the main bulb, AM-FM radio which works fine, the NOAA weather band is difficult to tune but that's true with any non-PLL tuner. The AC inverter works fine for charging most AC devices, the 12v DC power socket is handy for some devices but the ability to keep the whole thing charged via the included adapter or by hand-cranking is the best feature.I haven't run trials on the duration of the light since we've had no outages this winter but I'll post them when I can."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice idea, bad quality","review":"I thought this product would really come in handy for camping.

Both the narration and the voice-overs of interviewees are mediocre at best. If you are averse to dubbing of fictional films, you will understand that overdubbing of non-fictional work is particularly onerous.

It is a true mix of psychedelia, metal and ambient. It's like a drug. I haven't been this tripped out by music in a looooong time. It makes me feel like a child again to hear it - it's so illustrative. It reminds me of when I saw Herbie Hancock live actually - It's music without boundaries - it's not really even music in the traditional sense - it's sort of like a sensory experience.

Frank, who spends his days in an alcoholic haze, is at first intrigued and later enthralled with the outspoken Rita.This is a wonderful showcase for the talented and adorable Julie Walters. She is dazzling and thoroughly likeable and every word spoken in her thick Liverpool accent rings honest and true. Caine lets her shine by downplaying Frank, who is hopelessly morose and more than a bit lazy. Both were rightly nominated for best acting Oscars.The inevitable transformation of both characters is sweet and uplifting without being overly-sentimental.

Julie I give here a 10 for her acting. Well because Frank Michel was suck a bad actor I believe that there is no two incidents that I want to discuss but instead of Frank going to Australia by him self he should of gone to Australia with Rita.

Michael Caine wasn't acting very well, he always seemed tired and bored. Rita had a very annoying voice, so I couldn't sleep during the movie (good one!).

Chiropractic is not about back pain, it is concerned with the removal of interference to the nerve system, thereby allowing the body to function closer to its potential. Chiropractic has never been about \\"LOW BACK PAIN\\"---it is this type of misconception which has permeated our society and continues to be spurred on by texts such as this. Dr. Sportelli graduated from Palmer College of Chiropractic in the 1950's. He most certainly was not taught such nonsense at Palmer, for his pigeon-holed concept is not taught there, nor at any other good chiropractic college. Chiropractic recognizes and deals with the bodies inborn mechanisms. Dr. Sportelli's book was quite a disappointment in this and other respects. My advice, pass this one by and talk to someone at a college such as Palmer, Sherman or Life College and get the facts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even better than 98 if thats possible","review":"Let me start off by saying that if you are an F1 fan especially a technical one(like myself) you can't pass up this book. If you do not know who Giorgio Piola is, he draws for the weekly magazine AutoSport. He is one of the best artist I have seen. His technical drawings allow you to understand the F1 cars in a technical perspective. Compared to the last edition \\"Technical Analysis 98\\", this one is even better. If you don't have the 98 book you should order that one too. I do like the 99 book since it is written in english only as opposed to the 98 which is in italian and english, but thats not a problem.

Unlike other books set in the South of recent memory, though, this book doesn't describe an abused young man or a dysfunctional family but rather one of great strength.Although Jim's father dies only a matter of days before he was born, Jim is raised by his mother and three uncles who never married. Throughout the book, it is these men, who earn their livelihood from farming, who teach Jim some of life's greatest lessons. From learning how to hoe a field to confronting a firends devestating illness to seeing the grandfather he never knew as this old man lays dying, we as readers journey along as Jim experiences life between his tenth and eleventh birthday.Reminiscent of the equally lyrical style found in Plainsong by Kent Haruf, this book is a pleasant read for a summer's day."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Treasure","review":"This is a book about the spiritual nourishment of a young soul.

Very few authors today have that restraint, finesse, and wisdom."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Charming Book","review":"\\"Jim the Boy\\" is one of the most simply, yet beautifully crafted novels I have read in quite a while. One one level it may seem to be somewhat simplistic and a quick and easy read. However, the skilful and artistic author has in fact written a deep and emotionally moving novel about the depression-era childhood of a fatherless boy under the care and guidance of his mother and three uncles. I confess to reading this only because it was the featured novel at my book club this month, but am so very glad that I did. I found it fascinating to see how Jim's uncles guided him through life's sometimes hard-learned lessons with both toughness and compassion. I look forward to my group's discussion later this week."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Is a Very Boring Read","review":"For some reason I thought this novel was for adults although in retrospect looking at the cover should have told me otherwise. Set in the South, North Carolina, it is the story of Jim who never knew his father. The guy died at 23 of a heart attack, and his widow remained faithful to him, never considering remarriage. However, Jim has the love and support of his three unmarried--bachelor?--uncles. They live on a farm, and this is a sort of coming-of-age story. Quite possibly adolescents might like it. But it is a dull, dull read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Human Contact","review":"The book tells of a time when the primary contact was person to person, with the family of Jim The Boy teaching him what he must learn in life. The era was before television, cell phones, ipods, PC's, texting, etc. Raised by his mother and three uncles they as a unit put their arms this boy to raise him into manhood, which on occasion involved the saying of No and punishment, but always with a point to make. I look forward to reading the sequel of Jim's march into adolescence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let's face it - I hated it!","review":"This book was recommended to me by a co-worker. I often love to read the recommendations of others, but after this experience I will be more cautious! This book was quite simply one of the more boring books I've ever read. Its simple-minded prose irritated me to the point of distraction. I was grateful for the distraction though, because the prose itself was mind numbing. The chapters could just as well have been titled: \\"Jim almost meets Ty Cobb!\\" \\"Jim Climbs A Tree!\\" \\"Jim Gets A Baseball Bat!\\" and the titles would sum up every piece of action contained. The characters were lifeless and virtually indistinguishable from each other."},{"rating":"1","title":"a fairytale for slow children","review":"After reading Tony Earley's story collection Here We Are in Paradise, I expected a clever and cleverly written first novel, not terribly deep but entertaining. Instead, Jim the Boy is a bland and episodic and schmaltzy tale that never rings true. The book tries so hard to be heartwarming and simple that only a child could take it at face value, and a child that knows nothing about life--and certainly not life in the depression South. A startlingly unambitious and self-congratulatory book, filled with nostalgia for a place that never existed. I can't think of a supposedly literary book with less in it. The prose is supposed to be understated and poignant, but there's nothing underneath it. Jim the Boy is the literary equivalent of The Emperor's New Clothes, and makes the reader ask: what happened to the guy that wrote \\"Charlotte\\"?"},{"rating":"1","title":"How amazingly boring","review":"Jim the Boy is perhaps the worst book I have ever read, excepting The Man in the High Castle. When I unfortunately and forcedly (I had to read it for school) partook in reading this horrible novel, I was at first puzzled.

There is even less action, and even less plot than the vicissitudes that Jim endures..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Believe the Hype","review":"Jim the Boy is terribly overrated, with a cast of cardboard characters and a wooden tone. Apparently many critics don't know how to distinguish between spare, basic prose and dumbed-down bad writing.

Nothing special. No twists to it. A plain, dull, stupid plot. Just another boy without a parent during Depression.I can't even say much about this book, because there's NOTHING in it.

I kept expecting Andy and Opie to come walking in, carrying their fishing poles; at least something funny might have happened, that way. But this earnest, plodding book about an unbelievably good world is actually kind of an insult to the way southern people really lived in the 1930s, black and white. What was the author thinking?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Thin and disappointing","review":"After reading Tony Earley's exciting stories in Here We Are in Paradise, I expected a much stronger first novel. In fact, Jim the Boy barely counts as a first adult novel. The book seems to have been written for younger children (its simplistic piety would insult teenage readers.) It's sentimental to the extreme, giving us an idyllic depression South that never existed, comforting as it might feel to some readers. There's no coherent storyline, just a string of events with no tension. The writing is supposed to be luminous and understated but is just painfully plain, with nothing under the surface. It's the literary equivalent of the Emperor's new clothes. A great disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"There's a little Jim in all of us","review":"Childhood memories are some of the strongest sensory feelings anyone will ever have. When we were kids we knew how we felt, we just couldn't always determine why we felt that way and couldn't possibly put our complicated feelings into words.In \\"Jim the Boy\\" Tony Earley takes universal childhood emotions of pride, jealousy, greed and companionship and strikes up a story to rummage through his own memory of childhood complexes. It's been done before--\\"The Wonder Years\\" TV show comes to mind--but Earley doesn't play for laughs here. Rather he takes a grown-up's understanding and experience of the world and latches it onto the illuminating eye of a child.Earley succeeds in creating a quick, nimble book that, even though it's set in 1924, could have happened yesterday."},{"rating":"1","title":"A book for kids, not adults","review":"This is a pleasant, rather hokey coming-of-age tale that seems addressed to kids of 11 or 12, not to grownups. I don't understand why this isn't being marketed as a children's book, as it really has little to hold an adult reader's interest. The plot is very familiar and sentimental, and the writing is clear, uncluttered, and plain but not interesting in its own right. Buy it for your school-age son, but not for your father."},{"rating":"2","title":"COMING OF AGE IN NORTH CAROLINA","review":"Life during the Great Depression was harsh. We see it through the eyes of a ten year old, boy, Jim. Yet the simplistic rigors or farm life lend strength, discipline, and tenacity to this little boy coming of age in Aliceville, North Carolina. His widowed mother and three endearing uncles help Jim face the turning points in his life with courage. The illness of a friend, the coming of electricity, and the marriage proposal his mother receives expands his world, and his adventures in a different local begin anew. Through his eyes, we remember ourselves as children, and easily identify with his perceptions.

I felt misled when I first skimmed this hardcover edition. Later, I realized that there were about 50 extra pages, but photos added to the hardcover weren't that much different from what was in the paper version on newsstands; pages with pictures of individuals at the end was overdone filler; and many photos were very familiar already. Having said all that, one can't argue with the quality of \\"Life\\" compilations of photographs, and quality of the book overall (paper, format, photo placements) is very good, with several eye-popping pictures.

But Kai Hansen appearance in IRON SAVIOR is almos as guest, since Pit Sielck writes all the songs, sings, plays guitar, bass and keyboards !!! The result is an album in which you clearly see the musicians skills, but where every song sounds the same: a furious metal assault with melodic choruses in between.

With a similar delivery and all most identical voice, he finally has begun his approach out of his big bro's shadow. Kinda sad to see some of the faces gone after No Limit has revamped(biggest manuever NO Beats by the Pound), but their new musical style is gonna keep them in CD players all over the streets. This album has a handful of 'gems'. I personally like the songs Damned If They Murder Me, Down for my N!gg@s, and Hustlin. Gotta love Krazy(2Pac's vocal clone) and Mac brings it every time. C-Murder keeps up with the basic formula for song concepts that has made No Limit famous. If your a No Limit fan you've already got the album. If your not, this is a quality album but definately peep a few more albums off the label to fully appreciate how far they have come. Keep your CD's spinning."},{"rating":"2","title":"C-Murder is back","review":"1st OF I AM A NL FAN 4 LIFE C CAME TIGHT ON THIS 1 I DONT EVEN HAVE THIS BUT I HEARD EVERY SONG WHAT U BOUT IS DA BEST SONG ON THERE I GOT ALL C'S CD'S BUT THIS MIGHT BE BETTER THAN LIFE OR DEATH I SUGGEST EVERY NO LIMIT FAN 2 GET THIS ESPECIALLY 4 THE BEATS."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good No Limit Release","review":"Third No Limit release of 2000, and NL has definetely improved.

They also forced him to change some of the more explicitly homoerotic lyrics into more standard gangsta bling-bling tropes. Personally, I think the original concept would have been a refreshing change of pace. I've been waiting for a long time for a rapper with the guts to admit he's not afraid to love another man in the most intimately physical way. We've known for years about CM's tastes and proclivities, but the hypocrisy of the music biz forces gay rappers to hide their true nature beneath transparent macho posturing, lest they alienate their more dimwitted, less progressive fans.

The CD features the usual suspects like Master P, Silkk, Snoop Dogg, Krazy, Magic, so you know theyll be bringing the heat.

It seems to me that the whole rap genre itself is inherently hostile to a gay sensibility. I appreciate the effort Bambu Taschiaglou (C-Murder's real name) has put into trying to use rap to make the black gangsta community accept these alternative lifestyles and lovestyles, but the music itself projects a mindset inimical to any sort of tolerance for \\"Greek\\" love.

A complete application is gradually developed through all the chapters, together with smaller applications which illustrate specific points.While the editing of the book leaves something to be desired (e.g., incomplete sentences, punctuation errors, occasional code inaccuracies), this is a very worthwhile book indeed. I highly recommend it for the author's lack of assumptions and obvious understanding of the beginner's needs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Learning to Program with Visual Basic","review":"I had to buy this book for a class and frankly it is not a good book.

This book goes beyond anticlimactic, it is just awful. The ending and the explanation of the Emperor is so...I can't even find words for how disappointing it is.I'm left wondering if Saberhagen didn't outgrow the series and quickly wrote Shieldbreaker's story to bring the series to a close so he could move on to other endeavors. I can not believe that he actually thought that this ending would satisfy his readers.I can not stress enough how thoroughly disappointing and frustrating the ending of this book is.

(WARNING! Specific plot details follow!) Just so readers are forewarned, the Emperor is never explained, and he gives a strange quasi-religious statement about himself. Here it is, verbatim: \\"Some long ago have called me the Sabbath, or the Covenant--Some have called me Wisdom. Some lately have said that I am the Program of Creation.\\"Has Saberhagen found Christianity, and he's trying to inject it into his fiction? What the heck is he trying to get at, here?

A good book for undergraduates in mathematical analysis."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little lacking","review":"I had to get this book for my advanced calculus class. There are 3 issues I have with this book. First, that the material in any given chapter gives what is needed to work most, BUT NOT ALL, of the problems at the end of the given chapter. Second, having solutions to selected exercises is a good tool to have, and if an instructor disagrees, he or she can just assign problems that don't have solutions given. Not all students would use those solutions, but it's nice to have to verify one is on the right track. Third, the author does not explain things as clearly as other authors do. He (assuming Edward is male) could have explained things much better without adding a single word to the text. I find myself frequently referring to 'How To Prove It' by Velleman, since Velleman explains things much better. In short, this book is not the worst I've seen, and I would give this book 3 stars, were it not for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE text on advanced calculus at my school","review":"I can't believe this is the book my advanced calc 1 class used at university.

But I cannot agree with the other reviews in that the book is very UNACCESSIBLE to undergraduates! I have poured through the first 3 chapters until I almost have them memorized and the concepts are NOT CLEAR. Instead of explaining what is going on, the author rambles on about the \\"beauty\\" of his subject and how \\"we\\" as students should \\"carefully\\" digest the ideas. The examples and proofs are NOT clear and are NOTHING like the HW problems! In fact the proofs are so incomplete, that proving them in the fashion that the author does, does not convince my professor???

After wasting my time with this book and two of her other books, I'd be skeptical of allowing her to run a lemonade stand. Please save your time and money.

Great discussion of Justifcation.","review":"This book is worth it for the early discussion on the Catholic faith and then Dr. Schreck's discussion of Justification by faith and works. If you are like me, you might have a Protestant view of salvation. For me I could never quite reconcile this view with the book of James. If you are not quite sure of the Chhurch's position on faith, grace, works, salvation, etc., this book places it all in perspective and clearly explained.

Or sew crocheted \\"lace\\" onto a normal t-shirt's collar?I have used the basic patterns many times over and adapted them as I became more skilled.

My daughter wanted a pug. We already have a dog and two cats, this was a consolation and I felt it was not worth the money. It doesn't do much other than bark when you tug the toy. Which is totally fine and would be great except that it's so light weight, you have to jerk it to get it going which sets the dog flying. Alternatively you could hold the pup in the other hand and pull the toy but then it starts doing the motion in your hand, it really needs to be on a surface to get the benefit of the motion. It would have been better as a non-mechanical stuffed animal."},{"rating":"2","title":"1984 all over again?","review":"We is a book all about beating the system. It follows one man's life through a journal he is writing to send on the spaceship, Integral, to primitive civilizations like us. The journal writing style and many other features reminded me greatly of 1984. This is a classic book about the impossibility of a true utopia. The love story that flows through the book ads intrigue and seems to parallel 1984 in several ways as well. The reader begins to feel the author of this journal's thoughts, regrets, and inner struggles. A true classic that few have read or even heard of that I believe should be added to every need to read list."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oui","review":"This is my second endeavor into the famed distopia trilogy. Unfortunately, I should have read this one first. I loved Brave New World, but I think this is in a class by itself. I read somewhere that Brave New World was written without knowledge of this book, which would make the similarities uncanny. Anyway, This story grabbed me from the very beginning with the effective use of numbers to substitute characters names. This let's you know right off the bat that this future society is not joking around. The intertwining fashion used between dreams and reality was especially appealing, giving this novel a surrealistic feel. The thing that hooks this novel into masterpiece status is the ending. Unlike Brave New World, this was one I was not expecting. Also, the fact that a man living in communist Russia wrote this novel really enhances the experience and shows you the nightmarish visions this man derived from his way of life.

A fairly quick read, \\"We\\" will keep you interested and leave you with an interesting literary history lesson."},{"rating":"2","title":"A comfortable prison is still a prison.","review":"Where George Orwell's 1984 was an attack on Stalinism, We is an attack on Leninism. This makes it particularly uncomfortable to Communist apologists who like to blame the brutality of the Soviet Union on Stalin, while freeing Lenin of any respondsibility. Zamyatin contradicts any such whitewash; the \\"Welldoer\\" (Lenin), is still just a dictator. A prison, even a comfortable one, is still a prison. Individuality Zamyatin argues, is too high a price to pay for security. The writing is excellent, the story is timeless, and the novel is a triumph of both Science Fiction and political satire. This is the book that made \\"liquidation\\" a euphemism for murder"},{"rating":"2","title":"We","review":"I have alot of interest in the books 1984, and Burgess's 1985 who also wrote Clockwork Orange.

I work in a professional graphic studio and needed a large flatbed. The first scanner arrived DOA, and it was returned. The second scanner died within one week. Recently, I started to notice severe color variations. This is after months of other problems, including scans that had shadows where there were none, and strange color patterns most of which I was able to correct in PhotoShop. Talking to technical support was useless, I would email them the scans that had very visible problems and they would claim it would look perfect on their monitor. I finally got hold of a supervisor who told me that the scanner was broken and would need repair, which would cost at least a few hundred dollars, plus shipping costs.

I gulp down mystery novels whole and I devour unreservedly every scrap of British royal history so what could be more appropriate than this classic. Perhaps I have read too many actual works of history, albeit of the wonderful pop variety kind of Alison Weir, that have refuted Tey's conclusions. I was delighted from the moment I began the book. It was more clever and far more humourous than I had anticipated and I could not recommend it more highly (although I still have doubts about the verdict reached). I have no doubts, though, about the journey. It was pure, unfettered joy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everyone Should Read this Book!","review":"Yes, everyone. I mean it. Tey's storytelling is terrific. Her arguments in favor of Richard's innocence are compelling. Far more important, however, is her brilliant ability to help us truly understand what it means for history to be written by the victors. Anyone who reads this books and does not spend some time re-examining his or her own biases is just missing the point."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite mysteries","review":"I can't recommend this highly enough.

The author gets to the heart of matter without painting unnecessary surroundings. It's a well-written, entertaining book and I recommend it if you have an afternoon to kill.by Simon Cleveland"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brain-teaser, brilliant, historical mystery","review":"Some say this book is responsible for the renewed interest in Richard III. Whether true or not, it certainly peaked my curiosity.It's chock full of history. But I have one word of caution: If you know nothing about the Wars of the Roses, the reign of Edward IV or Richard III, I recommend you first read Sharon Kay Penman's THE SUNNE IN SPLENDOUR. Without a good foundation in the history of the times, you'll miss much of the subtle references.On the other hand, the unveiling of Richard III (biased in favor of the man) appears secondary to the point of the book. Rather, I think Tey meant to call historians to task. If history were written after proper (or legal) interpretation of the evidence at hand, she seems to contend, it might prove a whole lot more accurate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating","review":"It was a great way of handling a detective story.

I'm so glad I have now discovered this author (she published under the pseudonym of Gordon Daviot as well). I totally ate this book up. Yum!! Oh, Richard III, I'm so glad I got this chance to learn so much about you. Shame on Shakespeare and Sir Thomas More for maligning him all these years. This was just such a treasure, I was so thoroughly hooked.

Still I want to chalk up my 5 stars. During the reading of this book I spent hours on Wikipedia and other internet sites reading everything I could find on Edward IV, Richard III, Henry VII, and as many other players in this story as I could find, a subject that has never before held any interest for me. Henceforth I will question every so-called \\"fact\\" of history. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice popularization of history","review":"Nicely told story of how a modern-day detective using instinct and common sense unravels the defamation of England's King Richard III. Unfortunately the alternate suspect proposed for the murder of his nephews is probably not the guilty party; the most likely suspect, Henry Stafford, Duke of Buckingham, is only mentioned in passing. Also some evidence is now outdated. Still, a nicely told rebuke to the traditionalists and Shakepeare for perpetuating the defamation of a man who might have become one of England's greatest and most humane monarchs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rethink English historical mystery","review":"My knowledge of Richard III and the War of the Roses period of English history was limited but this book draws you in to the 15th century.

I would recommend this book unreservedly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Old English mystery","review":"Historically based detective story about Richard III's England which is being investigated by a modern day Scotland Yard officer named Grant.

Tey uses the shield of \\"historical fiction\\" and writes as a dabbler in the history of the period; without a serious consideration of the key players. She maligns the good reputation of Sir Thomas More, and makes ridiculous assumptions about his motives that do not stand up to close academic scrutiny. In addition she bases her detectives entire investigation on a portrait that is totally unauthenticated. I found her dismissal of Historians offensive and her overall lack of scholarship depressing. Read this book if you must, but then go out and get Alison Weir's \\"The Princes in the Tower\\" for a more accurate view of the period."},{"rating":"1","title":"Face it, he killed them.","review":"The pro-Richard effluvium is getting rather overwhelming here, so for all of you who think this is actually a history book, I'll recommend another book by a real scholar: The Princes in the Tower, by Alison Weir."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the most overrated mystery classics","review":"I had great difficulties through the years reading this book.

So if you encounter the same problem, try contacting HP.Just like other users have commented, this printer doesn't automatically get the paper, so you have to stay ready by the printer to feed each page.

It did great for about 2 weeks, then the paper feed problems began. It doesn't pick up the sheets unless I feed them one at a time. If I don't, the rollers simply don't pick up the paper, and the message reads \\"No paper in paper tray\\" even though there is plenty. Then the misfeeds and paper jams continue. It even stops and reads \\"Paper Jam!!\\" when there is no paper jam!I called HP and they sent me a new one free of charge, with a box to return the old one in. The new one worked fine for 2 weeks, then started up again with the same old headaches. The alcohol/hairspray trick another reviewer suggested for the rollers does not work. Save your money. This printer is the absolute worst. HP should be ashamed of themselves for putting it on the market. They MUST have known about the problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't scan, doesn't print!","review":"I agree with the others here, HP are useless and I should have known better.

When that option ran out I contacted them again and they stated they could no longer help me with the problem. Disappointing for a large company to put out such a crappy printer and I am definitely going us use reviews the next time I purchase a printer. Not sure if I trust HP anymore. Now I'm getting the \\"No Scan Option\\" message and it seems to be a fairly common problem also.

Since then, I have had to hand feed every single piece of paper I try to print. Then there were the issues of it only printing in color and not using any of the black ink cartridge. The only fix was to replace a virtually new cartridge. Granted, the customer service people at HP, who helped me troubleshoot through instant message, were helpful, but this has been a lemon from the moment I bought it.I don't think I have ever found a printer that is not a professional-office grade one that works well at home.

HP sent me a replacement printer at no charge!My printer did the same thing that so many others here have reported... worked fine for a while and then stopped feeding paper. It seems clear to me (after carefully inspecting and poking at it without disassembling it) that the roller that initially feeds the paper doesn't apply enough pressure.

They were not knowledgeable and I spent 2 hours online removing printer cartridges, cleaning printer cartridges, aligning printer cartridges (the extent of the \\"support\\"). I was told that the printer would be replaced with a refurbished unit and I would need to provide a credit card number to guarantee the exchange.

My paper never jammed. I bought this printer and used it for about a month before the color stopped working. I called support numerous times and it was a time-consuming endeavor. Each time, we would get the printer working only to have the color stop working a couple of days later. Due to the time it took to work with support and my busy schedule, I was unable to stay on top of it before my warrantee ran out...maybe that is the HP plan? Anyway, not only does the color not work, but if I don't set the documents to \\"black only\\", it will print blank space where the colors were. Very annoying. I also do not like how HP software installs all sorts of \\"helpful\\" stuff that pops up all the time.

It does have an ethernet port, but there's no point in networking a printer that doesn't print.

When I contacted then on Online Help site, after a bit of useless troubleshooting, I was told that the printer was out of warranty and cleaning kit would cost $39. I estimate that I printed less than 100 pages of text with this pinter. Since I screwed up and bought extra print cartridges, my cost per page is probably around $2 per sheet.

The widescreen format is not anamorphic, which means that the MPEG aspect ratio is 4:3 and the picture resolution of the viewable area is lower than it should be. The quality of the film print used is poor and contains scratches and white speckling. The film has also had some bits edited out, so I suppose you could say it contains a negative number of special features: i.e. some normal features taken out. This is a shocking misuse of the format because the DVD standard contains the possibility for having optional scenes which can be shielded from young viewers, so why wasn't this used?I doubt it will be long before the next version comes out, the 'collector's special edition' or whatever they will call it, so my advice would be to wait for that."},{"rating":"1","title":"One star for the Movie, None for the DVD","review":"As other reviewers have noted, this is a ground-breaking, hilarious, one-of-a-kind movie. It deserves to be in everyone's DVD collection, even if your collection consists of but two DVDs. It deserves five, even six, stars, but...I urge you to wait for another DVD version, for two reasons: first, if ever a film deserved extras, it's WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT?, but we get none on this over-priced DVD. Second, the movie is trimmed by a scant few seconds (on grounds of poor taste in the offending scenes), but the critical thing is -- It IS censored.

If this DVD had a good transfer, good extras, and uncensored, I would have gone for it's purchase and give it a 5.The problem is, this DVD is the opposite on what I would have gone for.The transfer is a botch job with blurs, sandy in the tan areas, overbright in reds, has a grimmy sound transfer, and IS censored in two parts.Are there any extras? No. Unlike what the lying eyes of the box says, no. And the film is only 14 years old.

We used to have all-day Roger Rabbit festivals, where we would watch the movie over and over again. The movie is THAT fun. I venture to say it is a movie for all ages. Adults will find subtle humor that will go over kids heads, and kids will love the animation and slap-stick jokes.

I did see it in the theatre and at a young age so my opinion is bias perhaps.

Not only is this possibly the first blockbuster film to allude to Joyce's 'Ulysses' (the Toon Town/Night Town sequence), but it is also an allegory of the McCarthy era, reminding us how animation bravely protested when live action kept ingloriously schtum."},{"rating":"1","title":"I love the movie but I can't get it to play, it says something about check code.

Robert Zemeicks made a film that everyone can enjoy. Watching the film as an adult I noticed there's big a amount of sexual innuedno in this film the kind of humor that you have to be an adult to get. Bob Hoskins and Christopher Lloyd were in top form as the hero and villian in the film and we all know that the two best voice overs in the film were Charles Fleischer and Kathleen Turner. This is still one of favorite Zemekicks films so sit back and watch this for old times sake."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who Stole Roger Rabbit's Extras?","review":"Directed by Robert Zemeckis (Back to the Future, Forrest Gump, Castaway), Who Framed Roger Rabbit is an eye-popping delight for kids and adults alike with it's clever comedy, inventive animation and seamless cartoon interactions with the actors. Bob Hoskins and Christopher Lloyd are great, and the combination of cartoonish humour creates a nuance that woks well. Alan Silversti's lively score suits the film's tone, using the same themes as Back to the Future yet bringing new \\"cartoony\\" music to the film. The brilliant combination of effortlessly clever humour and high-sprited fun make this one a superb classic.This \\"special edition\\" DVD is very dissapointing in the way of extras though, with no features of any kind, not even a trailer!

For my purposes (at at the closeout bargain price), the 1\\" cutter length is fine ... but be sure you know what you are getting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie especially for those who are fans of the games","review":"I haven't seen this on home video, but on TV recently, which I thought was great, except that there wasn't so much based on the game. Bob Hoskins and John Leguizamo are Mario and Luigi, which is OK. There is a Princess named Daisy, not Toadstool. King Koopa is human, not a reptile. Also, there were no fire flowers nor were there any invincibility stars. If you like the games, you will love this movie.

This film fails on many levels: it's not as exciting or engaging as a real video game, and it's not as smart or entertaining as any other film. Not even Dennis Hopper can save it. Fans of the original Super Mario Bros. will be definitely disappointed not only because of the lack of excitement, but also the lack of any real connection between the game and the film. As a matter of fact, this doesn't even look like an actual Mario Brothers adaptation (there are many things in this movie that are not connected to the original games). It looks like a completely different fantasy film with just a few elements of the video games added in. I have never actually played Super Mario Bros. and I don't exactly hate this film. But still, the entire movie is flat, dull, and very uninteresting. If you absolutely love Nintendo, then stay away from the Super Mario Bros movie. Nothing in the film works.Grade: D"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible with a capital T","review":"This movie was screwed up all kind of ways.It wasn t even like the video game or even the cartoon.For example,King Kopa didn t look like how he supposed to be and the storyline seem like it was written by a 4 year old.I wonder if the director was on drugs while he was making this so called movie.To all the people that didnt see this movie,you don t need to because you will regret it.Its so bad that it will be perfect to be shown on MST3K."},{"rating":"1","title":"Certainly not the Worst Movie Ever!","review":"This is definately worthy of the MST3K treatment. It's really lame! Super Mario Bros. is about as playful and challenging as an unplugged pinball machine.

It's the Mushroom Kingdom*Toad is not in this movie (dumb)*Yoshi was more cartoony and can talk in the games*More than HALF of the enemy characters are missing in this movieAND MANY MORE!But don't panic you'll get a good chuckle from the EXTREME bad acting!

I admit it's different from the games. I wasn't born when the movie came out but I rented it. The film is a little weird at times. Like that evolution thing. The special effects are convincing enough. There's something I don't get. The film was relaesed in 1993. That's the same year jurassic park was released and it used cgi. So was this film made before CGI or what? If it did use cgi that would have been great! The idea of changing Bowser from a fire breathing monster into a human is silly. The film would have looked better if it was animated like the tv series so the can animate the enimies which would be easier. Too bad there isn't a sequel.

It might have been better if things could be more like the game, but if it were it would probably lose alot in the translation, and like a contapositive of a statement means the same thing, the translation to movie and the translation of things like goombas, they even out for a pretty good movie.

Think of all the terrible video game movies that came after it! Mario looks far superior in comparison.Overall, I ask that you put aside your vision of a Mario film and clear your mind of the traditional imagery in the games. You will see that Super Mario Bros. was a very unique take on a property that doesn't lend itself to live action film. I tip my hat to those involved in the actual creation & direction of the movie, since there was a lot of behind the scenes issues.Hopefully, we'll see an anniversary edition materialize in a year or so."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny","review":"This movie is very funny and entertaining but using the Mario Brothers name maybe they shouldn't have."},{"rating":"2","title":"my kids love it","review":"my boys are 10 and 13 and they've seen this movie once a long time ago and recently asked me to see about getting it for them.

Super Mario Brothers goes beyond horrid! It seems as though nothing was thought out when writing the script for this movie and it does not resemble the game by Nintendo in anyway. If they had slapped a different name on this and changed the names of some of the characters I think this movie could have received 1.5 stars rather than just 1.

As an adult however, I've gotta say I have a new found love for this movie. As a re-imagining it's not bad, it's creative, and dammit, Dennis Hopper was epic in whatever he did!

Mostly, the problem is that this movie derrived from a video game. Some people dislike it because it comes from a video game and others hate it because it is too unlike the game. Admittedly, if there were some name and costume changes, this movie could be called something besides \\"Super Mario Bros.\\".In any case, how good would the movie be if it featured a little plumber running through a bunch of turtles and jumping on to a flagpole? If it were too similar to the video game, many viewers would turn away (however, its unlikeness to the game has turned away some gamers). In any case, this movie is a lot of fun to watch.

I'm not going to say it wasn't \\"realistic,\\" it's not meant to be. I mean, jeez, look at the game! I will say that I wish it had more in common with the game... too much was changed, in my opinion. Luigi is a young guy (with no moustache!), Toad is some kind of hippie, and the Goombas are shrunken-head dinos. I suppose most people would expect things to be more similar to the original, just like they'd expect a movie based on a book to be similar. I also got the impression that the writer/director really wasn't familiar with the game, maybe that's why there were so many changes.

True, the cast seems a bit awkward, but that thought fades away once you see how tough Bob Hoskins makes Mario look. Ever wanted to hear Mario say \\"C'mon kid...we're going in\\"?

Who cares!?Even if you completely ignore the video game origins (which this movie fouls up miserably), this movie does not work on its own as intelligible entertainment. The movie feels like a poorly directed stage play, with everyone pitching for the last row, but not campy or quotable enough to be memorable.For those of you who think this is an overlooked gem, I direct you to the climax, where Koopa basically stands in the same spot on a walkway for 20 minutes, while clichéd, cartoonish \\"action\\" unfolds on the same recycled sets around him.Another movie that tries to be everything and only succeeds at being boring and mildly nauseating.

Watch and judge for yourself, but I became quite sour on these guys due to this, though I love their music and I'm sure this feeling will subside, but the DVDs are in the trash. There is ZERO opportunity to \\"get in to the song\\" with all of the viewing changes. There are so many awesome live concert videos available from numerous bands, but PT DVDs are NOT them! Sorry PT fans, but you must have received different DVDs than I. But do go and buy ALL of their CDs. Great Band!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"Wow, how bad does it get.It was a chore to read this book. It contains the most unlikely and implausible plot. The characters seemed to be conjured up and very unreal. Not interesting, not funny, not entertaining and it was really hard work to get through it.I droppped my copy in the trash bin when I finished reading it. There is no way I could ever read it again and I wouldn't want to inflict it on anyone else.I've never felt this way about any other book. It was awful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, but not as good as TGN2","review":"The mix is good, and I liked almost all the tracks, but there was just something misssing in the cd that only TGN2 had. There was more hard trance/goa in TGN2, and TGN3 is more regular trance, which is still really good. My favorite track on this cd is \\"Madagascar\\" by Art of Trance, it just has an awesome background beat. I'm a stern follower of the TGN series, and I think it's one of the better trance mix series out there. TGN3 is a great cd, and I recommend it to anyone who is a trance lover, or hasn't experienced trance yet. Better yet, get this and TGN2, and you'll really be trancin' it up! =)"},{"rating":"2","title":"High Quality","review":"This cd was at one point one of my most over played. I have moved on to brighter prospects. The cd has many slow moments of relentless repetative sounds that blend together so effortlessly due to their lack of individualism. However the last track Katria is a wonderous magical piece that creates an awesome world in my mind. The beats are very basic and driving, but still get the job done. I feel as far as compilation discs go, it is above average."},{"rating":"2","title":"TGN 3","review":"When I first heard this CD, I loved it from the get go. The music is very hypnotic, while at the same time it infuses you with a lightening bolt of high powered trance trip'n. This makes an excellent medium for visualization (the internal kind, not the video kind), meditation, and just trancing out. Oh yeah, and dance. Dance, dance, and dance to this badboy. Even at 56 years old, I can feel the electric current going through me like I was made of copper. Did I mention it's downright sensuous too...oooeee baby, it sure'nuff is."},{"rating":"2","title":"short and sweet","review":"This is a basic book on how your thoughts are vibrations.

It teaches the same things as the other metaphysical books, but with fewer words. Examples would be like the acronym F.E.A.R., false evidense appearing real; what you think about expands; staying positive and removing limiting beliefs by replacing them with a corresponding empowering belief. Example would be \\"I am a good speller\\" instead of \\"I am a bad speller.\\" If you don't want to wade through thousands of words on metaphysical truths but would rather have the short, abridged version of metaphysical self help, then buy this. Also Maxwell Maltz's book called Psycho-Cybernetics which I think was published back in 1960 would be a good complement to this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Before You Think Another Thought","review":"Short and sweet.

It is easy to read and the thought process is well developed.There is no question that your circumstances are a direct result of your thought process. While this is a difficult concept for most folks to grasp, it is true and Doyle does a good job of leading the reader to this conclusion.The book is written in simple terms and has a fairly good set of exercises in the appendix.While the concepts are simple, like any process that requires you to change, they are not necessaily easy. In fact the author cautions against trying to make massive changes in your life. Rather giving the sound advice of taking small steps and making one change at a time.These concepts are not new. But they are presented in a fresh and easy to understand manner and can serve as a great way to reinforce what you may have been taught by others.It is certainly worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic book!

I had hoped the ultra-wide photos (which was my main reason for going with this camera) also would be ultra sharp, but instead they tended to be soft. The camera has a lag time of about 1/10th of a second, so it's more of a point, shoot and wait camera.The V705 may be okay for posting internet images or enlarging to small prints, but don't expect the sharpness typical of better quality cameras. In my opinion, the camera squeezes too much out of a JPEG photo by way of compression and shooting TIF files just isn't practical.I demand better image quality from my cameras and, when zooming in, I like to see detail.

Sylvester was Sylvester and this book makes it a point to stress it while documenting his short life. His life, intertwined with the Cockettes, the Disquotays, and his work with Martha and Izora (Two Tons of Fun, The Weathergirls, C+C Music Factory, Black Box, etc.) reflect the depth and response to the radical social changes taking place in America. Sylvester's life and times are true inspiration to those seeking to institute radical personal change.I was much too young to enjoy the true disco days, but I remember listening to 7\\" records of \\"Dance (Disco Heat)\\" and \\"You Make Me Feel (Mighty Real)\\" as a youth.

The answer is no. I didn't like the movie at all. I may have seen the Exorcist too many times but I think that the movie wasn't scary enough to keep me satisfied. It wasn't a surprise that I was dissappointed after seeing it. It's absolutely not a horror movie only a good psychic thriller. I think that the fault is all Ira Levin's and his original book.

After seeing the Exorcist, no other scary movie compares. This had an easy plot to follow, lots of chanting, and a bunch of crazy witches saying Hail Satan! The scariest part of this movie is the FBI warning at the beggining. I gave it two stars for the opening song, but other than that skip it. Almost as stupid as The Other. Not The Others, The Other. The Exorcist is way better, and I'm not a die hard Exorcist fan, The Exorcist is simply the Scariest movie ever, because demonic possesion is very real. I was \\"privleged\\" to witness one, and I still have nightmares to this day. This is another dumb anti-christ movie. The only good one was The Omen.

This movie, along with Chinatown, shows Polanski is at his most suggestive and subtle.He absolutely reaches the ideal that Hemingway talked about with \\"90% of the story submerged beneath the surface\\"--only Polanski does it on film in a way that no one else has done before or since.Hail Satan!Err..Hail Polanski!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic Tale Of Naivety","review":"100 years from now, actress Mia Farrow will be remembered in her role in this classic \\"horror\\" movie, much more than her current role as an activist with the United Nations (UN).

She ends up being used, conned and abused. It teaches you not to be too trusting with people with strange practices and behaviours.If you're looking for scary scenes based on 21st century digital standards, there are none.

I've found that horror flicks shot in the 60s and 70s tend to be dull and lackluster, absent of any real scares. Of course, many have good plots, which is why Hollywood ressurects them from time to time with new casts, etc. But, Rosemary's Baby really stands the test of time. There are some genuinely suspenseful and \\"spooky\\" moments - and it's a clever movie as well. I'd definately recommend it, and I'm a pretty tough critic.Just by way of background, and while other reviewers seems to prefer to reveal much of the story and plot, I think that sort of ruins the film in many cases.

The genius of the film is that it juxtaposes the mundane with the most beastly and achieves it with little graphic violence. The carnage occurs mostly off-screen and we see the crowd in the street or hear the terrible news over the phone just as we would in real-life.Polanski plays (or preys) masterfully on natural human paranoia and allows the viewer's imagination to construct the most heinous outcome.

I felt this was one of Roman Polanski's best directed films. Well written script leaves the viewer wondering until the final few minutes whether or not the central character is truly a victim or simply paranoid. Dialogue closely follows Ira Levin's novel. Unfortunately, younger viewers used to special effects or gore may be put off or bored by the lack of both. Horror and tension is created instead with dialogue and the viewer's imagination."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn.","review":"The TV Guide called it probably the best horror movie ever made. This was supposed to be a classic? I guess it was a classic con-job. Mia's character, or was it just Mia, was so unbelievable. The whole tale seems so, simplistic? Oh let's not go over for dinner, oh we will, oh it is so ironic Guy's suddenly taken a liking to his neighbors. The 'suggestions' and red-herrings didn't help much in alleviating the pain of a sad non-ending. I would recommend this to film buffs only. For me, at the end of two and a half hours, it felt like nothing much had happened."},{"rating":"1","title":"I dont get it?","review":"I am a very big fan of horror movies, I have been snice I was around 5 or so. This was on sometime during Hallooween on AMC, and it was always one of the \\"100 Most Horror Movies\\" on Bravo. When I watched it before that show was on I saw a few parts and though to myself when does the good part come?..But I ended up about to fall asleep so I taped it, but not every part came on, then I watched it again and though to myself this is not even scary what makes it so scary?...The movies mostly about a young women and her husband who want a kid, then when she gets it(supposly she's rapped by the devil), and her kids the devil living inside her, but nothing really scary happened I was pretty dispointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of a good plot","review":"I thought that this movie was going to be scary, and terrifying. In the end, it was stupid and meaningless. The plot was good, but it was played out all wrong. It was a waste of a good 2 and a half hours and it was one of the worst movies I have ever seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck!","review":"Rosemary's Baby starring Mia Farrow is a total disaster. The ending is cheesy, what was Roman Polanski thinking? This horror flick is considered a classic but I think it's a muddled mess. Stay away from this turkey."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sort of well filmed. But a bad story.","review":"Nothing much to say here. It's well filmed, but it's the story I don't like. I like happy endings. Don't expect a happy ending on this one. Very disturbing."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst ever.","review":"This stands out in my mind as one of the biggest wastes of time I ever spent watching a movie. The name of the movie is Rosemary's Baby, the whole movie centers around awaiting the birth of the baby, and after all is said and done, we spend a lot of time being bored and not seeing the baby. Total rip-off. Save your time and money. This movie is complete garbage, regardless of the decent acting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Masterpiece.","review":"First off it was made by a Perv, Second it is creepy with everybody in on it type of thing, and it's representative of the era and Hollywood's Obsession with The Bizarre and Plain dumb. Masterpiece? NO."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long and boring","review":"I can summarize why I didn't like this movie pretty quickly. It was long and boring, and the antichrist wasn't born until about the end of the movie, and then it was over. Nothing really interesting really happened. I felt like it was a waste of time. If you want a good movie about the incarnation of the antichrist, what The Omen, it's much more worth the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rosemarys Boring","review":"This movie was not as good as it seems. When i first rented it, I thought it was going to be pretty good considering I like classic horror films. But to my belief, it was very boring. The begining was pretty interesting with the couple looking for an appartment to rent, and the dead body in the begining/middle. But after a while it was very bland. Especially the part where she gets pregnant. I actually laughed during one part where she was \\"floating on a bed in the middle of the ocean\\". I rated it one star only because of the connections the movie made at the end with all of its characters. There was only one exciting part where i was saying to myself, \\"finally\\" but then it ended very quickly. I thought her decision was ludacris at the end. Don't waist two hours like i did watching this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Handy fishing companion","review":"Fits in my pocket when I go fishing - I read a bit after I cast the line.

This is most evident when you look at the etchings and woodcuts. If you have seen the originals, they are crisp, clean and beautiful. In this book, they are little better than black smudges, with no fine detail visible. The tale in it's completeness is one thing. The etchings and woodcuts should add a beauty and delight to the whole experience of reading and owning this book. This version, printed on poor quality paper, is a huge disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing - not good for a 2 year old","review":"This was very disappointing, we bought the Bob the Builder version for our 2 year old, and he had the same problems as the previous reviewer with stickers ripping. The reusability factor was also not there, after a 2 year old pulling them off and trying to reapply them just the first time, they were curling up at all the edges and not staying sticky. The other problem with this book is that the pages are non-contiguous posters, which means for him to use them as whole pictures, without pulling out 3 staples and then losing posters and stickers. All in all, I agree with the previous reviewer that this is a very poor book for little kiddos."},{"rating":"2","title":"A big hit!","review":"My 23-month-old LOVES this sticker book. He has been using it almost every day for a month, and he still loves it. I sit with him while he plays with it to help him bring the edges of the stickers up from the pages.

This is a person with such a versatile voice. We find him on the musical stage in his \\"Broadway\\" voice, then we find him singing pop selections with a strong resemblance to Tom Jones! Then he surprises us with beautiful ballads. His rendition of \\"Bring Him Home\\" and \\"Send in the Clowns\\" show great mastery. Not many can sing \\"Bring Him Home\\" and really do it justice. Any legit singer will admit that anyone can belt out a song, but a quality singer can sing softly with a controlled, beautiful, and rich tone. Michael accomplishes this--it's just gorgeous. The album has something for everyone and showcases Michael's range and skill. You feel mellow one moment and then he makes you want to jump and shout!! Really enchanting---run to get your copy. Hats off to you, Michael!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Delicious","review":"This is a wonderful, quiet and relaxing CD that I find Iput on quite often.

He is so over-acting, no subtlety whatsover. It sounded amateurish and over-done. I hope he learns how to town down in the future. His take on \\"The Winner Takes it All\\" is so softy in approach. Please, no more over the top performace. Only Barbra Streisand can pull that one!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Again!","review":"I keep hoping that Ball will release an album that isn't as overproduced as his vibrato but I have yet to hear it. How can an album this uncreative seem so pretentious? I wish Ball would follow in the footsteps of Bernadette Peters, Patti LuPone and others who have toned down their vocals and orchesrations and give us a more intimate and diverse look at what he can do. Please save the theatrics for the Original Cast Albums!Just my opinion.JMF"},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE THIS CD !!!!","review":"Michael puts so much passion and feeling into everything he sings.This CD really high lights his great talent and range.

I listen to this CD everyday because it is so relaxing &I love all the songs on it. One of my favorites is BRING HIM HOME. I have just about all of his CD's but I think this is my favorite.

After only 3 months of use it literally blew up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Buy!","review":"I bought this coffeemaker as a gift for my sister and was so embarrassed when she took it out of the box. First, the plastic top is extremely cheap and flimsy, and the whole thing broke off the first time we flipped it back. There was also a grey powder film over the whole appliance. Finally, it is just not good looking at all...extremely cheap in appearance. It did not even make it to the countertop before we had it back in the box and on its way back to Amazon. I went with the Bosch on their reputation for the greatest dishwashers. Evidently, another company designs and manufacturers their small appliances. DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM!!!! Get the Braun KF550-BK AromaDeluxe instead!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wouldn't buy again","review":"We bought this coffeemaker to replace a Melitta. This unit is much taller, barely fits under the cabinets in our kitchen. The carafe is a strange design, have to turn it almost upside down to get all the liquid out. The device that forces water through the filter is narrow, so when I tried to use my re-usable filter, most of the coffee did not even get wet and made a poor pot of coffee; you have to use a paper filter. The dripper drips every time you take the pot off, even though it has a stopper device, which splashes and makes a mess. The mess is more evident because the coffeemaker is white. The coffee it makes is marginal, seems to take more coffee to make it ordinary strength. I would not recommend this coffeemaker."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good","review":"Purchased this coffee maker about 3 weeks ago, it is a simple design and makes a decent cup of coffee. 2 hour timer is nice. anti-spill feature is also a plus.

This book seemed like an attempt to get attention in 1949 for his teaching skills. He my have been a good teacher but he wasn't a good writer.The Thread That Runs So True never caught my attention. The book was dull and boring. The book wasn't worth my $14.00. Jesse Stuart gets too much in detail with his story. A lot of the time he is talking about his money troubles and give us acual estimates. The Chicago Sun my have said \\"stuart's joy for living illuminates every page.\\" but I never saw that illumination.

From the one room school house with 20 year old students still mired in the first grade to brilliant students from impoverished backgrounds. A terrific review and account of cultural conditions in the 1930's, from the depression to WWII. A must read for educators/teachers. Many of the methods and means used by the author will shock and surprise today's readers, but this is Kentucky in the 1930's. Imagery depicted is fantastic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mountain School","review":"I gave The Thread that Ran so True by Jesse Stuart a four out of a five because it was a great story and it was based on a real story. The Thread Thats Runs So True was published in 1949. Stuart was able to teach kids from the ages of five to twenty with a few minor set backs. He had some unusual experiences and had some unusual students. They would like to mess with Jesse Stuart because he was the youngest teacher and he went from high school to teaching without collage.

Her portrayal of the lonely spinster Judith Hearne is impeccable. The scene where she drinks alone is really heartbreaking. Bob Hoskins is equally good as James Madden who broke her heart due to mutual misunderstanding. In fact, there is no bad acting in this movie. I, however, have conflicting feelings about the concluding scenes (Madden visiting Hearne at the hospital) which are not in the novel. These might be the only scenes showing clearly Madden's lonliness and really draw a balance between the two main characters. But the character of Madden is made a little too desperate for money here and somewhat contradictory to how he behaves in the rest of the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Are you kidding me!","review":"I'm not sure how I have managed to miss this release. This is an outstanding live record. Everyone is really letting it happen and they deliver a fine performance. If you're a Yellowjackets fan, you should already have this release, if you are new to modern jazz, this is a great place to start. These guys are at the very top of the modern jazz world and this record shows why. You get great jazz played on electric instruments with their own unique voice. This is not smooth jazz, this is real jazz and thank God for that. I know a lot of people that are hesitant to try anything modern for the fear that it's really just Kenny G. in disguise. This is not the case with the Yellowjackets. There is a ton of great modern jazz out there that is real jazz and this is a great place to start. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great bike for the price I paid...","review":"I bought two of these bikes, before Christmas and when they were selling for one-fifty, which was an awesome price for an awesome bike. The bikes were relatively easy to put together - you have to install the handle-bars, seat post and seat, from wheel and the front disk brake (the only really tricky part), and it took me about an hour. Everything else is pre-assembled, and that is done very well too.The quality of the bike is just great - everything feels really solid and well-built. My only complaint is that for an all-aluminum frame they are surprisingly heavy, so even with the 21 speeds this is not a good bike for anyone living in a particularly hilly area.But even at two-fifty, these bikes are half the price of comparable comfort bikes at your local bike shop, and you can't even find comfort bikes with disk brakes from what I can see, so that makes the deal for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good bicycle","review":"I bought this bike for my wife.

You gotta be extremely careful when inserting a cd. The arm where the cd holder sits (i believe the lens runs along this part) will considerably move downwards to the slightest force. I agree with Bruce from NY. I don't want this cd player even for free. After returning this product I purchased a Sony cd player. Sure it was more expensive, but is working fine. Believe me, you'll regret purchasing this Memorex MD3020 cd player."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth your money","review":"These DVD's are not worth your money!

Waist of your money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A GRIPPING AND INSPIRING HISTORY","review":"IN THE HEART OF THE SEA by Nathaniel Philbrick tells the tragic and amazing story of the Essex, a Nantucket whaler that sank after being rammed by a mammoth sperm whale in the South Pacific in November of 1820.If the story of the whale attack and loss of the ship weren't enough, the harrowing tale of how the crew attempted to make it back to New England through the open sea in nothing more than open whaleboats, while experiencing everything from shark attacks to cannibalism, has to be one of the most gripping and inspiring tales ever recorded.Philbrick is masterful in his treatment of the story from start to finish. Drawing upon journals and writings of survivors--used in their day to inspire Herman Melville's masterpiece, Moby Dick--Philbrick offers a concise historical narrative."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating","review":"What a great book. It's not amazingly written but the story is so engrossing it doesn't matter. I was completely enthralled the whole way through."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly Recommend, A Page Turner","review":"I have read all the accounts of the Essex demise and this book gives balance to both Owen Chase's account and that of Captain George Pollard. I had a hard time putting this book down. One is amazed of what these men did to survive. I will not give away any details but I assure you, you will be mesmerized. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a tale with the right mixture of history and adventure. Being a regular of Nantucket for the past 30 years, I was enchanted of the accounts of life on the island in its glory years and life on the high seas. A page turner, you will love this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Astounding Story","review":"I learned about the story of the Essex in researching my family history. Captain George Pollard, Matthew Joy and Owen Coffin are all distant relations. Philbrick does an excellent job taking the reader along on this fateful, dark journey. This is a grim, harrowing story and it's hard to read. However, I came away amazed and respectful of the courage these men demonstrated- especially the young Owen Coffin. I also appreciate Philbrick's sensitivity. When things get pretty dismal, Philbrick relieves the reader by interjecting educational explanations for what is happening and why. This book is a must read for anyone interested in Nantucket history, Moby Dick or inspirational stories of human courage and perseverance. The sea is not for the timid!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A suggestion.","review":"This account of an epic adventure suffered from what I'd call \`reportage'. As I read this exciting book I found myself longing for the enthralling descriptive power of Patrick O'Brian marvelous prose. So imagine my joy in discovering -The Unknown Shore- by O'Brian! The final part of that book is strikingly similar to - In the Heart of the Sea-. O'Brian's masterful capacity to evoke the verisimilitude of his sailor's plight wonderfully enhanced my memory the Essex book. I was so pleased!"},{"rating":"2","title":"When men were men","review":"I grew up in New England and have visited Nantucket on many occasions. After reading this book my last visit to the whaling museum gave the whalejaws, the harpoons, the whaleboats and other artifacts new meaning.Whaling was an extraordinarily demanding and dangerous endeavor even when the whales were \\"well-behaved.\\" In this story, we have the drama of the Moby Dick theme coupled with a survival story that is amazing in and of itself.I found the writing excellent and the story well told. If readers have a chance to visit a whaling museum it will give the read a bit of an extra punch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thar She Blows!","review":"After having visited Nantucket many times for summer vacation, this book lends a great view of the historical island in it's real pretext. Although this is one of the most incredible adventure stories I have read, it is gruesome and tragic. The tragedy of the whaling ship Essex, makes Earnest Shakeltons antartic expedition look like a holiday in Bermuda. This book is not for the faint of heart, but it is none the less a miraculous account of human endurance, survival, and courage of the human spirit. It is astounding the adversity that we, as humans, are capable of overcoming. This book also gives quite a bit of insight into the gory world of 19th century whaling. I won't go into detail."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't Put It Down","review":"If you are looking for a fast read that is not \\"fluff,\\" but intellectual and well-written, then pick up a copy of In the Heart of the Sea. I bought the book based upon its topic and the fact that it had won the Book Award, not based upon any interest in the history of whaling or Nantucket. But I left the book feeling that I had ventured into a little part of the past that I would still care to know more about. It's also a great book to read along with Shackelton's story in the book entitlted South. The two books showcase vastly differing outcomes that resulted from decisions made in the face of tragedy at sea."},{"rating":"2","title":"An interesting book","review":"The story of the Essex is interesting to me, and this book fueled that interest and presented it very nicely. It is a little long in parts, but still very good. I would have liked to have learned more about sperm whales in the book.I definitely recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic American survival story....great read","review":"I finally bought this book after seeing it in a store in Newport a few years ago. I felt that the descriptions of whaling practices and historical accounts of events were well placed and well explained. One example, at one point in the book I was thinking that a simple map of the Essex's route from Nantucket to the Pacific would be a nice reference and then a few pages later there was the map. Also, the portrayal of the story by Philibrick was an excellent account of early whaling and early Nantucket. In my opinion, the story of the Essex tragedy is one that should be much better known.I would highly recommend purchasing this book if you are interested in Whaling history or stories of the sea."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read","review":"Exciting story of survival that will keep you wanting to read more with each chapter. A very well told true story!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Story","review":"As a nonfiction and disaster buff, of course this book caught my eye. This amazing story of survival was made all the better by Philbrick's skill at story-telling. The book is never dull. And he not only describes the shipwreck, but the whaling business and it's culture in detail. With frequent allusions to other shipwrecks and disasters, this story has only piqued my interest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific 175 year old Whaling tale- Basis of Moby Dick!","review":"An absolute stunner ,beginning with the history of whaling in Nantucket, an island settled by Quakers in the 1600's. Though 1 or 2 other reviewers suggest the meanness of the crew, I would state that, given the horrendous circumstances, all 18 showed a great degree of comraderie. Traveling through the Atlantic and Pacific ocean with a few stops in S. America and the Galapagos, their ship is attacked by sunk an angry whale, who may have sought revenge for the whaler's attacks on his fellow sperm whales. Splitting into 3 groups in small whaling boats, the survivors do everything feasible to stay together and stay alive, though 3 (smart ones) decide to remain on the proverbial desert island. while others continue their awe-inspiring voyage. If cannibalism repels you, as it does us all, here is a situation where this beastliness was actually condoned. All in all, a great book, destined to be a classic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I wonder what wine goes with that?","review":"Like many other reviewers, I couldn't put this one down. This is a gripping tale of survival in the face of terrible circumstances, and also an interesting history lesson on the whaling port of Nantucket. I really felt sorry for the crew lost at sea in those tiny boats, dealing eventually with cannabalism, the very fate they sought to avoid by the Captain's poor navigational decision. As moved as I was by this particular crew's fate, I was even more moved by Philbrick's description of life on a whaling ship. How miserable! And doing that for two years at a time for miserable wages!! When I think my job sucks, I think of those poor sailors trying out a whale on the deck of that small ship in the dark, and I immediately feel better."},{"rating":"2","title":"A RIP-ROARING ADVENTURE!","review":"I am only about 2/3 through this book, but just have to say it is the most rip-roaring adventure book I have ever read! It is full of information about the early 1800s, the whaling industry, the sea, and about whales that I have never known. It is all fascinating! Although I am a girl (ahem!), I am loving every word of this book, as I also loved THE ENDURANCE and INTO THIN AIR and A FIRST RATE TRAGEDY recently, not to mention TARZAN, FRANKENSTEIN, etc. from years back. This book is highly recommended whether you fancy yourself an adventurer (armchair adventurers okay) or not."},{"rating":"2","title":"a historian who can write...","review":"In November 1820 the Nantucket whaleship Essex was attacked by an angry spermwhale, 1,500 miles off the coast of Peru. This is the true story that inspired Melville to write Moby Dick. After the Essex sank, the 20 crew members took to the open seas of the central Pacific in three whale boats. In the Heart of the Sea is a historian's account of the Nantucket whaling industry, the personalities of individuals, the destruction of the Essex and the three-month open-boat journey plagued by thirst, hunger, cannibalism, and bad management decisions. The book reads as smoothly as any novel yet is backed up by the authority of years of research by a historian specializing in Nanctucket Island (off the Cape Cod peninsula in Massachusetts)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Paperback is $5 less than Kindle version","review":"I purchased the paperback version instead of the Kindle version because it was $5 less from Amazon. That is the reason for removing one star. I have just started reading the book and appears to be worth the read hence the 4 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lack of Leadership leads to Cannibalism by Nantucket whalers","review":"I found this book to be a fascinating look at the decisions people make in real life that lead to unintended consequences, or, in this case, to the actual consequences they feared the most. The author's descriptions of the Nantucket life style and insular home situations show how they men managed to hang together in even the direst of circumstances. The descriptions of whaling make this a real true life \\"Moby Dick\\" story. The author puts us in the boat with the whalers and in the end we understand the decisions each man took, whether it was: to abandon the boat for an island, to die of starvation, to draw straws, to eat their fellow humans. The line between what makes a person a human or an animal is explored in an insightful and compassionate way. Well Done, I hope I have written as well about the changes on youth caused by warfare in my own book \\"Rough Enough\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"And we complain about being thirsty...","review":"This book is a wonderfully written true tale of the disaster of the whaleship Essex. This crew of Nantucketers and off-islanders endured the most horrible adventure at sea. An enourmous Sperm Whale rams the boat and sends these men into a 90-day whirlwind of starvation, dehydration, delusion, despair, insanity, death, and eventual recovery. The way Nathaniel Philbrick depicts every aspect of their hellish journey puts you at the helm. I highly recommend this book for those who want to know what REALLY happened to the crew of the whaleship Essex back in the early 19th century, and how Melville was inspired to write his famous novel \\"Moby Dick\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining, gripping narrative","review":"This true story of the whaleship Essex caught and held my attention as I read through it as quickly as I could. Even though non-fiction, it reads like an adventurous novel---a much better read than Moby Dick.The author includes the historical context and taps several sources to provide details about the tragedy, as well as the whaling industry.I think this book has what it takes to appeal to all readers. It is insightful, reavealing, entertaining and suspenseful while being entirely unique.My wife and I both read it within a week and highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great book but Kindle price is insane","review":"An excellent book that I thoroughly enjoyed. Bought the paperback for less than $3, yet Amazon & the greedy publisher think I'd be dumb enough to pay $13 for the Kindle ebook??? Was thinking about buying a Kindle. After looking at the Kindle prices of most books still covered by copyright, though, I definitely will not. I can buy the REAL book for about the same price brand-new in most cases, and substantially cheaper if I buy a used copy. Besides a truly backward price, with a Kindle version I'd also lose the ability to do any of the following: lend out my books anytime I want to anybody I choose, donate them to libraries or secondhand stores, or trade them in for credit towards other books at a used bookstore. Net result: current ebooks = epic FAIL on value."},{"rating":"1","title":"Go to the source","review":"If you want to be enthralled by the story of the Essex, go to the source -- any one of the printings of Essex first mate Owen Chase's first-hand account in his \\"Wreck of the Whaleship Essex\\".His narrative takes you on the ship and grips you with the terror these men must have felt, adrift at sea with little food or water.Philbrick's retelling of the story doesn't capture the detail as well as one who was actually there.However, if you're looking for a history lesson on whaling, this one's not bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"No up to expectations","review":"The book was alleged to be \\"new\\" but the cover showed considerable wear. I think it was probably read and then offered for sale as \\"new\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"To many comparisons for a real story","review":"You can't tell is a great story when the story is real, here the writer tells us a real story and he writes things to compare the reality of that story with other stories, if you are writing a real story you don't have to compare it with anything, just tell the story and that's it.In the other hand your will read many times that it was a sunny day, then a rainy day, the a storm day, you just get tired of reading the same in all the chapters.In the main story you will learn that when happened a human tragedy, this tragedy is because were made several errors, not just one, and that was what happened to this crew.For ME, the last chapter is the epilogue and the epilogue doesn't have to be written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read it aloud - in one sitting! Riveted!","review":"My boyfriend and I were on an 8 hour car trip and I had picked up this book out of curiosity. I started to read a passage to him that I enjoyed, and before I knew it, I was reading the ENTIRE book to him--we finished it on the drive! We even read it during our pitstops, we were so into it.Now, we are not sailing buffs--...-so I was surprised that I enjoyed this so much. Truly, folks--the disbelief this book leaves you with is priceless. One of the aspects I enjoy the most is that the author has obviously done his homework and lets you in on what these people SHOULD have done...and then tells you what they actually DID... These men were, in every way, to put it eloquently, extremely SCREWED. We found it almost hilarious, though a little grotesque at times. :pThis is NO Shackleton expedition...THOSE boys all came out of it ALIVE............Read it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A page turning model for MOBY DICK","review":"Philbrick writes a fascinating account of the struggles of the crew of the whaleship Essex after a disasterous encounter with a sperm whale. He manages to capture the essence of the mindset of the inhabitants of Nantucket, the whaling center of the U.S., which explains many of the actions of the crew. The fight for survival is portrayed with both clarity and emotionalism. Having no previous knowledge of this calamity, I was amazed that at the time it had a similar impact in the 1800's that the Titanic had in the 1900's. It was enlightening that this tragedy served as the inspiration for Melville's, Moby Dick, which I consider to be one of the masterpieces of American literature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent read","review":"I found this to be one of the most engaging books I have read in a long time. I read it in three nights and was sad when it was over. The author appears to have done a LOT of research on this subject, amply illustrated by his extensive notes at the end of the book. It's great to read a book that is both well-researched and well-written. My only complaint, a small one, is that I wish he had spent more time discussing the racial dynamics of the crew. Unlike some authors, Philbrick definitely didn't ignore this topic. But when the African-American members of the boats die off and are eaten, one by one, I was totally incredulous. How could this have happened? I thought Philbrick could have spent more time discussing other historic shipwrecks where there were racial issues involved. Perhaps, however, there really wasn't enough data to go on. Anyway, as I said, I greatly enjoyed this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"One of the best and most interesting books I have ever read. I highly recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"In The Heart of the Family","review":"Philbrick's award winning non-fiction retelling of the Essex tragedy captured my attention as a tale of family tragedy. As a father of teenage sons, I kept trying to imagine the lives of those families torn apart by the whaling industry and the misfortunes of the \\"family\\" of men on this whaling journey. Though Philbrick paints an oversimplified picture of the Quaker village life of Nantucket, once at sea, this book is hard to throw overboard.For two other non-fiction books on the family, take a look at THE FAMILY CLOISTER: BENEDICTINE WISDOM FOR THE HOME (winner of the national Catholic Press Association \\"Family Life\\" Book Award 2000), by David Robinson; and also by Robinson, THE CHRISTIAN FAMILY TOOLBOX: 52 BENEDICTINE ACTIVITIES FOR THE HOME (Crossroad, September 2001)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Complete","review":"Philbrick puts together a tale that transforms you into a crew member. The thrill of the chase, the fear of the dangers, and the exasperations and futilities of all of a whaler's life. He creates great scenarios without bogging down in too many details. The text and writing style moves you smoothly through all the pages to the end. Great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another review of a widely read book","review":"This a recent book of a history that happened a long time ago, for all of you few people who thought this was going to be some sort of definitive book, too bad. In the spirit of other adventure history books out there this is a really good quick read. I think the Author made a sincere attempt with the information available not to embellish. Also try:Seabiscuit: An American LegendandShadow Divers: The True Adventure of Two Americans Who Risked Everything to Solve One of the Last Mysteries of World War II."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Enjoyable","review":"I really appreciate how Philbrick writes his non-fiction. I have read four of his books now and they read like historical fiction (but they not...). His \\"Notes\\" chapter is very complete and the bibliography is excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible tale, well-told","review":"I came to this book as a fan of Melville's 'Moby Dick', having recently re-read it and wanting more. That the climax of Moby Dick is taken from an actual incident, and further, that Melville's Ahab might in fact be loosely based on an actual person (the Essex's first mate Chase) is fascinating to me. Also, it is astounding to read about and consider what the men when through during their three months in the open whaleboats after the Essex sank. Philbrick augments this part of the narrative with information gleaned from contemporary medical studies and accounts of persons who have been subject to starvation and lethal dehydration.I can't imagine what it must have been like to contemplate eating the flesh of one's comrades in order to survive, to suck the marrow from their bones to avoid dying of thirst. Incomprehensible."},{"rating":"2","title":"A harrowing 19th disaster story","review":"Philbrick's book reads a lot like Sebastian Junger's \\"The Perfect Storm.\\" Like Junger, he details life in a fishing community and documents a seafaring trajedy that shook the town. Similar to Junger's description of drowning, Philbrick provides a graphic description of death by dehydration to emphasize what the fishermen were experiencing as they drifted for three months in open whaleboats on the vast Pacific Ocean. The main difference between Philbrick's account and Jungers is that some of Philbrick's fisherman lived to tell the tale. Philbrick is an excellent storyteller who brings his subject alive. Anyone with an interest in either the sea or a good adventure story will love this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"rewarding literature any reader can enjoy","review":"After arriving in the mail, it took but a few hours to indulge all Mr Philbrick had written about the 'Essex', and the life by which a Nantucketer lived in the apex of its whaling might. Mr Philbrick deftly combines the true events of the 'Essex' from numerous written accounts, details which fill in the story with the concepts of whaling, and superb analysis of physical and psychological effects of the events which the men endured. He also uses his own professional knowledge to speculate about certain events where true facts were missing.Through cementing all these , Mr Philbrick creates a work which engrosses the reader into what whaling meant to the men on those ships, and the gruesomeness of their daily lives. Mr Philbrick obviously did his homework for this novel, which results in a rewarding experience for the reader.HIGHLY recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow","review":"In The Heart of The Sea won the National Book Award for a reason. Philbrick's attention to detail, his research, and his style all make this incredibly tragic story come alive in a very fresh way. There were moments when I felt driven to tears, moments when I was completely disgusted, and moments when I couldn't help but laugh. This book is good for anyone interested in whaling, the ocean, survival stories, or just an amazing read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, a must read","review":"If you have any interest in American history, Nantucket whaling, or a great sea story....then you must read this book.

But he does more than tell of a ship smashed by a whale and the unfortunate survivors, he tells how they got to be months of sailing from home, out in the middle of the ocean hunting one of the largest mammals on the planet. That is the story of Nantucket and how it became the island that dominated the whale oil trade, about their customs and culture that allowed them to surpass many larger and better situated communities. It is an impressive tale and well worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Floats above others of the genre...","review":"A great read, both educational and entertaining, In the Heart of the Sea goes beyond a typical sea story and captures the time and space of a real event, trumping the famous fiction story (Moby Dick) that loosely rose from the history.Starting with a great adventure as its base, Philbrick has wrapped in many fascinating details of the time (the nantucket whaleing industry, the island's cultural roots, a geography lesson and social commentary).I bought this book following on some of the sea adventure stories I've read lately (including the fascinating story of Shackelton's travails (\\"Endurance\\")... and was pleased to find adventure and so much more.Run out to buy this and you'll have a suspensful read, a sailing story, and a history lesson all in one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrible Tragedy Wonderfully Told","review":"Philbrick deserves the praise given to Into the Heart of the Sea. In giving a historic account of the true story that gave inspiration for Herman Melville's Moby Dick, Philbrick unveils the world of the Nantucket whaling industry and the fate of one unfortunate crew. For a history book, this is a rich page-turner that is uncommon in its historic depth and compelling narrrative."},{"rating":"2","title":"A \\"real\\" Survivor story","review":"This is without question one of the more entertaining books I've ever had the pleasure to read. I had to keep reminding myself that it wasn't fiction. In fact, it has inspired me to read Moby Dick again. I think now I have a much greater appreciation for those who lived and sacrificed their lives on whale ships. I would recommend this book as a Father's Day gift for anyone who has an interest in history, or just enjoys a good adventure. Mr. Philbrick should be congratulated for his efforts!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not taught in 9th grade American History","review":"This was a hard one to put down. In vivid but tight language, the story of the Essex is gripping and the details of the culture of whaling and the hard life at sea are intriguing and informative. In the end we get to see how religion, social position and greed play together to tell the grim sort of story we rarely acknowledge as part of our American history. Well worth the time and suitable for non-historians for its high adventure. It made me want a big steak."},{"rating":"2","title":"No hesitation giving this 5 stars","review":"It is hard to imagine a greater adventure story. About 100 times while I was reading this book it crossed my mind that this story would make an awesome movie. I hope one day this happens. When I think of all the [...] that Hollywood puts out & then makes 2, 3 or 4 sequels of the same old stuff I scratch my head.The story is incredible & Nathaniel Philbrick does an excellent job of putting you there. He also makes it very clear that he has done a great job researching this story. Numerous times he refers to similar events that happened to other ships in the 1700 & 1800's. I think the last 1/4 of the book is detailed references & footnotes, very thorough indeed. He incorporates modern medical knowledge into the story as well. Of 300+ books I have read I would put this one in the top 10 of books I would recommend to others."},{"rating":"2","title":"So you want to be a whaler?

Big whale, little ship, cannibalization, fascinating characters - all great elements to create a compelling story.This is not the typical genre that I gravitate toward, but I found myself unable to put this book down. The descriptions of the whaling society in Nantucket hooked me from page one - and the story just would not let go.

However it does have some gruesome parts that classic stories like 'Moby Dick' and 'Two Years before the Mast' don't have. For instance there is much death and cannibilism. The story is told by a narrattor and is about how the Nantucket whaleship, the Essex, is wrecked by a sperm whale and how they must survive in three whaleboats with built up sides. The story is true and what the book, Moby Dick, is based on.This book is very imformative but I did not like the way it was written and it dragged in many parts.

David yearned to show Marissa a steamy night or two, even though his high-risk lifestyle had taught him to avoid long-term attachments and his sexy houseguest deserved someone permanent. Living with Marissa was tangling up his emotions something awful, and if he didn't know better he'd swear he was falling for her...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Paul Hoover's book is a wonderful compilation.","review":"The poems in Totem and Shadow, especially the newest work by Hoover, are so strong that style seems to drop away, as complex truths are given to the reader. This is a poetry of great intensity and brilliance."},{"rating":"2","title":"The complex made understandable","review":"What an informative, well-presented, clearly explained, must-have book! The practical details and concise, complete explanations take the mystery out of veneering. The five projects Mr. Burton walks the reader through answer questions I didn't realize I'd have until in the middle of a project.I thoroughly enjoyed his practical wit, the use of many low-tech (low-cost, too) techniques, and the in-depth way the pictures supplemented the text.I'll buy any woodworking book this man writes. He knows what he's talking about!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Of Limited Worth","review":"For the raw beginner wishing to gain an insight into the various methods of gluing veneer using a variety of different adhesives and their accompanying techniques, this book more than adequately serves to address this function. However, the all-important minutiae of veneering are not touched upon in any respect. The art of veneering lies not so much in the methods of gluing, but in the laying-out and trimming, particularly where the edges are concerned. An examination of any piece of pre 20th century cabinetwork will bear out this conclusion: the edges are blended with an almost surgical degree of precision to give the impression that the piece has been hewn from a solid piece of wood. This book's title should read: \\"A Beginner's Guide to Gluing Veneer\\" which is a far more accurate description of this book's contents and function."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pieces made in Columbia are unacceptable!","review":"I purchased the Finlandia pattern a few years back and the set was made in England- and is very nice. I wanted to add a few small plates and the ones that were shipped last week were stamped \\"Made in Columbia\\" on the back. They are nothing like the original set- some of the pattern is missing some ink (the same on all the plates) and are faded. Also the plate sizes seem a bit bigger/thicker than my original set. I can't believe this company does not have any quality control and think this is acceptable?!? I would only buy this china if I knew it was made in England...I wish it was specified on the product description. I read about the Made in England vs. Columbia in the reviews of this product and thought I'd take my chances. Well I lost- don't order these dishes unless you can make sure they ARE NOT made in Columbia!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick ship, good product","review":"Good product.

It deals with the conflicts between native people (Malayans) and Dutch tradesmen in the jungle of Borneo. It has some brilliant passages, but all in all it's a quite dull read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Tracy and Hepburn Film","review":"This is a disarming little movie about a woman athlete and her coach. It is a somewhat romantic comedy but it is more about developing a female athlete and coaching her to be a winner. Katherine Hepburn was apparently a terrific athlete and Garson and Kanin wrote their screenplay around her. It is not a raccuous or exaggerated romantic comedy like Adam's Rib or even Woman of the Year. It is much smaller but very charming. Take it for what it is and don't expect it to be like the other films. This is not what Pat and Mike are about."},{"rating":"2","title":"for Stevie","review":"Bought this for my daughter for a course she was taking at UF called Women in Films.

Watch for a VERY young Charles Bronson in his screen debut. He is hilarious as a bad guy that Katherine Hepburn beats up. It's awful funny watching little Hepburn beat up tough guy Bronson! That part had us all doubled over laughing. A young Chuck Connors also has a small part as the sheriff. It's definitely worth a watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pat and Mike","review":"Pat and Mike is a lovely story of a star athlete, played by Katharine Hepburn, who is discovered by a sport's manager, Spencer Tracy. Hepburn's character realizes that she is going to be watched every minute of every day while in training.

I was already impressed by the performance of the enesemble for Baltica young musicians and under the direction of Gidon Kremer that night. Now the CD is still impressive. It is not easy to get impressed by contemporary music for me as an ordinary classical music lover, but Piazzolla's music is not pretending to be profound and difficult. It's new music technique does not prevent his expression and comminucation of emotions via his music to the audiences.

Of course the Count himself was no slouch on the piano and add the vocals of Jimmy Rushing and Helen Humes and you've got 4 discs of music you can listen to over and over again without it ever growing stale. There is simply not a less than very good song in the lot. JSP once again does a fine remastering job.

Composed as he lay dying of tuberculosis, the book nonetheless encaptures the author's renowned zest for life as well as the libertine spirit of the age in which he lived. The journey down through France to Northern Italy is the perfect vehicle for an excursion into the nature of human sensibility, and from the moment that this cultured Anglo-Irish cleric sets foot in Calais, the reader is treated to a seies of exquisite encounters with the fairer sex. Rarely has an author transmitted so well his understanding of the psychological complexity of women, or the pleasure he takes in their company. Engaging, perceptive and witty, this is a book whiich cannot fail to leave an imprint on the imagination."},{"rating":"1","title":"Guess I'm the party-pooper rating","review":"It's been a number of years since I read this short work for my Pre-1900s British Novels class as an undergraduate, and while my memory is a little fuzzy on the details, my general impression of dislike and boredom is crystal clear. While I'm sure there is complexity in the words, it's hard to overlook the basic fact that almost nothing happens in this first of the sentimental novels.However, I can readily admit that it's obviously at least somewhat preference given all the glowing reviews I have found. I like my books character driven. The kind of characters that I walk away feeling like I know them personally and am sad to part ways. While Yorick is the driving force, he lacked that depth.We followed it up with Evelina by Burney, which was far more enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Belleza","review":"Como su título lo dice, el libro es una belleza.

Peter Bridges also seems to object that my notes are too detailed, even \\"demeaning\\" to \\"educated Penguin readers,\\" yet that my note re. Bailie Jarvie is not detailed enough.

Yes, it's dated, and to modern readers, the dialogue at times is corny and silly (as is DeForest's hesitancy to be more explicit about certain sexual matters). To me,though, that's part of the charm, along with its Victorian sentimentality. It's too bad it was not appreciated when it was published in 1867.

They didn't.So I was forced into buying this ovrerpriced unit, paying perhaps $25 more than a third-party unit would cost.Oh well, at least it works well. Haven't had any problems with it at all.Considering how much effort TiVo puts into customer care, you'd think they wouldn't pull this kind of stunt.

It was a frustrating half an hour before I was able to get everything to play nicely together. (The detection process wasn't as easy as I thought it would be in this plug and play era.) You definitely need to know how your network is set up and be prepared to play with your wireless network configuration application.That said, once I got everything working correctly, the thing has been extremely easy to use: in fact, I haven't had to do anything to it since we put it in.

It is great Plug 'n Play."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine for updates, slow for transfers","review":"I originally bought three of these for our HD boxes, and they improved the connection with TiVo service for updates significantly. Transfers between boxes were slow, though. If we tried to watch while transferrring, unless we waited until the transfer was almost finished, the program would pause when it had to wait for the rest of the transfer.One thing that helped was relocating the router next to one of the TiVo HD boxes and connecting it via Ethernet, That nearly halved the transfer times to/from that box.I later boughtActiontec MegaPlug A/V 200 Mbps Ethernet Adapterunits for all of the other boxes and now most non-HD programs transfer fast enough that we can watch them while transferring without hiccups.

It was slow as a dog! My signal strength hovered around 7 to 10% and often the Tivo would fail in it's attempts to download files. I just installed this Tivo G adaptor and my signal strength increased to 94%. Now my downloads are much, much faster! I don't know why I didn't upgrade before. Installation was a snap. I unplugged the old one and ran the new cable w/ this one. The WUSB11 uses a standard USB connector on both ends and this Tivo one uses a miniUSB on the device end and standard USB connector on the Tivo side. I went to the settings / network page on the Tivo and directed it to connect to my existing wireless network and it connected. The key thing is that I did NOT have to restart the Tivo or reset the network to get this to connect - it was very, very simple"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tivo Wireless G USB adapter works perfectly","review":"Does exactly as advertised.

I chose the TiVo brand adapter instead of others available to assure easy software compatibility."},{"rating":"2","title":"Less expensive here than elsewhere","review":"I was worried this adapter might be different than the others I have seen on the internet or in stores, because it was about $20 less than what seemed to be the going rate. Have no fear, this is the one that will work with your Tivo.It was easy to hook up - just plug the USB into your Tivo unit and follow the setup instructions (on screen in the Tivo Setup menu); I was up and running in about 5 minutes.Signal strength is a little bit less than what i get with my new laptop - My new laptop gets about 65% signal sitting on my bed, this gets about 53% from the same room. But, it's certainly acceptable for downloading program guides and swapping shows with my other Tivo. With a wireless-g network I can transfer an hour TV show in about 15 minutes, and much faster than real time.

The USB WiFi adapter is forced to perch precariously on the back of the shelf. It'd be better if it was designed to just fit right into the USB port, like the one I bought for my girlfriend's computer (which cost $10 less).The TiVo is supposed to work with other brands of wireless network adapters, but I figured the safe choice was to buy the TiVo brand.

To sum it up, it's useless and was not market-ready. TiVo customer service and support is abominable, and the \\"help\\" they supply for this product is laughable. My son has been a network systems engineer for over 10 years, he had to come and try and get it to work. After a bit of fussing with it, the adapter was getting poor reception. The wireless router and modem are barely 30 feet from the TiVo box, with open space throughout. My laptop easily achieves 12Mbps without a hitch.For a goof, we moved the wireless router and modem to the kitchen table, and hooked it up to the laptop. Only then were we able to get a decent signal, with the wireless router about 8 feet from the TiVo box and network adapter. Several calls to TiVo got me canned, simple fixes to try. It works best when you throw it in the trash."},{"rating":"2","title":"My TiVo's now connected!","review":"This network adaptor for the TiVo was about the same price as other brands of adaptors but made specifically for TiVo. I was very confused trying to figure out which other adaptor would work with which TiVo, this made it simple to choose. The software and instructions on the TiVo website made it simple to get started. It was EASY to get my TiVo connected to my home network and now not only can I transfer shows to my computer, I can burn them to DVD as well as having access to my pictures and music through the TiVo. It works well and expanded the uses of both my computer and TiVo.

I higly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good service","review":"This arrived earlier than I thought. I love Tivo, so a wireless adapter is a great addition vs. the phone line. For those people who wonder what will happen when you plug it in, the Tivo software on the newer boxes will actually work like your laptop. The antenna will identify available wireless networks, and then you can link to them - no setting up of IP's etc., like the old USB days! If you have a wireless router, buy this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product!","review":"This is a great device! It's worth every dollar and I strongly recommend it!

We bought a Pioneer 810H several years ago that included Tivo. This is Tivo Basic and this item requires Tivo Plus. You do not have a Media Access Key if you have Tivo Basic, which is required to get this to work. Unfortunately, Tivo Plus is an upgrade to Basic, so it costs extra. Since we already paid a lot for the box (equal to a lifetime membership), we didn't want to do that again and sent it back, so I can't really attest to its functionality or ease of use (although it was a huge pain to figure out why we didn't have a MAK...that took some serious googling since they don't make our box anymore)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well, easy to setup","review":"The TiVo adapter is practically effortless to install. Once installed, the TiVo Series2 recognizes the adapter easily, then you can walk through the configuration to set it up on the wireless network. The only challenging part is the cumbersome entry of the SSID, due to the TiVo interface for text entry. But once it was configured, it connected OK and is far superior to using the phone line by any means."},{"rating":"2","title":"TiVo AG0100 Wireless G USB Network Adapter","review":"Simple to install.

Easy to install!","review":"My old wireless adapter from Netgear stopped working on Friday evening. I ordered this Tivo wireless adapter by 6:30pm EST and chose Saturday delivery (Amazon Prime. Shipping was $6.99). At 10:00am on Saturday morning the UPS truck dropped it off at my front door. I was back in business by 10:15am. I just plugged in the adapter into the USB slot in back of my Tivo unit. I went to \\"Settings\\" on the Tivo menu and restarted the unit. Everything worked fine, it started updating my program guide immediately. When you are replacing a network adapter you do not have to re-enter your network settings nor the computers WPA/WEP security code. The settings were saved on the Tivo unit when I switched the adapters. Also be informed that this adapter connects via a USB cord that is about 3 feet long. It allows you to place the adapter in different areas and positions for the best signal.

You have to have the HD receiver to get all the things advertised, it will not connect to Netflix and a few others. This is not the problem with this receiver, it is in the Tivo box it's self. The receiver works just fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed - No Improvement Over Cheaper Alternatives","review":"So many people have given this adapter 5 star reviews that I was expecting great things. It didn't happen. This Wireless G adapter gives less signal strength and NO speed improvement over an old $10 Wireless B adapter I'd been using. And yes, I upgraded to Wireless G from my \\"send\\" unit, and yes, I've got a Tivo with USB 2.0 which should allow faster transfer speeds.In trying to transmit about 35 feet, all on the same floor, through a couple of walls, the best signal strength I can get is about 30%, compared to 45% on an older Dlink adapter. In testing downloads to a Mac, which is really the only reason I wanted a speed boost, there was no improvement at all.I stand in the minority, but I'll just say that the adapter I received is overpriced and underpowered. It's going back."},{"rating":"2","title":"TiVo Wireless Adapter","review":"Pros:Works amazing! Love it.

Not as fast as maybe you would like but it works. 30 minute TV show might take 15 minutes. Typical movie will take longer...I clocked mine at about 40 minutes sometimes faster depending on the qulity you recorded the movie at...higher quality will certainly be a larger file and take longer. Leaves a copy of the origional on the tivo the file was transfered from. Also great not to have to have a phone line connected once you get this connected to your broadband network. I use a Linksys wireless B/G router and I have one Linksys wireless range extender which I am sure helped this thing reach 4 rooms away. Wish it were faster and had longer range ability but that is the limit of G/G wireless...we need N wireless and an N device from Tivo or whoever makes this for them."},{"rating":"2","title":"WPA & WPA2 Supported","review":"I am extremely happy with this product.

Everything was easy to configure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Stand for the KDS-50A2000, Shelf Height Could be better","review":"Assembly was pretty straight forward, and when you're all done with the TV on top ... looks pretty slick. Strap in back secures TV, and cover in front does the same.Due to support beams in back, my receiver had to go right in the middle on the 2nd shelf. Those same beams, could possibly get in the way of wiring on the top shelf if putting components two across. In fact, I need to get a couple of right-angle connectors in my case. There is also a chance since the glass is at an angle on the sides, that one foot of a componenent all the way to either side may not touch the glass. I also wish the top shelf was a little taller for stacking components.Even with these quibbles, I am very happy with the stand, because the quality is very nice, and the end result looks great & feels solid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Table, well made and sturdy","review":"I just finished putting together my table and am pleased with the way it looks and functions. It's a strong platform for the KDS-50A2000. As the other reviewer mentioned, it's a little cramped for bigger components; I wish it had more room. Assembly wasn't too bad but required patience.My only complaint is about the Amazon merchant, etronics. I would not deal with them again if I didn't have to. The item arrived in good shape, but they are just way too slow and not very responsive to inquiries. The item sat in their warehouse for days, \\"ready to ship\\" they told me, but just lingered there. Tracking data was very slow in being provided. If you can buy this table elsewhere, you probably should."},{"rating":"1","title":"I thought this book had too much irony in it.","review":"The Mayor of Casterbridge was a very interesting novel. In my opinion Hardy uses too much irony, and this kills the fun of the whole topic. It is true that every day is filled with irony, but it shouldn't be in somthing someone is reading. the novel also shouldn't be too predictable, I guess that's why Hardy likes irony. If you are a reader who likes suspense and tragedy then this book is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"a metaphorical masterpiece","review":"just finished thomas hardy's \\"mayor of casterbridge,\\" a book which i highly recommend.this novel is purported to be the first thriller, from which all that followed are copies.the characters in this metaphorical masterpiece operate in a never dissipating cloud of pathos which hangs over them like a vulture over a wounded fawn. the last sentence of the book illustrates: happiness was but the occasional episode in a general drama of pain.once you pick up the rhythm of the writing, you will not be able to put the book down."},{"rating":"2","title":"tragic but enjoyable","review":"The story of a man who ruins his life by doing the right thing at the wrong time, both in business and in his relationships with his wife, a potential wife, and his stepdaughter.

Thomas Hardy was a master writer, and look no further than the fact that he makes a story about a person that buys and sells corn interesting. But, the kindle edition is, like the title of the review says, missing a chunk of the text. There might be other parts omitted, but that's the only one I've caught.Perhaps this is evidence that you get what you pay for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly Talented Writing","review":"I greatly enjoyed The Mayor of Casterbridge, not only for its clear and concise explanations, dialogue and emotional energy, but also for its themes. The loss of a wife, mother, daughter, love, husband, father and mentor are all carried off extremely well. I chose to read this book for a project I'm doing in my English class and although it was not my first choice, I do recommend it to anyone who loves English literature. I'm a big fan of Dickens and Hardy and truly loved this magnificent piece of work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Refreshing change in Hardy's writing style","review":"This is the easiest Thomas Hardy novel, but one of the most complex in terms of emotions. Being an English literature fan, I have to say that the story that goes on in this book is one of the most original and refreshing. If you found Tess of the DUrbervilles (another Hardy book) too difficult but loved the general storyline, read this, it's simpler for the simple minds out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"A mash of cobbled coincidences","review":"This book is similar to a Dickens novel in that it seeks not to reach perfection, but to please its audience at the time. Like Dickens, it is very dry and filled with hard to believe coincidences that make the story hard to swallow. Still, Hardy paints a very lively, realistic and flowing impression of the English countryside in the early days, before the industrial revolution. I would recommend this only if you are obsessed with Hardy, if you have run out of books to read (try Fifth Business by Robertson Davies) or if you are forced to read this as a part of some course."},{"rating":"1","title":"As plausible as the average soap opera","review":"The book is essentially a daytime soap opera.

Although it may pick up later, it certainly is not worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"two thumbs down","review":"I read this book for a class, and I am sorry to say that it was a disappointment. It is a silly tale, and totally unrealistic. I cannot believe that something like this could be considered a \\"classic\\". Mike sure made some dumb choices, and it is unrealistic! No one could make that many blunders. It was bogged down by unnecessary details, etc. All-in-all, a 100% waste. Don't buy this book. You've been warned."},{"rating":"2","title":"ended too soon","review":"Thomas Hardy is a gloomy writer, he likes to end his books by killing off the main characters. In this story he follows the life of a man who good and bad choices in life. You frist meet him as a young married man with a drinking problem. This results in him losing his wife and set him on a path of soberity. Do it yourself AA. When then rejoin his life 20 some years later and watch him self destruct and his wife and daughter reenter his life and he doesn't know how to react. He resumes drinking, Loses his lover, get into a love hate relationship with his presumed daughter. and finally dies of a broken heart as he realizes everything he's lost because of his impulsive behavior. Interesting read."},{"rating":"2","title":"My summary of my reading of the Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"The excellent use of language to desciribe the character and nteractions of the main characters was very polished and held my attention completely throughout. I liked the way the story unfolded, not a \\"just so\\" tale but one full of true to life human strenths and weakneses. The description of the enviorenment and tracking the history of Casterbridge and he normal day to day life of the enhabiants was interesting and made me feel almost that I was there. I would recommend \\"The Mayor of Casterbridge\\" to any lover of historical novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge--a masterpiece","review":"In this book, Thomas Hardy manages to cut deep into the human soul, and uncover to us a part of our makeup that though inacceptable in some cases, yet, very real. He talks of man's selfishness and desires. He presents his theory, which states that man's destiny is no more than the product of his character and fate. In the wake of the industrial and intellectual revolutions, he gives us an idea of what man's guidelines would become. It such a wondeful novel, that is full of insight and wisdom. (check the death scene, page 123; it might be as well, the most elegant description of a human being passing away!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you are considering this book...","review":"IF YOU ARE CONSIDERING BUYING THIS BOOK, SAVE YOURSELF SOME TIME AND WALK INTO ONCOMING TRAFFIC NOW!

Theres almost 4 pages dedicated to describing a building!

Suggest you try another kindle version."},{"rating":"2","title":"human character in constant conflict between strong forces","review":"Good literature provides keen observations in behaviors and psychology of human beings when faced with moral choices and consequences, and this book definitely is filled with good stuff. The main character, Mr. Henchard, is severely flawed and his iniquities are multiple, and yet, he also is so human and really hard not to have sympathetic feelings toward him in the end. The writing is wonderfully philosophical and dramatic, especially the last paragraph of Elizabeth-Jane's reflection on life is movingly insightful."},{"rating":"2","title":"reads well, despite an unsympathetic lead","review":"Hardy mixes the comical here with the sorrowful so you're at once, entertained and saddened by the events; the largest event which brings on the sale of one man's wife and child to another; a moment which both liberates and destroys the main character through-out the story. Competition and jealousy figure prominently in the time line, which covers many years in the lives of a few sad people. You could say Michael Henchard was doomed from the 1st chapter. He certainly is haunted by his past to the point of no escape. And in fact, it's his past (as well as everyone who was part of it) that fuels the inevitable heartbreak to come. Casterbridge as a central location isn't quite as powerfully stark as Edgon Heath from... Native but the landscape does affect the players in similar ways. A wicked sense of folly usually dominates every novel Hardy has written."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classical Tradedy by Tomas Hardy","review":"\\"The Mayor of Casterbridge\\" was a wonderful story which engulfs the reader in perhaps one of the greatest stories I have ever read. Tomas Hardy's skill for describing the enviroment is very clear in this novel. The plot changes are never expected, and what seems a boring read unravels into a classic tragedy that everyone must read. In conclusion I highly recommend this novel to everybody."},{"rating":"1","title":"Classically boring.","review":"I read this book for my English exam and after reading it, I cannot understand how it can be described as a classic novel. The only possible reason that I can come up with is that people in 19th century England, did not have things like T.V. and so were absolutely desperate for anything to entertain themselves. This is possibly the most boring book that I have ever read. Nothing happens! I feel that a lot of people call this book a classic simply because some literary expert happened to like it once, and so these people, in a vain attempt to appear more intelligent than they are, simply churn out someone else's opinion, without actually thinking of their own response to the novel. I don't know how many copies of this book have been printed, but it is bound to be a large number, and all I can say is that it is a huge waste of paper which could have been put to better use elsewhere. I wish that I had not wasted some of my life reading this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHY?","review":"I have recently read this book (not out of choice) and I am at a loss to understand why Hardy wrote this and why anyone would willingly read this for \\"fun\\".

I also am very glad that I was not around to ever meet Thomas Hardy as from this book it sounds to me that he may well of been a manic depresent, also in most, if not all, of his other books they all end in a very sad a depressing way.

The problem with this movie is nothing happens. Absolutely nothing! Throughout the whole movie we follow the lead character as he evades alomst all human contact and says about two words throughout the movie. This is loosely based on Kurt Cobain's final days, but this movie has no point. Van Sant tries to make a statement on the struggles of a troubled soul battling himself and others to find happienss, but his approach does not work and instead the viewer is left asking themselves why did Van Sant make this movie? This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen and I would not recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Movie isnt a tribute to anyone","review":"A Poor Excuse for a film.Due to the fact nothing happens in the film, example, He walks in the room, looks around the room, finds cereal, makes the cereal, eats the cereal, and we sit through a 10 minute scene and get nothing back.I am a huge fan of Asia Argento and she couldent even save this film from the trash bin."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible","review":"watch the trailer and you basically have the whole movie.a guy who stumbles around high and mumbles to himself.."},{"rating":"1","title":"hmmm...","review":"This film is shot beautifully and I liked the way the actors were allowed to meander around in their character to sort of \\"make the movie themselves\\" as they went along. Unfortunately the movie is made to be \\"About\\" the \\"last days\\" of Kurt Cobain. This movie is not accurate and falls short in paying ANY kind of tribute to the memory of Kurt. It distorts his memory if it does any thing which is sad. I enjoy the quiet scenes and all the mood shots, it's a neat reflective film and is actually comedic at times once you take away any reference there might be to Kurt Cobain. I had to MUTE the volume during the scene where the character tries to sing and play like Kurt. Other than that, like I said I like the way the film is shot and made and would have enjoyed it if it did not have something supposedly to do with Kurt Cobain. Any way, that's what I have to say."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst movie Ive every seen","review":"This movie was the worst movie Ive ever seen, Waste of 90 mins of time.

Actually I turned it off after about an hour...I don't know why I waited that long. Kurt was such an interesting and enigmatic person, a movie should have been made to pay respect to him or give something of a behind-the-scenes look at him. This movie basically shows Kurt as a wasted heroin addict with nothing more to offer or say or do; lazy film making, terrible camera work. Seriously if you rent this movie after reading this review you have no one to blame but yourself. Literally one of the worst movies ever wasted on film."},{"rating":"1","title":"What went wrong here?","review":"Sadly, Gus Van Sant has stopped directing movies. Instead he has become a supervisor of filming. In the DVD supplemental documentary, the cast goes on and on about how wonderful it was to get to be so creative and work without a script. They rave about how much they loved the improvisation and about how great it was that they were CREATING a work of art. In the end, they didn't create anything but a nauseating bore.I turned the subtitles on just so I could understand what \\"Blake\\" was muttering (it wasn't worth reading so I turned them back off). The film tries to offer insight into the Kurt Cobain like character but I fail to see how watching him make Macaroni and cheese or crawl around on the floor for five minutes or mumble unitelligable monologues offers an audience anything.

The first half hour has virtually no dialogue, just images of Blake (meant to be Cobain ) wandering through the woods and his home. There is a cast of \\"freeloaders\\" living with Blake, none of whom add anything to the film what so ever. If you are expecting to see a biopic on Cobain, this movie offers nothing of the kind. Blake spends most of the film in a stuppor, and the only part remotely interesting is a bizarre visit from a represenative of the Yellow Pages attempting to get an add renewal for a locomotive Co.

Visually, sure, it is great looking. However, his vision of this Kurt Cobain Character is nothing more than a stumbling mumbling half wit with no personality or reason for being on screen.

From start to finish, it was disjointed and each scene was entirely too long. In fact, I watched the last 30 minutes of the move in 10x speed and didn't miss a thing!Van Sant did not establish any kind of connection with the characters. You don't really even know Blake is a troubled musician (as it says in the synopsis) until half way through the movie, so you spend time watching him mope around the house in, what appears to be, a drug-induced stupor. But you really don't know what's wrong with him and it's not very interesting to watch.I had high hopes for this movie, especially after watching the making of it in the Special Features section, but it was a complete waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"it makes u cry","review":"TEARS of anger.tears of anger that is.i think kurt deserves more respect than this boring movie.I am hoping that in a near future, One director would have thecourage to make a film based on Tom Grant's investigation.WATCH COURTNEY AND KURT INSTEAD, DONT WASTE UR MONEY.Justice for kurt . we miss u and love u."},{"rating":"1","title":"WORST MOVIE EVER MADE!","review":"NO COMMENTS, JUST DONT BUY THIS PIECE OF JUNK, STARING AT A WALL FOR 2 HOURS WOULD BE MORE INTERESTING."},{"rating":"1","title":"If not the worst film I've seen in my life...","review":"Have you ever watched a movie and at the end of it you literally say out loud, \\"Wow, there goes 2 hours of my life that I'll never get back.\\" Well that pretty much sums up Last Days. This movie was beyond boring and completely with out plot. I mean, my God, we spend the first five minutes watching the whacked out druggy swim, stare at fire, and hum the theme to Bonanza. Need I say more? The one redeeming quality this movie did posses however was the music. The scene shot from a far looking in the window in on Blake was attention grabbing but that really only lasted for about 3 minutes. Save yourself the time and watch something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst movie I've seen ever! Awful!","review":"I have never been so compelled to review anything until I watched the movie Last Days yesterday evening. The movie was about absolutely nothing.

Half the time you're just looking at a still object with no characters on screen. There was a plot somewhere in there too but with all the MUMBLING you might miss it.

Kurt would be really disappointed someone even made a movie about him and he would probably be more pissed that it sucked. He was an extreamly talented musician and he deserves to be remembered way better than the way the decided to portray him. I also beleive he did not kill himself but was murdered. Kim Gordon of Sonic Youth, also a very good band, recently stated she beleives kurt was murdered. The fact is though that Gus Van Sant made a terrible movie. Anyone of you trying to force yourselves into beleiving you like this movie don't cheat yourselves you know it was so bad no one could really enjoy it. Even if you are a big fan of Kurt or Van Sant this was bad. If nothing else Kurt tried to teach us to come as we are so don't try to force yourselves to like a horrible movie for the sale of Kurt or Van Sant.

This film was about Kurt's last days and what he did, but it was a terrible thing to watch if your a fan because you get absolutely nothing out of it. Most of the music in the movie was terrible in choice; the only part of this movie that i liked was the very end scene where the ghost climbs out of the body. This movie didn't hold my interest at all; it was wandering, mumbling, eating, avoiding. How could you make a film about Kurt Cobain, the man who made grunge, so terrible? I must say I don't think any fan of Nirvana should watch this.Also the very end of the movie says:In memory ofKurt Cobain1967-1994This movie should not have been in memory of Kurt."},{"rating":"1","title":"TRUST ME - DO NOT BELIEVE THE HYPE - THIS IS JUNK","review":"Maybe this is how Kurt Cobain spent his \\"last days\\" but this does not mean it is a good film. This is just another stylish psuedo-intellectual art-house film. Gus Van Sant is quickly becoming like Stephen Sodenberg. A guy trying to make cool artsy flicks that seem really deep in meaning to the very niave watcher, but, like Sodenberg, anyone who even bothers to tread deep into an analysis of this film is apt to feel cheated and tricked. Gus Van Sant even attempts to lift the whole significance of the grunge-scene but this movie just seems so contrived and silly.

I suppose there is art in the sheer guts to make a portrayal so bleak, so real. But having said that, to want to invest 90 minutes of one's time in such a story, one has to actually care about the protagonists. In this case, there isn't any set-up, no reason to care. In fact, I found myself actively disliking, even loathing the characters (all of them). When the end came, I just didn't care anymore. If this were really what Cobain became like, then his death wasn't a tragedy. It was a blessing.Postscript: it would be nice to see van Sant make a movie that identifies with real human beings rather than the drugged characatures of Last Days or My Own Private Idaho.

An absolutely irredeemable mess from start to finish, and a movie that made me suspect that Mr. Van Sant got lucky with Drugstore Cowboy despite his lack of talent. But that isn't really fair, since he also directed To Die For and Milk, both of which were outstanding.

The mannered pacing is supposed to engage our senses in an unconventional way. If Van Sant wasn't a name director, however, people wouldn't give it a second glance and read into it what isn't there. But that's how it goes... certain artists are given license to bend the rules and sometimes it gives a medium a needed break from the conventional (uh, like Nirvana, irony of ironies).

The symbolism is OK if you're into that sort of thing.On the negative: He must have written this while out and out drunk and the editor, publisher and the adoring public make great allowance because this is \\"William Faulkner\\". The sentences are not just run-on, but change subjects midstream and simply make no sense. The dialogue is the same as the narrative except for the quotes surrounding it and thus since everyone talks the same, there is not much for characterization.

The plot was confusing and complicated by tough vocabulary and grammar. In the version I had borrowed from the school, the \\"long sentence\\" was (I'm pretty sure) around 7 pages (5x7 size pages).Recently, I tried to pick it up again, convinced by my wife, who had liked reading Faulkner. I found it only slightly easier, with no real improvement. I believe that the problem stems from something that Douglas Adams had once said: \\"I'm trying to be literate, not literary.\\" I get the feeling that Faulkner was trying to create literature as an artform, rather than try to convey his story to the masses.I can appreciate that many people love this story, and that it is a literary masterpiece, but I cannot say that I think it is good."},{"rating":"1","title":"a great book...if you could read it","review":"Reading this book was a tremendous pain in the ***. The mystery and plot could have been greatly enthralling if I hadn't spent so much time trying to unwind Faulkner's sentences. Not only were the sentences long and complex, there were so many rambling thoughts between the action that I missed the thought and the action. I think Faulkner had a profound statement to say about social injustice and the South's part, but he certainly didn't say it in any way I could have understood it."},{"rating":"2","title":"More readable than others would have you think","review":"Those who follow the AP Book of Rules for writing (i.e., subject, predicate, no commas, no decora) will have a tough time negotiating Faulkner's peregrinating sentences, but it's worth it. This book delivers several experiences at one time: a look at the Southern social codes, a textured appraisal of racial relations, an adolescent's step off into adult life, and an entertaining murder mystery. The lead characters are nicely drawn, with surprises; the action and crowd scenes are portrayed in easily visualized imagery. For all the Southern writing I've read, this added more information about the culture and people. I feel sorry for those who don't have the patience for Faulkner's style: a taste for it isn't that difficult to acquire and it's well worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bites","review":"I hated this book. William Faulkner has to be the poorest excuse for a writer that ever lived. I got so tired of his pages long sentences and parentheticals within parentheticals within sentences within parentheticals (I wish I were making this up). To make matters worse, sometimes his parentheticals were so long, I forgot what preceded it! And let's not forget his made-up words (uninsatiable? ever hear of a dictionary, Will? IT'S NOT IN THERE!) This book bites, HARD. And let's face it, if he were alive today, no way would anyone with a brain publish this garbage. At least not without some serious editing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long sentences that are extremely confusing.","review":"Bad book overall, only interesting about the themes of discrimination"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not read!","review":"Wow I have only read part of this book and it is now an all time low for me!

This book was on my summer reading list and as I began to read it it's flow totally lost ME IN THE DUST!!! I am not stupid, in fact I am in the top 99 percentile of all kids in my grade across the U.S. After having to write down all the characters and list their traits i believe that I can grasp a few chunks of this novel. O well.Yeah, just don't even try this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bilge","review":"I've read some Faulkner now, some required, most voluntarily, and still have yet to figure out what the fuss is about. Yes he can weave a story, but good grief, imagine the ego of a man who thinks he can turn out a story as incomprehensible as this. Right now I'm reading his bio by Jay Parini trying to decipher the Faulkner code.I'll let you know if I do. I guess I've just read too much Flannery O'Conner (brilliant) and consider Faulkner a bit too precious. Slam me if you must. \\"A Light in August\\" was good, and I'm reading short stories that are wonderful, but please, present and future authors, try to engage the reader, not send him/her away frustrated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read...at your own caution!","review":"I am in eleventh grade Advanced Placement (AP) English and this is the first book I have ever read that has made me want to learn another language. This writer has no respect for his readers with his continously confusing run-on sentences and distracting word placement. Furthermore, he has no respect for the \\"laws\\" of the language, that are put there to keep from this very disgrace of a novel of ever happening. I will never read another William Faulkner novel; for this one has made me feel like my intelligence has been stripped from me. In plain, American, understandable English: THIS BOOK STINKS!"},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT!?!?!?!?!","review":"I AM CURRENTLY READING THIS BOOK AS A MANDATORY OUTSIDE READING BOOK FOR MY 11TH GRADE ENGLISH CLASS. I AM ON CHAPTER THREE AND I STILL HAVE NO IDEA OF WHAT IS GOING ON EXACTLY. FAULKNER'S USE OF WORDING IS EXTREMELY CONFUSING AND DOES NOT CAPTURE THE READER AT ALL.ALONG WITH READING THE BOOK WE HAVE TO COMPLETE A PROJECT EXPLAINING THE PLOT AND MAIN THEMES. HOW CAN I DO THIS IF I DON'T UNDERSTAND THE BOOK ITSELF?THIS BOOK IS SAID TO BE A GREAT PEICE OF AMERICAN LITERATURE BUT I DISAGREE COMPLETELY.I THINK IT'S REALLY BAD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Long","review":"Thanks to its stream-of-conscious narrative, this book leans more toward the incomprehensible side of Faulkner's canon, despite a simple plot that often feels as if it would have been suited to a short story and was dragged out to fit the necessary length for a full-length book. When you add to that the blatant preachiness and, aside from the inciting event, a predictable storyline, this book ends up being more work than its worth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Second rate Faulker","review":"This novel doesn't rank with Faulkner's classic work and there are dozens of reviews here that tell why--but the most basic problem is the difficulty of writing a mystery, a plot-driven story, in prose that is often gibberish."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved it.","review":"I had to choose a novel for an independent reading assignment, so of course, being the striver I am, I had to choose an obscure Faulkner novel. I thought the book was excellent. Faulkner's rich prose helped to develop his deeply southern charachters. The culture of the South and it's deeply imbedded morals were brought out through Faulkner's lengthy sentences and gothic elements such as suspense and enhanced senses. The coming of age story of Chick Mallison and several subplots gave the novel many layers with which to envelop the reader. Overall, the novel turned out to be a tough read that was well worth the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Other than the four page long paragraphs...","review":"Okay...So the run on sentences and the page long paragraphs get a little old and annoying...However, under all of this is a very intriguing mystery novel...Who actually killed Vinson Gowrie and how did Jake Montgomery end up in his grave?

But the powder in my caps are slightly hard due to moisture/humidity getting into the caps. Not to big of a deal, can't roll out the hardness with my fingers. So had to use a few wacks with the back edge of a knife to break it up a bit so I could roll it out with my fingers.First time that happened, but various supplements are prone to humidity. Can't comment on its effectiveness? Just going with the available online research. Seems like a good antioxidant."},{"rating":"2","title":"I feel like a nut.","review":"This is good stuff, but I'm still iffy on major differences in the noticeable effects on the \\"outside\\". I did great with NOW Foods ALA in regards to shifting fat off the parts of my body that I was exercising.With these types of products, one really has to be in tune to get the benefits. Some days, you just know that it's not working and some days it feels like I've wasted it... I take it intermittently now. I'm gaining some weight, but it doesn't look bad - which I attribute to this product. I can't afford the others, which is what I'm really getting at. I know that it's helping the free radicals for sure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Resource for Planning Your Own Alaskan Getaway","review":"This book is a great resource for planning an Alaskan adventure. Area by area recommendations and descriptions are given to help the reader determine how best to meet his/her vacation goals.Especially helpful are the web addresses for individual services and locations, as well as the recommendations for the slightly-lesser known and (in the author's opinion) less crowded activities and the corresponding suggestions for how to beat crowds and how to plan ahead to have the experience you want.The general over-view information of each area also helps give the reader a good impression of the area and what the overall experience of the area would be like.A very thorough book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Frommer's Alaska","review":"This is a good summary book to have. I found it informative. Although this book by itself is not enough for planning a trip to Alaska. It gives highlights but I found myself needing additional information.A good buy"},{"rating":"2","title":"Top Quality","review":"Sunsout puzzles are top quality. The pieces are thick with a nice top finish. Each piece is easy to handle and the cuts are clean. Very enjoyable. Always a top quality puzzle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Accurate Examples of Questions","review":"I also found this $75 book to be more valuable than a $1000 \\"No Pass No Pay\\" Family Medicine Review Course. While that review course really delivered excellent information, little of it actually appeared on the exam. In contrast, this book contains questions very close to what you actually see on the test. Sure there are little mistakes and some annoying repetition of topics but nothing any of us could not get beyond. If you are not doing general geriatric and pediatric care or obstetrics, this book serves as a great starting point to explore the latest thinking. Similarly, if you don't do primary care, make sure to memorize the USPSTF and ACIP guidelines. Most importantly, do as many questions as you can from the ABFM website. I passed with above average scores but would have done even better if I had reviewed more of their sample questions. Good Luck."},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY GOOD","review":"This is very helpful for last minute review. Obviously not up to date on the hottest topics, but overall very good on general topics. Excellent question and answer format. With older intraining exams, questions at familypractice.org, and this review, you'll breeze through the exam. Good luck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Concerned about the number of errors","review":"I bought this to review for my 4th round of taking the boards. On the areas that I am well versed in, I have found a number of errors. I have verified these with other sources . This makes me worry about the accuracy on the topics that I need help. I have also found similar problems with their online questions.After this, I bought the new edition of Swanson's ReviewSwanson's Family Medicine Reviewwhich thankfully does not seem to suffer from the same problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"okay, but not great","review":"I used this to study for the recertification exam in the summer of '09. I passed the exam, but I'm not sure how much this book helped. It focused a lot of questions on certain diseases that were not on the exam, and some diseases that were hit multiple times on the exam were never mentioned in the book. Also, like other reviewers have mentioned, there are numerous mistakes and dated practice guidelines in the book. If I had to do it over again, I would try a different book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't overuse it","review":"This is a good review book and it helped point out some weak areas that I had to do further studying in. One mistake I made was making this text my main part of studying for the boards, I went through some sections several times and was doing fairly well on the practice exams. What I did not realize is that I was starting to recognize the right answers since the questions are used over again for the online banks of questions, so when I took the board exam my score was actually lower than what I was getting on the practice exams for the book. If you are making this the core part of your review and your practice scores from the book are not above 80%, make sure you take some practice tests from other sources to evaluate your knowledge base for the actual board exam. Overall, a solid review book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The book was good but the test bank was down","review":"I thought that the book was a great review for the test and saw much of the material on the test. However, the test bank was down the week before my exam which was when I wanted to do the questions. That was very disappointing, but I did the test questions on the AAFP website which were both helpful and provided CME credit as well.Addendum: I just got my scores today, and I rocked the boards! I ended up in the 95th percentile. I also attended a course, but I felt that this book really put me over the top. It was great at some of the esoterica on the boards. My only beef is that I could not gain access to the online questions at all. Mine did not come with a CD, you had to log onto a website with a number provided in the front of the book. The week before my exam the website was down completely. I ended up not needing it, but it did stress me out right before the boards. Good luck and buy this book!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"too many errors! How can I trust what I am studying!","review":"I have been out of medicine for 5 years and am reviewing to re-enter practice. I am only on question #145 but have come across 6-10 errors- mainly things that are contradicting previous answers. Many times I am double-checking answers on up to date.Otherwise, I guess the material is fine, but really for me personally, it is intolerable to have so many errors. Studying should NOT induce extra anxiety!!I have stopped using this book and just ordered Swanson's 6th edition and one other resource as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Errors. Repetitive questions.

Unfortunately, for me - all the other songs on all the other albums were nothing like the \\"Lullaby\\" song and quite honestly, I threw everything else in the trash.

I was able to sit through only a few pieces before having to eject the DVD. While \\"Miracle\\" showed the 12 Girls Band to be a class act exhibiting skillful musicianship, elegance and femininity, Bond came across like some goofy teenage girls lacking class, elegance and femininity. OK, so they are skillful musicians; not good enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get's boring","review":"What's not to like about four hot chicks shaking their bottoms playing classical music? \\"Victory\\", the song you probably heard in the watch commercial is by far their best song.

The 1812 Overture is, admittedly, a little cheesy, but nothing deserves the treatment Bond give it.Classical instruments do not need a dance beat and electrification to be cool. Listen to anything by the band Apocalyptica, or even Godspeed You ! Black Emperor (who use celli)--there is music out there that pushes the boundaries of traditional classical music, and does it well, without resorting to electronic beats and scantily clad women.If you must order this, order Apocalyptica's \\"Cult\\" with it, for purposes of comparison."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never liked the strings, but this blew my socks off","review":"I cought the concert on some very high numbered cable channel. I was so impressed I bought the DVD. This is the most origional idea I've seen in years. Its a cross between Enigma, Petshop Boys, Alan Parsons, ELO, and a conductor on crack. The song Winter is my favorite to date. I predict you find Bond music playing in the background of TV commercials very soon. Seeing them perform is 50% of the show. Just listening will suffice if you have the memory of them performing.

Her miserly and cruel father discourages her from spending a penny of it and even forces her to extract high rents from her tenants. As if this weren't enough trouble, she falls in love with Harry Mynors who is only interested in her money. When she realizes this, she has become so used to this kind of treatment that she decides to marry him anyway. Naturalistic and depressing, Bennett portrays his main characters well.

The drip stop function works perfectly, the shape of the carafe keeps coffee fresher than most designs, there are no clocks to set or automatic hot plate shut offs. The construction is sturdier than others (Krups, Cuisinart made in Mexico or China); it is made in Germany. The lack of a clock/timer is no big deal as it will get your first cup of coffee brewed-- and brewed RIGHT-- in two minutes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy a different coffee maker!","review":"I purchased the Bosch TKA 2801 about two months ago and it's been nothing but trouble. To begin with, it feels cheap, with plastic moving parts that feel like they're about to fall off at any moment, and often do. But worse, unless one is very careful with the unit, more coffee will end up on your kitchen counter than in the carafe when the coffee is brewed. It's no fun to clean that mess over and over. I called Bosch customer service and was treated very rudely, but after complaining I was referred to an outside service agent that has been quite pleasant to deal with so far. They've offered to pay for me to ship the unit to them and they're sending me a completely new unit. Hopefully the new one will function better, although I'm not holding my breath given the poor design overall."},{"rating":"2","title":"The perfect introduction to Ancient Babylon","review":"Before the beginning of this century, the only information we had about Ancient Babylon was from the Bible. Consequently, most of the literature that I have read on the subject (written during the height of Iraqi Archeaology in the 1920's and 30's) has been on a religious note rather than a historical one. This book changed all that. It brought a highly academic subject to the layman. It is a simple, informative account of how the real Babylonians lived. It describes the Babylonians as an advanced people who appreciated art and literature, as well as entering into contracts and having mortgages. It is a great introduction to an ancient civilisation."},{"rating":"1","title":"FACTS good, authors OPINION on religion(s) unnecessary","review":"Edward Chiera presented wonderful information on his research of ancient civilizations.

Probably because it is undersize. The dimension is 1/4\\" deep x 3/4\\" wide. This means that any standard miter gauge or sliding shaper jig, will ride high and rock side to side with no table support. The miter gauge supplied is all plastic and is a grand total of 3\\" long.It is also difficult to adjust the extension table sections low enough so that they do not interfere with the sliding miter gauge or shaper jig.The only plus on this set-up is a large, easy to access on/off switch.I don't understand why anyone would manufacture an item with so many shortcomings, when it would be just as easy to make the thing right in the first place.The best use for this product would be to mount a non-functioning router, and give the set to a child to play 'Carpenter' with.PS: Shipping was very expensive, ie: 50% of the cost of the item."},{"rating":"1","title":"indian-spiced braised lamb shanks?","review":"Kind of a lazy book; the title suggests a comprehensive reference, but what you get is a whatchagot stew of arbitary recipes & once-in-a-while Indian Pudding & Johnny Cakes.The number of Recipes-to-number-of-pages ratio is quite low, & plenty/most recipes not especially \\"New England\\" -- just because a salad calls for boston lettuce does not make it a regional specialty.

This poorly written tale just constructs a nice little fantasy about a martyr instead of a real child and it sounds like \\"Ozzie & Harriet Confront C.P.\\" Although the anecdotes about the aminmals were cute, the whole book is written in a condescending tone. The racist name that one rabbit was given was insulting.

But this love affair is tragic because the man is at the end of his charm and can only regress, whereas she represents the new style, the new era that is opening at this moment and she goes up so fast she crushes her husband into oblivion and non-existence. But she remains faithful to her love, and he does not want to block her in her career. So he commits suicide to free her road and she nearly cracks up and goes away. But she can stick to her career by assuming his name as hers.

The DVD from a few years ago was better than this, though still flawed and needing further restoration. I give 2 stars only that the story is still one of the greatest regarding Hollywood of yesteryear. The transfer to Bluray is a shear disappointment, sound & picture, especially when one of the trailers for \\"Nothing Sacred\\" with Carole Lombard that is included in the Features portion is in so much better shape than this film. That film was restored. Someone needs to call Martin Scorcese, Thelma Schoonmaker & their teams to get this one back into pristine condition.

My first son fussed while nursing causing me to be frustrated with it and pumping upon returning to work was stressful. I nursed him until he was a year and couldn't wait to be done with it. My three month old doesn't have a problem at all nursing, every three hours my breasts are full and ready to nurse, I pump every morning to store additional milk (I'm now up to 200 oz. in the freezer) and I take More Milk Plus three times a day. I will not stop taking the supplement for fear of my supply decreasing. Anyone out there looking for something to help, this is your answer. The taste is pretty bad but mixed with 1-2 oz of OJ make it bearable. An 8 oz supply lasts me about a month and a half."},{"rating":"2","title":"I was making almost no milk!","review":"I was literally pumping only 2 to 5cc (32cc make an ounce) for my newborn who was almost 5 days old when my lactation consultant told me to try this. Within days I noticed I was consistently pumping an ounce then gradually more, by day 10 I was barely supplmenting with formula. This stuff is like a miracle worker. Be sure to not drink anything before and after wards for at least 20 minutes. This makes the product more effect.Yes it taste pretty bad but order the alchol free and no problems.

I have been using the one WITHOUT alcohol and ran out so bought this on Amazon and noted that it tasted different - it burns (like taking straight shots of vodka) and tastes bad. Upon checking ingredients it shows 42-52% grain alcohol!My preference is for the one without alcohol because it tastes sweeter (actually got so used to it I ended up liking it very much - imagine my distaste when I first put this in my mouth). Not only that, it makes me uncomfortable worrying about traces of alcohol in my b-milk.So 2 stars for this but I'd give the one w/o alcohol 5 stars because it helps with production."},{"rating":"1","title":"didnt seem to do any good","review":"had twins. bought this when having trouble with one not nursing as well as my milk slowed down. did not really seem to make a difference in the amount of milk. tasted gross, I would take it in a shot of water. contains alcohol from the natural herbs.

I did notice that my pumped milk was more fatty after sitting in the fridge though. I was taking a double dose and took it round the clock, never missing a dose. I am past a year of breastfeeding and that may be why I did not see a boost. The alcohol taste is completely disgusting.

It's taste equivalent would be what I imagine stuffing your face full of dandelions and old socks would be.

Giles though has four exams and visually it is constructed very closely to a real one, little if any question explanation. Bottom part you'll benefit from both.

The picture is good, not great, but good. It is in full screen as stated, and there are a few small flaws with picture quality. This should not be a factor in owning, this DVD, as these are two classics from the past. If you enjoyed watching them 50 years ago, you will be happy to see them again. If you are young and these were before your time, then just keep in mind when these two films were shot, and nothing has been digitally redone, like you can get in some of the older films.

This is a welcome change to nonsensical 'interpretations' that conspicuously sound exactly the same as the melody line. You want to play 'Bennie and the Jets' from the starting heavy chords to the verse to the jazzy piano solo, here you go. Blue Eyes, Rocket Man, Someone Saved My Life Tonight (excellent song)... it's all here. In some instances (like Honky Cat for example), there's just no point in bothering to learn the music EXACTLY, because Elton John just improvised within chords in the first place. So it's best for you to do the same unless you want to pore through pages of the same music phrased slightly differently. Next time it would be better to include the more 'precise' songs in Elton's catalogue.Anyway, this is a great collection.

The packaging is 75% Japanese in both presentation and content, so it's not easy for foreigners to assimilate. Too, Eno, contributes musically to only 1 of the 2 cds, so it's \\"half an Eno at thrice the price of one\\". Perhaps he has achieved by issuing this a reduction on the demands for his attention and time. With a few more like this and some of it's Eno-involved predecessors since 1994, the wolves may stop circling his door for a while and he can breathe again and create something that has had time to gestate and mature before release."},{"rating":"1","title":"wasted money","review":"I was looking for a doll-that-wets to help me potty train my 3 year old daughter. The doll was quite expensive, the only one with the feature I was looking for in that particular toy store. It comes without any instructions, or maybe they were missing from the box, but I really doubt that. When you give the doll water it instantly starts peeing, better when it is laying down than when it sits on the potty. No matter how you turn it and how you close or open the valve, IT LEAKS. I could not see any tears no matter how I turned it. Overall, big waste of money, I would STRONGLY RECOMMEND AGAINST IT.

My three year old daughter was horribly disappointed by the \\"baby food\\" which looked like water with small white particles floating in it. At least you can submerge the baby for a bath.

First Lennie cause tiny problems, then bigger and finally the biggest trouble. Now what and how should the weak one(George) help or save his best friend?I give the rate of 4 stars to this book. It's a great book for love, friendship and at a loss as what to do. The theme of this book is sometimes friends have to force themselves do something that he/she doesn't want to.

The characters are well-developed, the dialogue is simple and to the point, and the descriptions are detailed. This book deserves it's frequent consideration as a classic. And while I still can't imagine ever liking GOW, I can no longer dismiss Steinbeck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Short, bittersweet, and powerful","review":"This tightly crafted story's surface level of life for Depression-era farm hands in Caifornia kept my interest even though that's not the sort of thing I'm usually drawn to.This book showed me a dimension to humanity I had never before been able to articulate: The paradoxal, divine, yet fungamenta nature of friendship.Steinbeck's gritty characters and setting are the perfect vehicle for a message that only sounds intellectual until you feel it. There is no fanfare, no flourish of trumpets, no pomp and circumstance, no canned philosophy -- just raw emotional truth.Some stories hold the mind's attention; this one touched my soul and made me simultaneously both proud and ashamed to be human. We are capable of ugliness but also such loving sacrifice. For a little book, it packs quite a punch.I am breathless. Give this book an afternoon and you will be too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Of Mice and Men","review":"This action packed book was filled with laughs, and tears.

I'll tell you this, though, buy this book in the store, they're overcharging for it here. And aside from that, this book *is* wonderful. I had to read the first chapter for school and read the rest on my own. The imagery is vivid and all of the characters, from the least important to the main two, Lennie and George, breathe a life of their own. Another good one by John Steinbeck is 'The Pearl.'"},{"rating":"2","title":"Really good book","review":"I had to read my mice and men in 8th grade. So it would be easier, I got the book on tape.

Bad tempered but somewhat kind George has to get Lenny out of trouble sometimes losing his job. They both share a dream together of having their own farm and just when it seems close to coming true things go absolutely wrong. I read this book and it left me breathless at the end and touched me deeply because of how it reflected the harsh times then and now and of how society deals with different minded people. The writing is beautiful filled with heavy metaphors. I think if you've read John Steinbeck's \\"Grapes of Wrath\\" you should read this too, or if you are interested in something heavy and thought provoking or if you want to read a good book that's bin banned before :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Steinbeck at his best","review":"In so few pages Steinbeck creates two characters who you fall in love with immediatly.

The excellent combinatiion of george and lennie makes for many laughable situations that will make you smile with sad stories that touch your heart.

I just want to say that if you're someone who avoids reading \\"the literary stuff\\" because you think it's going to be too difficult, this is probably the book to change your mind.

This story has many twists and turns and makes you think about your best friend. The story creates a suprising ending. It is a great short story for someone looking for a short and good read.

While browsing for some reading material in my Kindle, I ran across the title. I ordered it and was rewarded with a wonderful tale of hardship, compassion, and tragedy set in one of the most trying periods of our countries history. It was more novella than a book. Easily read in a few hours. It describes the strugles of two drifters seeking a piece of the American dream. One man, the leader, is bright and resourceful, the other is mentally challenged, but loved and cared for by his partner.

Clean prose and simple storytelling, no added unnecessarys. Even the metaphor is unfussy.But Steinbeck's true gift lies in characterisation and his understanding of dialogue. When his characters speak and act they betray themselves for who they are. The reader listens and sees, gleans a past from the characters' voices and gestures. The power of the novel comes from the intimacy the reader has with these characters, and it's a testament to Steinbeck that in such a short book he reveals so much.Everyone should meet Lennie and George at least once, and if you do, you'll never forget them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Of Mice and Men","review":"Our class had to read this book as part of the curriculum... and I am so glad we did!

He will do anything to make George happy.Curley- He hates Lennie because he is intimidated by men who are bigger than him.Curley's Wife- She flirts with every man on the ranch to make up for the loneliness Curley gives her.This book was written amazingly... obviously, it's a classic!

Of Mice and Men targets readers of all ages. It is a fairly short novel, and full of adventures, keeping the attention of even the youngest audiences.

The book takes place in the 1930's with the 2 main characters John and Lennie traveling to a ranch to work, save up money and live their dream. Lennie is a big guy that is a little slow in the mind, and has an obsession with petting soft things. George is a small guy that has known Lennie for a long time and gives him commands for Lennie doesn't know what to do by himself. Much like a Father-son relationship.I usually don't like fiction tales that take place in the past,but I enjoyed this one. The only problem is that the book starts out slow. It gives you clues that keeps you guessing and wondering.For all you readers that consider yourself a slow reader, this is a great book for you. It's exciting and short. Only 107 pages. The price on the book is 8 bucks. I think it's worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Opinion","review":"In the book Of Mice and Men by Jonh Steinbeck is about two men that looking for jobs from ranch to ranch.This story takes place in Soledad California,during the Great depresion.The story has two characters: the most important characters are George & Lennie. George is \\"small, quick, dark of face and strong hands\\" & the other guy is Lennie \\"A huge man he has a mind of a child & he likes to touch soft things.\\" Everything that he knows is because George has thought him. They have dreams, that want to accomplish. Do you think yhat George wants to live & accomplish the dreams with Lennie?I rate this book 4 stars & I really recommend this book to teens because there's only one in a million that knows what friendship is really about.

The roll between the two is that they both have the same dream and that is to live off the fat of the land and raise rabbits. Lennie, is best put as retarded, but is really the nicest guy in the world: it is just his size that interfears with the two men's lives. George has a short fussed temper and Lennie can't help but be dumb when it comes to any situation they may find themsleves in. The book has a great plot that you have to stop and think about long after you have put the book down, and this is without a doubt, the most realistic novel I have ever read. I would suggest reading this at a MATURE high school level. If you are too young for this book, you will not understand it.

Yes, it was able to keep me engaged in the novel and continue reading, but it was not my favorite. That is just the begining. The last chapter touched me in a way I could never imagine possible. Even though I did not rate this five stars, I am sure many of you would. I am sure many of you would rate this ten stars if given a chance. There is so much for one to explore and ponder within this novel, it is fraught with questions. I believe this book can not be missed and I do not usually say this, because I am one to believe that not all people have the same taste for books, as all people do not have the same taste for chocolate, and I recomend this to everyone.

Lennie is a large man with a mental disability and a craving for soft things and George is a small man who's in charge of Lennie, making sure he isn't getting them in trouble. The men had to flee from Weed because Lennie was accused of raping a woman when he only wanted to feel her dress.They find a ranch outside of Weed and work there. There they meet a rambunctious man by the name of Curley who threatens to knock out any man's lights if they even consider looking at his jail-bait wife. Curley is the ranch owner's son so, he's never going to get into trouble. When Curley and Lennie cross paths, something terrible happens. \\"Of Mice and Men\\" was a very good book that we both enjoyed.

George and Lennie are opposites in outer appearence and behaviour. The one, George, is small, smart and intelligent, but Lennie is huge, retarded and acts in a childish way. He has to rely totally on George. These two guys hold together because of two things: a promise and a common dream. George had to promise Lennie\`s aunt Clara to take care of him after her death and so he does. Both dream of an own small farm where they can live and work for themselves and be happy.To realize their dream they earn their money as farmhands.

It was unsual the ranch life, that two men would stick together for so long. The ranch life was a everymanforhimself life, but Lennie and George went through it together. Besides the affection that they had for each other, what held them together was common dream. They dream to buying a little ranch to grow their own crops and animals. Lennie was big (hard-worker), but he had sort of a mental disorder, while George was a small but meticulous man, who looked after Lennie all the time. I meant almost all the time, until the day that he went to the town (to drink) and left Lennie along in the ranch, and Lennie did something that shattered their dreams (forever). What I liked more in the story was simpathy of the characters (ranch workers), in the begining they seemed to be mean and anti-social , but then they started to get along with George and Lennie in a very social way"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't read this book unless you're forced to!","review":"Jeez, was this book strange!

It's too short and the conclusion doesn't make much sense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is There A Plot Here?!","review":"I had to read this book for my English class at school and I started out with an optimistic attitude reflecting this book. The beginning of the book was rather slow but, of course, I had to read it and was willing to give it a chance on account of it being such an essential classic. As I read further, though, I feel that the book could have develloped further than it did. What had been a trace of a plot at the beginning of the book had all but shrunken into a totally unnecessary conclusion that, I feel, had no thought or reflection on the main goal of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Suspense!

The scene of the book was in the country, were Lennie, the main charecter, looked for jobs with his friend George to make money and fufil there dreams. George would look after Lennie and keep him out of trouble. People weren't to social with lennie because of his mental disorder, they thought he was stupid, and caused troubles.

Now, they have got new jobs and George are vigorously trying to keep Lenny out of trouble .Lennie does not get into trouble intentionally , but he is so retarded that he doesnt understand much , this leads to a number of incidents .The story of the book is good because it has many unexpected twists and turns.Especially @ the end when George does what he do . Recommended to people who like reading short novels and generally like good books ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully Crafted Novel","review":"\\"Of Mice and Men\\" is a beautifully crafted short novel concerning the relationship between two migrant workers from the 1930s. The first character, Lennie, has quite severe learning difficulties and relies heavily on his friend George. Lennie is very strong and this in itself gets him into all sorts of problems. George has to come to Lennie's aid on a regular basis as a result of him getting into trouble through misinterpretations of his actions and a naviety of his own strength.Genuinely moving, the reader cannot fail to build up a great empathy with the lead characters; less so with the other figures that appear in the book- despite each one having their own set of problems.Steinbeck does a tremendous job of conveying his story to the reader, and it would be a person with a heart made of stone that would not be moved by the story's conclusion.An excellent read for older children and adults of all ages. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very emotional book","review":"I enjoyed this book and i think that most people would enjoy reading about the hardships, struggles, hopes and dreams of two men during the great depression. After reading this book I felt a greater appreciation for the people who lived during this time. The book was very inspirational tome. I loved how the book made you connect with the two characters, George and Lennie, and thier hopes for the future. This book was short in text but huhe in emotions and feelings of all the charchters. Although some times I will admit that the book exaggerated the sensitivity of the character Lennie the book was still good in the fact the plot made sense with a cast of realistic characters. The ending of the book is a real life ending that wasn't far fetched. They made the events believable which causedmany emotions to stir inside you anger, fear, suspense, sorrow, and happines just to name a few. You really connect with the book. That's why I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really boring","review":"I know a lot of people are going to be mad at me for saying that I HATE this book, which is why I have decided to leave this anonymous.

I didn't like the way the story was written, because that isn't really my type of book.

It is written well and it does keep your interest.

Lennie is, well, \\"different\\" in that he loves to touch soft things. He has the mind of a two year old. George does his best efforts to look after Lennie, although Lennie does get into a lot of trouble. After being chased away from their previous town, George and Lennie get new jobs in hopes to someday own a ranch of their own.Though this book was written well and the plot was good, I didn't like the story line.

They take a bus to a ranch where they are going to work but the bus driver drops them off way before the ranch.

While trying to reach this goal they run into many problems. Lennie has a problem of touching soft things such as rabbits, and he ends up doin some bad things at Weed and at the new ranch.In my opinion I didn't like this book alot because John steinback likes to describe the setting and i couldn't really picture it very much.

In a line of work that does not often lend itself to forming such close personal relationships, the two men are able to use each other as a support system to some how make both of their lives a little better.Steinbeck perfectly describes each scene placing the reader right in the action.

The author describes the settings in such detail you can almost smell the alfalfa. As far as the plot goes, he leaves room for your imagination to fill in the blanks and gives the plot life through drama and issues that any worker would face during the early 1900s. Of mice and men, it is a must-read for any reading level.The setting is based in the early 1900s, where Lennie and George, the two main characters, work for a new employer on a swamp. The author creates great detail not only through words, but also through the actions of other characters. For example, the author never once mentions Lennie's mental disability. Instead, he uses actions and dialogue to show that he is. John Steinbeck is a magnificent author, and he has my regards."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good book","review":"This book is a good one.

This book goes so much deeper than one can imagine, and when you think about it it really is a shock. A shock of how much the american dream has changed, and how friendship can be destroyed. This book does make you think of society and the hopes of reaching goals, it challenges and disturbes you as you read it (actually as you think of it).

Certainly, this book had any point to it whatsoever. The fact that a man would kill his supposed 'friend' just because people are after him is absolutely horrible. There was absolutely no plot to this story and you knew exactly what was going to happen next. This book was a waste of time and a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Starts Out Good but Declines Throughout the Book","review":"During the first chapter of the book. It hooks you right away. From the moment the characters arrive at the barn it declines. If you have ever seen \\"Pinky and the Brain\\" these are the characters. Except Lennie is more stupid than Pinky! My two year old cousin has more common sense than Lennie. The book is highly illogical."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not make me read this again!!","review":"I do not know what all of the fuss is about this book. Every single page I read was an absolute yawn. I did not care what happened to any if the characters and I just did not care about any theme this book attempted to convey. For me, I got not one thing useful from reading this book. And I can usually find a little bit of a gem in everything I read. So not interested in reading Grapes of Wrath. Oh well, can't win 'em all!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't be happier with this product!","review":"Book came on time and was in great condition.

I guess we all have our prejudices."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eli's the king","review":"I think that this book was very weak.There should of been more killing.I also think that lennie did the right thing by killing the girl at the end.The book wasn't very good.To much swearing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Of mice and men","review":"What confuses me more than why I was forced to read this book in school was how anyone could call it a masterpiece or a classic for that matter. I'll admit the relationship between Lennie( mentally retarded) and George was sweet. Although as the book so uneventfully progressed, things turned terrible between Lennie accidentally killing Curley's wife and George shooting Lennie. As in both The Pearl and Of Mice and Men, Steinbeck seems to love writing about innocent people getting shot. Steinbeck is a pessimist to say the least and I will never read his works again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning","review":"This tiny Steinbeck classic, published in 1937, is still considered one of the most stunning, impact producing works ever written. It continues to knock my socks off. And more than likely, always will. If you've never had the pleasure of reading this timeless classic, you really, really should."},{"rating":"2","title":"Literature Light, but Enjoyable","review":"After racking my brains trying to read William Faulkner, I decided to give this short, simple, touching story a try. Steinbeck is a great author to read after Faulkner; his easiness of style cures the headache Faulkner's vortexes of plot development cause. This novel, which was written to read like a play, contains the memorable characters of George and Lennie. Lennie's phrase, \\"Are we gonna have rabbits George?\\" has been immortalized. This story is easy to read and enjoyable; however, one cannot help to sympathize with the loneliness of all its characters. I recommend this book, but I classify it in the \\"Literature Light\\" section of the books I've read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Of MIce and Men","review":"The book has great story about how two men with very different personaliltes get along. They travel together working on a ranch. Their goal is to earn enough moeny to live out their dream. It shows how no matter what happens they have a friendship which connects them in some way. They have a wonderful frienship and stand by each other. Lennie is not the brightest man and can be a little aggrivating but no matter what George is there to help and protect him. This book is a great book that shows how very different personalities can get along. I fully recommend this book by John Steinbeck."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books I've ever read","review":"I loved the book! I had to read it for english and it was an in class assignment so we read thru it together. The 2 main characters, George and Lennie, go from town to town looking for work. most people think that it's weird that 2 men would travel together(not that way). Everyone thinks that George is taking Lennie's pay check and using to go to town and use it for the whorehouse. It had vivid descriptions and pictures that I had acutally thought I had lived and worked with them. It does have some foul language, but if you focus on the language then you will not be able to read thru it and feel the emotion. Also if a 12 year old could read it then most likely anyone could. The book covers the following topics: life in the early century (30's), racial prejudice, prostitution, and the all american dream. There's also a tear-jerking ending so be forewarned. Overall, (obviously) I loved it!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic for a reason","review":"This book is a very brief but moving tale that will leave you thinking. Stienbeck's mastery here is in character development. He creates a cornicopia of characters in a genius way, quick and to the point. Somehow, in such a short amount of time, he creates characters you feel you've known your whole life.The scenery is well built as well, and the story itself is interesting and timeless. It could be set in 2006 just as easily, and still be relevant. It's a very relaxing read, and flows smoothly.You wont want to put this book down, and you'll only be busy about an hour reading it. This book is just as entertaining as I'm sure it was in 1937, and can be called a classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Controversial Themes in Of Mice and Men","review":"This book is the powerful story of two young men, George and Lennie, trying to fulfill their longtime dream of owning their own land. In the meantime, they work at a small ranch to try to gain enough money to buy their own land...A major theme that has caused controversy among many schools throughout the country is its bad language. According to Christopher Moore ... there are over 122 curse words in the book and is thought to be an \\"unChristian mindset\\" for children. Some other controversial themes that have caused the book to be banned in many schools are its \\"...moral statement(s), treatment of the retarded, and the violent ending.\\"... Personally, I thought that this was a very good book that showed true frienship, through \\"thick and thin\\" and I don't think that it should be banned in schools."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tehe sadest book I've read.","review":"This book is the reallity of life.

It is very well done. Much better than the recent versions. Of Mice and Men is a classic in my eyes."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Easy Read","review":"Of Mice and Men was an excellent book. It tells the story of two men traveling and working together. Beginning in nature, it gives a sense of peacefulness. As the story goes on you learn about how one man causes trouble for the other. It tells of their big dreams for the future, but with a surprise, twisted ending, you learn there dreams will never come true. It is a very easy read while still giving a good story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Of Mice and Men","review":"Of Mice and Men by John SteinbeckThis story is about two men, Lenny and George, trying to make a living on their own. Smart and witty George finds them jobs, while slightly retarded Lenny helps accomplish the work with his ox-body structure. When tragedy hits this motivated duo, Lenny goes into hiding. The book ends in a terribly sad game of cat and mouse.This book was slow-paced at first, but the tables turn as you get further into the story. The characters were well portrayed and the conflicts of the story are exciting and keep you on the edge of your seat. The plot thickens after a while and forces you to keep reading; its hard to put this book down! Of you like classics with twists, turns and devestating disaster, this book is for you. I hope you enjoy this novel!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Over-rated","review":"This book is kinda over-rated - it's by Steinbeck 'n everything but I couldn't read past the 20th page."},{"rating":"1","title":"B-O-R-I-N-G!!!!!!!!!!","review":"i had to read this book for school so i bought it so i could and im normally a really fast reader and my thoughts dont really trail off when im reading but i opened the book and started to read the first page, it took me 5 minutes just reading that one page because i would start thinking of what im gonna do this weekend or whats for dinner and then have to start over cause i couldn't remember what i had just read, so in my opinion dont read this book unless you absolutely have to."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like John Steinbeck, you are insane, please seak help","review":"This book was quite possibly the worst book i've ever had to read. No wait, the worst ever was The Pearl! What is wrong with Steinbeck? Why does he feel he needs to kill main characters? I would seriously recomend that you never read this book ever.

I was shocked to see that the book has a good amount of cursing and that the school recommended this book to be read."},{"rating":"2","title":"DOWN AND OUT JUST EAST OF EDEN","review":"I have mentioned previously in review of Steinbeck's Grapes of Wrath that he had an ear for the language and circumstances of the drifter, the loner, those who live on the edge in seemingly fabulous California. This is not the California of the Chamber of Commerce hype but it is part of the history of the West Coast nevertheless. Of Mice and Men is in that same vein although there is probably a little more pathos to the characterizations of Lenny and George than Steinbeck gives to those in Grapes. But the dreams are the same. And why shouldn't they be. It may very well be that the best laid plans of mice and men go awry but, damn, we don't have to like it and what it does to the human spirit. And neither does Steinbeck. Read this book, read all of Steinbeck's books."},{"rating":"1","title":"mlms.peteyboy/ps","review":"\\"Of mice and men\\" is not a very fun book to read it has very bad racial and verbal langauge. for a book to do a report on it would be a very good selection it definitly shows the characters piont of views by explaining thier body language as you read so you can imagine how they feel. it gives importance of characters by putting them in situations that require them to take action.It is mostly a very good book with very interesting characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't undertsand it!","review":"Although this book was very well written, I couldn't understand it very well.

This book was awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you didn't like the pearl,you won't like this one","review":"Of Mice and Men had a good begining and a good plot.

I hadn't read this book since 10th grade, so I bought a new copy and read it again. I like the imagery and characterizations. It's a good story, plus it is a good book to read when you want to read \\"literature\\" but are intimidated by the 800-page Russian or British books. (Or likewise, Grapes of Wrath) The major problem I have with this book and much of Steinbeck's works are that the majority of women are portrayed as [prostitutes] who let their sexuality cause evil. Even on the back of this novel, it says something like \\"George protected innocent Lenny until a flirtacious woman...\\" I'm just tired of Steinbeck's view of women as evil sexual temptresses (East of Eden, Wayward Bus) or [prostitutes] (Cannery Row, Sweet Thursday)... definately worth reading though."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Powerful Story","review":"Between the haunting characterization and the brilliant story-telling, Steinbeck created a novella that captures the human experience with an eerie certainty.

George, a small out spoken man is responsible for Lennie, a larger hardworking man whom is mentally retarded. Both share a common dream of owning some land and being treated fairly.

Unlike most of the other ranch hands the two are traveling together from ranch to ranch, and even more than others are because Lennie is always getting into trouble. Lennie loves soft things, which gets him into a lot of trouble. At this last ranch they think they will finally fulfill their dream and earn enough money to buy a piece of land, Lennie gets into the biggest mess of all."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic","review":"Must Read!

All of the characters, are, in extreme situations, where the only salvation is work, and dream.

I would recommend this book for soft-hearted people. Ramone P.The book \\"Of Mice and Men\\" didn't really interest me because in a way the title didn't really fit the story. Also, the point of the story was not clear. The title didn't fit the story because the whole book wasn't about mice and men. The only thing in the book about mice was when Lennie kept picking up mice and having them as pets.

The way Steinbeck portrays Lennie and George just sets the mood. Giving Lennie his tremendous size and childish brain and having George as a tiny man with big ideas makes every situation they get into a bigger challenge. Their slured speech and stupidness is a key to this thilling novella.

Very rarely funny, My Life With Morrissey is a mixture of stupid ideas, redundant jokes, bad camera work and poor movie making. While watching the film (and I did force myself to watch the whole thing) I kept thinking, \\"If this was a college film project and these were my friends, I would probably find it humorous... But I don't know these people, so it's just annoying.\\" It's not that I'm some humorless Morrissey fan upset about the portrayal of Moz and his fans, it is just that the movie is simply not good.

She is an outcast and made fun of by everyone.The extras are actually more interesting than the movie! Clips of Moz conventions and psycho-fans are pretty funny. The extras actually have a couple of Moz photos/distant video-cam clips.I LOVE Moz but HATE this movie. Please, borrow it, rent it, or steal it but DONT waste your hard-earned cash on it.

I am a huge Morrissey fan, and this movie did let me laugh at myself a bit, which was nice. But overall she could have been obsessed with any other star, the movie didn't actually have much to do with Morrissey. If you know someone who owns this movie or can rent it, please do that instead. I don't regret seeing it, but I do regret spending money on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rent it before you buy it!","review":"I'm a big fan of off the wall movies. When I read the reviews I thought this would be a great movie. I really didn't pay attention to the negative ones. The description was interesting and the cover art made it look like this girl was over the top, and would be fun to watch her. It was the WORST movie I have ever seen. It was 30 minutes into the movie before I even laughed, and that was the only laugh of the movie. I was hoping it would just end, it was so STUPID! I waisted my money big time! I've never reviewed any of my past purchases, but after watching this I had to warn people. My only recommendation is try to watch it first before you buy it. I guarantee you won't"},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly Disappointed","review":"Allow me to summarize this film for you.A self-centered, rude and unlikeable Morrissey fan licks Morrissey posters and basically deludes herself into believing that she is going to marry him.I understand that the film is intended to be funny and over-the-top, but the humor is merely vulgar and mean spirited.Before someone accuses me of simply not like Morrissey or of being a victim of Hollywood formula, let it be known that I am both a huge Smiths/Morrissey fan and an admirer of independent films. Despite these facts, I couldn't bring myself to enjoy any aspect of this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Plain Bad","review":"Production quality aside (I allow a little leeway for independent films) this movie was possibly the worst movie I have even seen in my life. After reading other bad reviews I was ready to dismiss them and attempt to enjoy My Life with Morrisey. I am a Smiths fan, but did not care if Morissey was in it or not as long as there was a good storyline to follow. Boy was I wrong. The only thing worse than the script was the acting. That was 125 minutes of my life that I will never have back. Save yourself the time and headache and get a different movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware!","review":"Yeah, it's kind of over-the-top funny, especially in the way it portrays the character of a rabid Moz fan (we've all had to stand in line with them, and we've all safely watched from them afar as they tear his tossed shirt into tiny shreds...), but as a movie or a comedy, nothing quite says \\"low-budget\\" like this movie. Seriously, it takes about 35 minutes worth of something that would be good sketch comedy and stretches it out into an eternity. This makes \\"Joe Dirt\\" look like Oscar material. Find someone who has a copy and borrow it-- the original owner won't even care if you fail to return it. Better yet, save your money and just go buy another bouquet of gladiolas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasant book about desert life.","review":"I haven't learned the music for Way Out in the Desert yet, so I can't speak for the tune. However, the rhythm of this counting rhyme is a lot of fun. It gets a little old by the time you get to the tenth verse, but the beat is enjoyable. If you don't like poems that sort of get you into a singsong mode, though, you might want to skip this one.The illustrations are beautiful, and terms are explained at the end of the book. If you know how to pronounce both Spanish and English words, this text is a delight to read aloud. A great introduction to desert life!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gorgeous Drawings and Fun Poem","review":"Way out in the Desert, by Marsh and Ward, illustrated by Spengler, is a counting book featuring hidden numbers within spectacularly colored drawings of desert animals and their habitat. The verse is in rhyme and can be sung to \\"Over in the Meadow,\\" and the musical accompaniment is provided in the back of the story. I kind of chant this one to the kids and at the end of each page they look for the numbers hidden in the picture. Featuring plant and animal species which are native to the southwestern desert habitat, this book shows kids new animals they may not have seen before."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for young children","review":"My children, ages 1,3, 5, 7, absolutely LOVE this book (We have the board-book version). The rhyming is catchy and well-written. We live in Arizona, so they love reading about creatures we see everywhere. And they really get a kick out of finding the 'hidden' numbers. My 3 & 5-yr-old are always requesting it for bedtime storytime. They yell out the numbers as I read it, then we all count the creatures together. It's a great book for the whole family!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"A great little book that shares some of the 'magic' of animal life in the desert. Engaging pictures and creative text. Too bad the board book version doesn't have the glossary that's mentioned in one of the 'offical' reviews. So in case you didn't know, \\"javelina\\" are medium-sized mammals of the family Tayassuidae, and an \\"ocotillo\\" is a desert plant that looks like dead sticks for much of the year, but grows small leaves during rainy periods."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for aquarium","review":"Solid product, way cheaper then BRS.

I ended up wishing that I had walked in the first place and not wasted my time and $9.00 on this sea of stupid lines and pointless \\"plot\\".

Drew Barrymore is wonderful as the adorable amnesiac who starts each day with a fresh slate. Adam Sandler plays the smitten admirer who wins her over, only to find he is completely forgotten the next day. And the next. And the next.Rob Schneider is more irritating than funny, except for the scene where Drew beats the crap out of him, but the rest of the supporting cast is a joy to watch.You'll smile. You'll laugh.

Remember Guy Pearce\`s character in \\"Memento\\"? Well, in \\"50 First Dates\\" Drew Barrymore plays Lucy, a girl that loses her recent memory each morning, virtually living the same routine endlessly. Adam Sandler\`s character falls in love with her and dares to conquer her attention everyday. Cute, and very touching. Anyway, this movie ends up being too repetitive, slow, empty and especially unfunny, mixing drama and comedy yet failing to suceed at both. The directing is nothing special either, and the performances and characters are flat. Fortunately, the flick still presents some entertainment value, so it\`s not a complete disaster. But there are much better movies around (Bernardo Bertolucci\`s \\"The Dreamers\\" or Michel Gondry\`s \\"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\\", to name a few).Watchable and equally forgettable."},{"rating":"1","title":"For small gutter minds","review":"There is much raunch in this movie trying to pass as humor.And give me a break.

Sure. Maybe if he would have been a virgin looking for his one true love then it would have been beliveable.And all the boob, ass, homo, vomit, sex jokes are just plain mindless and talentless. \\"are you sure you will still love her in 15 years if she lets herself go and sex with her is nauseating\\" How would you like that said as you say your wedding vows while the \\"preacher\\" is looking at his fat wife?

This film! Ok, it's not as bad as, lets say, Mr Deeds or Little Nicky, but it was a massive disapointment. It came across like a last minute idea Sandler and his buddies had while vacationing in Hawaii and though, ah hell, lets do a version of Groundhog Day here and pass it off as a movie!Do yourself a favour.

It's wayyyy better than Sandler's last 4 projects, which really weren't that funny. Well, okay, mr. deeds was kinda funny....anything with steve buschemi....i digress.if you're a first timer and you're expecting some serious dramatic moments, then good news, there's a walrus in the movie which plays the part to perfection.on the whole, really funny, good ending...kinda bittersweet, okay i cried - so sue me!what's the movie about? good question.let's see if i can answer that in a few sentences...pineapple, amnesia, beach boys and a walrus :D"},{"rating":"2","title":"Adam Sandler Lost It...","review":"Well, when you hear of an Adam Sandler movie, a natural reaction is that you think that the movie is a hilarious comedy, but in this case, that's not entirely true. Don't get me wrong, the movie is FUNNY, persay, but I don't think I would catagorize it as a true comedy.If you're looking for an Adam Sandler type comedy, I'd rather recommend There's Something About Mary, which is a comedy with Ben Stiller and Cameron Diaz, than this movie.But don't get me wrong, this is a good MOVIE, but not a good comedy. Rob Schnieder's role is just plain dumb, but Drew Barrymore is what truly makes the movie worthy of watching. She did an excellent job. You have to be a die-hard Adam Sandler fan for you to appreciate his performance in this movie. If you are watching this movie for Adam Sandler, then this is a pure waste of your time, but if you're watching this movie for Drew Barrymore, it's well worth it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"best movie i've seen all year!","review":"Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore make a great couple! the storyline promises greatness but it's even better! After the intial fun of such a subject (drew's character has no short term memory) they get to the meaningful part of the movie and just makes your heart fly it's so great! A must for everyone!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"extremely funny, surprizingly sweet and rather sad.","review":"The first semi serious movie that i have seen played by Adam Sandler and co-stars Drew Barrymore and after watching the movie i found it to be better than i expected not only is the movie outragesly funny bad a rather sad side is added to the story enough to make some cry. The movie has the same humour as Adams previuos movies but it just as funny none the less.The movie starts with adams character going at with all the girls but dumping them soon after until one afternoon he finds himself visiting a calm ocean side restaurant where he meets Lucy(Drew Barrymore) who day after day he would fall in love with until he has to think of an appropriate method for her to live her life the best she possibly can.#with a combination of witty and desgusting characters makes the movie a very enjoyable watch with the same original humour of previous Adam sandler movies but is just as enjoyable i would highly recommend you watching the movie yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great \\"love to smile\\" movie - one for the ladies!","review":"I've read some of the reviews and have to disagree with them - this is a really sweet movie. Adam Sandler's character (Henry) is the typical luv 'em and leave 'em kind of guy before he meets Drew Barrymore's character, Lucy. Due to brain damage from a car accident a year earlier, Lucy can't convert short term memory into long term memory - she keeps replaying the same day over and over. Henry is intrigued by this at first, and tries each day to get Lucy to like him. After awhile, though, he truly starts to care for her and wants to help her move on with her life. Other characters - the friends from the bar and Lucy's father - are super in how they protect her by replaying the same day over with her. Her brother is definitely doofy, but easily ignored. This movie is a romance with a happy ending. Prepare to smile alot and maybe even cry a few tears!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun movie","review":"Loved the movie. Actually like to watch anything with Drew in it.So adorable. Anyway I would like to know which island most of the movie was filmed on. I would guess Maui but don't really know."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"I made the mistake of going into this movie with The Wedding Singer in mind. I LOVED that movie, but this one cannot begin to live up to it. What a shame and a waste of time. Appealed to my 14 year old mainly do to the inane one liners and oftenRAW comments. What does the size of the Walrus' member have to do with anything in this movie other than an attempt to add filler to an otherwise dull and overplayed plot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasantly suprised","review":"I am usually not a Adam Sandler fan but I was bored one day so I decided to rent this movie. Ignoring the first 20 minutes this movie was excellent. The premise of the movie is simple a man (Sandler) meets a woman (Barrymore) the click instantly. But sadly she suffers from short term memory loss so the romance can never be...or can it. I love the invetive way in which his character tries to get her to remember him. Drew Barrymore was wonderful. I think it would be kinda hard to constantly protray an amnesia victim over and over again in the same movie.Overall I recommened this movie if you like sweet romantic comedies. And ladies don't let the fact that Adam Sandler staring in this put you off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny","review":"The chemistry between Drew Barrymore and Adam Sandler was great! I never thought Drew was funny, but in this movie, she had me cracking up. The movie is basically about a woman who got into a car accident and lost her short term memory, so everyday her loved ones create the day she last remembered, which was also her father's birthday. Adam, a tourist player, comes into the picture and falls for her regardless of whether she remembers him or not. Adam is always funny and that was the reason I rented the movie. The pirate guy with the five kids had me in tears. And the Steroid Son was pretty entertaining too. This was a really funny movie that I thought was going to turn out not-so-good-but-okay-because-of-Adam. I was wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rent Groundhog Day instead. . .","review":"I really wanted to like this movie, but it just left me just a little disappointed. Sure, it was a pleasant and cheap way to spend an evening, but it just did not draw me in. Perhaps the humor was just a little to adolescent, and the character development a little to predictable- the potty humor of the Drew Barrymore characters brother was unnecessary and the silly characterization of support characters (i.e., the German lady) was a distractionThe premise, though unlikely, could have been workable; but as I watched it, I could not help but think how much better Groundhog Day covered the same material. So, if you are thinking about a comic romance, skip Fifty First Dates and rent Groundhog day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unnerving","review":"I don't know why, but this movie disturbed me. Perhaps it was the concept of the film. Or me imagining that happening to me what was happening to Drew Barrymore's character. Whatever it was, it kept me from enjoying the movie. I did not really find it sweet or cute or funny in any way. It was just odd. I know that people do experience such an awful form of memory loss, but to me, that makes a good dramatic film. Not a romantic comedy. I mean, I can understand why people would wish to make light of the situation and make it romantic and whatnot, but for me, it didn't work. And the parts that were supposed to be funny, really weren't. It was all kind of desperate actually."},{"rating":"1","title":"AMERICA'S CRITIC","review":"I HATED THIS MOVIE TO THE FULLEST!!!!!

Drew Barrymore and Adam Sandler are the perfect match for the perfect romantic comedy. The twist on this romance (and the fact that it was filmed in Hawaii) gives the film a magical quality that warms the heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality comedy with heart","review":"Adam Sandler's previous track record has been shaky, with some underwritten comedies (Anger Management) and movies that failed to find a mainstream audience (Big Daddy). 50 firsts Dates makes an improvement by not only providing an original script that lends itself to both comedic double entrees and depth, courtesy of Drew Barrymore's stunning performance, with convincing pathos. Sandler brings another great character to the screen, especially since this story provokes just as many tears as guffaws. This is possibly Sandler's best film and boasts great comedic turns from Rob Scheider and Sean Astin. This film really does work on all levels, and considering I'm not a fan of the genre. Combining an impressive supporting cast with a sprightly running time and hip soundtrack, and you have one of the best comedies of recent years. Highly reccomended."},{"rating":"2","title":"not like you'd expect","review":"I think it's unfair to the movie that it is getting such bad reviews. Everyone went to the movie thinking that since this is Drew Barrymore and Adam Sandler it was somehow going to be like the Wedding Singer. Well it isn't. if that's why you're reading this review stop, because it's not the Wedding Singer. The plot is completely different. If there was one movie I could only compare this movie to would be Groundhog's Day with Bill Murray, and that's only because some things are having to repeat. It's still a halarious movie with a pretty interesting plot line. The location is absolutely gorgeous. It's overall a pretty good movie that you have to see for yourself, and NOT base it off what others say."},{"rating":"2","title":"Possibly Sandler's Best","review":"I have to admit that I am not a big fan of many of Adam Sandler's movies. I thought he was funny on \\"Saturday Night Live\\" but I find many of his movies dissappointing. Some I find just not good (\\"Zohan\\") while others I find good for a while then they lose steam.(\\"Chuck & Larry\\", \\"Click\\" \\"Spanglish\\") Most of his movies I'll find some funny or amusing bits but not enough to sustain a whole movie. I keep watching Sandler movies and finally I've found one that is very good from start to finish.\\"50 First Dates\\"_is a very good movie with a clever premise, a good script and a good supporting cast, especially leading lady Drew Barrymore. I've liked some of his other films (\\"Big Daddy\\" \\"Bedtime Stories\\") but not as much as this one. It shows that given a good script, Sandler can make good movies.

If it ever get slow Billie Burke ( good witch of the north in Wizzard of oz) livens it up even better then Mrs. Howell did in Gilligans Island. Her comic often comes up as genius, and occasionaly brightens the movie just when it needs it. She wasn't used enough in comedies if you ask me.A few hidden doors and passage ways make for curious and bordering on scary moments. It has Rochester and an inside joke to his \\"former boss\\". some excess in the Seal scene. The boat offshore makes no sence and is never explained.Still it's a pretty fair comic mystery movie too and who can guess the real villian?But it's a fun yarn with a few cuties and reluctant heroes to enjoy.Though some similarities to the \\"Thin Man\\" exist, it's far more light.The DVD loaded easily, no apparent flaws in reproduction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure fluff","review":"The story is wafer thin and it matters little. There is more crammed in this little unsung film than most comedies. Despite the racist undertones, Rochester shows why he was regarded as such a great comic actor.

Dutch is not a particularly difficult language for English speakers, so that helps. Other than tourist oriented sentences and an index, the only other material is a table that explicates pronounciation. Again, no big deal here. Pretty much anything a tourist might need to say is here.The only things that might make it better would be a crash course on conjugating verbs, and a glossary at the back for supplementary vocabulary."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charming book!","review":"The Vicar of Wakefield is a wonderful book. A little slow going sometimes, but still a good read. Not only does it tell a story of a family but it also relates very well to real life moral and ethic values. It could almost be said to be inspiring. And definitely shows that the ends justifies the means."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sometimes the classics can be boring","review":"Oh well, sometimes you get the bear and sometimes the bear gets you. Reading the classics can be boring as this classic illustrates. Goldsmith should have kept to poetry and left the novel alone else he would not have produced this mess in the form of a philosophical romance, a loosely constructed story held together by ideas. Rasselas (Johnson) and Candide (Voltaire) are much better and worth a look. Meanwhile why bother with a story wherein the hero moves episodically from security through trials to the discovery that happiness and what truths we may grasp lie at home and in the human breast. The ideas are quaint and silly. The writing stylized and artificial. The characters impossible. The plot preposterous. You have better things to do with your time - like sleep."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't read this book while operating heavy machinery.","review":"Holy god, don't buy this book. It is intensely bad and over-appreciated. 1000 words cannot even begin to do justice to the extent of this book's worthlessness.Clearly, 18th Century vernacular is a hurdle in any book, but I doubt Garrison Keillor could rework this story into something bearable. The story is an exercise in description and banality. There is virtually no inertia or direction to the plot, and characterization is hopelessly shallow.Seriously, don't get this book. I'm warning you. I love great literature, and I hate this book. Ok...\\"hate\\" is a little rough, but I really, really don't like it. Try something more enjoyable; like stapling your hand to your eyelid.Ok, just so I have not wasted all your time, read anything by Wilde or Kafka instead. Read some freaking Mark Twain, for goodness sake. Just lay off the Goldsmith."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good 18th Century Novel","review":"The Vicar of Wakefield is a good book that shows how a family overcomes one harship after another. It is funny and at times very witty. Even though the language is a bit old fashioned, the book is still fun to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"She just gets better and better.","review":"I anticipated this CD for so long. I began to fear that I might be let down, and \\"Harmonium\\" would just be 'just another album.' Oh but it's not, it's definately not.Vanessa blessed us with 11 tracks this time around. The first single \\"White Houses\\" is simply an amazing track. It's had huge success on radio from Hot Adult Contemporary formats, to Popular Top 40. The video was also very cool, Vanessa showcases her talents in dancing on the video.Other great songs on the album are, well, check the tracklisting. I can't pick out one song that I don't like. Their all unique and original.The other great benefit of this album, is the \\"Pleased To Meet You\\" documentary as an enhanced feature of the CD. It's a fairly lengthy video filled with Vanessa's thoughts on the record, plenty of live material, and more.5 Stars, definately worth every penny. You won't get tired of this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"this album takes awhile to get used to","review":"This is an even better album than Be Not Nobody - the lyrics and vocals and everything about it is superb! It's not radio-friendly pop like Be Not Nobody was. Fav songs on this cd are: Annie and Half A Week Before the Winter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Work","review":"I have fallen in love with this music! The material is amazing though \\"Be not nobody\\" had its own magic that held the album together, this new record sounds different but different isnt always bad well at least not in this case.

Even though it had some catchy tunes. When I found out that Vanessa Carlton had a new CD I new I needed to get it... Little did I know how amazing it would be. She has shown so much growth since her first album, and I hope that this gets her through the \\"sophomore jinx\\" as they say... and if it doesn't then people don't know what they're missing.

William Hung, you don't have to worry about your career...Vanessa is no threat to you.Of course, she is the one TV and I am not..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow little girl","review":"Carlton thinks she is so damn profound, oooooo you came up with one of the most self important pseudo intellectual album names ever in \\"Be Not Nobody\\" Be Not Nobody? Try \\"Be not educated.\\" This girl is a shallow child, and it shows in her daft music. Just because you drop a name like Steinbeck in a song doesn't make you smart, or worldly. Here's a cookie, now shut up and go play with your even more narcissistic pseudo-intellectual boyfriend Johnny Third Eye Blind. These two are cut from the same lame ass hipster mold that you can find in any of the coffee shop of Berkeley, pontificating on their own genius and never realizing that they are not special no matter what people tell them. You want real \\"intelligent\\" music; try John Lennon or Tori Amos. Listening to Carlton's lyrical drivel is like grading a freshmen Philosophy paper, it's trite and irrelevant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrid!","review":"She's right in the middle of the pack of all the prepubescent sounding talentless young female singers that the recording industry is foisting on us. I was on the verge of canceling Time Warner cable when they discontinued her commercial. I hope this is the last we hear of her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vanessa is...","review":"One of the WORST vocalists out there today. I can't think of a more irritating \\"singer\\" than Ms. Carlton. Thankfully her latest CD bombed so hopefully I won't have to be subjected to her pre-school-like vocals."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow! What a great CD","review":"I waited for over a year for the new cd to come out, and my wait was worth it. I love the cd. I love Vanessa'a voice and I love the melody of her music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Amazing","review":"If you liked Vanessa's first album then you're going to LOVE this one. I don't normally write reviews because I think people should decide for themselves and not rely on other's opinions, but this CD is just too amazing to not tell the world about. The songs sound much more complex & fuller than the first album, and they explore more themes than just relationships, I don't quite get her vampire metaphor yet, but I'm working on it. If you get a chance to see her live, do it, because she is amazing, even more amazing than the CD. Personally my fave track on the album is Papa - it sort of has a jazzy feel, lots of half steps & unexpected chords. Definitely check this CD out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"I asked for this album and got it for Christmas without ever hearing anything from it first. That's how much I loved her first album!I was not disappointed, this is an excellent album. The video \\"home movies\\" were fun to watch, too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing pianist and songwriter","review":"I don't really like her voice though it sounds a little better than the first album. She definitely has a gift for writing piano hooks that stick with you though, without which a 1000 miles wouldn't have become the modern pop/rock classic it is known as."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who's to Say She's Not Good Enough?","review":"Perfect album! I can hear it two times in a row without getting bored, (notice that in about ten days I will be celebrating a year of purchasing it) I love it, well...C'est la Vie is not that good, is kinda weird... but in the other songs the lyrics, the music and vocals are just awsome! Well done Vanessa, you just became my favourite singer! If you haven't got this cd I encourage you to buy it right now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harmonium review","review":"Vanessa Carlton proves once again that she not only is an amazing musician, but that her voice is certainly unique.The second album from Vanessa 'Harmonium' is a fantastic blend of pop, classical and orchestral music, not to mention the blend of rock.A great album with something for everyone.White Houses - the albums first single opens the CD with a great flow of upbeat tracks where Vanessa's pianist skills shine gradually changing to a line of slow amazing chill-out songs.A great album written based on real life experience, you'll be hooked!Also a great CD-Rom documentary following the recording of the album.Highly recomended and a great second mature album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"As good as the first","review":"If you liked Vanessa's first cd this will definitelynot dissapoint. There is absolutely nothing to beupset as a fan about. She stays along the same linesas the first one with San Francisco being as catchy ifnot more catchy than A Thousand Miles. If you take thesix best songs off the first and the six best off thiscd you have one heckuva cd. Would love to see hertake a chance of the next one and write a song pastthe formula 3-4 minutes. Her piano playing andorchestration would be incredible if allowed to be morethan just fill-ins for a standard pop song."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harmony Ridden","review":"This is one of those \\"I bought the first one--liked it--but will I like the next\\" cd's. But I took a gamble, purchased it, and I'm glad I did. Harmonium is a total mood piece. It puts you in this dark place with hope on the horizon. Like a million beams of sunlight streaming through. White Houses is plain fun ear candy. And San Fransisco is intelligent, catchy, and moving all at the same time. Vanessa pounds on the piano with such fervor in some songs, you feel like she's moving mountains. Then touches the keys so lightly you barely hear the melody. A grand album. Two times the charm."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as I had hoped","review":"It sounds somewhat incomplete and boring to me to listen similar kind of tunes through out the whole thing. Still better than figure head type musician but not as good as I hoped. Felt this is the limit of her or the producer so I don't plan to buy next album if same producer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vanessa is getting weird","review":"There are a few mildly catchy songs, but tracks like \\"Half A Week Before Winter,\\" which mentions vampires, \\"She Floats,\\" which seemingly tells the tale of a ghost, and \\"The Wreckage,\\" which make it seem like Vanessa has a death wish, are too disturbing for me. Vanessa almost comes off as a suicidal Goth at times, and that's just weird. This CD is very dark, making it too different from her first album. And there's nothing as catchy and radio-friendly as \\"A Thousand Miles.\\" The melodies are usually upbeat and catchy, but the album seems bittersweet because of its depressing lyrics. I don't like this as much as her debut."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shameless Self-Promoter","review":"She's featured on Time Warner cable commercials in West Tennessee. Her voice is actually quite irritating and the fact she is promoting this CD on an ad in this manner is a huge turn-off."},{"rating":"1","title":"I gave it a chance but....","review":"The only reason I am writing this is because of that Time Warner commercial that keeps playing on TV was driving me insane! Now I mute the sound every time it comes on. I kept thinking, \\"Why are they showing this local musician on this ad?\\" Then I found out VC is a very popular singer, so I gave this CD a chance by listening to the preview clips above (maybe the ad did not do her justice, I thought). Well, the same weak,thin, and out-of-tune voice is still there. If you're over 14 years old and like this music, consider yourself tone-deaf (I'm a classically trained guitarrist who has played longer than VC has been alive, BTW). I think she does have some ability on the piano (I'm assuming that's her on the piano), though."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't get it.","review":"all right. i admit it. i don't get it. i had never heard of her before that irritating commercial started airing 500 times a day. i keep the remote handy just so i won't hear her bland, uninspired, amateurish rendition of a great stones song. this cd is all fluff. where's the emotion? what, does her dad own the studio?"},{"rating":"1","title":"If I could, I'd give her negative stars","review":"There must be an explanation for why Time Warner Cable chose her to do their commercials, but I just don't get it. Her voice is like fingernails on a chalkboard to me. I've seen drunk karaoke singers sing better than her. She is everything that is wrong with the music business today - record companies will promote these no-talent artists in advertising, pay off Clear Channel (who owns 90+% of all radio stations) to spin their records, and true artists are left behind. I bet the hair on Mick Jagger's neck stands up when he thinks of his classic tune being butchered by this nobody in those annoying commercials."},{"rating":"1","title":"HATE IT","review":"The cover of this CD is misleading.

It's easy to understand the attraction of this dreck -- it's atmospheric, kind of like elevator music in Dm, Dani Filth is an atrociously horrible singer, and their Edward Gorey meets soft porn cover art doubtlessly appeals to the latent Anglophile that lurks 'neath the heart of every American.

If anything, this album is definitely NOT a boy-band sound-alike. Clay's style is somewhat hard to define as he goes against the \\"pop\\" styled music which seems to dominate the radio these days. He's very smooth with a powerful voice - my favorite track is \\"This Is The Night\\" - very emotional and tender. He's a nice guy who's in a very tough business and there are those who don't like him because he was \\"made for TV\\" - which is utter nonsense.
