Longtreet in a effort to mask their own questionable civil war records or to enhance their own current reputations and that of Gen. Robert E. Lee. This book was Helen Longstreet's response to that attack.Keep in mind that at age 17, Helen Dortch was editoress of the Carnesville Tribune newspaper, in Carnesville, Georgia. As a newpaperwoman, she possessed all the investigative and writing skills necessary to cull facts from fiction.

For me, the price at Amazon is competitive with other retailers. I wanted to use this tuner for piano tuning. It has several features that I found helpful. First is the microphone pick-up that is on the back of the tuner is sensitive when placed near the strings and used in a quiet environment. Second, the needle dial is quite helpful in finding the correct pitch as well as the indicator lights for flats and sharps. I purchased the microphone, yet I really don't see that much more sensitivity using it. The lowest octave and the highest octave are not really picked up by the tuner so you will have to use your ear to get those scales tuned with the rest of your octaves. For me, this was a good investment for my money, I would buy the tuner again.

It takes an important text and turns it into a piece of garbage.Consistently, the special Icelandic letters (, , , etc) are rendered as gibberish, and there's no excuse for this. The entire process indicates laziness and stupidity on the parts of the publishers. They scanned and digitalized the the text but were too stupid to realize that often less common fonts don't translate well. They were then too lazy to examine the text and fix this problem. The solution would have been simple: finding a set of fonts that accurately reproduce is not especially difficult, but it clearly was a task beyond the skills of those who produced this waste of paper and who then had the effrontery to try to pass it off as \\"An Icelandic Primer\\". It is NOT that book. The constant errors in the letters make the text useless.For shame!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Kindle version is great!","review":"The earliest two 1-star reviews were for the print version. However, all the Old Norse characters show up wonderfully in the Kindle version. I say 'Old Norse' because the text deals with Old Norse / Icelandic and not the modern Icelandic language. Here, the acute vowel accents (á é í ó ú) are passed over in favor of macron vowel accents, just as they are in the author's \\"Anglo-Saxon Primer With Grammar, Notes, and Glossary; Eighth Edition Revised\\", which is also free for the Kindle!As a bonus for those into Norse mythology there are some stories about the sir, Vanir, and Jötnar in the original Old Norse, and the sections therein which have explanatory notes are underlined and clickable.

Its easy reading with a fun twist. I fully recomend this to young readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable Heinlein juvenile","review":"No one was a better SF storyteller than Heinlein. I especially like his engineering description of a spacesuit, and explanation of motion equations. Good hard science based fiction there. The far out intergalactic travel stuff is fun too. There is one thing about the novel that bothers me, though: Since it refers to a lunar base and a space station, it's obviously set in the future, but Heinlein makes almost no effort to make the reader believe Kip is actually in a future society. In fact, it's rather obvious that the book is set in the year it was published--1958 (there is no way a soda fountain drink costs only 35 cents in the \\"future\\")."},{"rating":"2","title":"My first Book","review":"This was the first Science Fiction novel I ever read.

One of the worst sci-fi books I have read in my life! Incredibly childish, primitive and boring!

I have read the book literally thousands of time since then, and I have read it a good ten times since downloading it onto the Kindle app for my Android phone. It is the quintessential science fiction novel in my experience, the perfect book to introduce the genre to my 8 year old self.The action is on a huge scale, yet it is intensely personal to the narrator Kip. His sense of the danger and the awe and wonder are so well conveyed that I could feel it myself even as a child.This is without a doubt Heinlein's greatest juvenile and still captures the sense of wonder and hope of the 1950s science fiction. I lament that this sense of wonder died in later decades and I wish every day that we could recapture it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book, Both Times","review":"I had read this book when I was in Junior High, and always wanted to read it again as I had enjoyed it so much, and was curious to find out what I had missed due to my age at the time. I took advantage of the opportunity to download the book to my iPad and to read it while I was flying on vacation. I found it to be as riviting and exciting as it was when I was MUCH younger, and found that while there were some nuances I had missed the first time around, I had managed to commit to memory the most important parts of the book. I highly recommend this book to fans of Robert Heinlein, or anyone that likes suspense or mysteries set in the future!"},{"rating":"2","title":"TIMELESS CLASSIC","review":"This is a perfect novel written in a unique way to appeal to youngsters and adults alike. I recall reading it many many years ago as a young teenager and being totally enthralled with the plot and the action.

Now, having read this a third time, I can realize that its a great blend of plot, action, humor, with a satisfying ending. I will get my young son, a teenager, to try it and hope to take great satisfaction if he enjoys it as much as me..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even after 40 years, still one of the best SF stories.","review":"I first read this book almost 40 years ago and I still enjoy revisiting Kip, Peewee and the Mother Thing every few years.

This story has never left me. For some reasone it left quite an impression. Recently I ran across a copy at a book sale and purchased it, took it home and read it again. I now know why it has stayed with me all these year! It is good! I have, over the years read quite a number of Heinlein's works and I must admit that this is probably my favorite of the bunch. I realize that it is considered a juvenile book and it is certainly an appropriate read for the younger reader, but, as I just found out, it is quite a nice read for the older reader also. As I remember, looking back, this book rather inspired me in many ways, and doing better in school was by no means the least. Some of Heinlein's later work was rather difficult for me to digest, i.e. I simply did not like them. I rather wish he had stuck to simply telling well told tales as he did with this one. Recommend this one highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book changed the way I thought","review":"This was one of the first Heinlein books I read -- or for that matter, one of the first SF books that I read.

Second, although the string instrument(koto)sounds pretty much Eheiji-like, the flute, definitely the dominant instrument on this cd, sounds more like New Orleans jazz than zen, which is quite disturbing, to say the least. The first piece ends quite abruptly, which is a disaster if you are meditating.I was thoroughly disappointed and it was hard to remain calm and centered thinking of the wasted money. It landed in the garbage can after just one try.How other people could write raving comments about this cd is a something of a koan to me.I recommend Sanctuary by Riley Lee, which is real Japanese and Zen and is 61:19 minutes long!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good walking music","review":"I don't currently meditate seriously. (Though I do sit and stare into space with a blank mind at times, it's not quite the same thing!)I put this into my portable CD player as I was going on my daily walk, and it was remarkable what it did. Instead of drawing my attention to the music, it focussed my attention outward. The familiar scenery seemed to take on a new and mysterious beauty and the sounds of wind and birds seemed to harmonize with the music, giving me the feeling of being on a strange and mystical journey. Wonderful as a change of pace and as atmospheric music, and I look forward to attempting meditation with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD for calming the mind","review":"This is a really nice CD, with shakuhachi-style music. A couple of things that may not be apparent from the description:-- The CD is from Verve, as the artist comes from the jazz tradition. This didn't come up for me explicitly in the music itself, but I thought it was an interesting way to make sense of the performance on the album.-- Most of the CD is improvisational. This wasn't an 'issue,' but it does emphasize that the music on the album is primarily non-melodic and spontaneous.Overall, a nice album if you want to foster a calm mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for meditation/prayer or simple relaxation.","review":"I hesitated to order this, as I do not practice Zen mediation, but I did so based on listening to the samples. And I am so glad I did! This music is wonderfully relaxing and works as either background or the focus of attention. Some of the selections have almost a Native American quality to them and they all can transport one to places of spiritual peace or renewed energy. Wonderful meditation tool for anyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what I was looking for...","review":"This is an excellent CD, very beautiful. The music seems to enter into and flow in between the atoms that make up your physical body. However, I don't recommend listening to anything when doing zazen. Zazen is best practiced in a very quiet room. I discovered Tony Scott thru this CD and plan to seek out more of his music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yawn...","review":"Zen meditation could be called a state of heightened awareness (although that's not quite accurate). This music induces here a state of heightened drowsiness. Although not unpleasant to listen to by any means, I do find it rather sleep-inducing and hypnotic -- a bit too serious, and dare I say, almost boring?If you want to actually do zazen, no music is necessary or particularly helpful... pay attention to the breath and be aware of thoughts arising. Otherwise, this music could be interesting to listen to purely as a sort of relaxation or enjoyment -- from that basis, it's not bad... if you like improvisational stuff (is it 'art'?). A step further in the direction of \\"interesting\\" might include Riley Lee, Uttara-Kuru, Kokin Gumi, even Kitaro..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful, Relaxing Music","review":"I absolutely love this album. I do not meditate to it, however I love to listen to it in the evening as a way to relax and ease into sleep.I brought a few cds with me to the hospital for the birth of our son and this was the only one I wanted to listen to throughout the whole labor (over and over) Everything else drove me crazy. I guess it was kind of a meditative aid during that time. It helped me to focus outside my body instead of on the contractions. I would actually count on the next note to appear just before it did.

Its construction is poor at best. My son is less than six months old and already the plastic screw and nut construction won't hold the binding together. The book pops apart every time I open it, it is a real mess. If this is what it is like at less than six months, I wonder how the publisher expects it to hold up as a lifetime keepsake. What bothers me the most about it though, is that I have been reluctant to pick it up and write in it because I don't have the time to line up the pages and put it back together again once I open it. It is a darn shame. I can't return it, since I've written in it already. I did call the publisher and they offered to replace the book, but really, that isn't what I need, I need better screws that don't strip under pressure. My advice to you is if you get this book DO NOT unscrew the binding (even though it urges you to do so) it will never be the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"A word about the binding. . .","review":"plastic breaks. I simply and quickly replaced the plastic screws with metal ones. You can get them for a buck at any scrapbooking store.

I should not have listened. This book is all about the author. Notice her name prominently displayed on the front cover. The drawings are cute but there are too many pages on items that should take a couple of lines. This book is all about making the authors' art look nice than telling the story about your baby. I w rote a few lines in it already and then got mad so I can't return it. Now I must throw this away and get another baby book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"I love this baby book. It is beautifully illustrated and unique, inspiring me to complete the whole book for my child.The only problem is the binding. The book is difficult to write in while bound. As a temporary solution, I've removed the plastic screws that came with the book and replaced them with loops of ribbon. Once I've completed the book, I plan to go back to a more permanent binding. Unfortunately, I realize that with all of the photographs and other items I've added, the book will be too thick to reuse the plastic screws.Regardless, I do not regret purchasing this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and easy Keepsake","review":"Love it, asks cute questions and has allowed me to preserve memonries for my son...we have bought this twice now! oN for each kid!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love!","review":"I liked this so much for my first baby that I have already purchased another to use for the next expected baby.

The small metal Thomas engines are slightly more narrow than these tracks, but my son still manages to push them around the track. A few of the wood pegs at the ends of the tracks have needed to be glued back in, but the cars and trains have held up to much abuse. The bridge and the supports topple quite easily and needs a parent to put it back together. This could be solved by gluing the separate pieces together (which I think I will go do now).

As the first Divas Live show (the others that followed were pale comparisons), this one packs quite a wallop! This being New York, the energy exchanged and given by the performers and the audience is palpable! Indeed, each of the celebrated Divas were at their best. For me the highlights included Shania Twain (she may play the role of a silly glamour girl at times, but the yearning in her voice is REAL and what a voice, what a revelation)! The dignity of Carole King was great as was that--and the incomparable majesty--of Aretha Franklin. And while I am not really a fan of Gloria Estefan, her performance can't really be faulted--even if she sorely lacks the punch of the other singers. Finally, what can one say that hasn't already been said about Mariah and Celine? They were great, I loved them all and each of them deserved their due. A DVD definitely worth having. . ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific listening and sing-a-long CD!!","review":"I bought the CD on a whim.

An alternative to syrup of Ipecac!","review":"Imagine the most squealy, schreechy, nerve-wracking sound you've ever heard, multiply by five and add some severe ego and you've got this album. It's like like the Voltron of annoying women. They combine to form a ten foot tall nightmare banshee of screaming hell and never, ever stop. I don't think I've ever wanted to be deaf more than when I was subjected to all five of these women schreeching \\"A Natural Woman\\" in unison. One \\"diva\\" always having to top the other until a swirling maelstrom of shreiking banshee destruction radiates from the speakers putting you in a catatonic state of numbness.

The self-proclaimed \\"divette\\" outdoes herself by injecting a lot of energy into her performance and music. In the last several years she has also been able to leave her shyness behind and open even more to becoming a better entertainer.

Carol's book is a much better documented account of Ramirez, due in part, because Carlo actually interviewed Ramirez numerous times.If you really don't care that the information is correct or you just want a macabe story to read, then by all means, get this book.

This movie completely, totally, utterly su**s. The pathetic attempts at comedy work for the film's first thirty seconds before becoming unbelievably boring and stupid. Not only are the jokes (if you can call them that) not funny, but they beat you over the head trying to make you laugh so hard when all you really want to do is burn the VCR (or DVD or whatever the hell you're watching this on). Trey Parker and Matt Stone should forget about acting ever again and stick with making construction paper swear, and watching Jenny McCarthy try to act is just about the only thing worth laughing at here. Seeing Ernest Borgnine and Robert Stack in a movie this crappy turns my stomach. I really can't say enough bad things about it, but if I have to sum it up, Baseketball f***ing blows."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother....","review":"It's obvious by the multitude of five star reviews that people love this movie. For the life of me I cannot figure out why. I really wanted to like this movie. I watched \\"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut\\" and \\"Team America\\" and laughed throughout both of those films. Where both aforementioned films succeeded in keeping me entertained, \\"Baseketball\\" fell very, very short. \\"Baseketball\\" is a film overwrought with bad acting, worse jokes & one of the most asinine plots I've seen in any comedy ever. I know that comedies aren't known for intricate, balanced plot lines and stellar acting but I seriously didn't think this movie was going to be that bad. The only interesting thing about this movie were the cheerleaders, but even in all of their scantily clad glory it's not enough to save this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Occasionally funny......mostly boring","review":"South Park is fantastic. Orgazmo is a truly entertaining movie. Trey and Matt are obviously pretty smart and funny. But Baseketball is not really very good at all. In fact, it made me cringe often to see so many celebrity cameos that just fall completely flat. I'm sure they tried very hard to make this work, but it just doesn't. Watch Orgazmo instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"You'd expect more humor from the creators of South Park","review":"I was looking forward to seeing this film, when I did it was a disapointment.

I wouldn't buy it or rent it."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a shame comedy doesnt get much respect...","review":"If movies of the comedy genre were respected at all this one would have been an oscar nominee!

They play the game on driveways with there friend squeak. 5 years later there playing for real. With hot babes, people trying to take to ever, oops almost forgot I don't want to ruin the movie.

This is a must see and Trey Parker and Matt Stone only make it better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Among the greatest movies of all-time!

For all of us who love sports, but are tired of the antics of today's narcissistic athletes, Baseketball has arrived! A very funny, entertaining and often clever movie.Not a fan of South Park, I found Parker and Stone's movie effort well worth the time. Fans and non-fans of South Park will enjoy. Crude language, but not sexually over-the-top or violent.

It was cheap so I guess I shouldn't complain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Humor Only a Prepubescent Boy Could Love...","review":"Okay, so I'm not a prepubescent boy. I'm a nearly thirty-year-old woman who was made to watch this ridiculous film quite against her will... And, damn it if I nearly peed my pants with laughter!However, I do not recommend this to anyone who dislikes bathroom humor on principle. Though each joke is well-executed, each corny, melodramatic quip delivered with deliberately dewy-eyed sincerity, it is unapologetically juvenile, raunchy, and pretends to have no amount of redeeming value. But even its lack of values came as a surprise to me, for I can't help but give it more credit than it seems to give itself for having very strong underlying themes of maintaining integrity (believe it or not), and of course, friendship.Bottom line - if you're looking for good clean fun, this is not for you; but if you're feeling a little off-color, goofy and in the mood for a guilty pleasure, this is a film that, at the least, will make you laugh in spite of yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"You Can't Help But Laugh","review":"South Park writers and creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone star in this hilarious film \\"BASEketball\\" as they form their own professional sport and find themselves lives. While being loaded with outrageous moments of sheer hilarity, this film also has a statement to make about how professional sports are money hungry. Through the combined rules of baseball and basketball, Joe Cooper(Trey) and Doug Remer(Matt) find themselves a new sport that requires know athletic skill whatsoever. There talent lies in the ability to psyche out the opponent, and they certainly have great success doing so. Filled with great cameos, great scenes in the hospital, and during games, this a great comedy for any fan of South Park. The humour certainly has its moments of grossness, but it is a pleasure to watch. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring, dumb, cheap jokes, no laughs, tame and lame","review":"I laughed two times during this movie..it starts off hilarious and then just gets dumb and dumber. South Park can be pretty funny..why can't they translate that into live action?honestly this movie has two or three laughs in it and the rest totally bombs. There is nowit. Trey Parker and Matt Stone have some wit and know what's edgy, but this movie is basically composed of jokes that will just make you roll your eyes.

It does things that just make your eyes open wide and scream out \\"Oh My Dear God!!\\" Your only defence system is to laugh. I still remember the first time I saw poor defensless Kenny get decapitated and the look on my face. Baseketball just repulsed me where I had to turn my head in defence. I'm not going to get into much detail, because I do not want to ruin any of the \\"jokes\\", but they're just bad and lacking any real wit that can be seen in South Park.

They of course didn't give me the refund, but oh well.I can't recall even a single moment during this movie where I laughed.The only part that amused me (very slightly, mind you) was when the guy got catapulted through the rafters of that building.

You may enjoy it but I didn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laughter the whole way through it!","review":"Most assuredly one of the more underappriciated comedy movies of recent times, BASEketball is hysterically funny despite it's occasional forays into more low brow humor. Not as vulgar as South Park or Orgasmo, it still holds with it the comedy genius of Trey and Matt, and the list of guest stars seems to be neverending. Even Mr. October himself, Reggie Jackson, has a cameo appearance. A good movie for a good laugh, and one of my personal favorites."},{"rating":"1","title":"Road Kill","review":"I enjoyed this movie, but it is not their best work. There is a lot of down time between jokes, but that is not Trey and Matt's fault. They are excellent writers and actors. The first time I watched BASEketball, I had to rewind the \\"Road Kill\\" clip. I died laughing each time the announcer said, \\"Road kill, caught on tape!\\" and you see all the animals hitting moving vehicles. Unfortunately, that was the funniest part of the whole movie.

There are NO sports heros anymore, teams have traded, people have sold out, thank you Coop, Reemer and Squeak. Also, a big point in the movie is, a little boy named Joey who is dying because he needs a liver and Yassmeen Bleeth plays Jenna, the leader of the Foundation who helps Joey. Coop insantly likes her.Ok, this movie is a laugh a minute movie, and Trey Parker and Matt Stone with Dian Bacher play their parts so well!

They are all great movies, and I recommend that you try to see the other two if you liked BASEketball!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Baseketball will have you rolling from start to finish!","review":"Baseketball is hilarious. It's done in the tradition of other great comedies such as Something About Mary, Dumb & Dumber, ect. Trey Parker and Matt Stone show the same kind of sense of humor that you find in South Park (but with an R- rating, they can get away with a lot more.) Yasmine Bleeth co-stars as Coop's (Parker) love interest. She is hot enough to make the movie a hit, by herself. Expect some surprising cameo appearences,too. Baseketball is one of those movies that you find new stuff to laugh at each time you see it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Witty and comical in ways no one has ever attempted!!!","review":"Trey Parker and Matt Stone push the limits of normal comedy beyond obsurdity and back then beyond where they were before. With great cameo appearances by that guy from \\"Unsolved Mysteries\\" and major stars in minor roles like Jenny McCarthy. This movies outrageous plot and fantasy with the creative genius of director David Zuckerman, will have you laughing almost all the way through. You will have to see it two, three, maybe four times to catch all of the wit and hilarity that this movie has to offer."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Movie Is A Comedy Gem!!!","review":"This movie was made Trey Parker and Matt Stone who achieved great suceess with their South Park series. This movie is VERY FUNNY from the outset when Matt reveals his intentions to Trey as they arrive at a girl's party. Later they are seen having a good time in (unknown to them) the girl's mother's bedroom.The jokes come hard and fast and a highlight is when Trey and Matt try to \\"outpsyche\\" their baseketball opponents.

It's truly funny, though has times which are a bit crude. If you wish to watch something and roll around laughing (as well as you are open-minded and not easily offended by sexual innuendo and the like). The story line is ultimately about 2 losers whom wanted to look cool by creating a new game (a mix of basketball and baseball; hence the name) and by some miracle the game went world wide.

Where is the much-needed acton in this series. I had just finished seeing RTLD and was very impressed. However, this dvd series is a SCAM!! There is no essence of LD except for Newt. If your expecting to see the much favored Captain Call, don't waist your money on this lousy TV series! And I wouldn't even bother to get the Outlaw Years!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"four stars for Lonesome Dove: The Series","review":"First there was Lonesome Dove the miniseries. Then came Return To Lonesome Dove the miniseries. Then came Lonesome Dove: The Series which was followed by the Lonesome Dove: The Outlaw Years. There was also another Lonesome Dove sequel miniseries Streets of Laredo as well as a prequel miniseries Dead Man's Walk.The DVD sold on this page is just the first three episodes of Lonesome Dove: The Series. I like those episodes but there is a set of all 21 episodes of that show available on DVD which is a far better buy for fans of the show. Lonesome Dove: The Outlaw Years has also been released in a 22 episode DVD set. Both The Series and The Outlaw Years were great programs and deserve a four star rating. You'd really be better off buying those full season sets instead of the DVD sold on this page since the Tales of the Plains DVD on this page only has three episodes of Lonesome Dove: The Series on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great western series","review":"Lonesome Dove: The Series (and its subsequent season 2, Lonesome Dove: The Outlaw Years) continues the Lonesome Dove saga.

I had to check it out for myself and watched it last night - some 4+ hours of material. The film - with and without commentary - plus over an hour of bonus video blogs. I've seen a lot of movies, but nothing quite like this. I'm still trying to absorb what I saw and heard. This is a keeper to watch again and again and well worth the price of admission. Act 1 is way-over-the-top-bizzaro-titillating comedy. I kept thinking - where is all this leading? Act 2 take an unexpectedly darker turn until the end. There's ample nudity - OK, more than ample. Someone ask Matt Riddlehoover if he did his own \\"stunts\\" and he said \\"why, yes I did.\\" I'd say this film is a must see to believe, but that's just my opinion. I'll be waiting for Part 2!Sidenote: click on Steve Balderson's name."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Alternative Entertaining Experience","review":"I bought this DVD, hoping to enjoy a gay themed movie that wasn't a \\"B\\", with all the movies out there, this is one of the better made.

The script was bad, the acting was bad, but Matt is oh so cute. That's all that this movie is worth is to see Matt. Should've been 'more' of him to see, though, to make up for the dumbness of the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless","review":"Not only is the central character in this terrible film self-absorbed and self-indulgent, so is the film itself! This silly little diddy relies far too much on narration to make its rather inane point. The script is abyssmal and the actors are mediocre. The film has the look of a slightly more polished, but certainly not more entertaining, Troma film (the makers of \\"Toxic Avenger\\" and other cult favorites). But it possesses none of the skill Troma is known for in telling campy stories. I wish I hadn't wasted money buying this nonsense."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Most Touching Movies I have seen in a long, long time....","review":"Before I saw this movie, I was expecting a spooky horror story like the others I have been watching before Halloween. Much to my surprise, I found an incredibly engaging story which keep me riveted to the ending. I love stories which take us on a journey then either scare the daylights out of me or have me reaching for the tissue box. This movie is one whose ending touched my heart and gave me a warm feeling. I hope there are other films out there which try to emulate this one. Watch it as soon as you can and I think you'll agree with me it is a great one."},{"rating":"2","title":"surprised","review":"I was very surprised at this movie. I really enjoyed it.

I speak and read English and French.The film has the appearance of a badly colorized, old-old-old, badly edited, deteriorating, fuzzy, black-and-white film.This was an unappealing lost of $3.99 and a jolting deflation of my expectations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Reliable Shifter","review":"I'm using this shifter on my custom shaft driven bicycle based on a frame and shaft drive system from Dynamic Bicycles. This shifter has more pull than conventional shifters to accommodate the needs of a hub gear. The shifting is solid and reliable, with a satisfying click, I've never had a single failure with it. The only thing I would warn potential buyers of is the cable routing requires a wide run straight up from the shifter, which can be rather awkward."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great performance","review":"I was very excited to hear Misa Criolla. I've heard it performed live on several different occasions and this performance is one of the best. I want to applaud the tenor soloist, Ken Goodenberger, for beautiful, lyrical singing - even though I had to look long and hard to find his name! The warmth and beauty of his voice sent chills through my body. The Boys Choir sang with excellent intonation mostly, and nice musicality. The accompaniment by Khenani was superb. What a great feeling they have for this piece! All in all, this recording demonstrates excellence in singing and musicality from the Phoenix Boys Choir."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Mystery With Plenty Of Laughs","review":"This is the second book in this series that I've read and revisiting these colorful characters is like sinking into a big comfy chair. I like the way Ms. Taylor tells a story...it seems effortless (as it should). A very good mystery with plenty of twists and turns and a very satisfying conclusion. I don't understand why this author isn't getting more attention. She's gone to the top of my list."},{"rating":"1","title":"eBook problems","review":"The kindle version of The Heart is a Lonely Hunter is full of typos and errors. If you want to get the best out of this excellent novel then rather buy the traditional paperback version. The poor quality of this edition can only damage Penguin's reputation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Marvellous work","review":"Every two or three pages, the hairs on the back of my neck would prickle up. This book is marvellous and masterfully crafted.Recommended reading: anyone with the time to spare for perhaps the best read of his or her life."},{"rating":"2","title":"For Anyone Who's Ever Felt Like an Outcast or Misfit","review":"Published during the second World War, this novel takes an in-depth look into the lives of unique characters who throughout American history have come to epitomize the label of \\"different\\", \\"outcast\\", \\"weird\\", \\"freak\\" or \\"misfit\\". There is a character in the book that everyone can identify with and come to understand their world from a more insightful perspective. McCullers makes a brilliant showcase of life not as it should be or how we hope it will some day become, but as it is, without artifice or evasion. She allows us to look at ourselves without pity or self-loathing and without rationalization or retribution. We can see ourselves simply as human. If the definition of a literary classic is a title that stands the test of time, this novel certainly deserves that distinction."},{"rating":"2","title":"A deep book","review":"The Heart is a lonely Hunter is a very different sort of book. I've read quite a few books, and never one quite like it. One person I know compared it to the Bell Jar by Sylvia Plath because of the dark story line. The story is based upon the lives of 5 main characters, the majority of the story telling spent on the mute John Singer and the teenager Mick Kelly. Themes of alienation, isolation, intolerance, loneliness, and the fulfillment of dreams dominate the novel. The opposite of a superficial book, this story is about how people feel at their core and their dreams and aspirations. The writing is good, but just not very happy. The focus is more on how lonely each character feels and for what reasons. After reading it, The Heart is a Lonely Hunter forced me to think deeply. And I believe the title sums up what Carson McCullers was trying to say in her first novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Book for All Ages","review":"This is a great story for people of all ages. As a teenager, I felt at one with the antagonist of the story. As an adult I see her transition more clearly than before. It is also a reminder of the power of the emotions of adolescence and those first real learning experiences, something I hope I will never forget."},{"rating":"2","title":"Carson McCullers' first and best","review":"This is an easy to read, sad and thought provoking novel that stayed with me a long time after finishing. The story involves the lives of four characters as they revolve around the life of a deaf mute in a small southern town in the 1930's. The story of the five main characters is so void of ego and superficiality that it allows their voices to resonate after you've finished with such haunting power it is miraculus to behold. Carson McCullers, who was increadibly only 23 when she wrote the book, writes with such fresh clean talent and crafts the arc of the characters with such sublety that it didn't hit me until the very end of the book where the elusive paths of the characters were leading to. The inside cover of the book calls McCullers a creative genius and after reading it I would have to be inclined to agree. The book reminds us that innocence at any age may be fleeting, so hold on to it as long as you can."},{"rating":"1","title":"So so","review":"I read this book because it was mentioned and held in very high regard in the book I just finished Off Magazine Street. Although it was very well written, it's definitely not for everyone and it made me feel as though I was reading it for a class. It was a struggle at times. I appreciated it, but would not recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"You Rock!","review":"This book is an nice read. Another very good and easy to read book is Barack Hussein George W & The American Dream by B. Charles Henry, ISBN 1466312645. In addition, his homepage at Amazon's B. Charles Henry Page reveals some interesting APA scholarly written texts. These are two great authors."},{"rating":"1","title":"B.O.R.I.N.G.","review":"This was the most awfully boring book I've ever read! It was for a discussion group or I wouldn't have read most of it. Had no idea it was a classic, but now wonder what made it so. All of our discussion group thought the same thing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Old Classic","review":"This book was originally published in 1940 and has been considered a classic ever since. Unfortunately, as Mark Twain once said, \\"A classic is a book everybody praises but nobody reads.\\" In this case, I am glad to see Oprah recommend it and thus restore its popularity. The characters are rough and sometimes ugly, but beneath all this the heroine manages to find beauty and happiness.Great story for young women readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is Boring","review":"First of all this book is something that shouldn't even be forced onto someone to read. The book is way to slow to grab someones attention. I love to read everything, but this book in one word is bad. It took me about 4 or 5 weeks to force myself to read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Words can not explain.....","review":"how BORING this book is. For the life of me I can not understand how some readers \\"LOVED\\" this. Like the reader from Manhattan, I also couldn't keep going after a certain page. And God knows I've tried. I've tried a couple of times. And I just couldn't go on. It just never took me anywhere. Why, for the Love of God is this book considered to be a classic?????"},{"rating":"1","title":"How can I say this?.....BORING","review":"I am an avid reader. I will more or less read anything and everything. This, however is the most boring book I have ever read. It's been 3 weeks and I am still on page 100. I just can't get into it. And sometimes feel like I should force myself to finish it. The characters are boring. They never grow or develop. What is the point here?? Why is this book a classic?????"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn...","review":"I just finished reading this book, and it wasn't easy. The characters were vague, frustrating, and aimless. So, who cares about them, not I. Life is too interesting to be so pointless, and there are too many interesting people in this world, so why write about such dull souls. The author's picture on the front cover seems to express her own feelings...Yawn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not only HS kids find this book boring...","review":"college grads find this book boring just as well. It was just so slow moving, so uninteresting, so dull and depressing. Gosh, there are so many books out there that I would consider classics. Why this book??? I can't believe readers are giving it 5 stars. I would give it NO stars if I could."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't even deserve 1 star","review":"I don't understand how people found this book excellent and interesting. But then again some people might not understand how I found this book totally boring, uninteresting and depressing. This book is far from a Classic and deserves NO STARS."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant, Classic -- Read It Today!","review":"Thank you, Oprah! I read this book as a college freshman in 1976 and still remember its startlingly honest, quietly devestating portrait of five women from a small Southern town and how, despite their individual loneliness, they fail to connect. Written when McCullers was only 23, it was the emotional and intellectual touchstone for all her other works. Still a pleasure to read and new generations of women will be mezmerized. My other two favorite recent books: \\"I Sleep At Red Lights: A True Story of Life After Triplets,\\" by Bruce Stockler, an amazingly funny and fresh memoir about marriage, manhoood, love, career, parenting and juggling. And \\"Reading Lolita in Tehran: A Memoir in Books,\\" by Azar Nafisi, an immensely moving portrait of the power of words and books in a closed society (and how we take books for granted)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book that will have you thinking!","review":"There is much to be said about this book and all of it good. The characters within the pages are memorable and demonstrate the old saying that \\"everyone is their own world\\". In the heart of the tale is focus on the solitude that exists in some lives. Additional points to ponder are racial justice through the eyes of a black physician that must wage his own fight after having his son jailed and misunderstanding as the various characters talk to a man that is unable to speak in John Singer. They assume that he is deeply concern without ever really giving thought to the truth of his quite sessions of listening to them going on and on about their injustices. Overall, the characters are seeking to air their discontent with the world while attempting to grasp the reality that has been dealt them. A very good book and one that I would highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loneliness creates peculiar alliances","review":"Excellent! Brilliant juxtaposition of characters. The constant dualism between the internal and external worlds of characters such as Mick Kelly make for an insightful look into human nature and the struggle with loneliness."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Truly Gifted Writer","review":"I will forever treasure this book. I only wish I had discovered Carson McCullers 20 years ago while an eager English Lit student ... what an inspiration it would have been to know back then that a fellow 23-year old had written such a wise, compelling novel. The cast of characters in \\"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter\\" will stay with me forever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Characters","review":"At first I didn't know what to think when I finished this book. It was such a page turner and the end was like a train wreck for all of the characters. I almost felt like it was without hope. When I thought about it further, though, I reconsidered. The characters in the story don't emerge unscathed or exalted from tragic or mundane circumstances, but neither to most of us in the real world. It would have been great if Mick had been able to become a composer like she wanted, but don't most people who dream of greatness ultimately end up somewhere in between. That doesn't make life or people less valuable. The interesting characters were not at all what they appeared to be on the surface. Reading about them made the book worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Many Reviewers AreToo Young to Understand","review":"It seems that most of the negative reviews listed here are from young readers. It's unfortunate that this book is assigned to students too young to appreciate and understand it. This book was required summer reading prior to my entry into Jr. High School and I really didn't think much of it at the time. Many years later, with some life experience under my belt, I reread this novel and found so many things that were not evident to me as a 12 yr old forced to read it for school. So - to all of you young readers (and teachers) - it's too bad you're forced to read stuff before you're old enough to appreciate it - try to keep an open mind and don't be turned off to some the classic of literature."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't understand this book!","review":"I'll admit that this book was interesting, but I didn't know where the author was going with it. I had to read this book for English so I could write a speech about it on whether or not it's a classic. I don't know what I will write since I really don't know what it's themes are. I could not relate to the characters very much. I don't know anyone like these people! What I saw were a bunch of losers who had their problems, but they didn't didn't try to help themselves! Mr. Singer was the most promising character in the book, but he killed himself! I was very disappointed! I guess this book made me realize that I have little problems in comparison to them. Don't read this book unless you are an expert on finding themes!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"I find this book boring.

Tell me it gets better."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a great book to put a person to sleep!","review":"This book put me to sleep before I could even finish a chapter. I don't think that it had anything to do with a real persons daily life. Overall I hated the book and it was the most boring book I ever read!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow & boring book....","review":"I was excited to finally join \\"Oprah's Book Club\\" and start by reading this book. As I read along and got encouraging emails from Oprah, I kept wondering when the long, cumbersome details of each character would end and some sort of interesting plot would develop. When I read the end of p. 359 the boring descriptions finally ended. Unfortunately, it was the last page of the book!!!I did get the point of the book, that we are all more the same than we realize or want to acknowledge....BUT...Overall, I felt that this storyline moved very slow and wasn't very interesting.I'm hoping that the next book club selection is better than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"It sucked!","review":"I had to read this book for school. It was rather boring. The only parts I liked was about Mick Kelly, and nothing ever even happend to her. But, it is easy to trace the pattern of lonliness throughout the book. Anyway, if you are reading it for fun, you've got to be REAL BORED!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow and dull","review":"I personally found the book slow and dull. It could not keep me interested and that is unusual since I can normally read just about any book that is put before me. There isn't much more I can really say about this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"This book was boreing to read because it did not follow a definite plot line and skipped from person to person. I didnt know what was happening or who it was happening to. It was a chore to read instead of a pleasure."},{"rating":"1","title":"For those who like to appear well read","review":"In the grand list of books that you will have enjoyed having read, this one ranks slightly above \\"Tom and Jane Go to Camp\\".Now, I'm not going to say that this book was trite, boring, lacking in substance or otherwise devoid of anything resembling redeeming merit, because it does have its purpose. That purpose being to sit on your shelf and make it appear as though you are some kind of eruditic masochist.If, like me, you were forced to read this book as some sophomore hazing ritual, you will no doubt remember that this book contains very little in the way of plot and character development. The characters don't so much grow as fester.I would not recommend this book to anybody, even those that I hate. People who have suicidal tendencies are warned to stay away as the most cheery portion of this book is slightly happier than a crushed puppy.In closing, let me just summarize: this book is bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time!","review":"The return for the time invested in reading this book was a big nothing - I regret picking it up. One of those books you keep hoping the author will pull together and deliver an \\"ah ha\\" moment - she didn't. The book simply goes no where."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely top notch","review":"This book was my mother's favorite novel. It's my second favorite novel, after The Triumph and the Glory. THE HEART IS A LONELY HUNTER is a masterpiece of fiction, an emotional experience without compare. I would encourage everyone to read it, it is simply womderful."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fine work by Carson McCullers!","review":"The Heart is A Lonely Hunter, Carson McCuller's first published novel, is a success in the eyes of the critics and in my own. She creates a world in which the reader will become engrossed and anxious to learn more about the well-developed characters, from the heroine Mick Kelly, to the God-like John Singer, to the rugged Jake Blount, to the sad Antonapolous. McCullers creates a beautiful story where the characters each fight their own personal battles as well as the universal battle of loneliness. I enjoyed this book greatly. The works of McCullers continue to amaze me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Read it when you're sick...","review":"...because then you can throw up on it, and you won't care that you have ruined the book!

As an avid reader for more than 55 years (I am 61 yrs old), it staggers my mind that I overlooked this \\"way back when\\". It is such an easy read ---- nostalgic & real. Please read it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"wunderkind","review":"I have such a connection to Carson McCullers and her work and it is difficult for me to pick a favorite, but this one just resonates. I loved \\"Reflections in a Golden Eye\\" and \\"Clock Without Hands\\". McCullers knows about outsiders because she was one, and used that experience to inform her writing. Similar to \\"Member of the Wedding\\", this novel has a tomboyish young lady who can't quite articulate her dissatisfaction with life and relationships. Each character is stricken with an irrepressible desperation and isolation. Anyone can relate to this novel. Only wish there were more undiscovered McCullers novels in a trunk somewhere..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read Cannery Row instead","review":"This book is lacking some vital essence. Maybe that was the author's point. I don't go into a book with the expectation that I will bond with the characters, but I do need a reason to finish reading it. (In this case, the reason was pure, dogged cussedness on my part.) While MuCullers gives us page after page of rich detail about her characters' thoughts, lives, and surroundings, she never pulls back to let us see the big picture of why we should care. Just about anything by Steinbeck is better than this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh! So BORING","review":"I don't understand how readers actually like this depressing, dark, dismal book. I just couldn't finish it. I got to page 90 and couldn't go back to it. The first book ever, that I couldn't finish. I didn't want to finish it!!!! It bored me to tears. I felt nothing for the characters. I felt nothing for the plot. It's a waste of money and reading time. I just feel for all those HS kids who are required to read it for English class. Avoid it if you can!!!! And try to reason with your English teacher...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh my, but this is a depressing read!","review":"I really can't see why this is considered to be a classic.

I'm an avid reader who will give any book a shot - at least the first 100+ pages. I read about 120 pages and threw the book away. I have never in my 42 years done such a thing. In a word -- BORING. I was not captivated with any of the characters, even the main character. I gave this book a fair shot and it failed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overnight Shipping -- what a rip off!","review":"Don't believe Amazon when they say you can have overnight shipping. MY daughter could not find a book for school, so I ordered it from Amazon.com. I paid more for shipping two copies of the book, so I could read it too, than I did on the two books. We are at 1 week past the day I ordered the books and they still have not shown up. My daughter has since driven 25 miles away to another bookstore, purchased the book and finished it. Two days I ago, I put in a request to stop the shipping and was told it was too late. This is ridiculous!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing pages","review":"I just received my book in new condition.

It doesnt deserve any stars"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's not an easy read but it's worth it","review":"Carson McCullers paints a wonderful picture of life in a southern town in 1939. The novel is filled with thought provoking images about lonliness, slavery, and hopelessness. But in the end, if you're willing to spend time thinking about the writing, you will enjoy the book.The book is dripping with descriptive prose (I didn't think there were so many ways to describe the sunrise or sunset)and the action moves very slow. Many people who prefer the current-day dramatic novel with it's fast paced action and heavy reliance on dialog may not find this book to be their cup of tea. But, in my opinion, it's worth reading this book if only to understand the world of 1940 when she wrote it.Afterall, reading is not about what the author is doing with her right hand but what she is subtly doing with her left."},{"rating":"2","title":"Discomforting","review":"I have seldom read a book with so little \\"action\\" yet so stirring. Admittedly, I am not a great friend of the South much less the language, but the characters of this book had me engulfed so deeply that I was not able to read any other book shortly thereafter for lack of depth, sincerity, emotion and total involvement.

Full of over-the-top imagery, cartoon characters, hoary motivations, semi-socialist polemics (truthfully it is so muddled it is difficult to find the point) and adolescent heavy breathing on the subjects of sex and fidelity and loyalty. It would be funny if it wasn't so earnest.Hemingway summed it up best by calling the book, \\"phony.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"JBC","review":"I am not sure why all the hype about this book.

I hated this book. It took me at least 6 months to read this because I could not force myself to read it. But that being said I also hate stream of consciousness and now wished that I had looked at some reviews and realized that was what I was getting myself into. I read 'As I Lay Dying' in High School and hated it too. There is no plot, and no point. I hated it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really, really tried...","review":"This is the most boring book I have ever read. I kept hoping something would happen and nothing ever did. I only cared about two of the characters out of about 5 featured and I was shocked to find that nothing ever really brought them together. I wasn't expecting a John Grisham thriller here, but I did expect to at least enjoy reading the book or even have something to think about after I was finished. By the time the last 20 pages came, I found myself just skimming to get to the end so that I could say I finished it and that my opinion was valid. All I thought about was how many hours I wasted reading it. Sorry, but it was that bad!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This Woman is a Bad Writer","review":"My lord, I should have gone with my instincts. I originally thought a book called The Heart is a Lonely Hunter was bound to be a piece of overwrought trash. Then I found out it was one of the best books of the century. What a farce that list is. This woman described a black man's hair as a \\"woolly cap\\". The endless overbearing light-dark motif. Oh, everybody's so lonely. Every other word is \\"lonely\\". Stay away from this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fair warning: IT'S AWFUL!","review":"Don't let anyone talk you into reading this book. It is truly awful. Anyone who tells you there is some deeper meaning to this book is full of blasphemy. I should know. I wrote a 500-word essay on this book for Honors English and it got an A, and it was nothing but a tissue of random guesses on what the author was trying to say. I don't think anybody knows what the meaning of this book is. They just want to act like they can see something in it that you don't. Just ignore them and read smomething interesting! The Heart is a Lonely Hunter is written in a snobby tone that makes you think you are stupid for not understanding it, but it means NOTHING! This book is nothing but a bunch of random, boring scenes in a bunch of random, boring people's lives. Avoid it at all costs!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"A boring book about lonely people and the things lonely people do (nothing). The photo on the cover of the book is perfect, and sums up the feeling through the entire book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to get into","review":"This book was very hard to get into. I didn't like the way the story jumped from one character to another. It was like the author's mind was all over the place when she wrote it.

Good heavens. I read this book years ago (in high school) and I loved it. I re-read it recently, and found it even more beautiful. It takes us to the meaning of loneliness and love in ways that other books don't. If you can appreciate works that pack a lot of meaning into the limited actions of characters (It's not a thriller, gang) and ask the reader to associate rather than merely see, you'll love this book. My favorite book is a toss up between this and To Kill a Mockingbird."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Detailed and Unique","review":"Overall I liked The Heart is a Lonely Hunter. It started out kind of slow but got better towards the end. It was kinda shocking at some parts, but that was what made the book enjoyable. I was surprised that everyone seemed to revolve around Singer. I thought Mick would be the main character. After I was finished with the book, I sat back and thought about all the troubles and feeling of isolation that all the characters had to go through. All in all, I thought it was pretty good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the ending i expected","review":"I decieded to read this book and join in on the hype. This book is not what i had expected.

It was not a gripping page turner. The characters were oddballs and not terribly interesting oddballs at that. I'm very surprised this was one of Oprah's picks. It was definitely one of the more tedious choices from Oprah's list."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"\\"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter\\" is simply a compilation of character sketches loosely strung together. If you are a student of literary characterization and the methods authors use to bring a character to life, you might enjoy this book. The charcters are indeed animated. However, if you are searching for a book that combines vivid characters with any sort of plot, this book is not for you. By the time I was half-way through the book I was seriously wondering when a coherant plot would develop. One never materialized. This book does not adhere to the standard beginning-middle-end, protagonist-antagonist-plot-resolution formula by which most novels abide.As I was reading this book as a book club assignment, I trudged through to its completion. Now all I wish is that I could recapture the hours of life wasted on its pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter","review":"Maybe it's just me, but I thought this book was boring.

In fact, so many classics are not happy at all. (i.e. The Grapes of Wrath, The Scarlet Letter, Sons and Lovers, etc.) I am tired of hearing people say that they disliked a book or film because it made them sad. There is more to it than that! Reviews are supposed to be objective if they are to help readers in finding meaningful books."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was such a drag","review":"What a waste of time. I seriously cannot figure out how this book was an Oprah book club pick. The characters where unlikeable to me. I didn't relate or sympathize with one of them. I didn't feel that there was a true story with a conclusion or point of any kind. It was down right strange. I forced myself to read it because it was a selection for my book club. I would not recommend it to anyone. If you want a good book w/ likeable characters and a moral message, read to Kill A Mockingbird. Now that's a classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is very overated!","review":"I've read this book once and I had to force myself not to put it down. This book is like the movie \\"It's A Wonderful Life\\" on the fact that it shows how one man influenced other people's lives. However, in \\"It's A Wonderful Life\\", the world was worse off without Jimmy Stewart, the characters are EXACTLY the same after their \\"Jimmy Stewart\\" is killed. So, his death had no impact. Doctor Copeland's constant complaining does not help the story in any way either. I very much recommend you to avoid this boring novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a book I'd recommend","review":"This book was required reading in my honors english class. When I first recieved a copy I thought it looked interesting and different. In the beginning I wasn't really drawn into the book, like so many other's I've read. I read on, thinking it would get better. I was wrong. In fact it just got worse. I couldn't relate to the characters. I mean a girl who hears music in her head, a man exploring his femine side, a Deaf-mute, and a man who is half the time drunk and the other half trying to start a revolution.

For others who feel like I do, I recommend another book I got from Amazon, \\"People of Passion\\" by Carl Mays. It is also about people from the South (Appalachia) who had it bad, but they found meaning and purpose in life and had the faith and determination to rise above their circumstances. There is no doubt that Carson McCullers is a talent, it's just that I was depressed by the way she used it with the characters and their decisions in their situations.

I am completely unable to find anything wrong with this album. People seem to really like Bringing down the Horse. I like Bringing Down The Horse a lot and the songs are really good some of them outstanding like Invisible City and Josephine and I wish I felt Nothing but there isn't near as much emotion on BDTH as there is on Breach.

After a few more listens, though, more of the songs came alive, and the hooks and lyrics became much more memorable. Most of the album, in fact, is excellent, lyrically stronger than previous Wallflower songs. There may not be as many radio-friendly songs on 'Breach,' but there are more truly exellent songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sophomore Album More Impressive on Some Fronts Than Debut","review":"I've been going through my music collection from A to Z over the past couple years, and finally have reached the Ws. Although [i]Bringing Down the Horse[/i] was a very impressive debut from Jakob's band, pound for pound this one delivers a more cohesive, solid sound. Out of ten songs (twelve if you count the two hidden tracks), there are only two that I would count as being 3-star songs. The rest are either 4+ or 5. Not too shabby for what many musicians fear in the sophomore effort; a slump, this is not.Favorite Song: Letters from the WastelandLeast Favorite Song: Witness"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Tom Petty&The Heartbreakers Clone????","review":"JakobDYlan&Crew Sound like they have been Listening non-stop to TOm Petty&The Heartbreakers.if the Profile of this Group wasn't so High&By The way carrying The Dylan Last Name wasn't being always Mentioned they Might get away with this Album.However it really doesn't add much to the last one.it's Basic&Comfortable in it's Element.Tom Petty has had some Moments but He's No Bob Dylan.why would you Settle for 2nd's when you should Strive to be Better than That?Maybe The Next Record will Bring better Results."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not their best stuff","review":"Given that the band took a 4-year hiatus since their last work, they certainly could have done better than this. although the first single, Sleepwalker, is catchy, the CD is punchless beyond it. Gone are the rhythms that made songs such as One Headlight, The Difference, Heroes, etc. into radio hits. I expect sales to drop like a stone once people realize the CD has only one hit on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Very Good","review":"Well, I waited for this album for quite a few years and I must admit I feel let down. \\"Bringing Down the Horse\\" was so utterly perfect and wonderful and I expected this album to be just as good. However, the songwriting is so bad on this album that I felt the money I had spent to purchase it had been wasted. I mean, what the heck was up with \\"Murder 101\\"? It sounds like garage music written by a 12-year-old. I gave the album 2 stars because at least the performance style is polished and the vocals are pretty good."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOTAL DISAPOINTMENT","review":"I don't know what I was expecting, but this CD blows. I wishI could take it back and get my money back. The songs I felt were just boring and we've already heard them a million times. Nothing new here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hum drum, lacks originality","review":"I don't care who's son he is, this cd really lacks originality. All of the songs sound alike. The \\"Bringing down the house\\" cd was great. This one really is a disappointment. Spend your $$ elsewhere.Son Dylan has a formula and applies it to all his songs. Maybe he needs a new producer?"},{"rating":"1","title":"umm...i dont know what yall are smokin.","review":"no song on this album is worthy of airplay. nothing catchy, and really its quite boring. some people do like the slower folky stuff and this stuff is just that.some of the lyrics are really just cliches."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whassupppppp","review":"I really do not understand these reviews. How can this record be considered stellar? HA! What a joke. The production is way too polished, the songs are simply dull. The hidden track is really the only decent track on the cd. I guess they are just trying to make some spending money (i would imagine it will sell millions...probably even win a grammy!) and sacrifice the creativity. I heard their first album and thought it was great....the second one was better.....and now this! C'mon guys! Jacob needs a little tutoring from his pop. This record, coming from a band with potential, simply sucks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Introjection","review":"I waited quite a long spell for this record to come out and the last few weeks of the wait have brought plenty of new articles, interviews, and reviews to heighten the anticipation. Most of the commentary I've read thus far has been positive, but there are a few spiteful reviews that want to dismiss the latest offering from The Wallflowers as a Tom Petty rip off. To those out there tempted to grab that nonsense and run with it, I want to share a word with you that I just recently learned to appreciate, myself. The full meaning of it hit me when I listened to Breach for the first time. Introjection: absorbing the characteristics of outside objects or persons by the self which then reacts to them as if they were internal. Breach achieves introjection of influences from The Pixies, Tom Petty and The Heartbreakers, and Elvis Costello, to name three, yet the songs are fully Jakob Dylan's own-and that's a good thing, despite what hucksters who seethe for a living would have us believe."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Great","review":"I bought Breach before I bought Bringing Down the Horse. I had heard \\"One Headlight\\" on the radio and loved it. I went looking for one of their cd's and only found \\"Breach\\". I bought it anyways, and found it to be great. I think eery song is a stand out on the cd. My personal favorite on the cd is \\"I've Been Delivered\\". It's a great story that I know everyone can relate to. I sure did. They are all very talented, and can play very well. Jakob is a talented songwriter. He has a gift of touching you without trying. Just like his father. \\"Hand Me Down\\" is another great song. \\"It's not that you've done something wrong/it's not your fault that you embarass us all...\\" At one point or another we all feel like hand me downs. And he puts that out there. I hope they keep up the good work."},{"rating":"2","title":"When are they releasing their next album?","review":"I turned a Wallflower fan long back when I heard that smooth, feel good music, deep (U2/Pink Floyd) lyrics and that bass Jakob Dylan voice on One Headlight. There was no chance I was missing their Breach. What I hear makes me feel only better!There is still some music alive after all. The music is never complicated, never jarring, never hard on your ears, the feel good music of Bringing Down Horses is definitely there only better. Sleepwalker, I've Been Delivered, Hand Me Down and Letters from Wasteland sound addictive. Lyrics are good and the moment you hear it you know it was meant for the music thats playing. In all, for Good Music Sake's get Breach."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid, good songwriting","review":"Jakob Dylan will always be in some way compared to his daddy, but now he seems to have gotten past caring about it. Breach gives us a maturing singer/songwriter backed by a laid back but still tight band. It reminds us of the days of yore when musical prowess was a product of thousands of hours of work spent on mastering your craft, not electronic aids and tools but instruments. As refreshing as a cool drink despite offering nothing new, just good music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent follow up","review":"Breach is a great sophomore effort by the Wallflowers. This album proves that the success of their first effort 'Bringing Down the Horse' was no fluke. Breach is just as captivating, but takes the band to a new level. These songs have more depth, with better lyrics and overall musical influences. I've just owned Breach for a few days and already have played it through more times than I can remember. Get this, you won't regret it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wallflowers Back & better than before, actually scratch that","review":"As a avid Wallflower fan since 1996, I was a little dissapointed in this album. While, I do enjoy it, the tracks took me while to get used to. They aren't as catchy as Bringing Down The Horse, but do have some liking. I like slower songs sometimes, and this album does have a lot of them. But don't get me wrong, it is still a GREAT album. Anything these guys do is great. Just dont go into it expecting another Bringing Down The Horse. Reccomended Tracks: 3-Sleepwalker * 5-Witness * 9-Murder101 * 2-Hand Me Down"},{"rating":"2","title":"worth the wait","review":"Much like many of the Wallflowers fans, I have waited four long years for this cd and it was well worth it. The songs on Breach may not strike the listener as immediate radio-friendly hits, but the catchy chords and soulful lyrics will definitely resonate in the head hours after the music has stopped. Breach illustrates the maturing of the Wallflowers, and they seem to have found a comfortable place to stand among today's rock artists. The cd may be a bit more mellow than Bringing Down The Horse (and shorter-only 10 songs plus a bonus track), but I think that it is a better all-around effort that will remind listeners of what it takes to be a truly great band. This cd is definitely worth getting and I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid stuff","review":"I was looking forward to this release, and am pleased to say that it falls in the category of CDs that improve upon repeated listenings. At first I was not blown away, but over time, I see the genius here. The lyrics are more interesting on this release than they were on Bringing Down The Horse. Gaining insight on his relationship with his father really brings us closer to him, and it's songs like \\"Hand Me Down\\" and \\"Letters From The Wasteland\\" that do it. A solid release from start to finish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bathroom Tapes - Drone On","review":"These songs are awful. The muscianship is awful. The singing is awful. No one other than the son of a rock and roll icon could possibly get this through a record company. The young Dylan sounds worse than sad voiced Bob Dylan on a really bad day. I mean a really bad day. And why is he trying to sound like his father anyway.Singing this awful should only be done in the bathroom with the shower on full blast or maybe out in a forest where no one can hear. I had to rate this on a scale of 1 to 5 stars so I gave it one star. Believe me it should have no stars. Drone on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wallflowers continue the miracle...","review":"Everyone think that the succes of Bringing down the horse was insurmontable. But The Wallflowers sign another excellent album, a very good album, not better than the first album, but it's a mature album. It's a very good album, so slow but ... everyone as found what the search on this New album by The Wallflowersa an Jacob Dylan..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD-- Definitely worth the 4 year wait","review":"I Bought this CD the day it came out. I was actually surprised. I had no idea I would receive the second disc which contains a live version of the song \\"Invisible City\\"(from \\"Bringing Down the Horse\\") and \\"Sleepwalker\\" again. But the whole CD is great. It was definitely worth the 4 year wait for the CD to come out. Every song on it is great. Though I love them all, 3 of my favorites are \\"Sleepwalker,\\" \\"Some Flowers Bloom Dead,\\" and \\"Murder 101.\\" Here's another thing. Even if you don't buy the Limited Edition copy, on the regular disc, after track ten(\\"Birdcage\\") ends, keep listening. After it ends, there is a hidden song called \\"Babybird.\\" It is another great song."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eloquent and ripe followup","review":"The Wallflowers come back with a highly-fulfilled album. Jakob Dylan sings so well in this album, especially in songs like Hand Me Down, Sleepwalker, I've Been Delivered, that you feel his existence behind these songs. His lyrics prove that he's not just a footnote or a page in the book. Jakob Dylan is a mellow book in his own right. Bonus track is a sweet song, probably the most peaceful song I've heard this year. Elvis Costello, one of my favorite artists, is a great surprise on Murder 101. The Wallflowers are delivered. The ideas come through. The four-year long waiting is definitely worthwhile. (Though I'm still wondering what that thing is, that Sam Cooke didn't know but Jakob Dylan does.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Anyone want to buy a used Binaural CD?","review":"Go ahead. Write me off as a casual, post-Ten Pearl Jam fan if it makes you feel better. Assume that I know nothing about the history of the band, or what their stance is in the music scene, or have heard none of their B sides. The fact of the matter is, this CD is pathetic. It has the sound of a weak garage recording, where Eddie's vocals are often drowned out by play that is about as tight as cheesecloth. The beauty and draw of this band has always been Eddie's vocals, which are virtually background noise here. If this is a sign of things to come for the band, then I guess I'll stick with the old stuff, and try and forget they ever made an album after Live on 2 legs. Maybe I'm just not \\"in\\" enough to \\"understand\\" what the band is doing, but I think its a lame excuse by people clinging desparately to what they want to hear. If it were any other band, it wouldn't have sold 200 copies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Songs that Go Nowhere","review":"I don't normally write reviews, but I feel giving this album 4 stars is completely out of step. I am simply writing this review to possibly balance the diehards. I am a big Pearl Jam fan, and I really enjoyed Yield. I just didn't feel like there was any direction or drive whatsoever on this album. The songs will build to what is hopefully a dramatic plain, but just don't seem to reach their ultimate destination. Maybe I'm rating this too low, but I expect much, much more out of a Pearl Jam album. It almost seems as if the band recorded this album with other thoughts on their minds, and missed the mark with the music. I see the potential in many of the songs, but that is what is most disappointing about Binaural. It seems as if they had just spent more time preparing themselves for this record, they would have undoubtedly produced a gem, like most of their previous work."},{"rating":"2","title":"just clean, pure and professional","review":"Even Pearl Jam members say that this one its not their best work, but i have to disagree with them, i think absolutely the opossite, Binaural is one of the best Pearl Jam albums ever, the work of Soundgarden's Matt Cameron its obviously a plus in the cd, songs like Light Years, Rival, God's Dice and Breakerfall, it makes me believe in rock and roll once again, They're a great band , they have already made history of music, and hopefully they will keep on doing it for long time. Remember Soundgarden , they're all one with PJ. thanks Seattle!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If you like Pearl Jam...","review":"If your a fan of Pearl Jam you need to buy this! I have all of thier CD's and as usual there are some songs that I am not really crazy about, then there are some songs that I HAVE to HAVE! Check out Light Years, Nothing as it seems, and Thin Air. I think you will find out that it is a CD worth having."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still not afraid to try something new.","review":"Pearl Jam is one of the few bands left that isn't afraid to take risks (as they do frequently on their latest) and do something that's, well...just not like them.Examples with this disk: 1)there are several songs that Vedder had nothing to do with the writing of 2)there are just as many typically abrassive and radio-unfriendly songs as there are <gasp!> catchy and almost fun songs (watch for Vedder's ukelele).So far my favorites are the first single, Ament's almost Pink Floyd-like \\"Nothing As It Seems\\", and the driving, melodic \\"Light Years\\". The usual hints at influence form The Who (the opening to \\"Breakerfall\\" strongly echoes \\"I Can See For Miles\\"), and Neil Young (I'm still convinced he has some uncredited solos on here somewhere).Great music, great lyrics, definitely a great break from the manufactured garbage that's making it all over the radio."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm diggin' it","review":"I had the opportunity to hear this record back in March when I visited Los Angeles. At that time, the master tapes were being flown to Atlanta so Brendan O'brien could mix the up-beat tunes (I guess Tchad feels fast songs are not his strong suit). I was kind of disappointed to see they kept only five of his original mixes. I personally love Tchad's mixing style and think they're much more unique. \\"Rival\\" is my favorite (that's Blake's dog). Overall, It's a great rock album."},{"rating":"1","title":"not a big fan of pearl jams new material","review":"i know im probably the only 1 star review so im gonna get bashed but i simply do not like this album. i wasnt a fan of no code or yield either and if you dont like those albums you wont like binarual. i was a big fan of ten and v.s but i just dont like the new pearl jam sound. no i am not a kornfan or kidrock posuer im more on the hardrock/metal side (metallica, nirvana) but i have one ? for pearl jam fans- what would be so bad about another album like ten? it has great guitar solos as shown in alive and emotional songs like black. to me binarual is just simply boring. breakerfall and insignifigance are pretty good but to me the rest of the songs fail to delvier. nothing as it seems makes me fall asleep and soon forgot, well eddie vedder plays a ukule. but if your not a fan of the new pearl jam do not buy this album. youll wish you never did"},{"rating":"1","title":"I Know, I Know...","review":"I'm probably going to have one of those 0 out of 345 people found this review helpful, but something went wrong. I LOVE ten as well as I love Vs. and Yield, but this is not a strong effort. I gave it two stars because I believe there are two VERY GOOD songs on it \\"Nothihg as it seems\\" and the best song \\"Sleight of Hand\\". I see many people reviewing it saying it was so great, but really, if this wasnt PJ they would rank it very low. I could care less about the whole \\"grunge is dead\\" and \\"go back music like ten\\", the lyrics would have been good if it were spoken word but w/the music behind it, it doesnt sound right, not to mention the lack of overall rocking that makes PJ a great band. I LOVED Tiny Music.. by STP(witch was not rocking either) and some people hated it, maybe its a aquired taste, but its not for me"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Evolution, Baby...","review":"Pearl Jam's latest effort shows an ever evolving sound and maturity beyond most rock bands of today. \\"Binaural\\" represents some of the best this band has to offer. Most songs are excellent, but, surprisingly there is little mention of my favorite song on this CD...\\"Sleight Of Hand\\". An experimental, but superb song that elevates the band way beyond their grunge rock beginnings. Will see this band perform in October and hope to hear this song performed live. The CD is highly recommended to all true fans of this ever changing band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pearl Floyd","review":"Can't you just hear the influence in Nothing As It Seems? Sounds like something from Pink Floyd's Animals period. Also, Rival has a very strong Roger Waters influence in the vocal presentation. The main vocal is backed by a an angst ridden, almost screaming backup of the same lyric a la much of Final Cut or Pros and Cons. A tight album that deserves credit for what it is, not what you wished it was going to be"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album","review":"After listening to Binaural for about one week I have determined that I cannot stop listening to it. Some of the songs are absolutely beautiful. It's a nice mix of great fast songs as well as slow songs.I bought Yield two years ago and I like that album as well. However, Binaural really stands out as one of Pearl Jams best. Their sound has grown over the years and it only gets better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grows on you, like fungus","review":"I'll admit I haven't been keeping up with Pearl Jam lately. The last album of theirs I bought was the brilliant \\"Vitalogy\\" nearly six years ago. So I figured I'd see where they're currently heading before treading back to \\"No Code\\" and \\"Yield\\". Boy am I glad I did. This album reflects an evolution - there are new directions here - while maintaining consistency. You can hear glimmers of classic PJ (to me, \\"classic PJ\\" is anything off of \\"Ten\\" or \\"Vs\\"). And I disagree with some of the other reviewers that the songs aren't \\"sticky\\". After only 2 days I can't get \\"Light Years\\" out of my head - I hum it in the office and annoy my co-workers (had the same problem with \\"elderlywomanbehindthecounter...\\" off \\"Vs\\"). And when \\"Insignificance\\" comes on, well it's time to crank it up. But the real gem here is Eddie's whimsically dark \\"Soon Forget\\" - a lesson learned, if nothing else. If you like well-structured rock, with thought-provoking lyics, definately check this one out."},{"rating":"2","title":"An album full of ROCK MUSIC. Imagine that!","review":"What a relief. I didn't think record labels pressed rock n' roll albums anymore. Well trust me, this album is rock. The first two tracks explode from your stereo. It's great! Insignifigance and Grievance are also great songs. Perhaps the highlight of the album is Eddie Vedder on ukelele! One warning though: Don't buy this album expecting to hear another Ten. This album is more in the vein of Yield. But it is not exactly the same, because once again Pearl Jam proves they can do the evolution."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst pj album","review":"Pearl Jam really dissapointed me with this CD. There's really not any great songs on the album, maybe a few that are listenable, but none worth mentioning. Even if you are a die hard pearl jam fan, dont waste the money on thisn."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Compilation of Disjointed Noise","review":"This CD is without a doubt the worst Pearl Jam effort I have ever heard. I've read reviews that advise listening to it several times before you judge it however, once was honestly all I could handle. For those of us who have been listening to Pearl Jam over the years, they have often included the occasional out of tune, slightly off key track in some of their albums but this sounds as if disharmony and for lack of a better word \\"weird\\" ho-hum effects were the goal. Get back to basics Eddie........Ask youself this, \\"When was the last time I heard anything from this album played on ANY radio station?\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Pearl Jam can not play with Neil Young anymore!","review":"Pearl Jam seems to be following in the footsteps of their hero Neil Young. They are so concerned about being commercial they are alienating all of their fans. Considering the talent in this band it is definitely a tragedy. This CD has very few keepers on it. The highlights are \\" of the girl\\" and \\"Sleight of hand\\". The rest are equal to anything you will find in the bargain bin at your local music store. Even the 1st single released off the CD does not match what Pearl Jam has released as \\"B\\" sides of their singles in the past. Eddie Vedder has one of the best voices around and he chooses not to let anyone appreciate it. I just hope the next CD will not take 2 years and be this big of a disappointment. Hopefully the tour will be better. 2 stars! Just because it is Pearl Jam and I am not the editor at Rolling Stone which would give PJ 5 stars for passing wind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Off The tracks.....","review":"This band has been on the downward spiral since after Ten which to my ears is their only decent album. This album just sucks. This is just a typical everyday crap album, im not a Pearl Jam fan anymore. If they did a TEN tour I would go see it if they weren't going to play any garbage after TEN espessially not anything from this album, Riot Act, BackSpacer or Yeild. Pearl Jam are gone and they are not comming back, they keep getting worse with every album Backspacer is the worst yet just radio drivel."},{"rating":"1","title":"The sparkle has dulled","review":"After a rather lackluster effort with Yield, the addition of Matt Cameron's songwriting and drumming talents to the group should have pushed PJ in a new direction. Instead, we have an album which is instantly forgettable, making one wonder if they have any good material left in them for album 7.AVOID!"},{"rating":"1","title":"a little dissapointed","review":"Being a huge music fan, and also being a moderate pearl jam fan i was excited to hear the new album. I was used to the normal pearl jam album, four or five brilliant songs and the rest getting skipped over, but i must say i was truly dissapointed with this album. Eddie Vedder seems distant and doesnt connect with the flow of the songs, the music is sometimes to much to handle, to much at once i suppose. If you like pearl jam, buy the live on two legs album, not this one, you will find yourself putting it in the back of your cd collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let down again","review":"Once again I rushed out to get the newest Pearl Jam Cd in hopes that they might accidently stumble back upon their glory days of Ten or VS.. Just like the times before I was let down. If these guys want to keep experimenting with new directions for music do us a favor and stop selling the results. \\"Nothing as it seems\\" should have been a clue. It showed possible potential that they were back on track. However, since \\"nothing is as it seems\\" I was mislead again. Rounding out the album are tunes like \\"soon forget\\" which could even make Tiny Tim cringe. Once again Pearl Jam disappoints."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can You Say \\" No Code \\" ?","review":"Allright, so Eddie, Stone, Jeff, Mike and Matt are no John, Paul, George and Ringo.. This album is a big dissapointment after listening to something as strong and sound-filled as \\"Yield\\". This reminds me of listening to No Code after having enjoyed \\"Vitalogy\\" as much as I did. Light Years and Insignificance are strong original PJ tunes, but the rest is fruitless.. I'd rate this album slightly higher than No Code, but not much. Too bad I bought PJ Tour tickets before I got a chance to listen to Binaural.. I'd be doing something else on Halloween otherwise."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Cover is Great!","review":"I give 2 starts for the cover artwork and for the massive promotion. The music is as good as good as any other Pearl Jam album in the mid and late 90's, if you like those albums, listen to them insted of buying another one who sounds pretty much the same (though seems like the quality here is very poor. now what kind of stupid gimic is that! )."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good, Solid Title.","review":"I'm not an old-school Pearl Jam fan, so I can't compare this album to their older releases. In fact, the only other PJ album I've listened to is Yield, the one released right before this one. My first impression of Binaural was mixed: there are definitely some songs that are easy to enjoy right away, but most of the album took a lot of effort to enjoy. That said, it's worth the effort. After owning this album more than half a year it has become one of my favorites, but there were a couple months where I didn't bother listening to it. Now I listen to it start to finish and enjoy every song. It's a solid album, definitely worth owning and it's a breath of fresh air if your appalled by the repetitive pop the radio plays over and over."},{"rating":"2","title":"CD and Concert","review":"Wow! I went to the Pearl Jam concert in London and it was awesome. I have never been so psyched at a concert, it was soo fun. The Cd is also great but everything is always better live. With Eddie Vedder's strong and beautiful voice made him perform perfectly. There is some confusion if they are grunge or not but who cares! They are damn good and thats all the counts :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"big disappointment","review":"I was really looking forward to the release of this album. However, it turned out to be a big disappointment. I bought it this morning and listened to it for two times, and I can only say that I find it extremely boring. No melodies that can carry a tune (and those few melodies that might be able to do so are embarrassingly clichéd), no surprising song structures, no or hardly any remarkable or memorable guitar riffs. In absence of these things, bands quite often turn to 'oddities' like, for example, using technically wrong chords, as in \\"Soon forget\\", etc. Things like that may make a good song more interesting, but they can not turn a dull song into an exciting one. Unfortunately, it seems as if Pearl Jam have run out of ideas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pearl Jam's worst album yet","review":"Now, first off, I'd just like to say that I am a huge fan of Pearl Jam, and think everything they did was brilliant.That is, until Binaural.You see, \\"Binaural\\" tries so hard to be the next \\"Dark Side of The Moon\\", and it falls flat on its face. Pearl Jam were NOT meant to be a psychedelic/acoustic group at all. They are at their best when they're making rock anthems, whether they be straight-forward ones (\\"Ten\\", \\"Vs.\\") or hidden treasures (\\"Vitalogy\\"). THERE IS NOT ONE DECENT ROCK SONG ON THE ALBUM. No matter how hard \\"Grievance\\" and \\"Rival\\" try, neither of them are normal PJ quality.So please Pearl Jam, with your next album (planned to release in November), go back to rock. Your fanbase will mutiply and you'll be the biggest band in the world again."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst album","review":"This is the worst album I've ever bought.

This is Insignificant music, PJ's worst ever effort, thatdoesn't get much better upon further playing. Light Years, Thin Air,Of the Girl, and Sleight of Hand are just OK. Breakherfall, God's Dice, and Evacuation are all knock-off's of Hail, Hail, and poor knock-off's at best. The only good song on this disc is Nothing As It Seems, and you can save your money by buying the single and skipping this horrid excuse for artistic expression.I never thought I'd say this, but I'd rather listen to Britney Spears than this. My disc will be used as a coaster or frisbee. I guess PJ missed again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Pearl Jam","review":"This is a great album. It is an album that takes a while to grow on you though. Not as well done as Ten or Vs., Binaural takes us deeper into the band we all know and love. Each song is kinda slow, but full of quality. If you are reading this wondering if this is worth your money, it is well worth the..., but you have to listen to it a couple times to get the feel of it and realize just how good this collection of songs really is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid #6","review":"Like sone other Pearl Jam releases there are a few songs which take a few listens, but from the opening rokcer through the accustic ballads Thin air and Of the girl this album is very satisfying! Light Years is one of the best in the PJ catalog and then the experimental Parting ways is moving. The one song which dosen't do it for me id Grievance, although a live version I heard did the tune more justice. If you are looking for 10 the return you will be dissapointed, but if have followed the grouos career and appreciate the risk taking, which most modern bands fear to take, then you will be satisfied with this release.pickledjoe"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as good old grunge days","review":"I was a fan ever since Mother Love Bone came out and the next two albums by pearl jam per se (addition of eddie) ARE the ultimate in grunge music. I know eddie hasn't lost his passion and voice but the songs on Binaural just doesn't have the punch as in earlier albums.. except maybe couple of songs. The albums has a great start but fizzles out a little too early just when you are jamming up and are at that high that you are so used to if you like the songs such as 'rearview mirror'....I'm seeing them live in couple of weeks in mountain view and I just hope they play more of their older songs... jeremy spoke in spoke in ~ ~ jeremy spoke in classss todayyy"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow.","review":"Everyone was anticipating a good album but was saying \\"well can it measure up to Ten and No Code\\". I guess their question is answered. Not only does Binaural match any other Pearl JaM production so far, it makes me and some other die hards PJ fans question if it surpasses any other PJ masterpiece. From the vocal showcase \\"Nothing As It Seems\\" to the mind blowing \\"Insignifigance\\" Binaural covers any kind of style a fan of music in general could ask for. Buy this album. Now. You'll be kicking yourself if you dont. later."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst of all Pearl Jam Albums","review":"Pearl Jam is a great and very talented band. The single \\"Nothing As it Seems\\" made me buy this album. The sad part is that this is the most \\"unispired\\" album that this band has gave us so far.There is nothing like \\"Ten\\" or \\"Vs\\" in here. It's mostly slow clean songs with a little heavy or grungy parts. The melodies are very weak and Eddie's voice leaves a lot to wish for.The heavy songs, like the opener, are actually not the Pearl Jam that I love. It's not aggresive an just plainly not good. I would also say that the album is even overproduced.Makes me wish that their next album will be more \\"Pearl Jam Like\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Pearl Jam Will Never Die","review":"I know a lot of people who reviewed this album are saying, \\"It's not vintage Pearl Jam,\\" or, \\"The songs suck because they're slow!!!\\" That's complete and utter BS. Pearl Jam's talent really comes through in this album. Mike McCready's beguiling guitar work will make you gasp in amazement because some of the guitar work is absolutely unbelievable. Eddie Vedder also comes through strongly, offering a top-notch vocal performance. Great all-around effort and it really paid off. Congrats PJ, you've done it again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Years Have Paid Off","review":"Binaural IS, by far the bands best album. It lacks any kind of filler, and every song is very solid. Binaurals key feature is its ability to flow between tracks. Most of their other albums (I own them all) felt like a bunch of songs were just tossed onto a disc. This however, is a REAL album. And stands as a great album, not just a collection of good songs. This new direction is indeed an improvement from their other work. The songs have become more powerful, and more potent. Look back at Ten and you have great technical guitar playing, towering vocals, and pulsing bass lines. They have actually risen above that, and have been able to add more atmosphere and mood to the emotion often displayed on their previous albums. Experience has definitely been benificial for this group of extremely talented musicians. A must buy for any rock fan, even if you're not too big into Pearl Jam."},{"rating":"2","title":"This One Deserves To Be Heard!","review":"Pearl Jam does it again! What a great collection of fantastic tunes. Plenty of single choices, but if your local radio is like ours in Western Maryland, the only PJ song they'll play is \\"Last Kiss.\\" Which is OK, but enough is enough...Gems like \\"Light Years\\" \\"Thin Air\\" \\"Insignificance\\" and \\"Parting Ways\\" should be heard!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Complex and difficult","review":"It's hard to describe this record, except that it every bit sounds the product of hundreds of hours of jam sessions and a commitment to experimenting. Every song is a uneasy ride of unusual melodies, angular riffs, abrupt dynamics, subtle experimentation. One could even call this a sort of punk-jazz record, like a Fugazi or Minutemen. At the least, every song has surprises that suggests influences (Who, Fugazi, MC5, Radiohead?, even trip-hop) but NEVER plays to the rules. This record is probably commercial suicide, but for once Eddie Vedder has a band that challenges him as much as he the band. If none of the rockers really gel and the ballads are uneasy, the album as a whole still is a wild ride. Often thrilling, maddening, but always full of music, making Binaural the most committed Pearl Jam album since Vitalogy."},{"rating":"1","title":"INSIGNIFCANCE","review":"REALY THE WHOLE CD LACKS ENTERGY. SAVE YOUR BUCKS UNLESS YOUR A DIEHARD FOR P.J. MOVE ON TO GREATER THINGS, LIKE RAGE AGAINST THE MACHINE... NOW THAT ROCKS!"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"If you enjoy bands like Creed and Kid Rock and current hard rock/alternative music ignore this review. This is for those who like I, much prefer Phish, Allman Bros., Grateful Dead, etc. Pearl Jam used to be my favorite band...My interest in the band faded after Vitalogy, but I decided to pick up this CD because I am going to see them live this summer. I don't want to sound like a 95 year old woman, but to me it sounds like a bunch of noise with little focus. It is very difficult to distinguish each guitar part. It seems like there is so much distortion and reverb on the songs that they all mesh together to form a mass of noise. The slow songs are certainly not up to the standards of anything off of their first three albums. I wasn't expecting another \\"Ten\\" but didn't expect a 2 star album."},{"rating":"1","title":"All Show","review":"Who the hell am I except someone who spends good hard earned money on CD's. Most times I can live with it but this one really took the cake. If you are a Pearl Jam fan (And I am one) you cannot help but be disappointed by this recording. There is nothing on it that even reminds us why this band was so good to begin with. Those who say that this is an evolution of Pearl Jam and it is a good thing should listen to Jim Morrison and try to see if it reminds them of anything he was recording when he was on drugs. (No disrespect to Mr. Morrison; I'm a fan of the Door's also). People should save their money on this one and look foreward to their next release, I'm sure it has to be better. Sorry guys but on this one you stink."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor effort","review":"I think Pearl Jam's problem is whenever they do an album is the media calls its a classic album, this album is so selfcentered, Im pretty sure Eddie Vedder could sing Mary had a little lamb, and the fans aand the media would call him the next John lennon. The songs on this album are so trite, I have already taken it in to the secondhand store."},{"rating":"1","title":"An OK CD by Pearl Jam","review":"Being a huge Pearl Jam fan I had to buy this new CD Binaural, I figured anything by PJ would be great. I bought the CD and listened to it and I hate to say that I was disapointed. Over the years that Pearl Jam has been around there music has gotten softer and softer, most of the songs on this CD are pratically light listening. I wish PJ could get back to there roots and play the kind of music that they are great at. If you liked old Pearl Jam music a lot and are into that kind of music, chances are you won't like this CD much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same Old Same","review":"I Used to think that Pearl Jam would Come Out&Change their Music especially after Kurt Cobain Dissed them&Especially after Stone Temple Pilot made a Career Emulating them? well I was Wrong.The Lyrics&Music are as Predictable Now as they were 8 years back.Pearl Jam is Very Corperate they are on the same Label as The KING OF POP MICHAEL JACKSON,SADE,Celine Dion,etc... their Music&Image is very Manufactured.They Need too Either Break Up or do something Completely Different they are Long Overdue.Having Listened too many of their Albums I've Never Gotten what the Hype was about."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's so, so...blah?","review":"Big PJ fan. Own and love all their records. Been looking forward to this record as something new, different and interesting. I wasn't looking for another Yield, Vs. or anything else they had put out. After three listens I just don't find it very interesting. Except for a couple of songs the rest is just dull. No particular aspect of the album holds my interest for long. DULL. I am truly sorry to say this, but to this Pearl Jam fan, it IS kind of disapointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT THE SAME OLD PEARL JAM","review":"Binaural is definetely no TEN or VS., It lacks the melodies and tempo that PearlJam became unanimous for in the 90s. Stone Gossard plays few solos, and Eddie Vedder, in my opinion, one of the best singers ever, sings with little emotion, and barely showcases his unbelievable voice, as he has before in songs like Yellow Ledbetter, and Alive. I'm still a huge Pearl Jam fan, but Binaural is somewhat disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"...continued","review":"I haven't heard anyone ever say that Pearl Jam has sold out. Some people think they have? WHOOAA...I never knew that. Pearl Jam has never sold out. Lets put it this way: NO MTV, CONSTANT DIVERSITY, and their best selling album was their first. Excuse me but WHAT THE HELL? .....Oh yeah. Binaural is my fav. PJ album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another excellent album from a great band","review":"Binaural is a continuation of Pearl Jam's musical path. Some may like to say evolution, and while I agree that they get better as a band with each album, Binaural isn't so much evolution, as it is the next logical step. All band members contribute heavily to the writing of songs on Binaural, and to good result; each track is a winner, with none really standing out from the pack. From the rocking gem \\"Grievance\\" to the somber simplicity of \\"Soon Forget,\\" this album is chock full of varied musical excellence that fans have come to expect thanks to such great recent albums as Yield. Binaural is Pearl Jam's most flowing and complete album to date. Let me put it to you this way, if you are the kind of Pearl Jam 'fan' who thinks that Ten is their best offering, then you might not appreciate this album, however, if you are the kind of fan who throws their favor behind albums such as Yield, then you will most likely enjoy this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why this album is great!","review":"this album by pearl jam is just what the music industry needed to give it a good kick in the ass! Binaural begins with a rockin side and ends with a mellowish sonic sound, one of the bands best cd's, this cd can be linked to there other great work on no code. \\"light years\\" and \\"soon forget\\" are two of the many highlights of this album. Other song like \\"thin air\\" and \\"grievance \\" show how much pearl jam have come full circle. Tchad blake has give pearl jam that crisp sound they needed! Once people realize that limp bizkit is not real music , and that pearl just aren't that same band they were ten years ago, you can throughly enjoy this cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Great Track","review":"After reading the reviews I can tell I'm in the minority when I say Binaural's one great track is Sleight of Hand. It's the only reason to own a copy. The rest of the album I processed long ago and hasn't stuck a bit for constantly coming up short. Sleight of Hand is a bruised and haunted masterpiece.As far as the debate over which album is the last one worth picking up, for me it's Binaural and Sleight of Hand is the reason. Pearl Jam are way too spotty in quality to revisit continually. I mean a guy only has so much cash to burn.My feeling is that Sleight of Hand is sooo much better than anything else on this album or any of the 3 or 4 preceeding albums that it doesn't click with the usual fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting","review":"What is very very cool with the later pearl Jam albums is that they have a rough edge to them. What I mean is that todays artists work with their songs till every soundeffect sounds perfect! Binaural is no exeption and I am proud of them!The best track on the album is Light Years, followed by Insignificance, Thin Air and Nothing as it seems which sounds incredible on the DVD! All the songs on the album sound 10 times better live! Check it out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"there always changin'","review":"Pearl Jam should get credit for one thing, they mix there styles of music on every album.....could you honestly listen to six PJ albums that sounded just like \\"Ten\\"? Binaural is a good album and these guys are here to stay for the long haul. Binaural is no Ten or not even a Yield but then again this band is in a position to do whatever they want and play however they want....this album is pretty rad and once again different then anything in the past."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still the best!","review":"There are two breeds of Pearl Jammers. The ones that like TEN and those of us that love PEARL JAM. I, personally think every album has gotten bigger and better. My only regret is that some of the albums are too short. Binaural catches a much more refined and aged Pearl Jam. Congratulations to the best sounding and touring band in the world. If you are unimpressed then buy another copy of TEN and stay in the dark ages. Great talent has to expand and for that I commend them with all my heart. Please keep up the great work...you are the best! Thanx for the ride."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Addition to the Pearl Jam Library","review":"I've been a loyal Pearl Jam fan since day one, and I have yet to be dissapointed by any of their releases. But they have a lot to live up to and, as much as I hate to say it, this is my least favorite PJ album to date. I'd still recommend it, but it's definately got a narrow range by Pearl Jam standards. The tempo is largely quasi-slow with no real Porch or Sonic Reducer-ish fast songs.Now don't get me wrong- I still thoroughly enjoyed this CD and I recommend it. Many of the tracks like 'Nothing is as it Seems' and 'Grievence' are very solid. But, if you had no other Pearl Jam CD's and you could only afford one, I'd recommend Vitalogy or Yield."},{"rating":"2","title":"WHERE'S BRENDON O BRIEN","review":"I WAS A LITTLE SCARED WHEN I FOUND OUT TCHAD BLAKE WAS PRODUCING. I OWN TWO LOSLOBOS RECORDS HE PRODUCED AND ALWAYS THOUGHT HIS BINAURAL(SETTING UP MICROPHOPNES WHERE EARS WOULD BE) WAY OF RECORDING WAS MUFFLED.mAYBE PJ REALIZED THIS AND THATS WHY BRENDON O BRIEN REMIXED SOME OF THE SONGS. ANY WAY MY WORST FEARS WERE CONFIRMED WHEN I BOUGHT THE SINGLE, AND WHILE ALL SONGS DO NOT SOUND LIKE THERE WERE BEING RECORDED THROUGH COTTON BALLS, ENOUGH ARE BOTCHED TO MAKE ME LONG FOR THE CLARITY OF OBRIEN'S PRODUCTION. IS IT ME OR ARE SOME OF EDDIE'S VOCALS HARD TO UNDERSTAND LIKE EARLY REM. MAYBE THEY SHOULD HAVE TRIED SCOTT LITT OR STEVE ALBINI IF THEY WANTED TO CHANGE UP A LIITLE. I DONT KNOW MAYBE I SHOULD LISTEN TO IT WITH EAR PHONES A FEW TIMES.

It has great songs throughout the album. It start real great with Break her fall, God's Dice and it doesnt stop with the great songs in the album. I like it the first time i heard the album, so if anyone likes good music then you will like this album because Pearl Jam put 13 great songs again"},{"rating":"2","title":"Clearly Change is Good","review":"I believe this to be the best album of the year. It was not nearly my favorite when I first bought it, but after giving it chances, it is. I am always open to new music, and Pearl Jam is always there giving it to me. I DO NOT want another Ten or V.S. The new CD shows a gracefulness about it, that only age can create. Among many other famous tracks, everyone on the new album is good. Binaural includes great guitar and bass. They have background vocals, a new fairly element with Pearl Jam-- and the only songs that lack a bit are the last three, Sleight of Hand, Soon Forget, and Parting Ways. Still a good ride and a new drummer. Good job Matt!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't listen to the negative people: Pearl Jam is the best.","review":"Don't listen to negative reviews of this album, if any. This album is almost better than Yield, and most certainly gives me that good feeling that Vitalogy did when I first heard it. The first song \\"Breakerfall\\" sets you up for whats to come, then the fast paced \\"God's Dice\\". Other very notable, great songs are \\"Insignificance\\" and \\"Grievance\\".After all the years Pearl Jam has gone through, and all the drummers they've had, they've aged like a fine wine. They still rule. Great job on the new album guys."},{"rating":"2","title":"as good as any pearl jam album(all can be rated 5 staars)","review":"one of the most beautifully made albums ever.if true credit is to be given to the album then it should be at billboard no.1 spot should sell over 15 million copies and should be in each and every one's house all over the world.every song is good from the blistering breakerfall to my favourite light years and rival.for me light years seems like the other\\"alive\\".all other tracks superb."},{"rating":"2","title":"One word to describe this CD \\"SASSY\\"","review":"As I said above only one word can describe this CD and that word is \\"SASSY\\".

Give it a listen and I'm sure you'll agree with me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Binaural - More than an earful","review":"Fasten your seat belts, you're in for a ride on this one. This is one of their best albums since the sorely overlooked \\"Vs\\". The sound is raw, powerful, but well performed. There are moments when you wish Eddide Vedder would ennunciate better, but it does blend in well with the songs. \\"Breakerfall\\" is a knockout song, and \\"Thin Air\\" is one of the best songs I think they've done in years. This is one intense album."},{"rating":"2","title":"buy this cd!","review":"the new pearl jam is well worth it. anyone who says these guys are over are crazy. track five alone is worth the money. my favorite by far is \\"sleight of hand\\" with the odd 5/4 time signature in the verse. that had to be new drummer Matt Cameron of Soundgarden's idea. if the last album \\"Yield\\" let you down, dont worry, binaural wont. (i liked yield). buy this cd!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Binaural","review":"Pearl Jam's sixth studio album is essentially a continuation of where they left off with \\"Yield.\\" Its got raw rockers (e.g. \\"grievance\\") lilting ballads (\\"sleight of hand\\") and even typical P.J. oddball songs like the solo-Vedder \\"Soon Forget.\\" The first half is more polished than P.J.'s usual raw sound, but the second half is usual \\"difficult-to-digest-at-first\\" Pearl Jam. The album is not GREAT enough to warrant five stars. However, unlike past Pearl Jam albums, it has no major flaws (e.g. \\"bugs\\" on Vitalogy). Definitely a strong album which would be enjoyed by fans and non-fans alike."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not A Ten","review":"Pearl Jam is a great band but this album fails to show this.

When i first listened to this cd, i thought,\\"this is great!.\\" This cd is powered by \\"insignificance\\" (top 3 best ever by pj) and \\"nothing as it seems\\" (great slow song). But the good songs do not stop there, there are the soft/hard ballads \\"thin air\\", and \\"light years\\" which are wonderful. Starting off the cd is \\"breakerfall\\", which is pretty heavy and rocking. \\"breakerfall\\" is close to the same heaviness as number 3 \\"evacuation.\\" (just as great).

Binaural is 13 songs that are nothing more than variations of the lollipop hit \\"Last Kiss\\". Where are Eddie's electric vocals that were a beacon for listeners on tracks such as \\"Alive\\", \\"Jeremy\\" and \\"Rearviewmirror\\".

They haven't ever failed.....until now. Listening to this album made me think the band needed to take 4-5 years off, not do side projects, and use their best ideas for the next record. I was so depressed that I pulled out all my PJ cds(b-sides too) and started ranking songs. I got to 30 something before I could even think about putting something from Binaural on the list. There are some solid songs but nothing that jumps out at you. Experimental(meaning atypical of the PJ sound) songs that have worked really well in the past(Spin the Black Circle, Do the Evolution come to mind) fail miserably here(Evacuation, Grievance). Overall this album is a huge disappointment when judged against their former body of work. Don't know how someone could give this album five stars. Seems extremely optimistic and forgiving at best. Patently stupid at the worst."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not Pearl Jam's finest moments!","review":"This is not one of Pearl Jam's better albums.

I just can't believe that this is the same band that has just made the 5 best rock albums of the decade (Ten, Vs., Vitalogy, No Code, Yield)...it shocks me how fast a band really can go down hill. Their is not even one notable good song on this album...it's all easily forgettable. Their last two albums (No Code, Yield) were Pearl Jam's best yet, and then they make this.

It's not that I long (like many do) for another Ten. I like the way they 're changing and I think Light Years and Given To Fly are top songs. But Ten had 11 great songs while Binaural has 6 and Yield had some 5. I don't know where the problem is.

You never know with Santana so I was eagerly awaiting what the master himself was conjuring for a new album. \\"All That I Am\\" came and, as an old Santana fan for over 30 years, I went ahead, without reading the reviews, and bought it. The album pleasurably starts with a a-la-Santeria song. Nothing better to commence an album moyubando the Orishas. But then, it goes downhill with pop-rock radio music. Why does it have to be that way? I still have hopes that Santana will surprise all of us with his next album. He needs to do it so he can reconnect with his musical roots."},{"rating":"1","title":"Retread","review":"It's copy protected so it cannot be ripped onto my IPOD in superior sound quality. On top of that, the sound is poor - poorly recorded.It's the record company formula and the artist seems to be buying into it (along with the copy protection).

I'm returning it as well tomorrow."},{"rating":"1","title":"CD COPY PROTECTION SUCKS BIG TIME!!","review":"I just got this CD and nowhere are you pre-warned about the COPY PROTECTION all over this CD. Who cares about the music at this point. IPOD is not a destination, MP3 ripping is inhibited. You may get it ripped but the output file will sound like trash.

Supernatural was really good. Shamam was OK, but trending down. Now 'pop' goes Santana. What a horrible bunch of rubbish. The songs with his band are OK, but nothing really new. The duet with Stephen Tyler is the most restrained I've ever heard him. The instrumental with Robert Randolph and Kirk Hammet is good, but way too short and it fades out at the end! Los Lonely Boys add something, which saves it from one star. But all this bubblegum, teenybopper pop er' K-rap can go. Don't buy it.

Preventing people who purchase this album from making legal backups or copies for their own personal use on MP3 players is a completely unacceptable practice, and should be stopped.Furthermore, the software installed by this CD cloaks its presence on your computer, disguises itself as something else in case the average user stumbles onto references to it, and has the potential to damage computers if not removed properly (which isn't as easy as going to Add/Remove programs, as it is not listed there).For more information on this new, malicious form of copy-protection, I suggest googling \\"sony+DRM+rootkit\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"pure crap","review":"santana himself hate the music he's making,he loves jazz fusion and real rock not this rubbish,but he has sold his soul for money.you are not listening to santana here (like supernatural and shaman) but you are listening to inputs record company made for him."},{"rating":"2","title":"To Those Who Are Complaining","review":"To all who are \\"dissing\\" the new CD - instead of being shallow dilettantes and dissecting the lyrics,guest artists, music, copy protection,etc - how about just feeling the joyful sound that comes from Carlos's fingers as he graciously shares his gift and his innate joy.

Santana has, over the course of years, turned itself from a highly progressive and original band, to a solo guitarist who changes the line-up of the band way too often. Is there a Santana band anymore? Last time I checked, Carlos is the only one that comes out in commercials, liner notes, ads, photos, etc. This album is the third, and hopefully the last, in a series of Carlos Santana's collaborations with other artists. Only four, (FOUR!) songs out of the whole album is Santana by itself. The rest is Carlos Santana playing with other groups. The only good song (which is actually a mediocre song at best) is the first one, Hermes.Santana has often had albums in 3's. Their first 3, then the 3 jazz fusion albums, then the 3 \\"Back to Basics\\" albums (Amigos, Festival, and Moonflower). Hopefully, All That I Am is the end of a trilogy of commercial sell-out albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"Santana ... Always a Good Thing","review":"Love Santana, love the album.

Carlos, what were you thinking?\\"All that I am\\" is messy, with few periods of great guitar work and a wonderful percussion section way under utilized, which has always been the basis of great Santana music in the past.Performances by guest vocalists are mediocre at best.Carlos, you owe it to your loyal fans to create an album with just you and your band of great musicians.

A big part of his success after being off the radar for years (besides his undeniable talent)was the addition of both songwriting and appearances from many current artists, assuredly a plot hatched by many music execs and focus groups. Unfortunately, they seem to be running that formula into the ground. Two post-Grammy xerox albums later, and I may have finally given up on Carlos for a while. Part of the big problem on this release is the attempt to combine Santana's singular Latin-influenced style with an overabundance of R&B and hip-hop, which just comes across sounding contrived. Your money would be much more well-spent on the recently remastered release of Santana III, which is not only excellent but comes with a bonus disc of live material that smokes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great album but ..","review":"I own almost every album of Santana, a life long fan.

DO NOT BUY IT.Amazon - be brave - refuse to stock these protected albums - it's the only way Sony will learn!My advice - buy the album from iTunes.

I agree with a previous reviewer; please write Arista (and Santana) about this."},{"rating":"1","title":"And the music industry can't figure why sales are down","review":"I totally agree with all the negative comments about this release.Quite annoyed that it cannot be played on my P.C. or portable cd player.My copy will end up at the used cd store."},{"rating":"1","title":"Far from home","review":"It appears that Carlos Santana's latest outing was created to appeal to the widest audience possible.But now that Santana is an established household name, perhaps he can consider returning to the kind of music that made him so critically acclaimed and accepted.To my mind, Santana's greatest moments were during the Caravanserai-Welcome-Borboletta chapter. It was, indeed, a ground-breaking period in his career. A time when, musically, enlightenment and understatement meant something.Carlos Santana is best when he is experimenting. And he has created a temple of followers that have hung with him over the years. But, with All That I Am, I am lost. And, as a fan, I am truly far from home."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute Trash","review":"Supernatural - Supernatural powers force the beginning of the end of Santana. \\"All that I am\\" is the death of \\"this once upon a time great\\"! He needs Michelle Branch and co. to sell albums. Sony is showing its defensive strategies in the wake of digital technologies. The title \\"All that I am\\" is as defensive as it can get suggesting that Carlos Santana can only make this kind of music at this age! The only decent track in this album is Trinity. All others - I'm extremely sorry folks - dont regret spending any amount of money on this later. If you are an old santana fan, forget this one. New folks - check out the Ghost of Santana - you may want to hear the Late Santana after hearing to this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I LOVE Santana but this CD is not his best. The past two, Shaman and Supernatural, were so good I just about wore them out. This one will be dusty before it gets played again. Santana needs to get back to the scathing guitar riffs. There are some bright moments. The cuts with Michelle Branch and Joss Stone are good. But sadly this CD is way too much rap/hip-hop and merengue. Somewhere along the journey we lost Carlos Santana. Here's hoping the next CD is the real deal. I won't even get into the CD Protection. I'm just glad I found out before I tried to burn an extra copy for the car and screwed up my comnputer."},{"rating":"1","title":"right...","review":"was gonna buy it. then i found out about the root kit.

There's just not enough Santana in \\"All that I am\\". Instead, I went back to my own all time favorite \\"LOTUS\\". It's sad to see so much potential going to waste. It's discouraging to know that the quality of his music is decreasing. I just hope that next time he decides to come up with an album it shows more of what he truly is; A GREAT MUSICIAN, and not a back up guitar player as he seems in this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forget about the root kit and focus on the music -- which is only okay","review":"Santana is like an old oak tree -- some years there's an abundance of acorns, and other years there's a scarcity. This is a lean season, as the music seems more like muzak at times. I don't fault his effort, but the outcomes are not what his hard core fans look for. But like the mighty oak, Santana endures, and there no doubt will be other, more plentiful seasons ahead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Here we go again.","review":"Well, I've had a listen, and its all the same stuff, all over again.Does he not do anything new? Does he not have enough in him to be self supporting? Does he have to rely on bringing other poeple in?We've done this, been there, ready to move on!!! So move on!!! Give me something new to listen to Mr Santana. Please.The CD? Not that good. Expand your horizons. Change your guitar sound. Bring in fresh sound, not this old rehashed stuff with just new voices."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Tired Format","review":"If I wanted to hear all these guest stars, I'd buy their stuff.

This adds nothing."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Formula Has Worn Out","review":"How many times can you endure one of the guest rappers shouting out Carlos Santana is in the room or in the house? More appropriately I think Carlos has left the building when it comes to this recording.All That I Am repeats too much of the formula with Supernatural and Shaman. Supernatural was a classic recording as it adeptly merged Santana's afro-cuban rock roots with the modern touches of several hip hop artists. More importantly most of those songs had well defined hooks. Shaman duplicated some of the efforts from Supernatural but at least broke some new ground with songs like Sideways and the number with Julio Iglesias.All That I Am adds no new flavorings. The songs are mostly forgettable. I Am Somebody has a nice beat and Just Feel Better is fairly memorable. Hermes has a pretty good keyboard passage and Twisted and Brown Skin Girl have their moments too. However, after that the magic started with Supernatural seems to have disappeared. Pass on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"I couldn't finish this book.

It has dirty lyrics. And don't let the radio people fool you into thinking that there are no swear words in \\"Absolutely (Story of a Girl),\\" because they just change some of the wording. I'm here to warn you to think about what you're buying! Same thing for the video. I really liked this band...until I read their lyrics. I liked \\"So Far Away\\" and \\"Revolve,\\" but all the rest of the songs were either okay, nothing I really thought of as very special, or something I just HATED. Out of all the people who have reviewed this cd so far, I've only agreed with 3 of them, and I've also partially agreed with 3 others. The lowest rating you can give a cd here is 1 star.

I'm sorry but I would rather listen to Mandy Moore than go through the torture I went through listening to this cd. I think I will give this cd away to my worst enemy to avenge myself. The lyrics sounded as if they were written by a bunch of 2 year olds. I'm sorry but how could a girl cry a river? Wouldn't the tears stop coming after about nine days?

I would recomend this cd to anybody! it's worth every cent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sound from a new band","review":"Nine Days presents a refreshing sound to the often drab pop genre. The song \\"Absolutely (Story of a Girl)\\" was what attracted me to this CD. The song has a good beat, as does the rest of the album. I hope Nine Days releases lots more of the great songs on this CD as singles. A definate plus to the Madding Crowd is that it is explicit lyric free, and has a good messege."},{"rating":"2","title":"better than you might think","review":"Okay, I'll admit straight off that this is my \\"guilty pleasure\\" CD; I don't usually go for Top 40 groups. However, I was able to get past the extreme popularity of \\"Absolutely\\", because this CD, while not startling original in any way, is a cheerful, aurally pleasing piece of work. Don't look to Nine Days for intellectual lyrics or anything, but realize that every song on this album is really catchy, musically well-written, and fun to listen to when you're in the mood for something light. I think that these guys still have a long way to go in terms of being legendary, creative musicians (for instance, ditching the boy-band-esque pictures plastered all over the CD might be a good idea), but they've managed to produce a really nice collection here."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Stunning Debut","review":"As soon as I heard \\"Absolutely (the story of a girl)\\" I was hooked, but I was curious as to how the album could be. I heard a few of my friends mark it off as a great CD, but I wasn't sure that I wanted to spend all that money on a gamble. Luckily for me, I won the CD and had my chance to listen to it. I was amazed that the whole CD seemed to keep churning out the hits with ones such as my favorite song \\"So Far Away\\" and \\"Sometimes\\". Check out The Madding Crowd if you like bands such as:(if you haven't heard these bands, you may like them)Dexter Freebish, Vertical Horizon, Everclear and Neve. Great album to add to your collection......no regrets over at my house. Goodluck shopping/browsing everyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not too shabby","review":"OK, to start things off, how can people compare this to Blink 182? Blink 182 is PUNK, this is pop/alternative. They sound NOTHING like Blink 182, unless you are a teenie bopper who has only heard two songs by Blink... then it might sound similar... Listen to Blink's older stuff and tell me that sounds like Nine Days... That said, this band resembles more of Vertical Horizon, 3 Doors Down's more mellow side, matchbox twenty, Third Eye Blind, and poppish bands like that. The lead singer has a higher pitched voice, which can get frustrating at times, but overall, a very nice debut by these guys. Don't just buy it for \\"Story of a Girl\\", either... You'll be severely disappointed, trust me. Also buy Vertical Horizon, their CD is amazing... and also don't buy that just for \\"Everything You Want\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"As one reviewer said..\\"quirky wordplay.\\" and \\"infectious hooks.\\"Many of the melodies are easy to latch on to.

It's a shame, too. \\"Story of a Girl\\" was possibly one of the best singles of last year. Better luck next time, boys."},{"rating":"1","title":"maybe my bs detector is on too high...","review":"Too many positive reviews here make their point by saying \\"Well, at least it ain't no teeny pop or rap metal\\". That doesn't mean it's any good. The fact is, this is as a half-baked work with more in common with teen pop than \\"straight ahead rock\\". I hear the \\"sincerity\\",but i absolutley don't buy it. Same... you could get from ThirdMatchboxEve6Blind or whatever, just not as well-played or nearly as interesting. This shlock tries way too hard to be liked and ends up sounding third-rate, rather than something all it's own. Same old chords, same insipid lyrics, hooks all over the place saying \\"like me! like me!\\". It's background music for people who don't want to listen too closely.

I hope they keep up this style of music and do so much more!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite possibly the best album of the last ten years.","review":"The first time I listened to The Madding Crowd, I was instantly blown away! From the crunching guitars and harmonies of the opening track, \\"So Far Away\\" to the haunting guitar and vocal melodies of \\"If I Am\\" and \\"Sometimes\\" to the forlorn and desperate final track, \\"Wanna Be\\", The Madding Crowd plays like a classic two-sided LP. Not since the days of the Beatles have such incredible musicianship and talent been so skillfully intertwined with the profound lyrics of The Madding Crowd. I sincerely believe that \\"Hampson/Desveaux\\" will become as recognizable as \\"Lennon/McCartney\\" in coming years.

CD...EVER","review":"Clearly, Rod Stewart is one of rock's best vocalists. Unfortunately, you'd never know it from listening to this CD of pure drivel and sap. This is one of those excruciating projects where everything went wrong. The bad choice of material (not necessarily bad songs at all, just bad songs for Rod to sing), lackadaisical production, and indifferent vocals from Rod all add up to one of the worst listening experiences you'll ever endure if you decide you have to have it. The only positive purpose this CD could serve is as an interrogation tool, but it would probably violate the Geneva Convention rules against torture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Okay","review":"A couple of songs were definitely made for Rod Stewart, but was disappointed in a couple of the songs. Even if you are a huge Rod Stewart fan, you may get disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"He should get clear of Clive Davis!!!","review":"Rod Stewart is in a crisis. He needs an idea independent of his record label owner, Clive Davis, who is so old now, he doesn't leave fingerprints, and his ideas DO NOT FIT a talent like Rod. This album has \\"I'm all washed up, so I might as well cash in\\" written all over it. Four (count 'em, FOUR) volumes of the Great American Songbook (which was hard to take), then THIS??? This album flat out stinks. There is not a moment on this record that sounds like Rod has any grasp of these songs except \\"It'll make money\\". Stick to the originals. Rod, I may buy another of your records if you make one the old fashioned way. Write a bunch of good songs, sing them with conviction (the way you used to), and tell Clive to take a flying leap at the moon. You've made them enough money, now do it YOUR WAY!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Better to get a root canal","review":"First off, I like Rod Stewart. But this piece of dreck SHOULD be called \\"The tape is full, when do I get paid?\\". It's fun sometimes to hear a performer at a concert jump into an inspired cover. This is neither inspired, nor at a concert. It's a whole CD of, \\"well I need some money and I am too lazy to even add something to a cover song, let alone actually come up with something new.\\" Bad enough it's all covers, his performance is lifeless, lethargic, and apathetic. Certainly, if I wanted to hear any of these songs, I would reach for the original first. This collection is unnecessary."},{"rating":"1","title":"more drivel","review":"I didn't think Rod could stoop lower to make a buck than his mangling of the Great American Songbook, but guess what? He did! He should perform these songs on kareoke night at a local bar. I realize he looks at his bank account and could care less but his credability account is empty. What's next? Will Rod join The Wiggles or release \\"Barnery's Best\\" to tap into the kids market. How about a duet with Hannah Montana? I will now listen to my classic Rod CD's and cry."},{"rating":"2","title":"TAKE MY WORD FOR IT","review":"THIS IS A GREAT SELECTION OF SONGS THAT ROD SINGS TO PERFECTION. THIS COLLECTION DOES NOT HAVE A LOUD MUSIC SCORE THAT DROWNS OUT ROD'S WONDERFUL SINGING. HE IS SUCH A VERSATILE SINGER AND I AM THRILLED THAT HE IS GOING IN A DIFFERENT DIRECTION BY SINGING HIS SAME SOULFUL, SEXY STYLE ONLY WITH A GENTLER SOUND."},{"rating":"1","title":"still the same","review":"2 disc, whats on the second disc.No listing of songs!Bought one before an only came with one disc,'Spirit of the 60's'Sign'd Not Again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Read through all these reviews. Mine? Still the Same.I looked forward to the release of this CD.I love the tunes, Rod has great pipes. Curious where they were when this was recorded.The music is flat, and unimaginative, a sad butchering of some classic rock.Love Hurts is pure pain to hear.The whole thing has that lounge lizard feel.What a waste.As an aside to whoever mixed this; All those little switches, toggles and knobby things on that great huge board in front of you are meant to be adjusted throughout each and every song to enhance listening. Unless having Rod Stewart appear to absent mindedly hum through these songs was your goal. In which case I apologize."},{"rating":"1","title":"How much money do you need?","review":"There is just no reason to make this album. Boring versions of great songs. A whopping 13 tracks!

I feel Rod's voice is as strong as ever and absolutely loved this CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rod Rocks Again","review":"After remarkable successes batting out American Standards, Rodney is back to doing what he does even better, ROCK AND ROLL. OK so this album is not Chuck Berry, but Rod's uncanny knack for picking the best songs to cover with talented muscians and arrangements has led to an instant hit. The songs covered are recognizable immediately and Rod's delivery is perfect on song after song. If not for you, Missing you, Still the same all evoke pleasant memories and revitalize songs that may have slipped out of our memories or give life to them for a new generation of listeners.Bravo Rod I can't wait to see these standards mixed in with the old rockers at your next live concert."},{"rating":"1","title":"A PERSONAL NOTE TO CLIVE DAVIS & ARNOLD STIEFEL","review":"NOTE TO CLIVE and ARNIE: Think about the legacy. Think about songs like Maggie May, Every Picture Tells A Store, Scared and Scarred, The Wild Horse, Lost in You, Go Out Dancing, I Was Only Joking, The Killing of Georgie, Mandolin Wind, Italian Girls, Is That the THanks I Get?, Rebel Heart, You're in My Heart, Lady Luck, Every Beat of My Heart, A Night Like This, Stone Cold Sober, Young Turks, Moment of Glory, Dynamite, etc, etc.,,,,You are not doing the public a favor--you are robbing us of one of Rock's best songwriters. You and Rod have enough money. Think quality. Please. I am begging.......Rod doing so-so version of so-so songs is boring and so beneath his talent. This album is well beneath the talent of one Roderick Stewart. GIVE US OUR ROCK STAR BACK!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Music - Great CD","review":"This is a great collections of songs with Rod Stewart covering with renditions worthy of the sound of the original hits."},{"rating":"2","title":"I have always Thought Rod Is One Of The Great Rockers!","review":"I have 11 CD's of Rod Stewart and this CD adds to his collection! His unique voice and style are great! Well worth the purchase!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rod is an entertainer now...","review":"...not a musician. What I see in the negative reviews is a desire for Rod the Musician to return to old form. What I detect in the positive reviews is an enjoyment of Rod as an entertainer. Some people value musical chops and creativity- others simply want to be nostalgic and entertained. Rod converted long ago from musician to Vegas entertainer.If you want a taste of some old rockers who remain creative musicians, sample Robert Plant's or Neil Young's latest. Don't waste your time on Rod or this kitsch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry Rod","review":"I have been a Rod Stewart fan for 30 years now but I am sorry to say this is worst piece of drival that he has ever released. Dreadfull covers of \\"Rock Classics\\" that quite honestly were not even very good when done by the original artist in most cases. Rod adds zero to them and it sounds like he is singing to a Karoke backing track.This is the kind of stuff you expect to be advertised on TV. It is simply awfull and an emberessment that one of the great rock singers of our time has fallen so low as to have to put this out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Somewhere Between Fair to Blah","review":"Gosh darn, I was really looking forward to this CD, glad to see that the singer was getting back to roots & away from the total blah of the previous Frank Sinatra style disaster. However, I should have inspected the traks more carefully before ordering this CD. Anyway, I listened to it once & probably won't again. It's not a total waste, but geeze it's dull."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHY THIS?????? NOT AGAIN !!","review":"Come on Rod, bow out gracefully buy another cricket team or something just quit making embarassing albums like this. This and the awful dribble of the four, yes four volumes of the 'Not So Great American Songbooks' are a pale reflection of rocks most powerful and distinctive voice. Sure this has it's merit to little old ladies in antique malls who loved him 35 years ago but couldn't stomach Tony Bennett, so Rod became their Tony Bennett!!! Boy these record companies know how to market now don't they! Don't let them take you for a sucker, grab some classic Rod and spend your ears with it, not this."},{"rating":"2","title":"ROD STILL RULES!","review":"I don't care what song he chooses, Rod can add his special blend of voice, talent, and passion....and I can listen to him forever!Thanks Rod for making yet one more great project I can add to my collection! I wish I had 6 stars to give you on this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and Disgusting!","review":"Boring CD and doesn't derserve your money.

This CD is TERRIBLE..."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO MORE STORIES TO TELL, ROD!","review":"Rod Stewart USED TO BE one of the greatest Rock singers. HE'S NO MORE!!! What's the purpose of issuing this album with such a bunch of BAD covers of Rock classics, which are so good and so brilliant in their original versions? Sorry Mr. Stewart... If this \\"Still The Same...\\" is what you're planning to do in the future as a singer... You're almost out of the Music business! Period!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Passion is Gone","review":"Oh, Rod, Rod, whatever happened to that throaty, rockin' passion you used to lavish on much of your music? Hey, babe, I'm older'n you, but I've still got it! The problem with this CD is that some sound engineer or orchestrator set the metronome at this slow, drousy tempo -- and left the darn thing on the same speed for the entire CD! You're a musician -- didn't you notice? In ancient times I think they called it \\"Gregorian Chant.\\" I bought this CD because some of my favorite old songs were on it en masse, so I thought, wow, that's cool, but you sing them like they were all Fifties ballads. I can understand why \\"I'll Stand By You\\" is a dirge, but why in heck would you not stomp the floor with \\"Still the Same\\" and \\"It's a Heartache\\"? I gave you two stars, one for the memories and one for the pity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rod moves up several music generations","review":"Fresh from his 4 American Songbook series, he returns with what is the beginning of another series??? In this case, we hope not. Everyone has their own interpretation of what a classic tune is but in this case (at least as far as I'm concerned) few of these qualify. On the upside, he kicks off with 'Have You Ever Seen The Rain'(A CCR Song) which suits his gravelly voice as does 'It's A Heartbreak'(A Bonnie Tyler origional). He does a reasonable job on the Cat Steven's 'Father & Son'. As for the rest, some of these 'classics' I've never heard before. Maybe he should have stuck with American Songbook tunes."},{"rating":"1","title":"kidnapping/identity theft reported","review":"rod stewart--singer/songwriter of many great songs as a member of the faces and as a solo artist--has been kidnapped and a sellout stand in is using his name for profit. don't be fooled. the real rod stewart wouldn't continue to release this cheese.buy the faces, every picture or never a dull moment. you'll find many a dull moment with this tripe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Give the guy his props!","review":"These reviewers are way off-base......if you are people who only like Rod's rock albums, then don't even bother reviewing this one because you can't be objective......I find this album to be a joy in reminding me why those songs were such big hits in their time! He picked a nice range of tracks and he delivers all very well and stays true to the originals while still adding his own spin! I do hope that after this release, he does need an album of all new material and no more cover albums.....that is my only gripe!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't get such bitterness","review":"Yeah...the Rod is in his comfort zone, he's living easy, singing easy, making money...still the same voice, still the same natural!"},{"rating":"1","title":"STILL THE LAME","review":"i'm glad i borrowed this before spending my money. i thought this was going to be like the MTV unplugged cd. nope! just one example: \\"have you ever seen the rain\\". fogerty & ccr's version is brilliant. rod bit off more than he can chew. what's up with his pronounciations of some of the lyrics of this song? sounds like he's had a stroke.last night i saw the faces on vh1 classics and between then and now something horrible has gone wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"why roddy? why?","review":"'........!?' my exact exclaimation when i saw that rod stewart was doing an new album of covers. heck roddy,all those tunes were done when YOU had hits...big hits man!why bother rod? did clive davis eke you to do this?rod my friend what about you own albums - arent you not remastering the rest of them?what about 'foolish behaviour', 'out of control', 'infatuation' and you best 'greatest hit comp. the one with the pink outfit?i guarantee you will sell more units that this sorry state of a rehash 'karaoke' disc..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rod the Mod","review":"I've always thought he was interesting and loved a few of his hits: Maggie May, You're in my heart, etc and then I saw his story on Biography channel and now I'm swooned.

However, re-doing these \\"classics\\" just doesn't gel with me. For some reason, they all sound alike with hardly any variation. If I had to pick one good track, it would have to be \\"If Not For You\\", originally done by George Harrison (speaking of which, check out Olivia Newton John's remake of this song-much better than Rod's). Perhaps Rod should have tried some original rock tunes instead (but then they wouldn't be classics, now right?). I love all of these songs performed by the original artists. I think Rod could have done these songs justice...he has a great voice to pull it off, but the arrangements are stale in my opinion. I almost pre-purchased the CD, but glad I waited until after hearing the samples. I will not be buying this one...sorry!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Uh...\\"Wake up, Roderick, I think we got something to say to you...\\"","review":"So Rod Stewart is \\"returning to rock,\\" eh? That, ah, \\"selection\\" he picked out to \\"perform\\" is only marginally above \\"acts\\" like \\"The Little River Band,\\" \\"The Starland Vocal Band,\\" or Leo Sayer. Guess those mighty vocal cords just gave up while he was pimping himself out, \\"doing\\" slimy \\"rat pack\\" material. But, hey...he's past 60, now, I guess we can't expect him to really Rock and Roll anymore..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is something the matter with his voice ?","review":"This cd is just a mess. This is money making corporate rock at it's worst. A real take the money and run phone in job. Sadly Rod has become a real sell-out. Making it worse is his voice. He should have it looked at by a throat specialist and I am not kidding. Will my fellow reviewers PLEASE avoid adding career statistics to their posts and review the cd at hand. Review THIS cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rod is still the same.","review":"I love Rod, I always have. I enjoy the Songbook series, and I like this album. I'm not certain about the song choices; once upon a time, there was a radio station category called \\"easy listening,\\" and I think that's where these songs would fit. Nevertheless, I grew up with these songs, and I think Rod does a great job. Rod puts a little soul into everything he sings, and this album is no different -- Rod singing \\"Father and Son\\" is classic, and I like his version of \\"Day After Day.\\" If you like Rod's voice, you'll like this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"OH MY GOD THIS IS S-O B-A-D","review":"I had high hopes for this disc - after the American Songbook debacles, which gave Rod the chance to sing songs he had no business singing to talk show audiences around the coutnry, I thought GREAT! The scottish rooster is going to get down by singing rock classics of OUR TIME! COOL! Just look at the titles - If Not For You, off of All Things Must Pass is 36 frickin' years old!!! These are old songs, sung by an old guy, for an old audience. They sound old. Rod sounds old. This is an act of marketing desperation. What comes next? Rod Stewart sings the Rogers & Hammerstein songbook??? Don't buy this disc - buy the Rhino Faces box set instead and hear 70s music sung by Rod at his peak. 'xcuse me while I kiss my metamusil."},{"rating":"1","title":"Music For Shopping Malls","review":"The production on this is flat making every song sound the same,get the original songs and make a compilation it will be far superior.P.S my mother inlaw likes it so that about says it all really,muisc for older mums."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rod still has IT","review":"Rod still has it. He sounds good as ever. This is the kind of stuff he does best. Welcome back. Nice cover."},{"rating":"1","title":"More bilge from another over-rated rocker!","review":"One can only wonder how someone with so little talent could sell so many records for so many years! First of all, the title itself is ludicrous, given that \\"Rock Classic\\" itself is practically an oxymoron. If listening to a craggy voice singing mediocre tunes is anyone's idea of a good time, then this is a top competitor, given thousands of other such drek out there! Like many other aging rockers,this performer has made a feeble attempt to sing the real \\"American Classics\\" Songbooks, but that was even worse! However, 2 Stars for still recording, and for lassoing all those fans out there to line his pocket, and the pockets of everyone involved in this drivel! That is a major achievement!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Return? I think not.","review":"When I heard Rod was returning to Rock I was anxious to hear his new material. First off this isn't new and for the most part it isn't even rock. The album is full of tired old remakes that barely showcase the wonderful voice Rod has. He is capable of so much more. The songs are mostly ballads and love songs. To title this cd \\"classic rock songs\\" is wrong and very misleading. If you need a shot of good classic rock get the new Bob Seger cd \\"Face The Promise\\". It's a much more worthy purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doo doo caca please retire now Rod.","review":"Ok, he's done some good covers in the past, but he's phoning it in from the side of the pool this time to add to his retirement nest egg. It's not too late to start over Rod and do something else if you're not busy counting your retirement fund money. I hope this isn't another series of albums. Maybe a nice Lawrece Welk themed CD would work better. Blecch."},{"rating":"1","title":"A truly awful album","review":"So sad that a once great artist has sunk to recording Karaoke albums with a band that sounds like it was picked up Republican fund-raiser barbecue. I was once a huge Rod fan (unfortunately pre-Atlantic Crossing). I know he can do better - if you want to hear the evidence go listen to Sweet Little Rock and Roller off of \\"Smiler\\". Rod here is what you do - get on a plane, come back to England bring along Rick Rubin and get Ron Wood out of rehab, lock yourself away for a year and produce something to regain your reputation and respect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rod Stewart- Still the Same","review":"I'm glad I disregarded the negative reviews and bought the CD. It is classic Rod Stewart singing classic rock songs. Listening to the CD gives you that feel good feeling. I'm thoroughly enjoying this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunately, still not the same ...","review":"From \\"Every Picture Tells a Story\\" to the \\"Great American Songbook\\" series, a Rod Stewart album has been an automatic purchase for me. Through the inevitable ups and downs, I still have enjoyed each album ... until this latest effort. It sounds strained, sleepy, and lifeless. The song selection is very poor, and certainly does not deserve the label of 'rock classics'. In the past, even with mediocre material, Rod's energy could make each song come alive. He hasn't (or he can't) with this material on this album. The songs sound more like hymns or lullabies; certainly something that I would never accuse Rod of in the past. Wait for his next album. Rod Stewart is capable of much more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Captain Kidd","review":"Not the Sea Hawk or Captain Blood by any means,but still enjoyable.With a cast like Laughton,Carradine and Scott it can't be too bad.Historicaly not very accurate and a little hokey.But then again it doesn't claim to be factual.Laughton is great as the scheaming Kidd and Scott as the hero is his usually heroic self.If you are a fan of this type of film,and i am,you will enjoy this picture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laughton IS Kidd","review":"Charles Laughton was unparalleled as a character actor and \\"Capt.

What skill--but the best thing is, there is nothing obvious or manipulative about Ms. Cisneros' writing. This makes her stories unique. Some of the stories are more successful than others, but you remember her best because of their realism, and their integrity.If I could write fiction, I would want to write like Ms. Cisneros. She has a certain (dare I say it) purity and truthfulness in her style that is very attractive, and probably only comes to a writer after much heartache, testing and patience, while trying to capture the elusive \\"voice\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Mango Lives on in the Form of A Creek","review":"This collection of short stories consist of a few intersting stories, however the majority of the stories were cluttered with over excessive drama, over worked imagery, aand repettion.

Read this book.","review":"Meditations from the Mat is an outstanding resource for learning to practice yoga on and off the mat. It is not about poses, but about the practical application of the Eight Limbs of Yoga. In a world full of complicated, and at times contradictory philosophies, yoga is more relevant to our lives now than ever. Gates and Kenison provide a guide that brings the relevance of a yoga philosohpy to our modern lives. I love how the authors start each short daily reading with a relevant quote that in itself is worth pondering about. The text that follows brings to life the concepts from the yoga sutras. Even if you do not have an interest in yoga philosophy, you will enjoy the lessons in this book because they will calm you, ground you and provide you with a useful guide for living a better life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was disappointed in this book.

This was a very good book and I'll read more of Karel Capek. It has a very clever theme and is not only good fiction but a social commentary as well.However, I would buy the paperback instead of this hardback edition. It has obviously been photocopied and has many defects, including almost no periods at the ends of sentences, very strange spacing and a few duplicated paragraphs. Some pages were truncated at the edges (copy machine), and there were many extraneous marks.Note that the preview on Amazon is the paperback and does not display those defects.That being said, it was still readable. If you can't get a better print copy, get this one. It is still readable and the content more than makes up for the defects."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite Excellent","review":"This is definitely worth adding to your reading list. The concept is quite unique. If every object is a portion of the great creation, then all objects contain an inherent remnant of the power/genius/God of creation. So what if a device, \\"The Kaburator\\" could consume matter entirely and in doing so release the \\"Absolute\\" held within it. And once the absolute is released into the world, what is its impact on us?This question and its answers are what Capek weaves into a very entertaining read. I highly recommend and can promise a great read."},{"rating":"1","title":"do not buy this badly printed copy","review":"I know nothing of the book because I could not get that far. My copy was clearly a photocopied hunk of junk in a badly bound hard binding. There were multiple photocopy stray marks throughout the book (random blobs like you get with a photocopier). There was at least one page where the type was wavy like what happens when you photocopy something that is not totally flat. The margins were too big so it looks more like a photocopy of the actual book. The binding itself was actually uneven. The page that tells you who published it and when said 1944, and did not mention a more recent printing which indicates to me that it is possibly a pirate even. It is total crap. I had to send mine back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor acting Western!!!","review":"This film has a good idea for an action filled western--but where is it? The actors in this are just average at best and the action scenes are poorly made. The lack of any great actors is evident and the battle shoot out parts appear real fake. I have seen a lot of westerns filmed during the 1950s to 1960s that are much better than this one. The black and white background is great-the only thing going for this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful, touching book!","review":"Reading this book was like reading the story of my own son's life. So much of what was written could easily have applied to my son and the things he does. I frequently found myself nodding in understanding at the crazy things Patrick did or the struggles they encountered as a family. It was so inspiring to read about how the author accepted her son with so much love and grace and trusted God for everything. I can only hope that I can use her example in my own life. It's great to know that there are others who have walked in my shoes. So well-written and so heartfelt. This book will be making the rounds through the family and I'm sure will be enjoyed by all. It gives great insight into what we live with every day and would be a great outlook on a family with special needs children.

I got this CD from a pianist friend for whom I have a lot of respect, not quite sure what to expect. It took a while to arrive. I popped it in the CD that morning, I just had a terrible night. 8am and already in a bad mood. 10 seconds later, Monty's trio had taken me to a different level. It swings so hard, instant burst of energy. Even the recording quality is gorgeous. The piano is bright and crisp, and you can hear Monty constantly reaching its bed to get the best of it.

Aside from the occasional typo found in the book Ab Williams writes a rather amateurish introduction to Chinese medicine beginning with Taoism, Yin & Yang, the various meridians found along the physiological plain and concludes with a short blurb about use of and benefits of the exercise balls.

As always Cornwell's attention to historical detail shines through, showing the reader what was going on back in England while Wellington's forces persued Napolean across Europe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sharpe struggles to save his regiment!","review":"One of the things that I enjoy about Cornwell's Sharpe novels is the real picture the reader gets of the life and times of the common soldier. In this book, Sharpe is forced to return to England to find out why his army is not receiving new troops to replace the ones who have been lost to French lead. His quest forces both he and Patrick Harper to go undercover as new recruits in order to expose former Col. Henry Simmerson. The reader gets a real feel of how a soldier was recruited and trained during this time period in England. The book also brings in the Prince of Wales whose addoration of Sharpe earns the regiment the new name of the Prince of Wales Own!

Not only are the illustrations interesting and unique, but they are beautifully presented. As a middle school teacher, I would encourage students to use Dr. Coopersmith's book as a resource mostly because it is timely, complete and compelling. Moreover, his coverage of both the Union and of Confederacy is thorough and accurate. An excellent book, indeed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Watch!","review":"I love this watch! It's gorgeous! The only thing that is less-than-great about it is that the display should have more contrast. I need to turn the backlight on to read the black-on-gold display at light levels significantly higher than with my watches that have black-on-gray displays.

I can freeze some of it then top it off on hot days."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't normally spill, but also doesn't dispense enough water","review":"I purchased this water bowl for use at the dog park. It seems fairly sturdy and has a nice squat shape that would be hard for a dog to accidentally knock over. It also holds a pretty good amount of water.I wish the blue cap were easier to screw on. It usually takes me several tries because it seems to want to cross thread.The main issue I have, though, is that the blue cap fills with less than an inch of water under normal operation. The water level rises significantly when I apply pressure to the other end of the container using my foot. Once I release the pressure, the water level falls back down.This is a problem at the dog park for two reasons:1. I have to remain standing nearby the Water Boy in order to dispense water (with foot pressure) for the thirsty dogs.2. Quite a few dogs are too nervous to drink water while I've put my foot down right next to their noses."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money, unless you like wet carpeting in your car","review":"I needed a spill-proof bowl for a road trip, and I had seen one in a pet store before with a lip on the edge, that prevented sloshing water from spilling over the edge. They had none left, in stock, so I got this one instead. BAD DECISION. Any time you start up or stop, water sloshes over the edge. My carpeting has never been so wet. AND, it leaks around the cap also. If you screw it down a little to tight, it leaks around the O-ring. If a little to loose, it also leaks around the O-ring. I ordered a Buddy Bowl to replace this, and it's perfect. Not only does it have a lot more water in the bottom of the bowl so the dog doesn't have to wait after every lap for the bowl to fill up, you can be a speed racer and the water won't slosh out because of the rim."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad material causing water to rot!

BOTH OF THEM!! That smell can be smelled without putting it near your nose! Not at all good for ANY animal including humans to drink from! I used both distilled water and bottled water to see if it made a difference. It did not! I feel that the material it is made of causes this smell!

Everything I wanted in one item. I order the Water Bowl with high hopes. I was ecstatic when the Waterboy Travel Bowl arrived. It looked like the answer to my problem. I filled the Travel Water Bowl with water and carried it to the park. Unfortunately water spilled out of it as it was carried. I refilled the container and put it down for the dogs to use. Only a tiny bit of water was in the area for the dogs to drink. The dogs didn't like it as their tongues scraped in the plastic insert to get at the small amount of water in the drinking area. It only worked when it was put on a slope (and the dog park is flat), or, when the dogs wanted water I had to step on it to make more water flow into the drinking area. What a disappointment! Maybe an air hole strategically placed might help the water fill the bowl without human intervention."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for stationary use. Needs work","review":"The good: Great capacity. The bad: Since the bowl creates a sealed environment, dogs promptly lick it down to nothing. (it is hard to explain). Trouble is, even with the reservoir filled to capacity, when the dogs drink they just empty the cup where the water is. You then have to tilt/shake the whole thing for more water to come into the cup. This probably works great if it is sitting on a moving vehicle, but at home, the dogs are just licking and licking the few drops that are on the bottom of the drinking cup.

The opening track Basstation flirts with a churning guitar riff and bass line only to give way to a hook most deep sea fisherman would give an arm and a leg for. And while Ressonace may be the most radio friendly song the boys have ever written,it sparkles with the oil-drenched glory of all things Manhatten.The album concludes with \\" Let it Breathe\\" in which the slowly building tempo cascades over the chorus. This may be GVSB most fluid and cohesive album to date and I for one ,am just fine with that"},{"rating":"1","title":"These \\"Boys\\" still have a lot of growing to do","review":"If someone had told me 10 years ago that Girls Against Boys would still be playing today such minor-league Manhattan clubs as the Mercury Lounge and Brownies, I would have called them crazy. I was sure these guys were going to make it big. But I've grown up, and most things around me have changed. Except, apparently, GVSB. Now when I listen to some of my old GVSB recordings, my adolescent bad taste embarrasses me. Yet here we have another GSVB CD, one that sounds exactly like the stuff they put out way back when, just as monotonous and just as adolescent. Maybe the fact that their music hasn't evolved has a lot to do with the fact they went nowhere and that their one mainstream recording a few years ago flopped so badly. Only singer Scott McCloud sounds like he has any energy left. The rest of the group just seems to be going though the motions. This CD is a complete fiasco. Sadly, it seems, these \\"Boys\\" are never going to be Men."},{"rating":"2","title":"Back to basics","review":"First off, let it be said that I loved Freakonica. It seems that people came down on that album b/c of it's techno tendencies. Man, that album rocked and was one of the more refreshing pieces of alternative to hit the shelves in a long time. Now, back to You Can't Fight What You Can't See. Forget Freakonica. This album is bass, guitar and hard pounding drums. They rip through all eleven tracks with a ferocity not seen since before House of GVSB. Vocals and lyrical styles are the same as always. You don't know what the songs are about you just know they sound cool. And coolness is what GVSB has always been about. But it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't like this one? You're listening to the wrong band!","review":"The best way I can describe this album is that it gives me the same feeling I get when I'm looking through the used CD bin at the local shop, and I discover an old gem of a CD that I bought way back when that I either lost or used to own on cassette and never upgraded. In most cases, after three listens I pop it into the ol' CD rack and forget about it--just like I forgot about it until I saw it in the used CD bin!If you feel like this album is a step in the wrong direction for GVSB (and correct me if I'm wrong but few bands if any have ever made a successful regression to their original formula) then you should check out the amazing stuff that Scott Temple and John McCloud are doing in New Wet Kojak. To me, their sound in that project, although a bit less rock-oriented, would have been a nice succession to Freak on Ica."},{"rating":"1","title":"You can't fight getting lame","review":"Advance reveiws have generally treated this album as a return of GVSB to the glory of their early '90s years. I wish I could say that this is so, but it just ain't. I loved the group back then (especially \\"House of GVSB\\"), but for me they've long since lost their spark and have become just another ageing rock band long overdue for retirement.

It is absolutely devastating that someone like Mengele, who deserved the absolute worst evaded capture for decades as this book clearly shows.

Not only is she the only person in this movie who makes sense, but she is also the only one who isn't a whiny high schooler.I'm sure the other actors are just playing the script, but they were so annoying that I had to resist the urge to throttle the tv, and slap some sense into their heads.I only paid $2.00 for this movie. I only paid that because of the monster I saw in the previews. I really need to stop watching any movies that begins with the sypnosis of: \\"A group of college kids\\", or \\"Friends celebrating spring break\\", etc. Any horror movie that begins with something similar to that always seems to portray several characters you don't care about being killed, and leaves you scratching your head in frusteration as the characters make one stupid move after another.I give it 2 stars for the monster, and Lowdnes, but I honestly can't recommend this movie to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"It could have been good...","review":"Great storyline...possibilities...hopes...but this one FAILS.

You won't want to watch it more than once...then again, you may not finish watching it the first time. It is one of the slowest thrillers I've ever seen. Odds are you'll never see these actors or actresses in a quality film. And that's good. The over-reactive cast and dialogue was laughable.

The filmmakers outsourced the CGI to China, but it's a shame they also didn't outsource the script, direction, and acting as well.The film's fails on most levels, but a production begins and ends with a strong script, and this film simply didn't have it. Characters have to be likeable in order for us to care about their fate, and these 5 are very often cartoonishly obnoxious. I didn't care that their lives were in danger. In fact, I couldn't wait for them to be killed off.There are some films that are so bad, they're good. This one isn't. It's so bad, it's bad. Even clocking in at 82 minutes before the long 8 minute closing credit sequence, it feels long and ponderous in most places.Not even worth a rental."},{"rating":"1","title":"Losing altitude, fast.","review":"I think most people who have seen this movie agree that it will not win any awards.

Then again, if you have a group of 5+ people with nothing to do and 'naked twister' is not an option, play this movie and grab your alcoholic beverage of choice. Trust me, it'll make the experience that much better if you think of it as something kitschy, like your neighbor's Pomeranian in haute couture.Bottom line: If thin plot lines, confused endings, bad acting, horrible scripts and yelpy tweens offend you, stay far far away.

It is very long and very boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Michener blinded by his own assumptions.","review":"Michener once again poses as objective historian whilst force-feeding his own narrow-minded assumptions on anyone still reading his books. Although CARIBBEAN has some interesting sections, the author's thinly-veiled prejudices come shining through. The book is nearly half over before the narrator gives any attention to a single black character. His dismissal of Carib Indians is shallow and redundant. And he completely trashes Rastafarianism as a deliberate attempt to misread scripture in order to get high and scare whitey. This last dose of intolerance is utterly indefensible. Coming from the author who defended the rights of white South Africans to seize and oppress, CARIBBEAN gives thoughtful readers one more reason to discard Michener's imitation scholarship and reach for some real wisdom instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great Gift","review":"My daughter-in-law is a professor and writer.

That being said, he seems almost like a kid in a candy shop, and he seems eager enough to ignore the inn keeper's rules in order to capture evidence, and so a part of me thinks he wouldn't make anything up for that reason.

First At Bat and Chris Hits One Out of the Park.","review":"A great start for Chris Bachelder! A very humorous but at the same time sad look into our modern society. Chris delves into what we Americans place our emphasis on and where exactly our culture is heading. He achieves this in an amusing and very interesting way, using very imaginative imagery, ideas and dialogue of a somewhat present but an all too near, scary future.The story can be looked at from a number of different views. The way I looked at it was going to see the Super-Duper bowl on your PC between an Elvis Presley impersonator and a holographic John Lennon rumbling at Woodstock.

The first \\"Nativity in Black\\" is an awesome cd...a great tribute to a band that has inspired many of todays heavier bands. I couldn't wait for \\"Nativity II\\". Got it...like it a lot. It is more interpretive than the first. For example, just as I started to get depressed with a couple of the songs openings all of a sudden they took off in classic Sabbath style.....wall of sound awesome. Then there are many great semi-straight remakes, like Megadeath's \\"Never Say Die\\". This song alone makes this a CD worth buying..that good.

Pantera's cover of \\"Electric Funeral\\" is ok, but it's annoyingly identical to the original (Iced Earth's version is WAY better). \\"NIB\\" with Primus and Ozzy isn't bad, but they cut out all the solos to make it a radio hit.

Then there are the rap versions of Sabra Cadabra and Iron Man which are absolutely terrible. By buying this Cd I have lost all respect for Slayer. I have all of their CDs, but after hearing their version of the classic \\"Hand Of Doom\\" I wanted to bury my head in the sand. Megadeth's version of \\"Never Say Die\\" was just as bad.

The stand-out track on NIB 2 is Soulfly's take on \\"Under the Sun\\". I also like Busta Rhyme's version of \\"Iron Man\\" a lot despite the rest of the reviews here. Even if you don't like rap, you have to admit that he made a new-song out of the material unlike the rest of the \\"artists\\" on this album. Megadeth and Pantera both give good performances except their covers are barely distingishable from the originals! The rest of the tracks go from ok to terrible. You can skip this record. Instead, spend your cash on \\"NIB 1\\" for a good pop-metal disk or \\"Eternal Masters\\" for a great hard-core metal experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD but why the C-Rap","review":"This is overall a great CD until you get to its final track which for me ruins the entire CD. Busta Rhymes destroys one of musics greatest songs. Why the producer didnt cut the track I don't know. But there is nothing we can do about that now. All the other tracks are good. I usually don't like Static-X but I loved the amazing job they did on Behind the Wall of Sleep. System of a Down did a great job on Snowblind, and Primus with Ozzy on NIB was amazing, the bass solo intro the music it was all great especially when it is topped off with Ozzy's amazing vocals.

Lastly I used the heat gun with an adhesive patch to repair a hole in a pair of jeans. The heat gun worked well for all 3 jobs.

But her type of jazz is not for me. She is almost always accompanied with symphony-like support and mostly sticks to a classical jazz repertoire. The reason she does not appeal to me is because she is technically perfect to the point that each song seems like an exercise in control, which she does have except when she quickly drops to a much deeper voice. At least, that is my perception. I find little emotion.

Some terrorists blow up oil wells in Russia, what does Russia do? They decide to steal oil from other countries. Thats a good way to start a war, considering our society is totally based upon oil these days.This has a great plot, but is very drawn out and technical (like most of Clancy's novels...) but is still very good. The book constantly switches between the war and a group of people lost in Iceland. This really makes the suspense nerve racking.This book is very long, and I am not to compelled to re-read it. It is also very technical, and it bothers me at times. Still, it is worthy of 4 stars. I am sure Clancy has better books out, I am reading Patriot Games and it is better already. I do recommend this book to Clancy fans or people who would like a good thriller but don't mind all this techno-blabber."},{"rating":"2","title":"enjoyable read","review":"I remember reading this book when it was first published in hard cover. I bought it for my kindle.Tough the book was written at the height of the cold war."},{"rating":"2","title":"Packed with suspense to the fullest!!!","review":"A 10 if you like stories about war. A real page turner. As the story unfolds it stays at a pretty high suspense level, so it might be a little taxing on one's nerves to read it. Some statements about Germany are false for the 1980-s, they are more from the 70-s or even earlier, but that argument is more for nitpickers than anyone else.What struck me odd was the complete absence of any references towards insubordination and desertion of forces on both sides. OK, you can't desert on a ship, but on the ground it's another matter.The 'White Knight' part was a little out of place, though it counterweighted the hardware stuff nicely.Just replace any references to the F-19 with the F-117. I remember the plastic models of the F-19 sold at hobby stores 'till the early 90-s, and the F-117 to appear only shortly after Desert Shield.All in all it's a pretty good book, though by far not high literature. It's pretty long, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not too long at all","review":"As i read the reviews i noticed that some people pOinted out that the f19 did not exist, this is true however the cold war also never kicked off and we never foight the russians.

During the course of this mainly Jack Ryian odessy, I cam back and read this book 3 times. The first time I found it exciting, but I was rather confused by some of the technical details. The second time through I concentrated on figuring out what was going on in the parts that I didn't understand, and once I did, I reread the book. This time through I found myself identifying with many of the characters. Morris seemed to remind me of my uncles, and I thought that these people seemed totally realistic. I would recommend that anyone who has the time (it took me 2 months, 3 weeks, and 4 days to read it twice) to read such a book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Excellent Book!","review":"Red Storm Rising is a must buy!

Ryans character was good in Red October, but after that he just went down hill. This is a great book, and to all of you poor people out there that have not read this book I highly recomend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Conventional war thriller I have read","review":"This book was the best book Tom Clancy has written in my opinion. A great read for any military personal. overall a must read"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Jack Ryan, But Still Good","review":"I gotta say when i first started \\"Red Storm Rising\\" i was pessimistic. Without Jack Ryan, or John Clark how would it fare? Well \\"Bob Toland\\" is almost a carbon copy of Jack Ryan, which i find.. not so good. He\`s an intelligence analyst at the NSA instead of CIA, and even get\`s deployed to a Carrier early on. But this book isnt about character development, i think of it as a spin-off of Clancy work, it concentrattes on the Soviet/NATO war BRILLIANTLY. It was made mid-80\`s so the technology is a little outdated with some things, but he describes the war jumping theatre to theatre just great. Im kind of hoping Clancy write\`s a book like this (or one of his older ones like Patriot Games and Clear and Present Danger) in his next book instead of all the polotical stuff like his newer ones. His biggest mistake, IMO, was making Jack Ryan president."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a rush!","review":"Though I've never been a supporter of war of any kind, I really enjoyed this book. It was the first Clancy book that I ever read and I have loved his work ever since.The first time I read it was over ten years ago and I liked it so much I have decided to read all of Clancy's books all over again in the order they are to take place.Not being one of the \\"Jack Ryan\\" stories did not take anything away from the entertainment value. It's got thrills, tense situations and plenty of hard battles.I strongly recommend this book to lovers of espionage and action in general."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe if this had been written just by Clancy it would have been good...","review":"I read this after my 5th read of Hunt for Red October (I love it)... and I had to go back and check that I was reading a Tom Clancy novel. It reads so differently from HfRO, and not in a good way, in my humble opinion. I have not read any of Clancy's other novels, but can only assume that Bond's co-authorship is what ruined this for me. Be forewarned: if you're looking for something on par with Hunt for Red October--this isn't it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I thought it would be","review":"I love Tom Clancy. In fact I can safely say that Cardinal for the Kremlin is one of my all time favorite books. So when I heard that there was a novel out there about WWIII with soviets I jumped right on it.Big Mistake.I was expecting a book about major battles and world changing events. I was expecting to see the world structure change right before my very eyes! Although this is a great concept, I feel like Mr. Clancy spent too much time on minor things.******SPOILER*******I don't care about 3 men stuck on hill 142.

The US and its allies would be the ultimate winners. But I don't believe in the extraordinary events that take place in Red Storm Rising, there are just too many coincidences. For example, when the air strike against the american carrier group takes place, a small group of F-15s en route to europe just happened to be passing by and killed some of the soviet bombers... come on people, the Atlantic is way to big for this. And I'm just sure Soviet commandos in a covert mission get distracted enough to be ran over by a car every day! Sorry, I just had to get it out of my system. The book is just full of these sort of events. If Clancy had just left them out, the book would be in one word Excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome military book","review":"Tom Clancy's RSR is one of the best book I have ever read. Even though it may seem unlikely that the Soviet Union will resort to a world war to get access to the oil fields, instead of just asking for help. ( They did when their wheat crops failed, and they were supplied by the US and Canada ) But the action is great, and I was just captivated by the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"By far Clancy's best work to date!","review":"If you love Tom Clancy's books or your just looking for a great read, this is the book for you. Clancy manages to interweave geo-politics, military action, dahm good chracters and a non stop thrill ride of a plot into a book you won't be able to put down. This book has everything or as Ronald Raegan would say it is the perfect yarn."},{"rating":"2","title":"Long, Detailed, but Worth the Time Invested to Read","review":"My chief rave is that the book really does immerse you in the action. You can feel yourself in theseat of the sonar officer on a sub or the radar officer on a ship. The naval action kept movingforward unerringly.My chief complaint is some of the excessive detail which adds bulk to a bulky story. Do I really care what model torpedo is fired every time oneis fired? I also fault the weak subplot of alove story during wartime. It just wasn't allthat interesting. Of all the campaignsgoing on, I found the ground war in Europe the least interesting from the point of the reader. It lacks the suspense of the submarine stories. Itlacks the speed of the air war. It lacks the intrigue of the intelligence war.The story is not perfect. There are some definite loose ends with the finale. SometimesI kept wondering when some of the characters were going to come back to take their bows, and theynever did."},{"rating":"2","title":"By Far The Best Book He Has Written","review":"If you are looking to get away from his jack ryan novels this is the one to read. The action starts off right from the first page. From their it is nothing but all out land, sea, and air warfare. It is a very scary realistic possibility of World War 3. Surprised they havent turned it into a movie. Would recommend to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Geat Book!","review":"Clancy's first book is definitely one of his best. The way he depicts modern combat is as if he was actually on the front lines in a modern WWII. The only part that I disliked was all of the tedious submarine lingo. It would be great if he would have put a glossary in, but it's still awesome."},{"rating":"2","title":"The classic tale of the war that never happened.","review":"I think this was the novel that made Clancy famous, and if correct then rightfully so. Red Storm Rising is the story of a conflict between the Soviet Union and NATO over oil, after terrorists strike at Russian Oil production. NATO is seen as the major obstacle to the conquest of the middle eastern oil fields, so it must be taken out first. The main action of the book revolves around the taking of Iceland by Soviet paratroopers brought in by ferry, and they efforts of the United states to take the island back. There is plenty of action described in Central Europe and other areas as well, as the friction of war and unexpected resistance slow the Soviet advance. This book is not as well written as Clancy's later books, but is still a good read and of interest to anyone who asks the question, what if America and the Soviet Union had actually clashed head to head in the late twentieth century."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Clancy that I've read","review":"This was the first Tom Clancy novel that I read. It was in 1984 and I was told that my ship ( USS Pharris FF-1094) was in the story. I couldn't put it down. Like all of his stories it grabbed me from the first page."},{"rating":"2","title":"red storm rising is a fun read","review":"This is my first Tom Clancy novel, although I have seen several movies based on his books, all of which I enjoyed very much. I think if Red Storm Rising had been about 100 pages shorter, it would have been wonderful, and the author would not have lost any of the suspense he manages to create with the great battle scenes and political machinations of the Russians. I thought the story line about the guys running around on Greenland could have been shortened by 2/3 and the book would have been more succinct and suspenseful. I think Clancy wanted to inject a bit of romance into this techno-thriller, but, since he is pretty hopeless with in-depth character development, this component fell flat and could easily have been eliminated. Anyway, the book is a fun read, even if the equipment used in this version of WWIII is quite dated (reflecting the date of the book, of course). I plan to try a few more Clancy novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good story but some parts are slow.","review":"This book was not one of my favorite Clancy novels. The techno-warfare is accurate and well-researched, and there are a number of exciting parts, but there are also some parts that are slow-reading, drawn out sections that I found boring and/or tedious. I think too much writing was spent on character development for the Clancy fan who is looking for an exciting adventure story that moves at a good clip. The contrast between The Hunt for Red October, which reads at a much faster pace, and Red Storm Rising is vast. I think this book is worth reading but one should be prepared to spend a disproportionate amount of time reading the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good book to begin reading Tom Clancy","review":"This was the very first Tom Clancy book I read. I found it very easy to read, and quite enjoyable. Ever since I read this, I have read nearly all of Clancy's novels.

I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A thriller from begining to end","review":"This was the first Clancy book I ever read.

Thank you Tom Clancy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thrilling Scenario","review":"What if the US and USSR had gone toe to toe militarily in the 1980's? In \\"Red Storm Rising\\", Tom Clancy takes a hard look at a frighteningly plausible scenario for just such a Third World War. Including combat by land, sea, air, and even space, this is an action packed scenario that looks at two superpowers locked in combat. Mixed in with the exquisite technical detail are many plot threads, with excellent story-telling and narration that help make \\"Red Storm Rising\\" a non-stop pageturner.Although dated now, almost some twenty years after its publication, this is still a great look back at a very unstable point in our history. Luckily a confrontation like this one was avoided, but at the time the threat was very real, and Clancy clearly did his homework before writing this thriller."},{"rating":"2","title":"The cost and ultimate futility of war","review":"A tragic disaster (by a terrorist act) brings the world to war with everyone saying we had no choice!

Have read all of Clancy's books since. Reading this book again, reminds me of why have read and collected all of his books. Bought the Kindle book because my original hard copy was lost in a flood."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Clancy.","review":"This is one of Clancy's first books. Therefore it belongs to a time when he was worth reading. The best part is the plausible way in which he describes how world war III would happen if it could occur without Nuclear Weapons. As usual, Clancy delivers an action packed book and is a master in telling a great story. His command of military technology is unique. The flaw lies on the caracthers. They are flat and borderline cliche. Clancy has no grasp on what makes humans, well, humans."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm not a Clancy fan, but I'll be honest here.","review":"This book was fast paced and techno, but most of the action lay in dialogue between commanders so that the book could fit twenty battles where most would fit one, and despite the amount of dialogue between commanders I could never get to love the people enough to get emotional over the events. It was rather more like history to me. So and so won a battle, and so and so then got shot in the head because of another so and so's conspiracy, and then the other so and so lost a battle. But if you like books that are techno military without much emotion and with a bird's eye view of a hundred battle scenes buy this book; it's probably Tom Clancy's best. Else wise I would really recommend a book named: Cain by James Byron Huggins."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly typset Kindle edition","review":"I love this book, but it's a far better experience in print than in the Kindle edition. The book appears to have been transferred to electronic form with OCR and poorly proofread. Many of the alpha-numeric abbreviations are mangled and throughout the book you find tell-tale errors, like \\"c\\" for \\"e,\\" which leave you looking at nonsense words. Worst of all, in this case, are the myriad \\"m\\" for \\"rn\\" errors which turn almost every nautical use of \\"stern\\" into \\"stem,\\" which carries the opposite meaning and is truly confusing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent story","review":"This is early Clancy novel presented in a Larry Bond-type format. This plot involved an entirely different set of characters than the Jack Ryan series. These characters were developed and quite believable. I am disappointed that Mr. Clancy hasn't brought back the Air Force Lieutenant and his Icelandic damsel for a Jack Ryan novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clancy's Second Best","review":"I've read the majority of Clancy's books in the past year and i find him great one of the best authors. Up there with Dean Koontz, Stephen King, Robert Magammon and Micheal Chricton. Now the best book madeby Tom was Rainbow Six and this came in a close second place. I had buht the book and then idn't expect that it would be that great because it's basd on WW3 and its 725 pg's long so i didn't ed it for the longest time. That was my mistake i should have read it right away. It took me under a week to read it was so good. He describes the war so well and the battle seens he wrote it was like i was there. He made the war even and not lop-sided (like he did in SSN) he made both sides win the battles. For some reason though i wanted the Russians to in this book i guess i'm just sick of always seeing the Yankee's win (there so full of themselves when it comes to war movies or books. They think there the best). Any way this is a must read for everyone unless you hate war."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boooooooring...","review":"Well, first of all, I have no respect for anyone who attends fundraising dinners for Oliver North, but I gave this book a try since \\"The Hunt For Red October\\" was pretty entertaining. I've tried three times get through this book, but to no avail. The plot is quite interesting, and there are some good moments, but the whole thing is bogged down by endless, redundant battle scenes that do absolutely nothing to move the story along. This book would have been great if a couple hundred pages (no exaggeration) were edited out. Tom Clancy could use some pointers from Frederick Forsyth, Jeffrey Archer and Joseph Finder. They do this stuff much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Old book still good","review":"I read this many years ago when there was a possibility of a war against the Soviet Union.

The book reads like a technical manual, reducing sex to a series of specific tasks, and telling us how women supposedly respond to kisses and touches. Not all women will respond in the same way, and the important thing is to be sensitive to the clues she is sending you, not to necessarily spend x amount of time kissing or touching one specific part of her anatomy. There are better books on pleasing a women, e.g. \\"The Sex You Want.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Really Awful","review":"Only 7 pages of this 132 page book actually deal with the g-spot, the rest reads like a horrible dating manual for idiots. We don't need a book to tell us what to talk about over dinner. I am not kidding. Rather than addressing the topic at hand, the author speaks down to the reader as if they have never met or dated a woman previously. We were laughing hysterically at the first few sections until realizing that the whole book read like this. Absolutely stupid and insulting, you would do better studying the Wikipedia entry on \\"g-spot\\" and Penthouse Letters."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Dating for Neanderthals\\" would be a better title!","review":"This book was the most useless book I've ever read! It didn't have much to say about the G-spot except a mere 7 pages out of a total 132 pages. The rest is pretty much author's self promotion of his technique that is ironic since there is none!The title should have been \\"Dating for Neanderthals\\" or \\"Dating for sexually retarded\\"... Believe me it was insulting to read! The author just assume that anyone who is reading a book about sex must be a total moron that has never dated a woman much less touched one! I've read a lot of books about sex and by far this purchase was my biggest regret!

When I received it I very briefly looked at it and put it aside until Halloween. Well to my surprise, when I was putting the leggings on, it turned out that my package had two right legs instead of one right leg and one left leg. There is a white stripe that runs down the outside of the legs. I had one stripe on the outside of my right leg and one stripe on the inside of my left leg when I wore it. It ruined the costume. On top of that the leggings kept sliding down my legs ALL NIGHT LONG. It turned what would have been a fun night into a really long night and I just wanted to go home and take it off. I had to wear it since I didn't have a back-up costume, otherwise I would have returned it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zumo 550 problems","review":"I have now had two Zumo 550's completely fail.

When it works, very good and easy to use.While the store replaced the first one (and they will replace the second one), I expect much better from a product at this price point. I will be asking for a refund at this point.Suffice it to say that I have zero confidence that this unit will survive when exposed to the vibrations and weather on a motorcycle!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buggy Software","review":"I've had the Zumo 550 for just over a month now and during that time it has locked-up in the power off mode multiple times while in the cradle. The only way to get the unit to power back on is to remove and re-install the battery using a 2mm hex wrench (not included). The unit does have some nice features but its lack of dependability make it more toy than tool. If you're considering a purchase check out the ZumoForums online. There are multiple accounts of new Zumos with the same problem I had. Kudos to Amazon for shipping out a replacement (I had owned the unit a few days too long to qualify for a refund, which I would have preferred.) but my discussions with Garmin and others' experience doesn't make me hopeful that this will have been a good investment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Zumo review","review":"This Zumo 550 was a gift I purchased for my husband.

It will not let you easily alter a route it has chosen for you. The mapping software on the PC is much easier to manipulate.

You can't go wrong with the Garmin Zumo. Add the XM receiver and you have not only the GPS, but sat. radio, MP player, and use of the phone through Bluetooth.It is easy to use and definitely lives up to the waterproof claim.The only reason it did not get a 5 is because the cradle for the motorcycle is NOT waterproof and any moisture shorts out the antenna (and other) contacts.

The unit ships with all the stuff you need to mount it on the bike and in the car. There are maps available from Mad Maps which feature some nice motorcycle routes in a variety of different US states.I am a Mac user as well, and the only complaint I have so far with Garmin is that they don't seem to offer as much support for mapping software on a Mac as they do on a PC.

I highly recommend this unit for any biker out there needing directions! I wired it direct to the bike, and the handlebar mount works very easily, and has the safety feature built in so no one can steal it. Plus, even if it's stolen, the thief can't use it! What a feature loaded unit! The only reason I didn't give it a five star rating is I wish it was a little bigger, and had voice directions, without having to plug it into a bluetooth device, as some people don't have communication devices on their motorcycles (like me).

The features are great, but mine just wouldn't turn on sometimes. Unfortunately the unit waited 17 days to act up, too long to return it to Best Buy, so I turned to Garmin. Tech support couldn't solve the problem so they requested that I return the unit.They wouldn't just send a replacement unit, they want ALL the parts, including the ones already mounted to the motorcyle. In addition, they rewarded me with the pleasure of paying for shipping to return it to them. Customer rep. said she didn't think it was right either, but it's \\"Company Policy\\". I used this unit on one trip, and it left me stranded. Thankfully I had maps. Now Garmin is taking a few more bucks out of me. Cheaters never prosper Garmin! I'm in a loose/loose situation.

Undaunted, she keeps trying, where most customers would have given up and just thrown the $300+ out the window.I want the Amazon community to know how lacking in post-sale service this company is.I can't give a review of TomTom, but I can definitely say, do not purchase a Garmin, unless you enjoy wasting hundreds of dollars on a faulty device."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Garmin, you have failed me for the last time.\\"","review":"I was tired of the 15 minute start up times, the touch screen that couldn't stay calibrated, expensive map updates and Garmin's useless tech support.

It navigates and recalculates very quickly and so far is very accurate.It's also obvious that Garmin put some thought into the engineering of this unit. The mounts are sturdy and it's easy to use.My only complaint is the cost of the XM antenna... it's over $200. You can buy an XM radio for less than that, so why not just put an audio input jack on the GPS and allow me to listen to my own MP3 player and/or XM radio through it?"},{"rating":"2","title":"this device rocks..","review":"Easy to use. feature rich out of the box.

I have had 3 others and after much research went with the 550.I would go 5 stars but like others may have mentioned.... the MP3 player cannot be used unless the unit is in either the car cradle or the motorcyle cradle with external power connected. The headphone jack is part of the cradle not the GPS body. What this means to me is... I can't just pop it off the bike and listen to music in my tent/hotel or around camp. It is not a dig deal since I have a mp3 on my cell phone but it would be a nice feature to have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Zumo 550 Review","review":"Zumo works great, however, the item was incorrectly packaged. They had two car mounts, instead of 1 car mount and 1 motorcycle mount.The people at Zumo were extremely NOT helpful. Their customer service is terrible. They would not replace the mount, without going through a dog and pony show that was ridicules.I needed the motorcycle mount for a weekend trip, and they said it would take weeks to get a replacement to me, if they could at all. I have never experienced such poor customer service. Was quicker just to buy a new mount.This was no fault of Amazon, as they do not do the packaging. Amazon is great, and will shop with them again. I doubt I buy any more Garmin products though - as they will not offer the basic support thats required from a company of this caliber."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great GPS!","review":"I love the garmin. The same day I got it it went on the bike. You do not need any kind of voice directions on the bike due to great screen with advanced instructions. On the included car mount, it talks great! It has elevation figures and it gets signal from the satelite right away. I am really happy with the unit, it's also super sturdy (it looks like it would do fine if it's dropped). The only thing I can think of that would make it better, it every time you have to navigate somewhere it asks if you want to go somewhere in your state. This gets kind of old and I would it rather assume I am going somewhere in the state, if not I should have a key to say diff state! But this is a super small thinkg!

Over all-5 of 5 starts-awesome.Marc [...]"},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading Concerning XM","review":"Garmin says that only an antennae is needed to use the built in XM capabilities. That is not correct. The Garmin does not have an XM receiver in it so you have to buy a special \\"antennae\\" listed at $270 and $200 on Amazon. It is the only way to use the XM function and is 1/3 the price of the GPS itself.

Diane Lane and Tommy Lee Jones also give standout performances here, and most of the cast is convincing enough. The problem seems to be Bolt\`s direction, entirely average and bland, which doesn\`t provide any particural memorable moment or scene. There are no impressive camera-angles here, so what counts is really the plot. The worse thing is that the plot is just adequate yet nothing special either, presenting a typical rags-to-riches storyline with cliched characters and unsurprising situations. The acting makes it work in a mildly interesting manner, though, so the movie still manages to be an entertaining pick for a rainy day. \\"The Big Town\\" is another average film worth watching once and be done with it.Not a keeper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dice players rejoyce","review":"I first stumbled across this movie on cable in the late 80's.

Matt Dillon plays a complete craps stud who can win any dice game no matter the stakes or cash on the table. Tommy Lee Jones, Tom Skerrit, Bruce Dern & Lee Grant all contribute with awesome performances to this \\"Gem Club\\" of a movie.

Intellectually and cinematically, a masterpiece. So why shouldn't you buy the DVD? Because it's simply atrocious. It's truly tragic how poorly the colors are rendered. Where the film's photography is lush, rich, and vivid in color (an element which, by the way, is essential to the film), the DVD renders none of this. The DVD colors are dim and washed out.

I love slow-moving stories, but here the story is so thin I found myself dying to hit the fast-forward button to speed things along.

You can just skip Lorne Green, Tab Hunter and Kirk Douglas they can't sing and it is too bad that they were included on this disc.If you are a fan of westerns, movies or tv, you will no doubt enjoy most of this. The quality of the recording is fine though it is from Germany and some of the details in the written material is in German to me its not really a problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed because...","review":"The reason I purchased this particular CD was for the title song.

But this one is the only one I do not like. There is barely nothing to do and the only thing good is all the items, which take forever to get. It's extremely sluggish too. I know ps2 sim games aren't the fastest thing but this one was extra slow, it froze up my ps2! There wasn't enough tasks to do. I rather play the sims 1 game with the worser graphics because at least it was A LOT more entertaining. The big thing is you can't even have a baby and that sucks big time. My big problem with this was that it wasn't fun and even though the graphics were very improved they sometimes froze or took forever to do something. So I recomend sims castaway, urbz, busting out...anything but this one. You won't like it and you'll be bored in a day or two."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bustin' Out was more fun -- this is a step backward","review":"I bought this on the first day it was released. What a disappointment. It has less functionality than any Sims game -- as far as building or dressing people or aspirations or....well anything.The aspirations are stupid. For example, if your main character hires a maid that doesn't stop someone else in the house from wanting to hire a maid days later (even though the maid is walking around in front of their face!). How dumb is that!!The control panels are clunky. You have to pause the game to go find out when your character has to go to work or what they need to advance in their job. Plus, your PS2 will grind constantly and don't even get me to talking about the terribly slow load times!!Bustin' Out was way more fun -- more action and with a lighter sense of humor. Plus you can buy it cheap -- instead of this overpriced, uninspired mess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun for awhile...","review":"This game was fun for little while until the more I played it the more I realized their wasn't much to do. Sims 2 is better played on the PC version on the computer. Sims wasn't made for the PlayStation 2. You can't build big houses because of the fire code; you build your house to big with alot of stuff inside it could catch on fire. One thing I loved most about the Sims is the ability to create my dream house, and I can't do that with the PlayStation 2 version. This game should just stick with computers and not game consoles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh..","review":"This version has a way different feel to the computer version, but I bought it a long time ago when my computer didn't have the juice for the game.

A load of crap. [...]Funny how they failed to mention that all the original aspects of the Sims has been removed in SIMS2 playstation. You'll have more fun buying the SIMS2 on PC not PS2. Serious.

Improved graphics from the previous Sims games for PS2. Awesome direct control/godmode toggle. More interactive objects through third person mode (and cooking, socializing, etc) Not bad in general.Some issues: AI still seriously lacking. Doors getting blocked so sims refuse to move or walk through. Sims taking the longest possible distance to walk to an object. Often difficult to simply interact with other sims. Minor problems in interface such as having to pause the game and scroll through a bunch of sims to figure out what their relationships are. Pausing the game every time you need to know which skill to improve to advance in your career. Could have made it a little more user-friendly.Overall, a lot of improvement and depth added. Recommended if you are a Sims fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Addictive and Very Fun!","review":"This game is totally addictive. If you have time to kill, play it.

There are 3 big reasons why I regret purchasing this game:- You cannot become pregnant or adopt.- There are no Genetics, Family trees, etc.- There is no agingThe whole point of \\"The Sims 2\\" was to develop GENERATIONS of sims and take each sim from a child up to a senior citizen. In this games defense, I will say it did provide hours of entertainment.Honestly, The sims series just is not meant for a console like PS2. The sims series is a PC game, and when transferred to a console you lose so much of what makes the game great.I love almost every game Maxis has ever created, even my least favorite Maxis' games are ranked above some of the more popular PC games.A rare miss for Maxis."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad, Bad, and BAD!!!","review":"I really liked the origional Sims for PS2.

I can not pick it up without saying, \\"Ouch.\\" It is filled with \\"If - Then\\" statements, all ending in \\"Then I know nothing of Calvary love.\\" It is a small book, and \\"if\\" is a small word, but it has a big impact. It is filled with wise and profound statements covering many areas of life. Every time I pick it up it shows me how little I know of Calvary love, and how much God has yet to change me. This is not a book to read once and then put down. It is one to open up at random on a daily basis. It isn't a book shelf book, but one to be kept by the bedside, coffeepot, kitchen table, or any where else that will remind you to pick it up again. It is a convicting reminder of how God loves each of us, and how He expects each of us to pass His love along."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderfully challenging!","review":"This isn't a soft pity-yourself kind of book. It's convicting, refreshingly true, and very, very challenging! In such a small amount of words this book manages to say so much.

It's almost impossible for me to enjoy a book that is so visually confusing. I wish I had known...Reading it on my Mac is much better because the window simply shows the full wordage on each line, although the page seems rather narrow compared to other books.

This print was $1.39 when I bought it, so I can't complain too much, but it's certainly not worth the price they're asking for now.

Dinah changed and evolved as a singer thru the years (some critics accuse her for \\"selling out\\" to pop) and her voice grew rich and soulful as well. There's the early Dinah from the mid to late 40s with songs such as \\"Long John Blues\\" \\"Slick Chick on Mellow Side\\" where she's only backed by a trio and guitar. Record company did a good job restoring sound quality on the earlier recordings. You can hear Dinah's voice mature thru the years. As the years go by you can hear the different accompanists---orchestra, strings and violins---it all shows how comfortable Dinah was in each and every musical setting. The later pop smashes are here too \\"What A Difference A Day Makes\\" \\"This Bitter Earth\\" \\"Unforgettable\\". She truly was unique and versatile. No wonder she boasted to the public \\"I can sing anything, anything at all...\\" She wasn't boasting at all.

Usually we think of all the troubles Job endured, however, Iverna Tompkins shows how God used the conversations of his four friends as prophetic words pointing to God's sovereignty. This story is related to us in manner which is easy to apply to our contemporary world. It is not only a study book on the prophetic but a lesson in dealing with difficult situations and people.

He used three 100Watt Marshall stacks pushed at full volume to derive unbelievable tones from his guitar. Simply put -- there's not much tone on this album, nor sustain, nor overtones that come from Marshalls on 10. Yeah, there's talented guitarists, like Andy Aledort, but the notes seem to die out.

If you have never treated yourself to one of his books, why wait any longer? If you've read, say, \\"Angle of Repose\\" and wonder if his other works measure up, don't worry... they do. In this one, he tells the story of the itinerant Mason family over the course of 30 years, from just after the turn of the century until the early 1930s. You'll follow them from the Dakotas to Saskatchewan to Montana, Nevada, and Utah, as Bo Mason, intent on making it big, involves his family in a variety of get rich quick schemes, (some legal, some not) that emotionally wrench the family from one city to the next. They are always on the brink of either great wealth or abject poverty, of high society or a prison term. Stegner can weave a tale like few other writers. Very highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"the Big Rock Cany Mountain Myth","review":"I loved this book. Stegner is a wonderful writer in that he gets to the meat of things and into people's heads in a way that draws one in. His character development is superb.

Though this book is quite good I could not give it a '5' because it does not come up to Stegner's great works. The characters seem to have values that are either black or white.This is an epic novel of the post-frontier western United States. It tells of Bo Mason's selfish pursuit for quick money and an easy life. Though never quite attaining his dream, he can be cruel as he drags others in his wake, not caring what their sacrifices are. Elsa, his wife, is too good (or stupid?) to be true.This book is early Stegner with shadows of his writing's maturity shining through. Though long, parts were breathtaking in their characterization and description. It is a good tale of family, love and estrangement."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good read, but I wish Elsa had some backbone","review":"I enjoyed the book. Stegner does a good job evoking life around this period (1900-1930s), and describing realistic characters. However, the mother - she was portrayed as a saint - was exasperating with her infinite patience and understanding of her husband's inexcusable behavior.I'm sure there were and are women like Elsa, but I would characterize them as co-dependent and lacking an iota of self-respect/esteem, rather than as extraordinarily kind and wise. For example, it's truly pathetic how she apologizes to one and all for being so much trouble when she's deathly ill."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent read","review":"Even if you have no prior knowledge about reefs, this book explains and makes sense of the entire reef ecosystem.

The reader will gain a helpful historical perspective of the history of this current hot-button along with where we stand today on this unresolved issue. More specific ideas as to what initiatives might be taken in local communities would add a necessary component to the book.

I want my research to be fully informed by all the various differing voices in the debate over Charitable Choice, and thought that this book would yield thoughtful, intelligent analysis and discussion. I was sadly disappointed. This book is not meant to be a resource for any serious scholarly discussion, as I found it greatly oversimplified many of the topics it approached, and is written very much in a consumer-friendly fashion. If you are looking for a book that will lay out the basic positions of supporters of Charitable Choice and the Faith-Based Initiative, and a simple explanation of what Charitable Choice is, then this is the book for you. However, if you are looking for serious scholarly discussion, don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ware makes his own way.","review":"David Ware plays a deep, fast, unique horn. Tonality is key to his technique, but he is not painfully bizarre--as was Pharaoh Sanders most of the time when he nearly ruined the latter Coltrane group (except when he played alto on \\"Live in Japan\\"). Ware's music is sometimes jarring, but bright with innovation. \\"Surrendered\\" is more approachable and less \\"outside\\" than, say, \\"Go See the World,\\" which I also like. There is more song structure than in other \\"outside\\" jazz. Ware's fellow musicians fit well with his sensibilities, especially his pianist, Matthew Shipp, who can hold his own with Ware's ecstatic flights into the unknown. The last piece sounds a bit like \\"My Favorite Things,\\" and swings in 3/4 time.This is not one of my most-played discs, but it is just right for some moods. Ware has a voice of his own, to be sure.--Douglas Groothuis"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow","review":"David S. Ware (b. 1949) is an incredibly talented tenor saxophonist who reminds me of a young Archie Shepp. This music is open and edgy, demanding listeners to let it inside. Ware represents a corner of the jazz world that continues to create, evolve and inspire modern listeners and critics with a sound uniquely his own. He is one of a handful pushing ahead on the cutting edge of freeform jazz music.\\"Surrendered\\", recorded in October of 1999, is a superb endeavor with Ware accompanied by the following musicians: Matthew Shipp (piano), William Parker (bass) and Guillermo E. Brown (drums). Ware's musings are careful yet unreserved, at once appearing as violent as they do tame. Occasionally Shipp pops up from the background with a stellar piano solo for audiences, with Parker and Brown forming the makes of a solid rhythm section. This album is well worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Need odd taste to enjoy this","review":"So, this comes across as a mockumentary, but it is suppose to be 100% true.

They had no compassion or willing to compromise for an 82 year old woman on a fixed income. I would not recommend this product at all-she used it a total of twelve times in the 2 1/2 years.

Indians, but I apparently didn't have a high enough standard for the adjective good. This movie is about as low budget as they come. The battle scenes were almost comical. A member of the beleaguered army fort would observe with great fear, \\"The Indians are forming to attack!\\" Cut camera to the Indian charge and you witness a whole hoard of all of 12 to 15 Indians. Heck, half the time the Calvary outnumbered the Indians AND they were armed with repeating riffles sitting behind stockade walls. What were the Indians going to do, huff and puff and blow the fort down? Just when you think you had seen it all, the movie ends with the Indians simply letting the soldiers go because, \\"They have fought the good fight and shown bravery.\\" Perhaps I should have sought a very good fairy tale.

Most DVD+R disks are 8x or under in speed so there really is no use in having a 16x DVD burner, but I guess in the near future there will be media that can burn at 16x. By the way the other reviewers mentioned that they were using DVD-R media, that media is made to be used with Macs not PCs, you're supposed to use DVD+R on a Windows PC. So that could have been they're problem. I use this drive with Nero 7 Ultra Edition and it works great.

Main room luminaries, such as Sinatra, whiled their after hours with Prima and Smith.Backed by the Witnesses,led by the greatly overlooked and under appreciated Sam Butera, Prima and Smith simply wailed. Butera plays the most lascivious sax around. Listen to him solo or support and be amazed. Don't forget that Prima was a first rate trumpet player in the New Orleans style. As hard as they swing, that style informs their sound.Contrasted to Prima's heat is Smith's cool. She can cut loose, too. If only for Tenderly/Can't Help Loving That Man, buy this record!

I cannot understand why this mat was not made to accomodate the buildings/planes that are made for the wooden set (,planes, hangers, firehouse etc.) The mat should be a runway without airplanes and buildings pictured so that it could actually be played with. If anything they should have drawn dotted lines for where to place buildings that you have. What are you supposed to do with the wooden buildings that you have they do not fit on the mat. The planes can actually go inside the wooden hangers(more fun than a flat mat). Though the hangers are too small to accomodate all the planes(example the kids hanger....only two fit not three) It does make a nice, expensive rug or door mat for decoration though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't add much to the play experience","review":"My 2-1/2 year-old son received this for Christmas along with three of the plane characters and one of the hangars. The play mat is very cute, but it basically just acts as a storage area in our living room for the toys. He never uses it to actually play with the planes in terms of running them down the roadways, etc. It is durable enough, but I would say it's a waste of money.UPDATED: My son is now 4-1/2, and actually uses the play mat more now than he did before. He must have been too young to grasp the idea of it, but now he's using it like it's intended.

In the aftermath of instant celebrity and scandal, they take a rafting trip together down the Salmon River and discover even more secrets about each other. Great surprises I won't give away! This is a powerful story about the mistakes women often make when they're young and not so young, and the joys they share with each other. I loved the male characters too, especially Jina's boyfriend, Mike, who isn't the perfect man, but is so perfect for her you have to root for him. There's even an elk who thinks he's Elvis Presley!

A young naval engineer is called upon to help with the development of the the North's first ironclad ship.

All of the books have engaging, fun text that rhymes, as well as humorous animal illustrations. These three books have a more sing-song quality to them and are especially fun to read.

Of course, in true Boynton style, they all rhyme and have cute illustrations. Pajama Time is my FAVORITE!

Barnyard Dance is also sing-songy and cute. The dinosaur book has opposites and is very clever.My other favorite books of hers are What's Wrong Little Pookie?, The Belly Button Book, The Going to Bed Book, and Doggies. (Although, I like every book of hers I've read.) In some ways it seems like Far Side for kids."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed!","review":"I'm disappointed because my daughter has no interest in this set at all.

My newborn loves the rhyming sounds and the rhythmic meter of the text. Pajama Time is the best of the three, but Barnyard Dance isn't far behind. Dinosaurs isn't as good as the other two, but it's still worthy of the collection. Sandra Boynton in general is fantastic for small board books (The Belly Button Book and But Not the Hippopotamus being my two all-time faves) and you can't really go wrong with this collection (unless you let your kid eat it)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love these books!","review":"We loved the Boynton books when our kids were growing up.

It teaches absolutely nothing and only gives a very tight form rather than allowing students to develop their own style. Used in English classes for God knows how long, it gets worse with age. About the only thing this book has going for it is that it's so fun to make fun of-- the dumb analogies and Lucille V.

It was THE MOST BORING BOOK I have ever read!! It was difficult staying awake.This torture may have been worthwhile if there was something to be learned. Unfortunately there is nothing to be learned!!!You could condense the book down to ONE sentence- Writing is important, like drag racing, and never say the word there.

My high school freshman English class used this book, and I still have my copy a decade and a half later. It's the single most useful book I've read on writing fundamentals, and I recommend it highly to those who are actually interested in learning to write. There has never been any point in trying to achieve a personal style before mastering the fundamentals of logical organization and tight writing.Some of the examples, perhaps, could use a little updating, but the fundamentals of good writing have not changed appreciably since the book was published.

Yet, this book, assigned in our Rhetoric class, is a juvenile attempt to teach the art of writing. The LAW merely teaches subjects that are, to many, common sense, such as the avoidance of passive voice, but any valid points made by the book are nearly invisible in the horrible examples, such as drag racing or teen-agers. (yes that's how old the book is. It was written when \\"teenager\\" was not its own word.) Ultimately, the book teaches a style of writing that does not nurture the natural abilities of a writer, but dumbs them down. If i were to write a paper based on Mrs. Paine's guidelines in a college course, my professor would certainly look at me, as if i were a child, and ask if i wanted a lollipop, for it would definitely match the maturity of Mrs. Paine's writing rubric."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lively Art Of -Old Time- Writing.","review":"I am a senior at Champaign Central High School.

When I finally removed the tags and stuck my hand into it, it felt wrong. When I went to grab my first cookie sheets from the oven, the sheet almost slipped out of my hand. I then re-adjusted, and ended up destroying a cookie.The biggest problem I have with this is that the spacing is fine for the 4 fingers in the hand, but the thumb has nothing but problems. I would much prefer if one size was sized for the 4 fingers, and the other for a single thumb. Otherwise, it is extremely difficult to visualize where the pressure you apply actually goes.My girlfriend picked up on a similar issue in the fact that the thumb side needs to be shorter than the finger side. When I tried again, I noticed that was also a major part of the problem.Even after trying this grabber quite a bit, I find it extremely cumbersome to use."},{"rating":"1","title":"It just doesn't work well","review":"Like the other reviewers, I just couldn't find a way to use this \\"grabber\\" that didn't cause problems that don't happen with other silicone grabbers.

But as has been noted before, the 4 finger part is ok, but I have small hands and even with just the small gripper, I can barely hang on to a cookie sheet without my hand coming out of the gripper, the thumb part needs to be made lots smaller. I still think the idea is a good one, I like clean simple items, but I havn't seemed to master hanging on with one hand.

However, I wasn't very far along into it when I began finding factual errors -- errors in major categories that easily could have been corrected had the author or editor bothered to check. In Chapter One, for instance, the author claims that Hugh Griffith won the Best Supporting Actor Oscar in 1963 for \\"Tom Jones\\"; in reality, Melvin Douglas won for \\"Hud.\\" (Griffith won in 1959, for \\"Ben-Hur.\\") Later, in a question regarding consecutive wins, the book omits Tom Hanks for his performances in \\"Philadelphia\\" (1993) and \\"Forrest Gump\\" (1994), although the book was published in 1999.

I enjoy this series but more for the descriptions of WWII British life than for the mysteries which are usually quite cookie-cutter and simple to figure out.In this entry, Elizabeth is helping Major Earl Monroe with the mystery of four redheaded soldiers who have been poisoned. There are a few suspects from which to choose, making it fun to guess which is the guilty party.More interesting, Elizabeth and Earl come closer to admitting their feelings for one another. Polly is still trying to get back into the good graces of soldier Sam, to whom she lied about her age.The book ends with two cliffhangers, causing me to look forward to the next book in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brits and Yanks at war","review":"As others have said, I really like this series more for the depiction of life in a British village during WWII than for the mysteries themselves. There are some very good continuing characters: young girls, bumbling village constables, the American soldiers - plus a right old rip-roaring boo-hiss village harridan whom I love to hate!And of course there are Lady Elizabeth, her faithful household retainers, and the handsome US officer in whose presence Lady E practically gives off sparks, heh, heh...I guessed the solution to the murder pretty early on but still enjoyed the book because I wanted to know what happened to the characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great customer support!","review":"I just wanted to say that the parent company, Innovention Toys, was great to deal with.

So if you buy the game, know that they have great \\"hassle-free\\" customer support. I didn't know that customer support like that really existed anymore!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Game if you like Strategy Games","review":"This game is not as complicated as chess but requires higher level thinking when compared to checkers. In fact my seven year old picked it up right away. He enjoys trying figure out where the laser will end up; missing the strategy of the game:). But he and I enjoy playing. I introduced it to my friends and family and they all love it. The games are quicker than chess but require a lot more thinking than checkers. The construction of the game is very good with solid plastic pieces. It comes in a nice case storage spots for the pieces. If you like strategic thinking games that you can play with a friend, in my opinion, you will not be disappointed.

However, They seem ready for game add-ons to challenge them a little more."},{"rating":"2","title":"alignment problems","review":"I have had alignment problems as well, noticable after only five reflections. From what I can tell, it stems from lax tolerances not with the laser, but with the reflective surfaces. The pyramid pieces in particular seem to be built with more angular variation than the others. I plan on calling the manufacturer to see if they have looked into tighter tolerances, or even to see if I could get a couple of replacement pyramids that are dead on. We'll see.Other than that minor frustration, the game is quite fun, and the alignment issues sort of add a little extra fun for us nerd types. I like to try to find which unit is misaligned. But I don't recommend letting your kids do that, because this laser is a class II and can be injurious if stared at.If you haven't noticed any alignment problems, go ahead and get the beam splitters, too. They add to the variety of the game.I feel really sorry for those with misaligned lasers; that would be a game breaker."},{"rating":"2","title":"Khet Laser Game Review","review":"My son-in-law says this is a fun game.

However the quality of the production of the game is really low. Unlike a chess set you would never want to leave this on display the pieces are made of cheap plastic and one of my sphinx pieces broke on arrival. They were quick to send a replacement however.

This is for sure a MUST for everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Concept, Shotty Craftsmanship","review":"Received Khet 2.0 in the mail today, all of the pieces have a indent in them where they were clearly broken off a chain of plastic molding. The mirrors have scratches and dents in them, and one of the lasers is really loose and does not work when pressed directly on, rather one must make a vividly hilarious maneuver with their thumb to get the laser going, inadvertently making the piece fall out of the triangle holster (on the board).

Go figure, I paid what I got for (get it?)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Son loves the strategy","review":"This is a great game that really teaches the concept of thinking ahead. You have to balance between offensive and defensive moves. I only wish more than 2 players could play at once. Our family of four ends up playing little tournaments.

It is well worth it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"laser design ruins the game - opened item sold as new","review":"I was looking forward to gifting this game, but when I got it from Amazon, the game was opened, seals broken. After inspecting the game, found out that the lasers are not aligned properly and lucky if it gets through two reflections. It is a poor design that the lasers cannot be calibrated or slightly re-aligned. It could have avoided countless returns I'm sure. So back it goes - again! Maybe you could be the lucky third recipient of this opened and unusable game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good new idea for a toy, both educational and clever","review":"I think this is both a clever idea, a new strategic game, and educational. Like chess it forces people to think about their move and their opponent's move and to think ahead. It's easy to get started, and the different setups make it easier not to have the game repetitive. If one person already has a sense of angles and the other doesn't, however, it's going to end quite quickly. The add-ons (beam diverter kit anyway) make the game a ton more complex and maybe are required to make the game more challenging for folks that are fairly good with simple angles who are already familiar with other strategic games.That kit may make it too complex for kids that are new to it but it can be used selectively and is not expensive."},{"rating":"2","title":"khet lazer","review":"this is a challenging game for anyone and bought it for my nephew who is into robotics and loves it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good game, with reservations.","review":"An excellent challenging game, though rather tedious to set up.

The problem with Khet is that it's a lot like chess, which has certain traditional opening moves, but with Khet nobody tells you what those are, and unless you're the type of person who really enjoys spending a lot of time just figuring out how to play - as opposed to actually playing - this game will bore the hell out of you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Game","review":"Saw this on a gadget site and decided to purchase it for my brother-in-law.

I have listened to a TON of her music and I can say (i believe) with some objectivity that this is the best collection of her material that I have heard. All of Ms. Simone's albums have at least a couple of interesting tracks but this album is consistent from start to finish.Quite honestly, Nina Simone has a very unique voice that can range from beautiful to shrill often on the same album. She is definately best when her material is slow because when she stretches, it can be quite grating (hey - i'm a fan - just being honest).From the opening Black Is The Colour (of my true love's hair) with Nina holding onto her notes for dear life, there is not one misstep.

I'm your average loose tea, fresh from the source type, and I still love these for their ease and speed while on the go, while not sacrificing a good cup of tea or joe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Darin !","review":"This is Darin at his best! Live! If you enjoy his music, his rapport with audience, don't miss this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bobby Darin: Live From Las Vegas","review":"This is another in the series celebrating the 100th anniversary of Las Vegas and it is one of the best. Recorded in November 1963 three months after Darin's collapse at a Freedomland show in New York, he is under doctor's orders to take off from live performances, so this is an early swan song for him. The act from opening to final curtain is captured beautifully ('in three track stereo' Darin adds)for a proposed album that wasn't released until this series. Ace in the Hole shines, Darin does a great set of impersonations and some folk, Sammy Davis is in the house and gets a rousing cheer, and he closes with The Curtain Falls. A great way to spend the evening - wish I'd been there!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bobby Darin: Live in Las Vegas","review":"As a fan of Bobby Darin, it was a treat to hear him perform in the old Las Vegas. The way entertainment should be in any venue. Because of the 100th Anniversary of Las Vegas, the album will become part of my collection celebrating this momentous event. Don't miss this one of a kind CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"mistakes mistakes mistakes","review":"Differences between the mathematical examples shown and what's written in the accompanying text seem to be a trademark of Fabozzi books. This book is no exception. There were mistakes from the very beginning and, though I am currently only halfway through the book, I have not stopped encountering more of them. The text is reasonably explanatory albeit somewhat elementary but the amount of mathematical errors is astonishing. Difficult to recommend this book unless you enjoy solving puzzles (ie trying to figure out what the correct numbers are, based on the text)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this book a joke?","review":"A book written on \\"valuation of swaps and swaptions\\" is obviously not for the lay man. I was extremely disappointed to go through this book, which seems to be fit for 5th graders. It's a shame that a supposed leading thinker like Fabozzi can write such a shallow, meaningless book. Mr. Fabozzi, please name one practitioner who cares to use this good-for-nothing book of yours. Perhaps a better title for the book would have been, \\"Swaps and swaptions for dummies\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Six Mornings On Sanibel","review":"What a good read!

It is an easy read, and while somewhat predictable, it is still very enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the heck is this?","review":"The fine print on this title says that it's from Allegra Entertainment, copyright 2006. However, based on the washed-out cinematography, poor film quality, low-budget costumes, and portentious narration style, if this was made after 1970, I'll eat the disk. There are no credits or supplemental information of any kind on the disks, and there's no listing for it on the internet movie database, nor can I find anything about it with Google. Does anyone have any idea whether this used to be called something else, and when the heck it was made?"},{"rating":"2","title":"truly poetic writing","review":"I am still under the spell of enchantment of this book. I picked it up by chance at a used-book store going out of business just because I had so enjoyed Lord of the Flies in high school. I don't think I have ever read anything that impacted me so much as the simplicity and painful beauty in Golding's use of the language. This is a book to read again and savour.

Neat little film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than other sets","review":"I disagree with the reviewers that say the division of the songs by themes makes for uninteresting listening. I would much rather here a set like this that sprinkles songs recorded at different times in his career than a set that does everything chronological. Many box sets seem to have a lot of really early material that is often not very good, and later material that is not really good, and the middle discs are the only really listenable ones. Examples are Eric Clapton's Crossroads and Gordon Lightfoot's Songbook. I personally like this style of set much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a big SF reader","review":"I'm not a big SF reader, but I liked the book a lot. I enjoyed the early character development and the scene setting of the planet Xica. I agree with a reviewer about the appearance of Conc. He could have been less mysterious acting and more human. The end was not appealing. I'd never read anything by Foster before but I probably will check out some of his other books. I too would like a sequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"I will spare myself the last twenty pages.","review":"Nothing interesting happens throughout the book. There's almost no action going on except for some childish discussions between a bunch of scientists who stumble around on a foreign planet. And these \\"scientists\\" are really a poor example of human explorers of the unknown. They have as much imagination as the dirt under my shoes. Totally blind for the obvious. In other words, you would never want to meet any of the protagonsits of this story. This is what makes the story extremely improbable and even boring. You wouldn't want to read that book. Spare yourself the 311 pages and read something else instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"this book combines the best of vampire, wraith, and mage.","review":"better than the normal vampire game, this book gives the charaters a new world and a goal to work for. it combines the best aspect of other great white wolf games."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drama-soaked impossibly complicated drivel","review":"OK... for years, White Wolf hints that the East is a big bad place full of big bad vampires... And then they publish Kindred of the East. It's an anticlimax that should never have happened; someone fell asleep at the switch. Between the over-numerous virtues, restrictive societal protocols, uberdisciplines that let a KoE crush an opponent, and an unbelieveably complex system of rules that makes playing next to impossible, this book is not worth the nearly $30 you have to pay for it. Skip Kindred of the East if you can; if not, don't say you weren't warned"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hey, if you can figure it out...","review":"Hey, this book is pretty awesome. The art work is amazing, the concept is very intriguing, and the entire idea of a race of vampires in no way relate to the curse of caine is wonderful. But, my only problem is, i can't figure out the dang thing! I love the fact that there is more to worry about than blood, health, and willpower; but i can't figure out what the heck you do with the rest of it! P'o? Hun? Yin Chi? Yang Chi? Gee, one day i will figure it out, and then i will have a good ol' time.

But White Wolf has gone the wrong way with this one: The deadlier, the better is seldom true. The Kindred of the East are by far mightier than Western Vampires, Mages, Werewolves, Faeries and Wraithes. This might be okay if you stay in system, but forget to play them in crossovers. They'll kill everyone - fun first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Depths & Texture for Kindred in the Far East","review":"Definitely a fascinating entry for the WoD series, and in my mind, a candidate for its own 'line,' rather than just a supplement to V:tM's Western Kindred. Complex, yes -- but reflecting the complex patterns of history and society of the Far East and the philosophies animating these mysterious creatures. If you look at just dots and damage dice, indeed, it is easy to create formidable fighters from these creatures--but there are lots of other opportunities and paths to follow, if you're willing to open your mind to them. It's especially important to remember how crucial \\"setting\\" is to these creatures...just as a lone Ventrue stands little chance of surviving in the Middle Kingdoms, in the West, the Kuei-jin are still making inroads. On a sigular basis, the challenges the West presents should keep these powerful Kindred in check."},{"rating":"2","title":"BRIO Mighty Red Locomotive","review":"I rated 5 stars because it is great train along with the BRIO Battery Operated Action Train; however, both quit running the same day even after changing the batteries 2xs. Hard on a train lover when you have to return item."},{"rating":"2","title":"great battery powered train.","review":"My kids love this train. It has lights and sounds, both in forward and reverse. It definitely adds to the fun, instead of only pulling the train along the track yourself. Couldn't find it in ANY stores . . . ended up getting on Amazon. It was to replace the exact same one we had bought at Zany Brainy many years ago."},{"rating":"1","title":"I thought I could...I thought I could...","review":"Unless your Brio set has no hills, you should expect this engine to have trouble. First, on one of the older bridges, the train was too tall, so we had to remove. Next, like other reviewers I just read, this engine has no power. With brand new batteries, and fresh out of the box, it made it up only one hill (one time) without some kind of trouble. This was without any trains attached!If you're going to have hills w/ a Brio set, you should not use a battery operated engine!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I forgot to mention","review":"I forgot to mention that you need a long thin phillips screwdriver to put the batteries in it since they go under the smokestack, which is something I couldn't find right away & could be a problem if you've got kids jumping up & down wanting to play."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I bought this for my little boy and was very disappointed with this engine. It couldn't pull the other cars and would get stuck at the bottom of the hill spinning its wheels. It was constantly falling off the track around sharp turns. You would be better off with the smaller engines. This is the first trouble I have had with the Brio and Thomas trains."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great addition!","review":"This is a great addition to my son's Brio train set. It is a little pricey, but well worth it. We have had no trouble with the train getting over hills. The smaller, green battery- operated engine, does have less power and would have occasional trouble climbing the steeper hills (like the hill with the basic figure-8 layout). The sounds and lights are a cute bonus.For those having trouble with the hills, you might want to try your track on non-carpeted surfaces. We have found that plush carpet tends to make the track less flat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sharp Looking Engine","review":"This is the only train we have encountered with a \\"reset\\" button underneath which my son finds more interesting than the train itself. Now the bells and whistles go but the train does not. Why in the world did they put that button there when there are already 4 buttons on top? And yes, it does drain those batteries quick!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of there less durable products","review":"I was completely disappointed at how short of a time it lasted in our house with my 2 year old son. It did not make it up the hills and seemed to lose power very quickly. We had purchased the smaller of the two battery powered locomotives previously so I was expecting a little more quality out of this one. I have to say that the smaller engine was much stronger and more durable than the larger more expensive one. We are going back to the smaller one, which lasted months instead of days.

Mollie Kaye is a wonderful writer, and her incredibly evocative descriptions of the sights, sounds and smells of India come from her great love and encyclopedic knowledge of the country and its people.

It's been arranged (by the composer) in to a \\"symphonic poem\\"; a term from the Romantic era of classical music in which the music is supposed to convey a story. What you have then is a long-form piece made up of themes and motifs that will be familiar to any fan of the Kimba TV show. The music was always a major part of what made the show so great. I'm a big fan of Tomita in everything he does, and it's great to have this CD available."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mermaid Park rocks!!!","review":"Mermaid Park was such a fun read. I can't wait to read more by Beth Mayall. The author made me root for the main character and made me feel like I wasnt the only one with teen insecurities re: boys and family. And what plot twists?! You definitely want to read Mermaid Park."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good despite some unbelievable bits","review":"I found this book to be written well with great description but also thought that several situations were pretty improbable, such as a manatee swimming into the swimming tank and Amy's becoming the mermaid queen seemed a little too convenient. Amy's surprise parentage seemed a little unbelievable as well, although I had guessed that her mother had worked at the park after several clues about her affection for mermaid merchandise.Despite this, this book is a good read and I would recommend it! It's filled with summer romance, adventures, and all that can come from a teenager living in a new town for the summer without her family. It really makes you thirst for summer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware of shill reviews.","review":"I'm really getting irritated by publishers, authors and their friends writing five star reviews for their own books.

This is no coincidence.You might also notice that the less than positive reviews for this have a lot of unhelpful votes, too; that's probably the publisher or author at work again.

Pulled paint off, made the wall flex... when sanding off the wall, I had to sand down to the bare drywall to get rid of all of the residue.

It's a very mild, but flavorful coffee with a smooth finish and no bitter aftertaste. I don't like extra dark coffees with lots of acidity, so of that's more your cup of tea, so to speak, this blend isn't for you.I will definitely be picking up more of this blend and if you're in the market for a french vanilla flavored coffee k up for your Keurig brewer, this one is an excellent choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent coffee, but expensive","review":"Excellent coffee, but on the expensive side.

While installing I discovered that the waterspout does not swivel. If I had known this prior to purchase I would probably not have bought this particular fixture. Needless to say that a spout hanging this far over the sink causes some awkwardness and hazard while trying to wash ones face, either by bumping your head or scraping your hands on the spout.

It is as pure and simple and perfect as a reference book can be. That is, simple, not simple-minded.This much lauded illustrated edition, with its simple-minded illustrations, is yet another sad example of the dumbing down of western culture. In Will Strunk's time this sort of treatment, if it existed at all, would have been intended for children below the age of six or seven. It's current target reader is apparently the developmentally challenged adult. While we all sympathize with those struggling with learning disabilities, it is pathetic that such a degradation of a classic work is received with respect.

I'll buy the normal edition. This one is irritating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pleasant illustrations that add little to the book","review":"The illustrations are pleasant, even beautiful at times. I agree, however, with some of the other reviewers who were disappointed because the illustrations add little to the original Strunk and White classic. What is the point of illustrating examples such as, \\"Somebody else's umbrella\\" and other snippets of grammatical examples that in illustrated form are out of context and irrelevant to the book's purpose? Do we really need an edition of Strunk and White for the sake of whimsey? The book is a tool for writers and is beloved for decades for a reason.

However, having examined this particular edition, I can't get past the horrifying error at the top of page 147, in which the spelling \\"principle\\" is substituted for the correct form of the adjective \\"principal,\\" as in \\"main,\\" or \\"chief.\\" This passage is supposedly from the introduction to the book's first edition by William Strunk, Jr., who would have made no such mistake. (It is however a common one, to judge by its appearance in at least one of the Amazon reader reviews of this book).Didn't anyone at The Penguin Press proofread this book?

The VHS version is a masterpiece, featuring 90+ minutes of a smoking hot Allman Brothers show. The DVD is packaged identically (even stating a \\"running time\\" of \\"90 minutes\\"), yet clocks in at 55 minutes. Many songs are abbreviated versions of the originals found on the VHS. The DVD is deceptively (if not fraudulently) labeled. I used to think of the Allman Brothers Band as a band for the common man. After this ripoff, I've vowed not to spend another dime on anything that will earn Gregg and the boys another penny.

It stinks and it sucks. Too much talking, not enough of the concert music and they have shortened to disc.Get the VHS and record it to a DVD. That's what I did. You get the complete 90 minute concert and a video of nothing but music. No comments, no interviews, no interruptions. Warren Haynes and Dickey Betts are GREAT.

How can they claim this to be approx. 90 minutes? It's 55! Anybody that has seen the boys in concert knows that they are hardly breaking a sweat after 55 minutes. Furthermore, it is ignorant to place interviews in the middle of songs. I might play the disc 100 times and never get tired of the music, but I don't need to hear Dickey talk about the naming of \\"In Memory of Elizabeth Reed\\" more than once. Isn't that common sense?

A really classic performance featuring Greg Allman, Dickey Betts, Warren Hayes, Allen Woody and the rest. What a major disappointment with this transer to DVD. While the DVD format gives great color and resolution, there is a deluge of unsavory editing. In the middle of key live performances, interviews are spliced in. (...)But the real travesty is the omission of material from the VHS version, and the rolling of credits while the band blazes on Whippin' Post. This great song is literally cut short in mid-performance. The potential for a great presentation in the DVD format is lost in the editing. The running time claimed is \\"approx. 90 minutes\\", while it actually is less than 60 minutes. Sloppy job Sony!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Buy This DVD!","review":"The songs are edited and cut short. There is an interview over top of one of the songs.

This DVD is a Disappointing Rip Off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get the VHS version","review":"What a major disappointment!!! I have the VHS and was expecting the same only better sound and picture on the DVD, boy was I suprised.

The performances were fine, unfortunately, in those instances I wasn't given the privilage of hearing entire songs. DVD technology allows for re-editing this material so that the interviews are put in a separate menu. I would very much like to enjoy the original concert the way it was recorded, not as a re-issue of the TV program. There is a great opportunity to give the listener something better. Luckily, I was able to return this title because the running time was incorrectly listed on the box as much longer than it really is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing, but the problem could be fixed.","review":"I thought the disc would contain complete songs, but it only has bits and pieces of most. The disc breaks up many songs with interviews. It would have been a perfect opportunity for the DVD authors to do the interviews in separate menus, but have the entire music selections uninterrupted. We would not have the original television program, but something better instead. What was most disappointing is that the Allman Brothers are a great band, and I really looked forward to hearing the music. But, alas, I'll have to wait for another disc to get a real concert.Also, beware, the running time is under an hour, not the 90 minutes indicated on the package."},{"rating":"1","title":"WTF?!?!?!","review":"I've had this concert on VHS for more than a coupla years now.

Interruptions during the music with interviews although I like the interviews put it on a different track (Angle). Most songs were edited so you do not get the complete song, Guitar solos missing, Drum solo cut short, Whipping Post 2 minutes? With today's technology I would have expected better, much better than the VHS. The running time is not 90 minutes I am returning my DVD today. I am a southern rock lover, as well as a Allman fan but this DVD Stinks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Planning for The Allman Brothers, Reissue It Please","review":"I own the VHS version and hoped for an incredible DVD because of my satisfaction with the VHS version. Especially the 5.1 Dolby sound. What a disappointment! When I went to Blue Sky, all I got was interviews with Greg & Dicky with music playing in the background-Blue Sky for all intents and purposes isn't there.

This is a poor production of a great concert. I have the original VHS of this show and it is spectacular. They really blew it with the DVD.I was expecting additional concert footage that didn't make it to the VHS, interviews, extras...Instead we get massive edits, partial songs, songs interupted by interviews.Hopefully the band will have this show re-released properly.

While few movies are worth more than a single viewing, a good music video bears repeating. This DVD is about as bad as they come. Too much talk, not enough music.

Most upsetting is that the closing credits are displayed while the band plays \\"Whipping Post\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not perfect...but damn good!!!!","review":"I really enjoy this DVD..The Brothers play with fire and emotion. Yes there are Interview interuptions(that I could live without...but not as bad as people make you think..most of the songs are not interupted)...but it still serves it's purpose well...like making you want to get up and boogie and play air Guitar with Dickie and Warren.

God Bless Duane, Berry,Lamar and Allen....we miss you guys."},{"rating":"1","title":"What idiot edited this?","review":"It makes me sad when I see somebody making a lot of money to do a terrible job of something. Whatever morons were in charge of the editing decided that the people who buy a concert DVD don't want to hear the actual concert. Blue Sky is one of my favorite songs ever; imagine my frustration when I skip to that track to see 2 minutes of an awesome Blue Sky turned way down in the background while Dickie talks about Statesboro Blues over top of it. Don't buy this, you'll just get mad."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHY!!!!!","review":"The first place I saw footage of this concert was on youtube and let me tell you I was blown away. The allman brothers band perform there best songs. So when I heard there was an official dvd release I was beside myself with excitment, That is until I read the reviews stating that this dvd only shows short segments of these performances intertwined with interviews and all I could think was WHY! why would the people in charge of releasing this do something so completely idiotic. This is a complete tragedy to think that this concert exsist in full on vhs but only in bits and peices on dvd. I can only hope that one day this company will have the common sense to release this in full as it was originally intended."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT A COMPLETE WASTE OF A BEAUTIFUL CONCERT","review":"Shame on SONY's Editors who RUINED this concert with Interviews.I happen to own the LASERDISC version which is the FULL CONCERT, No interviews and i have it on DVD.

As always, the trenchant scholarship and sharp writing shines through.And, as always it seems, the same flaw appears whenever Wright tries to be relevant to the contemporary church: his ideas of Christian social justice are just the most shopwarn cliches of the most warmed over academic leftism imaginable. For example, he decries widespread consumer debt as creating \\"misery for millions\\" and profits for a \\"tiny minority.\\" As if borrowers don't borrow because it is in their interest to do so, and as if lenders would lend without being paid a return for their trouble. To hold opinions like this means being totally ignorant of modern economics. It is one thing to take every thought captive for Christ - another to indulge foolishness. Remember Mark 7 - folly is sin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerous","review":"While I appreciate Wright's defense of Paul as a faithful expositor of the teaching's of Christ, his book, as with all Covenantal Nominism undermines the gospel of our Lord.Justification is indeed about how one is saved, not merely who is included in the covenant. While Wright brings helpful insight into the mind of a 1st century Jewish convert, he overstates his case by attacking the orthodox and historic Christian understanding of justification by faith apart from works. Serious consideration of Romans 5 is not given in this book, and the Lutheran/Reformed/Evangelical understanding of justification as the foresnic imputation of Christ's righteousness to undeserving sinners is scoffed at as unscholarly.But nothing could be further from the truth. Those who do get this book, I must recommend you also purchase \\"Counted Righteous in Christ\\" by John Piper, and exegetical defense of the orthodox understanding of justification."},{"rating":"2","title":"N.

Most of the pages tell about what \\"Daniel\\" doesn't do - or points out negative behavior. Why not make the message using positive behaviors? I think it would be more encouraging and more interesting if a more positive attitude were taken. For instance - \\"Daniel does not put his fingers in his mouth or up his nose.\\" That spreads germs!\\" says Crots.

I don't know what happened, maybe its three years or fighting with labels, or spending all that time in NYC being [mad], but these guys have evolved and grown up to make one hell of a CD. The songs display so much more emotion then \\"lets get it on!\\"The riffs and vocals also seem to be more complex and angry. It was full of complex vibes, both releasing sorrow and anger, unlike the more \\"let's party\\" vibes from \\"lets get it on\\".The Step Kings seem to be very underrated for their talent. \\"Three The Hard Way\\" is definitely an album to check out for anybody who is a fan of hard rock and is board with what's mainstream."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaks at random","review":"This is my least favorite cup that we have tried.

It's been a wonderful transition from sippy cups to open lid cups for him, specifically when he's running around the house with liquids other than water.It comes apart easily and washes great in my dishwasher. I've never had any issues with reassembling the cup either.I do wonder what it is that makes these leak sometimes. I have never had any troubles with it, but sent it with my son when he went to the grandparents and they had major leakage issues. Maybe it's because I always screw the lid on with it in the closed position, so the liquid isn't drawn up the straw? Not sure, I'm not very good at science or physics, so I can't say what it is that I'm doing \\"right.\\" Perhaps someone else can give a clue as to what is causing this cup to leak for some people?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Deeply spiritual, and deeply real","review":"I am not a person who digs \\"gospel\\" music, but what Johnny Cash does on this album is like something right out of the Bible; a man who has known darkness and sin telling you \\"My God Is Real\\" and \\"It Was Jesus\\", \\"The Man In White\\", who saved him by His \\"Redemption.\\" He makes the oft-overdone \\"Swing Low Sweet Chariot\\" an earnest pleeding to Heaven, and \\"Cowboy's Prayer\\", \\"Why Me Lord\\", and \\"The Old Account\\" are sung with a fervor that sounds autobiographical.In an age where \\"Christian\\" Rock is increasingly making waves, people need to give far more heed to albums like this!

The earliest song is from 1957 (one of the few religious songs he was allowed to record for Sun Records) and the most recent song is from 1996 (his second American Recordingsalbum).

With so many songs previously that dealt with spirituality, Johnny Cash goes back to his original roots with some old hymn songs and some songs that he wrote himself. Obviously, the overall theme is \\"God\\" and Cash sings with the emotion that we have all grown to love.

Some of our cases involve members of the Islamic faith, many of whom are first or second generation Americans. This book has helped me better understand how their normally peaceful religion has been hijacked into what we see today, with a heavy discrimination against women and people outside the Islamic faith. According to this biography, Muhammad taught religious tolerance and respect for all God's creatures, and he held eminent respect for women, included them in important work and often consulted them. I enjoyed the book immensely, but more than this I found a deeper appreciation for one of the world religions that is so little understood here in the US."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deal with the real","review":"The hadith in this book is fictional.

However, I was MAJORLY DISAPPOINTED.It is yet ANOTHER novel that is not needed for this story. There should have been only 2 books in this storyline. Once Maltz and Carol Marcus were gone (I'm not even going to whine about Saavik not being in this story!), then it should have ended nicely.This novel seems very forced! \\"Let's mix in all the characters that were introduced in the earlier books, so we can call it Genesis!\\" There is NO EXCITEMENT and NO INTERESTING SUBPLOTS. I skipped through most of the story to only see how Picard's team handled this new adventure.Save your money, folks!

If this book is typical or considered fine, I'm glad I haven't read more. The characters were flat, much of the dialogue bland - and this based on characters with rich, complex development from TV! I realize that authors' have limited liberty to work with the main characters from the series, but numerous times I nearly set the book aside out of disappointment. Spoiler Alert! Quick - how do we save Deanna from the monstrous serpent? How else: her empathic powers convince the beast \\"We are friends from long ago.\\" Books such as this serve best as a bad example: here's how you don't do it.

The first two books in this series did a fair job of telling an interesting story resurrecting the concept, but the concept itself was already a moldering corpse even then. Book three had unquestionably passed the saturation point, and only a very well-told story with some very interesting characters saved this book from being a total waste of time and space; if the concept hadn't already been thoroughly played out, it would have been worth four stars, almost five. As it is, it ALMOST persuaded me to give it a third star, but I'm afraid that doing so might encourage the author to keep more \\"Genesis\\" stories coming.

While I am glad to have learned something about the events depicted, I felt that the presentation was substandard. The subplots were pointless and distracting, the writing was almost juvenile, the characters were unrealistic and one-dimensional. Everything was black or white -- the participants in the rebellion were demi-gods fighting a holy war, the English and their sympathizers were the personification of evil.

Start out on the decks of the Titanic, add a scandalous affair between a priest and an abused wife, force the hero to chose between the stuffy beauty and the golden hearted prostitute, add lots of arguments, and conclude with gunfire. Sound familiar? 1916 was a great concept. The poet warriors' futile battle with the British could have spun like Braveheart, but it became a very slow- moving Gun Fight At The OK Corral."},{"rating":"1","title":"Historical accuracy cannot overcome this poor novel.","review":"Although it is interesting to read about the historical background of the figures in the Easter rising, the contrived plot and relationships are outrageous. It's bad enough that the news media loves to publish every story about wayward priests, but please spare my having to read about it from an Irish author. Then the choice between the snooty girl and the prostitute just kills me. I would have expected much better than this. Trinity by Uris is far more realistic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Valid History wrapped in Incompetent Fictionalizing","review":"Mr Llywelyn may very well be a very thorough historian, as is evidenced by his intricate knowledge of Irish culture and hardships of the turn of the century, but he fails miserably to bring these events to light within the context of a third person narrative. The biggest single problem with 1916 is in the loose characterization. For instance, the protagonist, a fifteen year old Irish boy, is privy to insights into human nature that most very mature adults have no clue about. At one point, Llywelyn states that Ned (the boy) cringes each time he sees a particular character because he senses that the brightest candles burn out the quickest. This thought is occurring to a lad who just months before was daydreaming of pirtates attacking the cruise ship he was on. Oh yeah, did I mention that the ship was named the Titanic? If not for the gross inaccuracies in character response and interaction this novel may have been enjoyable as well as informative."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost good history in a trashy novel","review":"I am not as familiar with Irish history as other readers of the book and I was looking forward to learning a great deal. I worked hard to pick out the history between the unfaithful wife, the priest, the prostitute, etc. Why did Morgan insist on writing it this way? Was it to pander to the masses? If so -- and that's OK -- why bother being in the historical fiction section. why not just go for the steamy romance section of the grocery store?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful","review":"If tortured prose is to your taste, by all means pick up this exemplary model of how to bore a reader to tears with forced, plodding, contrived exposition.

While her historical research is solid (and documents with brief footnotes), the story itself is contrived--full of cardboard characters who seemingly pop up at every important event during the period in question. The book itself amounts to little more than a soap opera, and a badly written one at that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rising Needs no Embellishment","review":"I had high expectations when I bought this book. I had heard good things about Morgan and was excited about reading something about the Rising that added some drama, unlike the strickly factual interpretations I have read in the past. What I learned from reading 1916 however, is that the Easter Rebellion needs no dramatization or embellishment. The Titanic, a broken priest, a prositute heroine, are things that simply detract from what is one of the more telling stories of modern times. The book wasn't completely without merit. The truths it did decide to deal with, it dealt with accurately."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great characters, great story, great historical backdrop.","review":"Llywelyn's characters, real and fictitious, came to life as breathing, feeling, genuine people whom I found interesting and sympathic. It's the best book about turn-of-the century Ireland that I've read yet. Two compelling stories collide at the end of the book -- a great plot. The first pages grip you as you learn, through the account of the main character, about the lives of the people who lost or were lost due to the sinking of the Titanic.

Unfortunately, while the Disney movies are age appropriate, some of the on TV questions still require the game player to be able to read.

When I first heard this album a couple of months before it's release, I was converted. I was literally distressed about having to wait for it to come out. Now it's here. I must recommend this album to anyone who wants emotion and depth in their music. Rob Dickinson's voice is so expressive and even a little spooky sometimes. The first track, \\"Sparks are Gonna Fly\\", is an alt-rock assault and then you're plunged into the odd \\"Gasoline.\\" From there it's quiet and loud at the same time and a little hard to describe. My favorite has got to be \\"All of That\\". For me, it's a personal anthem of self acceptance and it's strangley beautiful.

Anyway, CW's last album \\"Wishville,\\" (released five years ago!) provides no thrills. Let's face it - after \\"Ferment\\" and \\"Chrome\\" the band started on a precipitous slide, ending up on the bottom with the tepid \\"Wishville.\\"For my money, there are four decent songs on the album (each of which are blown away by almost all of \\"Ferment,\\" and most of \\"Chrome\\") namely \\"Sparks Are Gonna Fly,\\" \\"Gasoline,\\" \\"Lifeline,\\" and \\"Mad Dog.\\" All of the rest are forgettable throw-aways.

Now it appears that CW are trying as hard as they possibly can to appeal to the mainstream masses by releasing an album containing one uninspiring guitar song after the next.To think that this was the band that use to bring us classics so perfect and so beautiful as \\"Heal\\", \\"Delicious\\", \\"The Nude\\", \\"Texture\\", etc., etc...... Only the anthemic \\"Gasoline\\" comes anywhere close. Don't get me wrong, Catherine Wheel are one of the most overlooked bands of the 90's but if you really want to hear the true Catherine Wheel, toss this and check out Ferment, Chrome or Happy Days."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Wishville\\" doesn't live up to expectations.","review":"I have to disagree with most of the reviews on here about \\"Wishville.\\" This album is really not very good, especially considering how talented the band is and how amazing their previous five albums are. First off, the album is too short...only nine songs. Second, not a single song is very catchy or remarkable. None of them would certainly have made the cut for the band's previous two studio albums of new material. Buy this if you're a fan, but if you're new to the band, pick up the excellent, rocking \\"Happy Days\\" (my personal favorite) or the excellent \\"Adam & Eve,\\" which showcases all sides of the band better than any of their other albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"skip it","review":"Don't waste your time with Wishville...your time and money is better spent on Ferment and Chrome, and even the B-sides Like Cats and Dogs...and if you can find it, the Show Me Mary single with the tune \\"Smother\\" on it...amazing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacking the strength and imagination of the past.....","review":"First of all, I would like to say that I am a huge Catherine Wheel fan, and appreciate Catherine Wheel's music for its sincerity, emotion, and dynamics. However, Wishville shows that Catherine Wheel's ideas appear to be running slighty thin. The atmospheric rock of Chrome, the hard edge of Happy Days, and the cohesiveness of Adam and Eve are nowhere to be found here. Instead, there are just 9 songs, almost all of which go along at a sleep-inducing pace. Overall, I was extremely disappointed with this effort, primarily because there is no other band out there like Catherine Wheel, and for this very fact, I was expecting a lot better."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you're looking to know The Catherine Wheel","review":"then this is your album of choice. A distilled, concise offering of what The Catherine Wheel are known for - emotive melodies, entrancing rhythms, and infectious lyrics. WISHVILLE is at a level that so many bands aspire to, not to mention an incredible production and mixing job which you've got to hear to believe! After cutting your teeth here, though, be sure to undergo other Catherine Wheel treatments, since each album is a completely independant, yet equally inspiring, piece of artwork."},{"rating":"1","title":"Et tu, Catherine Wheel?","review":"How did a band that produced such a magnificent cd like \\"Chrome\\" or such a sublime song like \\"Black Metallic\\", suddenly start to sound like Bush (and, trust me, this is not meant as a compliment)? Despite this very uninspired power-chord-laden \\"Wishville\\" effort, I urge you to explore the \\"older\\" works of this amazing band and see how brilliant they can be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insecurities and Fears Revealed","review":"Catherine Wheel's Wishville strikes a nice balance between the laid-back momentum songs found on Adam and Eve and the hard-driving songs from the classic Happy Days CD.I think the reason most Catherine Wheel fans don't like this CD is because of the weak opening tracks Sparks Are Gonna Fly and Gasoline. But the outstanding tracks (Lifeline, Idle Life, What We Want To Believe In, and Ballad Of The Running Man) make this an exceptional recording.The lyrics are singer Rob Dickerson's most personal and revolve around his insecurities and fears (\\"I am delicious. I am crap\\" - All Of That).Also of interest is the Storm Thorgerson album artwork reminiscent of Pink Floyd's Ummagumma.[DW]"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mad Dog should have been the single","review":"Didn't anybody have ears when it came time to choose the leadoff single for this album? Granted, lifting track 7 as the first single is a bit odd, but \\"Mad Dog\\" was THE hit on this set, and completely got ignored. This would have gone to radio, but the powers that be chose the stuck-in-neutral opening track \\"Sparks are gonna fly\\" as the first single, and it quickly tanked. A pity. The album basically got ignored as a result. But my favorite track has to be \\"Ballad of a Running Man\\". This is an incredible track, worthy of many repeated plays. Other gems include \\"Idle Life\\" and \\"Gasoline\\", which was the second US single, which also got ignored."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not at their best","review":"Not much to add to the other reviews except to agree that it is by no means their best album. Not wishing to offend anyone, it seems to me that their sound is becoming more american - I suppose your environment influences you as a writer/composer and as the band have made the USA their home it was bound to happen. I just feel like that they've lost an edge that Chrome and Happy Days had, but I've still got them to listen too and as as with many of their albums I guess it'll grow on me as I didn't like Chrome to begin with - and eventually I had to replace the vinyl as I'd worn it out so there you go. Still a fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceeds my high hopes","review":"This is a powerful, melodic, hard-driving, soft and lovely at times, well crafted, intense record. I have found things to love in each Catherine Wheel release, this one included. Only disappointment here is the 40 min length. These songs are rich, layered, emotional, good lyrics, fantastic guitar & drums, Rob's amazing voice is a highlight. Some songs charge with energy, others have quieter sides, all are irresistable and moving. I don't know how this can be topped as one of the best of the year."},{"rating":"2","title":"CONVINCING!","review":"I was eager to get the new THE Catherine Wheel album, but anxious as to if it would live up to the standard set by Adam and Eve. Well, they did it again. Instead of churning out Adam and Eve Part II, they recaptured some of the energy from Happy Days and made THE Catherine Wheel alive again. The best part is I get to see them in concert at the end of the month at my FAVOURITE venue, The El Rey. See you there!"},{"rating":"1","title":"An Absolute Waste","review":"This album is an absolute disaster. There is only a modicum of worthwhile talent displayed on this album. This album is so far removed from their former glory days that you have to ask what happened? Anyone remotely interested in \\"The\\" Catherine Wheel would do well to look to prior albums. this one is a complete waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Collapsing stars","review":"Wow, this one just hurts.Amazing band, simply stunning in concert, and now this.I hope they'll rebound. Stranger things have happened. For the moment, though, this stands among the most disappointing releases ever by a band that has had so much to offer in the past.\\"Sparks are Gonna Fly\\" and \\"What We Want to Believe In\\" are the only songs which led me to give this album even two stars, and even those decent tracks are but an echo of their predecessors.When your B-side compilation is more inspiring than your new release, you know you're in trouble. So it is with Catherine Wheel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible ending for a great band.","review":"their last album, released in 2000 on columbia, is simply terrible. i know there are people that like it, but to me it sounds like a collection of b-sides from collective soul and better than ezra. crummy songwriting, their bassplayer leaving, & boring riffs = crappy album. coming after the career (and 90s) peak of 'adam and eve,' this sounds doubly worse. a sad swan song for one of the best bands of the 90s."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gravely dissapointing...","review":"This is not the Catherine Wheel I listened to in high school.Not the Catherine Wheel whose brilliantly shoegazer lyrics mesmerized me and inspired me.Not the Catherine Wheel whose songs like Texture, The Nude, Black Metallic and Crank commanded me to go out and buy their music.\\"Wishville\\" is disappointing because you can tell that CW took some bad advice from someone at their record label, because if you didn't know better, you'd think you were listening to a Bush album (no offense to Bush, though). The lyrics are dull, the music is bland and just overall not a pleasure to listen to.I own thousands of CDs, cassettes and albums. This is one of the only CDs I have ever taken back to the store for a refund after purchasing it.Shoegazers, stay away from this one. End your CW collection with Happy Days."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Radio","review":"Works good now. Had to send it back. (No Modulation) Standard fixed it quickly.

Excellent case, looks just like your average hard pistol case you'd get with a purchase of a new pistol or like the ones they have on the shelves at gun stores."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Case!","review":"Excellent case. My 9mm Beretta 92FS fits perfectly in the case. Has a place to put your own lock for security during transportation. Highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Badly warped unusable item","review":"The body of the case is caved in on both sides of the plastic interlocking hinge, which never was fully assembled and can't be forced together. Why this item was ever partially assembled and passed on for sale, I'll never know. Pure junk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid and soft","review":"Solid on the outside, soft on the inside. Holds my 9mm, 2 clips, thing of snapcaps, hearing protecion, and multitool all safely. 1 star off due to the location and size of the holes for a padlock. pretty much unusable location for a guy with large hands."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good case","review":"This is a great case for a semi-auto or revolver. I use it with a Ruger 9mm. It easily holds the pistol and 2 clips with just enough room to spare. I can close the case and shake it and nothing moves inside.It has a spot for a small lock which would be effective to keep children out, but that's really the only use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ok Case","review":"I got this to store my new pistols, it does come with a loop latch that you can place a small padlock on to lock the case, while it does the job, it does feel a little flimsy in the hand but i have had no issues with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Value in a small package.","review":"I was searching for a new case to hold my gun in at home bedside, as well as take to the range. This was exacyly the item I was looking for. It's capable of holding my loaded SA XD40 Service fully loaded, as well as 2 extra fully loaded magazines. The hole for the external lock on the case is small so you will need a smaller lock. I found a good lock at the $.99 store and it works just fine. This case is rugged enough for your day to day activities at home or on the range I would recommend this product to anyone needing a single gun case. Also saw recently that they have these for the $10 at Bass Pro Shops as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good case and foam for the price.","review":"I bought this case locally at a sporting goods store for $11. I store an airsoft pistol in the case and it fits in a small drawer. The foam inside makes for a tight fit. I may carry GPS and camera in the case too on a future trip if need be. This thing is cheap and if it doesn't last a year carrying various items, it's only $11. If you have more valuable items or need a locking mechanism or water resistence, you may want to look at a pelican case."},{"rating":"1","title":"rip off","review":"I went by the reviews and bought this.

Really can't say much more than that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good item for the price.","review":"If you are looking for a hand gun carrier, this would be it. 4 guns fit with no problems, however, no room to carry anything else. You can't beat the price for what it does."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great case for the price","review":"I just needed a couple of cases for my Colt Commander and Walther PPK. These cases worked great. I was able to put a pistol and spare clip in each case and it worked great. Exactly what I was looking for and in a great price range!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great case for the gun range","review":"My Springfield Armory XDm 9mm (4.5\\") came in a huge gun case because it came with a bunch of accessories. I wanted a smaller case that I could fit in a gym bag for trips to the range. This case fit the bill perfectly. I had ample room for the gun and two magazines inside and I could probably fit two more magazines in there if I wanted to. The clasps seem pretty secure. I was initially concerned that the parts might slide around and rub together while the case was closed, but after I tried it, I realized it wouldn't be a problem. The foam was such a tight fit around the gun that the case actually bowed out slightly on both sides, so I know it's a tight fit inside. This isn't a super sturdy case, but it's perfect to use while transporting to/from the range. Great value for the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well... its a case","review":"It protects whats inside quite well with foam, and is a rather solid case, that is why I did not give 1 star.Unfortunately, with both ends locked, you can still pry the front of the case open quite easily with just your hands, and get a full size pistol out of the case effortlessly. Maybe if the locks were closer to the corners or handle. I guess if I want this to work I'll have to buy a 3rd lock to put around the handle. I'll just get a new case..."},{"rating":"2","title":"For the price, you can't beat it","review":"Ten bucks with free shipping available for a pistol case? Sure. This thing is sturdy and easily fits a handgun and maybe a clip or two, depending on the size of the weapon.

The case is good quality and protects my gun two and from the range. A must buy for avid shooters!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Plano Single Pistol Case","review":"This is a very well constructed case for holding anything, i use two for my pistols and one for my camera. The foam is thick, but not crushing the item. The latches are secure and the items stay in place during travel. Also if you look around the edges on the inside of the case there is a space for a o-ring rubber seal to make it waterproof, overall terrific case for the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great buy!! =)","review":"I bought this for my newly purchased 1006 S&W 10mm. Holds the gun along with 2 clips. Enough room on all sides there shouldn't be any problem. I would recommend to anyone and will purchase more in the future. Great price for good protection of your fire arm."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful, strong pistol case","review":"I bought two of these. One for a .32 S&W and the other for a Taurus PT-92 AF 9mm.

Protects your weapon at a very affordable price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice affordable case","review":"First off, I want people to know that this case isn't the quality of a Pelican case, but it's also nowhere near the cost of a Pelican case. For the money, this case serves my needs very well. It is well constructed. The hinges seem sturdy, as do the latches. It has provisions for a padlock which is always a plus. The foam fits the interior very well. For less than $20, you can't go wrong with this pistol case. It's plenty large enough for a large-frame handgun or even two small-frame handguns.If you're looking for airtight/watertight storage for your pistol(s), buy a Pelican case. If you're looking for something to carry your pistol(s) to the range while also being able to lock and store them at home, look no further than this case. The Plano company has been around for a long time and it's because they generally make quality, affordable products. I give this case two thumbs up. If I had three thumbs, it would get all three."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works for what I need","review":"This case fits my Glock 21 without any problems along with its 3 mags.

The games themselves also have a very low budget \\"feel\\" to them. The whole thing is junk. As a result, I decided I will never buy any vtech product again, phones included, and have not since. Too, bad, the toy had potential to be a good learning tool."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Product, Awful Service From AMazon","review":"The product itself I can't complain about, considering, I haven't gotten it yet, Thanks to Amazons awful service. I ordered this on November 10th. 10 days later they tell me the order is delayed, and it will only ship after December 25th. 1 Month Delay. Cool. Does it get better? Yes it does. I continue looking into it. They tell me, their only shipping it on APRIL 21st!. FIVE Months delay!? No thanks, you lost your money and your customer, this is ridiculous."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost Perfect","review":"The n800 is a very powerful hand gadget. It is NOT a replacement for a laptop or desktop, but can do almost everything a pc can do. Thanks to the open source OS there are updated OS's periodically to upgrade to. There is also a lot of home brew/ported apps that can be used. One favorite app is pidgin IM to keep in touch with friends, and Erming which syncs google calendar and GPE calander on the n800 and can display upcoming calender events and to do's. The internet is a 9/10, only because the heavy flash sites can bog the browser down(but at least it has flash & external speakers..Ipod hmmph). Web pages are REAL web pages and can zoom in and out. Also there is a tweak to make sites think you are on a iphone browser and display them is an iphone would. There is too much to say what it can do, but I suggest you get one."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 Units Both Unusable","review":"The first unit I received failed to boot. I am now on the second unit and the wireless module has failed. I bought this to replace a Dell Axim.

I really wanted this to work but it has been a disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked it","review":"I bought the Nokia N800 Internet tablet because I didn't want to carry my lap top on my recent trip to Taiwan and Hong Kong. It has served me well during my travel. I used it to access my Emails, handle my stock accounts, lookup any info on the internet while I am traveling. 50% of the time I could not get the wifi connections while on the road, except when I am in a coffee house, but I am sure this situation can be improved over time. While in the hotel I used a travel router which allow me to connect to the hotel's etnernet system. I also used the Skype for all the outgoing calls which saved me a lot of money. I thought by letting it to hibernate would save the charge as if I actually turning it off, but looks like I was wrong. I need to do more test on the definition of working mode vs standby mode."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nokia N800 Internet Tablet","review":"I bought this a couple of weeks ago and have to say I am really pleased with it.An added bonus is that as its Linux under the hood you can get a reasonable amount of software for it and Nokia have bundled an application manager tool with the system that makes it really easy to install new software and ensure its kept up to date.Does everything I wanted it to do!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great device","review":"Amazing product, crisp display, good touch screen, steady build, small but powerful, Wifi reception very strong"},{"rating":"2","title":"Where does this fit?","review":"The Nokia N800 is an engineering marvel.The screen is very good. But, it is obviously smaller than a notebook.The on-screen keyboard is surprisingly good. But it is obviously not as good as a notebook (my bluetooth keyboard is even better than the on-screen, but still not as good as a notebook).So, the dilemma is when do I haul the notebook and when do I use the N800?After analyzing my personal needs, I've decided that if I'm off on a 5 day+ business trip, I'll take the notebook. If it's less, I'll take the N800.I'm not the type that needs to be connected 24/7. So, if I go out for lunch or Starbucks, I only take my cell phone. But if I'm gone for the day (hasn't happened yet) I'll take the N800. I've played with it and I have no doubt it will function perfectly in that role.And the community of people supporting the N800 seems to hold promise of more and more applications, some of which might be the killer apps that would cause me to never leave home without it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't turn on - piece of junk","review":"Don't touch this piece of junk! It won't turn on reliably. Do a Google search on \\"N800 won't turn on\\", to see all of the grief N800 users are having with this. It's a known problem with the N800, and Nokia won't do a thing about it. People are having to remove the batteries and even put it in a fridge to try to get it to work! I have two - one I bought for myself and one I bought for my wife as a gift. Both have this problem. Once you turn it off, you can't get it to turn on again. Don't buy an N800 until Nokia fixes the problem!"},{"rating":"1","title":"defective screen as described by previous owners","review":"The good:* Ordered last Saturday and received it today(the following Monday) for standard ground shipping* Wireless connection is very smooth.* Most websites are displayed properlyThe bad:* The right side of the screen display is distorted and darkened.

That and of course, if I don't like the way a piece of software works, I can go get something else. The web end is really great, all the google products (gmail and maps, mostly) I use work fine. That and wikipedia make this thing the coolest since sliced bread. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"There is a limit to small","review":"Overall I like the N800. It does most of what I want a computer to do. The browser allows me to do virtually all of my online business without having to fire up my desktop. The WIFI connection is solid and connects everytime to my Linksys router at home. I have used the Skype software and like the idea of being able to call out from any accessible WIFI connection.There are two pieces of software I would like to see added. One is a personal financial application to keep track of my financial accounts. The other software I would like to see is calendar with the ability to schedule appointments."},{"rating":"1","title":"Akward","review":"Sent it back for a refund. Very akward, too small to read, does not work well with my blackberry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"When I bought the Nokia 800 I was looking forward to easy access to the internet (as they advertise) and was especially interested in being able to get video streaming from some websites I use frequently with my regular desktop PC which, by the way, is set up for wireless. What I found was that the 800 was not as easy and compatible as they claimed. Internet connections were intermittent and video streaming was non-existent. At one site I connected to, I was informed that I needed Windows Media 9 or better for video streaming. When I called Nokia Support they told me that the 800 does not have Windows Media and that if I downloaded it into the device, it could not handle Media Player 9 or better. I'm not a technology whiz and maybe others with more experience could have a better outcome but for me, this product is a dud."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent product; BAD BAD RITZ CAMERA","review":"I ordered this product from Amazon. I have used them before and trust this site. Unfortunately I noticed during check out that it was through a reseller Ritz Camera. It has been VERY difficult to get my money back from Ritz. In the end Amazon stepped in to save the day. But they shouldn't have had to.The product is ok, had a hard time finding and getting 3rd party software to work. I purchased a Ipod Touch instead.If you buy this DO NOT GO THROUGH RITZ CAMERA"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lipeäkala For the Soul","review":"I've had this product for two days and, so far, I like it a lot. I bought it mainly to use as a voip phone. Out of the box, it worked well until I turned it off for the first time. After that the wireless stubbornly remained off, no matter what the setting. Then I upgraded to OS2008 so I could load Skype and everything's been fine ever since. I've made a few phone calls on different networks and the call quality has been fine. Battery life is very good. I have no trouble using it with the online applications I earn a living with, so it's a great backup for my laptop. I was happily surprised when I found I could run Pandora but it crashed the web browser after playing a few songs. I might need more memory. Overall, a little pricey but if you buy it as a cell phone killer, it pays for itself in less than six months."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasted Potential: Major HW or Firmware Flaw","review":"The Nokia is a cool looking device with interesting software and UI; though I kept wishing that it had a keyboard. I also had trouble using a BT phone for networking (even though I know the phone I used supports networking). My biggest complaint is that I can't turn on this device on unless I first plug it into a charger. If I'm not near a charger or plug, the device is a brick. The problem continued even after I updated it to the latest firmware. That's a huge quality flaw that's really unacceptable for a mobile device. Enter \\"N800 won't power on\\" into a search engine to find that this is a common problem and Nokia hasn't been doing much of anything to address it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I PAID FULL PRICE & RECEIVED A USED OR RECONDITIONED TABLET!!!!!!","review":"I ordered and paid for a new Nokia n800 tablet. Instead, I was shipped a tablet from the Amazon Returns Center whch means it isn't new. Yes it works but it isn't new and I strongly believe Amazon should issue me a credit. That's not how you do business is it? Please respond."},{"rating":"1","title":"Connectivity Problems = [...]","review":"I really wanted to like this. Its Flash and Opera browser allow me to log onto sites like my bank account and watch vids like on YouTube that I simply cannot do on my Windows Mobile 5 phone. I love the ability to stream Rhapsody , the maipulation of web pages (full screen and zoom) plus the handling of pdfs. BUT I can only enjoy these perks...at HOME where it connects to my wi-fi service. Outside of home it just will not conect to anything, nothing.It will not use my cell phone's modem successfully (HTC 8525/AT&T; network), and it connects to open wi-fi networks but when I try to go open a web page, it gives me a network connection error (red dot that turns green remains red).So basically, it's a tease to me. I love the idea of traveling with this instead of popping open my [...] Mac, especially in certain places. But due to it's lack of ability to connect and no maemo (very un-user friendly) solutions, it's plain useless. I plan to return it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best gadget in 2007","review":"This gadget was reborn with the new OS (OS 2008). The browser does everything that a full browser does, and youtube works beautifully on the new OS. The scrolling rss news feeder in the home screen is an excellent way to get news updates. Another nice thing is the internet radio (an fm radio is also available).There are loads of freeware downloadable software like canola which gives an ipod touch-like experience. I also liked maemopad+, a multi-purpose sketch software."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great product for the price","review":"This is a wonderful little PC that works!

Every girl I know seems to have the wrong idea about sexuality and love because of this movie. The movie focuses too much on extremes-- perfect sex/love and then horrible abuse/murder.

Save your money and rent Fatal Attraction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst movie ever.","review":"Some movies are so bad they're good. This isn't one of them. This movie was the kind terrible that I wish I could undergo selective electroshock therapy to erase any knowledge of its existence. I like all the stars in the movie, but now this movie is going to taint the experience when I see them in future movies.For a movie that faithfully follows a time-tested formula, it manages to tweak everything just wrong. The creepy psycho homicidal maniac isn't an interesting kind of creep. While you obviously hope he gets what's coming to him, waiting until the end of the movie is far too long. And what sort of accent or dialect is that supposed to be?I wish I would have stopped watching before the family dog was beheaded. I wish I had never seen it. Do yourself a favor and don't watch this movie. Especially if you like Reese Witherspoon--a wonderful actress in the right role--you will wish you hadn't seen her in this dreck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mark Wahlberg is great","review":"I'm sorry but those that dis Wahlberg acting are obviously incredibly jealous. He can be charming, macho, angry, wacky, and SEXY.

Nicole (Reese Witherspoon) is very similar to my character. I thought this movie was very realistic and sends out a good message .

I thought she did a great job acting as well as all the other actors and actresses in the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fear is a wonderful and intense phsyco thriller!","review":"Reese Witherspoon and Mark Wahlberg are great in this movie, very convincing. At first, you fall in love with David as he charms his way into Nicole's heart. Then, realizing that he's a lunatic (but a hot one), you wish that Nicole would just see through him and end it!

Not only does Fear have tremendous entertainment value, it could open the lines of communication and prevent a young woman from becoming involved with disturbed people such as this.Recommended very highly."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a very old production","review":"The first chapters are in black and white. The newest car shown in the movie is a '56 Ford. When it progresses to the life of Jesus it changes to color but is very poor in photography and all aspects of production. There must be newer stories of the new testament. Find them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wonders of Alaska","review":"Beautiful scenery and certainly a topic of our interest. Tourist vacation souvenir aptly describes this DVD. The narration fails a professional standard; text clearly read with occasional lapses of grammar with a voice sounding much like a teenager rather than one of a well-modulated professional.

A bit amateurish was one comment I received."},{"rating":"1","title":"Look for better DVDs on Alaska","review":"Most of the reviews of this DVD are positive so all I can say is buy with care. The quality of the images is only fair, though the subject matter is wonderful. There is much repetition, particularly in the humped back whale section.

Just a brief note to let the reader know that you are in for a very special treat when you read Ark. Massive in scope, beatifully written, interesting characters that you really care about and an ending that is fraught with success, tragedy, and hope for the future. Surely a third book must follow. I love a good end of the world story and this is about as good as it gets. Is it dark, yes. Is it happy and sad at the same time - yes.

Is it satisfying and worth reading - double yes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing to say the least.","review":"I am not sure if the 5 star reviewers and I read the same book. I will not go into a lengthy and detailed synopsis of this book. You can read that in other reviews and I feel like I have spent enough of my time on this novel. The premise of this book was very interesting but the character development was non-existent. I was not invested in ANYONE and most of the characters were one-dimensional and the epitome of cliché. I did enjoy his writing style however and you can tell that he did a lot of research to get the science right. I just wish that the ending were better or maybe more fulfilling. I do not think that I will be reading any more of his novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"The ARK That Flew","review":"This is the delightful sequel to \\"The Flood\\", also by Stephen Baxter. Set in the near future, mankind is facing the end of civilization as the world floods and every piece of land will soon be under water. The ARK is a government project to build a special spaceship to take a hand picked group of young people to a \\"near-bye\\" star that probably has a habitable planet orbiting it. From my vantage point there is a lot of solid science in this novel. I also enjoyed the characters as they moved forward dealing with one crisis after another. They are believable as well as likeable. I had a hard time putting it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"lord of the flies in outer space","review":"I'm suprised no one compaired this book to \\"Lord of the Flies\\"...in outer space.But all in all it is a book any lover of hard SF will love. Some reviewers here thought that the warp drive technology was far fetched. But in my opinion what is even more hard to swallow is the launch of the ARK spaceship using nuclear bombs to lift off the earth. I'm I the only one who read this part? To think that the ship itself would not be vaporized by an exploding nuclear bomb right underneath it is pretty far fetched I think. But aside from this, this is a book that is very hard to put down, in more ways than one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfocused, overly long, and dull","review":"I read and enjoyed \\"Flood\\" and purchased this sequel with high hopes. However, where \\"Flood\\" was a page-turner, \\"Ark\\" was a long slog through deep mud.The story branches out into a number of substories that are more filler than anything else, and have nothing to do with the main storylines. I admit that I skimmed the second half of the book, and I'm glad that I did. The payoff was absolutely not worth it.Read and enjoy \\"Flood\\" (which despite what some reviewers have written, has nothing to do with global climate change), but I suggest avoiding this unnecessary sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"A captivating, moving story no library should be without","review":"ARK provides a fine, satisfying sequel to the flood-of-the-world novel FLOOD from 2009, this set in the year 2041 when the oceans are covering the earth.

Anticipating the later country-rock records, yet reflecting the psychedelic era of 1967, the 11 songs on this album are all classics.

His main targets are France (Paris) and England (London).He gives us a biting and cynical portrait of the French: parvenus and bourgeois who make a mockery of 'liberté, égalité, fraternité'.In England, he is confronted with child prostitution in London's Haymarket: a most terrible and moving scene of a child of only six, black and blue beaten, barefoot, who tries to lure him to have sex with her. On the contrary, the Anglican clerics preach a religion for the wealthy and don't even hide it. A most pregnant portrait of the fat and the meagre.A book to recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun to read","review":"I enjoyed reading this book.

I felt that I wanted to read about what Fr. Ciszek went through in the prison camps in Russia before I read about his spiritual journey. His experiences in solitary confinement, interrogation and labor camps for 15 years would have broken most men. He relied on God to help him through those years not expecting to ever be a free man again. It is an amazing story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Robin'sReview","review":"I am nearly finished reading this book. It is an incredible true story. It is a story of endurance and faith. I was moved by the author's own account of his tremendous ordeal and how he managed to survive. He tells his story very simply and with a heart of gratitude. His story makes you appreciate life. You come away feeling extremely blessed. I almost don't want the story to end. I would highly recommend this book. I felt that this man's story was a gift of awareness; it opens your eyes to see the good in life."},{"rating":"2","title":"After reading this, how can I possibly complain about my life?","review":"This book was awesome.

Definitely recommend this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Prismacolor delivers.","review":"Thick juicy color laydown allows for beautifully vibrant artwork, great variety with this collection. Weather you're a fashion designer, interior designer, or just a hobby artist, this set delivers. Be sure to use marker paper to save the lifespan of the markers. Great set for beginners and you can usually find this set for 50% off which is great. The markers life span is pretty decent, I filled 3 sheets 11x17 with black marker for some rough sketches and it still has some juice left.

I absolutely LOVE these markers. They are relatively inexpensive for high-quality art markers, and definitely worth the money. I use these in conjunction with Copic markers and they are a very close match in quality. The only downfall I have encountered with my Prismacolors are the lack of realistic lighter skin tone colors.

I was extremely disappointed. The locket itself is made of cheap, thin metal. The \\"antique\\" effect is just black paint in the creases. It appears as if the locket was dipped in motor oil, but not thoroughly cleaned. The chain is almost as bad. It is very bulky, much larger than it looks in the picture. AND the chain broke seconds after I got it out of the package (although the package was quite nice). To prospective buyers, don't waste your money. This necklace belongs in the garbage can, end of story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Academia in an alternate universe","review":"_The Rebel Angels_ is one of Davies' absolute finest novels, and a personal favorite. Davies, who at the time of writing was headmaster of Massey College at the University of Toronto, chose for the setting of the book that very campus (though all names have been changed to protect the innocent). The book is a lively romp through a sort of surreal parallel world of academia : defrocked monks, gypsy spells, corpulent priests, seductive graduate students, feces research, bawdy medieval humor, and an enormous dose of Davies' wit and wisdom. The book is a real treat."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Songs James Taylor Wishes He'd Written","review":"I found this CD for $1.99 in a discount rack two years ago in Palo Alto, and I bought it on a lark, something I almost never do. Out of the thousands of CD's I own, this may be my favorite. I keep searching for used copies, which I purchase for my friends and family members.Arudel's soaring melodies, coupled with the sincerity and warmth of his voice, command attention throughout his collection of nostalgic narratives. It's impossible to pick a favorite tune, as each is soulful, hook-laden, and the product of impeccable craftsmanship.I wish I could thank Arundel personally for the pleasure he's given me with this recording."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware!!!

Had I seen it in advance, I wouldn't have shown it to them. My kids are 3 and 5. My 3 year old found the movie pretty scary - alligators chase Babar, Celeste's mother is put in jail, rhinos chase Babar, throw spears, fight with swords, launch flaming rocks at the elephant village, etc. My 5-year old didn't find the movie too scary, but spent quite a while after watching the movie conisdering why the rhinos wanted to attack the elephants AND looking for someone to have a mock sword fight with. So, I can't recommend a movie that left one child a bit scared and the other ready to go to battle."},{"rating":"2","title":"great kids movie","review":"what my daughter wanted, she had it for years on vhs.

So disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A perfect hit for kids","review":"This movie, although a bit tough to understand for really little kids, remains firmly in my mind even though it has been about nine years since I have seen it. It teaches kids about the wrongs of slavery, and the idea that even a kid can make a difference. I can't begin to express my sorrow since they've discontinued it, I'm considering writing to the prouducer-type-people. Because if there's anything this movie has taught me, it's that no matter your age, you can still change things."},{"rating":"2","title":"Babar, My Childhood movie","review":"This movie is great for bringing back memories from my childhood.

I had to contort it into a weird angle to keep it out of the way of the gear shift, particularly since if you tap on it in any way it disconnects and takes forever to connect again. A bump in the road will disconnect, a wayward breeze will disconnect. There is no auto scan so you are on your own finding a station and out of all of them not a one was without static. It comes with a hard extender to give you more space, but this only worsens the disconnect feature as now there is more open air for your ipod to bounce around in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better for newer iPod","review":"I have a the 2nd generation iPod and it doesn't fit well for those.

After a trial period with my first car, I went ahead and got a second one for my other car. It is easy to operate and offers good functionality for different positioning.

Its very easy to put together there are just a couple of things you have to put together.

It is far more sturdy than other floats she has tried before. I feel much more secure about her not falling out of this. The other float tilted over to the side and this will not allow that. However, she can dunk her face in the water if she tries, so you do have to be right there to make sure the baby is okay. We have an absolutely blast in this and I love that she can actually \\"splash\\" around in the water. The mesh area also makes for a great place for her pool toys."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Baby Float","review":"Our extremely active son is 15 months and 22 pounds. He did very well in this float and seemed to enjoy himself. We put a couple of toys in front of him in the mesh part so he had something to play with.

He just loves to float around in it. The only thing I don't like is that he doesn't stay sitting completely upright all the time so he is able to put his face in the water if he bobs forward hard. He loves the fact that he can splash the water with his hands and have a few floaty type toys always within his reach."},{"rating":"2","title":"great if you start with it","review":"I got it after I had already started taking my baby to the pool with water wings on.

They are both excellent for my kids. I have used this for four of them in the pool starting around 6-9mo. That said, around 18mo, I have them graduate to wearable floating devices so they can move around freely.Overall, this is very safe since it's impossible for the kids to tip this over. Additionally, this has survived several years and four kids so I know it's durable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what we needed","review":"I read a bunch of reviews when shopping for a float for my 19 month old and this one seemed to fit the bill. He doesn't swim yet and has tubes in his ears, so he can't get water in his ears. This float keeps him above water ( the water is at chest level), I can put his toys and sippy cup on the rings, he can get himself around, can't climb out of it and he's happy. it's easy to just throw the float in the car, no need to deflate. The only drawback is that it's a bit tricky to get my son in and out of the float, but I don't know how that could be fixed. I definitely reccommend this float."},{"rating":"2","title":"Watch your eardrums","review":"I couldn't get any air into this with my compressor, and blowing and squeezing the valves was giving me a headache.

We also tried to use it with a 4 month old (13 lb). The only baby that actually could use it was the 1 year old. The 20 month old kept on throwing himself out of it (he's a monkey anyhow) and ended up not wanting anything to do with the float. The 4 month old was just a little too short and could put her face in water in the seat area. The 1 year old had an absolute blast !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Float","review":"This float is perfect because of the way it sits in the water. My son is able to be a little more independant, but at the same time he's surrounded by the water. Also, we take him to an area where he can wade-its like a walker for the water! We all love it! Everywhere we go, people ask me where I found it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great time at the Lake","review":"We looked everywhere for this float after borrowing one while swimming at the lake with our 11 month old. The nice thing about it is that it provides a safe and comfortable ride while allowing the child to be right in the water and splash around. We can swim right alongside and spin him around or swim underneath to come and suprise him from the other side. We don't have to worry much about the water being too deep because the float is so stable. I would say the only drawback is that while it inflates fairly easily, squeezing all the air out and collapsing the float can take a few tries. I would recommend this product to anyone with an older baby who wants to take their child for a float in calm water."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT SAFE!!","review":"Althought the aspect of being able to splash in the water is what drew me to this float, my 10 month old equally enjoyed the ease of climbing out of the float.

Buyer beware!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This Product Needs to Be Recalled!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I bought this for my 8 month old, and she almost drowned because she can put her face in the water face down very easily with me being right there!!!The mesh fills with water and it is not safe.

When I went to use it my son kept putting his face in the water and choking. Even though this item shows it folds up after each use and just springs open for the next use, you still have to blow it up some and deflate it before you fold it up.

My granddaughter almost drowned. The float flipped over and the weight of the float held her head under water. Even with very short reaction time to flip the float back over, she was terrifed and now is afraid of the water. I threw the Baby Spring Float in the trash. I know it is better than most floation products on the market, but I would rather hold her in the pool, than have her drown."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the price","review":"I bought this for my grandson in our pool, and he loves it. He can just float around and do his own thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"swim aide for baby","review":"I purchased this swim aide because of the product description, the most important being that the baby could touch the water and it wouldn't tip over. I have used similer products in the past, and they DID tip over! Several panic episodes with them. The baby swim float does not tip over! My baby can splash in the netted area between the floats and can easely kick his feet. He paddles all over the pool and can actually play with the other kids because he can go where he wants. Of course you monitor them at all times, but we have had no panic episodes with this product and the baby paddles around like a little duck and happy as a clam. I absolutely love it and so does he!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Purchased for one-year-old and even my three-year-old loves it!","review":"This float was super stable, portable, and fun for both my one-year-old and my three-year-old in the pool.

It was based on some nuances in Greek, which do not matter much. It is very amateurish and shallow in its theological presentation. It is very polemic and shows the theological roots of misunderstanding in Mr. Graves theology: The Churches of Christ and the Worldwide Church of God. Both of which had claims to absolute truth and another claim to be \\"The True Church\\".Mr. Graves wrote this book with a lot of passion, but not much theological understanding about basic systematic theology.

Depicted by Annaud as aggressive and carnal, the Ulams also come across with a certain poignancy, as curious creatures amazed and delighted by the appearance of a flame.

Quest for Fire is simply one of the best movies of all time, with no languages spoken in the movie, it really makes you pay attention, and keeps you thinking.

I believe women are born with the inate sense that they control men with their so called feminine wiles or does he also think that this is something that evolved?

I recently viewed the DVD and was equally impressed again. One of the great things about this film is that the director is able to tell a story without the use of dialogue. The acting alone tells the story, and that is quite a task. The story it tells is interesting and filled with human drama. One of the virtues of this film is that our ancestors are shown to be real humans; they have feelings like us, they react like us, they desire a better life, like us. By the end of the film you realize that humanity and all its aspirations and failings, has not really changed much; the archetypes remain the same, as Carl Jung would say. The DVD is excellent, good clear picture, good commentary, and lots of material on how the film was made. A good movie and good DVD, who could aks for anything more?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Masterful Prehistoric Fantasy","review":"It is very clear that this film is not to depict what we actually know about primative man... and it was the directors intention to counter \\"science fiction of the future\\" with this masterpiece of \\"science fiction of the past\\".The acting, mannerisms, cinematography, music, and scope of this production is lush and yet frightening. It is a work of cinematic art... just incredible to watch and experience.I bought this DVD remembering how much I enjoyed the VHS many years ago and I was astounded at the beauty and clarity of this DVD transfer.

I bought it because the premise was interesting to me. But this movie was so boring to me I couldnt even finish watching it. I literally stopped it, took it out, and put a different movie in. Maybe its because theres no talking in it. The early humans are portrayed more as apes. I have no problem with this as I do believe in evolution, but it just made for a boring movie.

I got hooked on Thursday with their older stuff starting with Full Collapse, then War all the Time, and now this. I feel this is the best CD to DATE from Thursday. It is incredibly emotionally charged, the lyrics are some of the best I have heard, and it is a wonderful change from the previous psuedo-screamo albums Geoff has put together.

To be honest, after listening to it once, I don't have any great desire to listen again, mostly because the sound quality is a big step down from their previous albums. I'm not that picky in my music, but I don't want a band like Thursday to sound like the garage band down the street. Maybe the lyrics are great, but I'm just so distracted by the distinct decrease in sound quality that I can't appreciate the other parts.

Unfortunately, it's not quite what I expected or what I like."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uninspired","review":"Relative to \\"War all the Time\\" and \\"Full Collapse\\", \\"A City by the Light Divided\\" is a huge disappointment. Maybe it's in the production or maybe the songs are simply not as well written, but the entire release lacks the melody and hooks that are prevalent in the earlier material. The Other Side of the Crash is clearly an attempt to build on Understanding in a Car Crash, but without the urgency and punch.

When I can safely compare thursday to U2 or Radiohead, it's probably for the best that I forget they even exsist.But hey, that's just my two cents.

I'm not one of those \\"scene\\" kids who listens to music because I like the lyrics or because the band members look cute in girl pants, but am a musician with an ear for originality and technicality. To begin with, the sound quality is unbearably bad; the cymbals create a flood of distortion that drowns out everything else, except the kick drum which sucks out the sound of the cymbals. Second, the album sounds completely generic, as if they decided to jump on the talentless overfunded emo bandwagon with the likes of My Chemical Romance and Underoath, even though they have dominated their genre for years. There is neither rythmic technicality nor raw emotion nor screaming(or the screaming was so scarce that I didn't notice it at all). They seem to be marketing to a different group: the trendy scenesters who buy whatever is on the Up and Coming rack at Target for $9.99."},{"rating":"1","title":"Help my ears","review":"Yes this album makes me want to set myself on fire.

The album just never seems to pick up the pace after the single, and immediately loses the listener's interest. My advice to anyone who is a Thursday fan would be to: 1) Buy the album--show your support of the band, 2) Listen to it once and generate your own opinion, 3) Type your review on amazon.com, and 4) Put \\"War all the Time\\" back in your player."},{"rating":"2","title":"A City by the Light Divided","review":"Great album. \\"The Lovesong Writer\\" is an incredible song.

Much of the album was written while the band was on tour so naturally, some of the songs are a bit short and the album as a whole ends up feeling like it's over in forty minutes. The album is simply amazing to sit and listen to. I wouldn't be too caught up in the other criticisms about it.

This CD is that raw emotion; this is the blues as performed by someone born into the blues. As quoted (on a CD title also) Fred will tell you \\"I don't play no rock & roll\\".

I think the best description was when he said \\"I dont play no rock and roll y'all. I just play the straight natural blues\\". I cant help but think when he said \\"rock and roll\\" he probably meant what most people call the Chicago Blues. Fred Mcdowell's music has reinvigorated my interest in folk music, particularly from the south. God Bless. R.I.P. Mr Mcdowell!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fitting jacket.

I found it refreshing and convincing.But then I'm going through the book chapter by chapter with a small group, which makes it that much richer.This book is not meant to break new ground.

Tracks like \\"Mission to Mars\\" and \\"Jackie-O\\" are superbly written, and every riff created by S/O is as memorable as the next.

This release, however, was quite disapointing. I can't put to words what's wrong with it. There is still some energy there, but the hard edge is gone. They have progressed I suppose, but their sound has transformed into something I don't much care for. I should give only one star, but I'll give two just because their past albums were so excellent.

Both guitarists compliment each other which is rare and the keyboards are quite strong. Also in the future, stay away from rap rocking because the melodic vocals are the key to the sound.

She also includes a useful list of equipment to take along and some good tips on what to do if you become lost.This book is small enough to take along with you out into the backcountry, but you might want to put it inside a plastic bag if you do so because (unlike some other survival manuals) it's not written on rain-resistant paper.This book does a good job of helping you to learn what you will need, how urgently you will need it, and how you could get it in an outdoor survival situation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too little information to be of significant value","review":"\\"Wilderness Survival\\" is well written and an excellent book to motivate you to study further (and the author encourages this frequently), but as an instruction manual it is severely limited.

After hours of charging the light turns solid, which means the battery is fully charged. I place the battery on the glue gun and the low battery lights up and the gun will not heat at all.

The battery dies in less than 15 minutes at full charge - even when we let it charge for hours. Becuase there is no way to power the gun via the AC outlet, your project has to stop and wait for over an hour before you get a few more minutes of juice. I thought maybe we got a bum unit, but seeing that someone else has had this exact problem suggests this is a common failure of this product. Stick with the tried and true, and avoid ColdHeat."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wouldn't buy it again","review":"Other than the convenience factor, this glue gun is junk. The battery is already losing it's charging capacity, after only four months. I can barely use it for 30 minutes, without recharging.

I selected the book because, having chosen other books on sermon structure, preparation and delivery, I wanted something that would help me find a more tailored Episcopal Church/Church of England approach and which would give me examples of specific content. Despite its age, but it has been updated in the fourth edition, it does help me with content which is much more timeless than delivery, which needs to be suitable for today's congregation.

As a gift to the Crist Child she yields her most treasured possession, a shiny bead tied about the new born king's wrist with a special thread from King Davids robe, a gift from a pack rat travelling with the Three Wise Men. In so doing she experiences Gods love and understands the miracle taking place. The book makes an ideal holiday gift and can be enjoyed by children and adults alike.

I listened once and knew I had found what i am always in search of: an outstanding release that is not well known. Sure, I heard echoes of Big Pink-Jonah wears his influences right on his album sleeve(actually cover)-but this album transcends any derivativeness. I've been listening to it for several months and it hasn't lost any of its freshness. Five stars for a new star perhaps. Can't wait to see these guys in a club setting.

As it was not identified, spent several days tracking down artist to find this wonderful album. The aforementioned song reminded me of The Band and brilliant songwriter Malcolm Holcombe - and I got a major kick out of finding Garth Hudson playing on a song and Jonah covering Malcolm's 'Dressed In White'. The CD is an understated joy - wrapped in moody melodicism and thoughtful lyrics. Jonah's voice has real character (despite the lame description by the Amazon reviewer) and his emotional commitment to the songs is palpable.My only small quibble (and reason for 4 starts) is the sameness of many of the tunes and that the production is flat - plodding, where it needs to push.That aside, this is a rare gem in a sea of sound-alikes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get it","review":"While going to see Susan Tedeschi in concert last fall, we were treated to an opening act that we had never heard of. The sound that Jonah Smith put out immediately grabbed our attention (we usually don't pay a great deal of attention to opening acts), and we immediately went to meet him and get some CD's. I bought 3 copies, gave two away and kept one that Jonah autographed for me. Upon listening to the CD, I was highly impressed that the sound that captivated us from the life performance was captured on the CD. The sound is very soulful, with definate influences from The Band and Van Morrison.As for the CD, this is solid from cover to cover. There is not a single track on this disk that I don't like (which I can rarely say for ANY CD), and the disc keeps finding its way back into my CD player."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless Strategy Guide !","review":"This guide was a disapointment.

It is very funny and clever because of the colorful conversations of a family of 12 kids and two adults. What I really liked about it was how they were always trying to find new ways to make their lives more efficient, by doing two things at once like brushing their teeth while learning a language or shaving with two razors. The only thing I didn't like was how their father died in the end.I also liked the family's car, the Silver Arrow, which managed to seat the kids and the adults.

Even my 11 year old stated there was a *allot of cussing* on this tape. The stories are funny enough without the hard language. This tape/cd has no rating on it.

I am going to buy the book and read it to my son, skipping those parts. I guess when I watched the movie (many moons ago) that language was not allowed on television and therefore we were not subjected to it. I was very disappointed in the book on tape.

It is the humorous story of a mother and father, who is a motion study expert. Together they raise a dozen children. It has funny anecdotes about their real life and all the crazy things they do. The father is always testing his motion study on the kids, and what happens is always hilarious. It also tells about their maritime adventures every summer in Nantucket.

Gilbreth, is an excellent book because is makes people who read it laugh. For example, one time father yells at the people on the sidewalk and calls them funny names. The reason this is so funny is because you don't often see grown men yelling at each other in public. Then there is the time that Lillian bobbed her hair on her own. This is funny because the results are disastrous. This book should be read by all middle-schoolers who enjoy a good laugh."},{"rating":"2","title":"A touching, realistic picture of what we all wish to have;","review":"if only for a moment in our lives.

I have had the same copy since I was 11 yeas old and I am now 24. I have the hardcover edition first printing in 1948.

It is about a family of 12 children the father is an effencicy expert and the mother a psycologist. There are six boys and six girls. it is fun to read about their adventures and the way their father taught them. The book ends when the father dies.

It was easy to read because it had a very good flow to it. I liked reading it because Frank Gilbreth (the dad) reminded me a lot of my grandfather. The book was mainly about the life and hardships of a family with twelve children. What I found was kind of funny was that if one of the twelve children got a cold or strep throat, within two or three days everyone else would have a cold too. Also since Frank was in the military, the family was very organized and had an assembly whistle. Overall in my opinion the book was pretty good and fun to read. I would highly recommend to book to anyone who likes a heartwarming family book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dana is the best reader I think I have ever heard!","review":"This story comes alive with the reading style of Dana Ivey! It is most enjoyable, and I think I've played it till I almost have it memorized. The nuances and subtleties she brings to an already enjoyable book, make her performance of it something not to be missed. She does the male and female voices so well that you will find yourself forgetting that it is a woman performing all the parts. I say performing, because she adds so much with inflection, tone, and timing that it really is not so much a reading as a one woman show. From the baby talk to the gruff Man Of The House, she makes this audio book far more of an experience than simply listening to a book being read. If you like the book, you will love the audio. You will not be disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheaper by the Dozen","review":"This book is about a family called the Gilbreths finding the best way to live. They have 12 children. All these children care for many different things and are different ages.They face many differnt obstacles. This family probably is like yours but maybe a little more funnier. You'll laugh by reading this book. The movie is a little differnt from the book. There are two versions of Cheaper by the Dozen. Reading this book will definately remind you of families and your own family. So if your ready for some laughs read Cheaper by the Dozen. If you liked the movie you'll love the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!","review":"If you enjoy a read that will leave you depressed and unfulfilled on every level, ths book is for you!

But more to the story is the characterization of the brother and sister relationship that is truely sad and tragic.

This is truely a classic to read if you have a brother or sister."},{"rating":"1","title":"Removed from context this book falls flat.","review":"As a modern reader I found the tone of Eliot to not only be didactic but insultingly so. With every nuance so pointed in its intentions the characters and action are devoid of any impact. One cannot help that feel this is clearly a novel that has aged badly for the simple reasons that its very heavy handed message is old hat and obviously the original audience for this novel was one of lower education standards than today. As a simple book written to carry a message this is one of the weaker Eliot novels for the modern audience to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book ever written","review":"Whenever anyone asks me for books I really hate, this one is topof the list. The author digs and deeper and deeper pit forthe main characters. Life gets more and more depressing.For a while this is ok because you are trying to guess howshe'll concoct some sort of sensible ending. Slowly it dawnsthat the characters are never going to get out of the pit, sotheres nothing left to read for. Ending is depressing,pretending to be deep (almost a pun there, for those whoknow what happens), and theres just no reason to read this book.Just to prove that I'm not biased against the author .. Irecommend Silas Marner which is a *good* book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Booooooooring","review":"I'm a senior in high school, and Mill on the Floss was the most boring book I've ever read. Every guy in my English class despised it, and only a few girls liked it. It takes over one hundred pages for Eliot to get started, and she lacks direction throughout the book. Even an experienced reader is left asking, \\"What's your point?\\" It seems as though she tries to say too much (or really never knew what she wanted to say), and it all gets jumbled and garbled into essentially nothing--and she does it all in only 600 pages. If you have to read it for school...I'm sorry. If you're thinking about reading it for pleasure, there are plenty of better books to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Eliot winner.","review":"The truly amazing thing about George Eliot is her ability to make readers not just care, but actually ache for the characters in her novels. The tale of Maggie Tolliver has to be one of the most gut-wrenching in the whole of English literature. Unlike earlier reviewers, I found her trials totally believable, given the time in which she lived -- a time when women had absolutely no rights and were generally at the mercy of their fathers, brothers and husbands. I did not find the fact that Maggie's sense of duty, honor and decency forbade her from eloping with her cousin's fiancé the slightest bit implausible. What is sad is that modern-day readers mistake her nobility for \\"wimpishness.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"DISAPPOINTED","review":"I have been promising myself for years that I would read some of the works of authors like Thomas Hardy and George Eliot. I started out by purchasing Mill on the Floss and was interested in reading about Maggie, her brother, and their relatives. I was very amused as the book progressed and the author, in a very subtle way, described Maggie's aunts and uncles in their narrow-mindedness and snobberies. Somewhere about the time that Maggie ran off and was taken in by gypsies, I became very bored and have not finished the book. I will probably pick it up again and fast-read to the end but I am not in a hurry to do this. The fault is in me, not in the book. In this day and age we readers are used to fast action and it is hard to stick with a slow-moving book like this.Perhaps I will edit this review after I finish the book--which I will do at some time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok, but long!","review":"The story I find quite ok and kind of exiting at times...but George Eliot could have written this book in 200 pages, not 500 (the paperback edition). At times she really creats a great atmosphere with her long explainations and detail descriptions, for an example is her description of the town St. Ogg. But generally her descriptions are way to long and that gave me the feeling that she was trying to hard to create some atmosphere. She simply over did it! If you have enough time and litle pacience I can recomend this read. I will probably hesitate alitle before I read George Eliot again!

Boring, decidedly too long and with a detestable, foolish heroine. Why did Eliot wish to torture her readers?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nicely written, but a bit boring at times","review":"I had to read Mill on the Floss for school, and although I thought it was wonderfully written, I found it hard to identify with Maggie. Her blind love for Tom was understandable to a point, but today's woman would most likely not put up with his scorn and narrow-mindedness. If you don't enjoy reading lengthy sentences chalk full of descriptions, I would not recommend this book. On the other hand, if you like that kind of slow, but interesting reading, you will Mill on the Floss."},{"rating":"1","title":"I just can't stand it!","review":"I loved Middlemarch so thought I would continue an effort to read \\"great books\\" with Mill on the Floss. I'm almost to the end and am considering abandoning the effort. What began as charming and amazing has become an incessant drone of intentional unhappiness and misery. I've lost all patience with the novel and its characters. Reader, beware. If I drew a graph chart, it would start high, then dive downward with only infrequent, tiny pulses upward."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful, grim novel","review":"The Mill on the Floss has one of the most appealing young girl characterss of all 19th c. literature--Maggie Tolliver. The relationship between her and her brother is at once beautiful, horrible, and probably indicative of much that was true for boys and girls in 19th century England. Whenever I read the book (and I've read it a few times), I am again in love with Maggie, delighted with the people around her, and saddened by the heavy events that bring her down. George Eliot doesn't pull punches--when you've read one of her books, you know you've been somewhere else, experienced something powerful"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Mill on the Floss","review":"I have thoroughly enjoyed every George Eliot book I have read.

This is Ella at her peak. Arriving in Berlin, performing at the Deutschlandhallen, this album runs the full dynamic gamut. On the one hand, it contains a subtle \\"Summertime\\" where her melodic embellishments are absolutely inspired. But then Ella, now in the home of Bertolt Brecht and Kurt Weill, decides to fill the set with \\"Mac the Knife,\\" recently made a hit by both Bobby Darrin and Louis Armstrong. When the words come unraveled before her, her improvisation is awe-inspiring. This is directly followed with the definitive live \\"How High the Moon,\\" complete with an 8 minute scat that is unequalled. This reissue is somewhat marred by the presence of two tracks mistakenly thought to have been part of the performance, but which are of a noticeably different character. Nonetheless, amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Only Ella Could Pull This Off!","review":"Only the Queen could *butcher* \\"Mack the Knife\\" the way Ella does on this album, apologize for it and end up winning a Grammy for her efforts. It's a delightful album, not just because of the \\"Mack\\" track, but because it's a chance to hear her give some of her old standards a thorough workout.Buy it & enjoy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The BEST by the BEST!","review":"I cut my teeth on this recording when I was a kid! So glad it is finally out on disc! What a wonderful live recording - cooking rhythm section and Ella having a ball-swinging and singing for a huge European audience. Her \\"How High the Moon\\" has to be the definitive version! Pure improvisational genius, swinging and singing from the heart. Ella's voice makes me smile!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A show stopper","review":"Fitzgerald brought down the house with this brilliant recording of a 1960 performance. I normally am not a big fan of my parents' era of music, but she is one of the most amazing singers I have ever heard. Her vocal range, intonation, phrasing and ability to scat sing are all astounding. She could teach a lot of today's divas (Mariah, Celine, Whitney, etc.) a thing or two. This album would be a perfect introduction to Ella Fitzgerald -- I see now why people call her the \\"First Lady of Song.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Live From Las Vegas Review","review":"I highly recommend this CD to everyone who remembers when these Artists appeared in Las Vegas and around the country. The songs keep your foot tapping and aside from being very enjoyable, consider the songs on this CD, \\"History\\" in a new generation who are forgetting the basic music of this CD which gave all newer music their start."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best","review":"As a veteran law enforcement officer who has read many books written by current and retired police officers, this is quite possibly the best one I've read yet. The author comes off as the real deal, and does not use a lot of overly dramatic terms to get his points across, he just lets the stories speak for themselves. He also does not attempt to make himself come off as the perfect cop, or person, for that matter. This guy is the real police, which is about as high a compliment as one cop can give another."},{"rating":"2","title":"On the Streets with Wags","review":"A terrific memoir of life as a cop on the streets of New York's tough Alphabet City neighborhood. Wags' book is loaded with fascinating, well told stories. Especially moving is the author's recollections of his dad, also a police officer, and how they would sit side by side listening to \\"Dragnet\\" on the radio. The experience apparently fueled Wags' dreams of becoming a New York City cop. My Life In The NYPD is much more enjoyable than Wags' earlier book about his catastrophic \\"career\\" as a PI/bodyguard which ended in a felony conviction. Aside from a nasty, totally unneccessary intro by racist, homophobic shock jock Don Imus, this is a unqualified five star read. Assuming he must have at least a dozen more great tales of his life as one of New York's Finest, I hope Wags finds time to write a sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top of the old westerns","review":"Being over sixty and seen a lot of westerns,I would say this was one of the better one's..Good to go back and see the old fifty's movie and remember how it was....."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works for me","review":"Research has mixed results regarding the use of this, but I did notice an improvement in memory after 2-3 weeks of use, but maybe it doesn't work for everyone.As a side note, on the bottle it suggests that some might want to use along with two other supplements, DMAE and Ginko Biloba.

She did it out of pity, the moreso (as she later realized) after she started reading it. I tried reading it in my early teens, and tried again in my late teens, and I think I actually gave it another glance a few years ago when visiting my parents. (They've kept every book they've ever bought, including the 1967 set of Encyclopedia Brittanica.)I am sure that there are worse books, but in terms of painfully stilted dialog, this sets a standard that is hard to beat. It is bad enough that, read aloud properly to an audience that has already started drinking, it could be hilarious."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard and heavy punk rock with something extra","review":"To stand out, punk rock needs real aggression from the musicians and to have the greatest appeal, the music needs to be more than just thudding drums and guitars with all melody replaced with distortion. Avail hit the nail right on the head with this CD. I like it a lot.Listen to the vocals on \\"N30\\" for an example of the band's involvement in the music.The music too is interesting and varied, clearly the band has a lot of ideas and they make fine use of them.Ilike every track on this album, the drumming on \\"Levelled\\" caught my attention as did \\"Invisible\\", \\"Bell\\", \\"Union\\" and \\"Old Dominion\\". \\"Bell especially shows that the Avail span a wider range than just narrow punk.If you are into punk then you should have no hesitation over buying a copy of this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best punk band around!!!!!","review":"Avail is the greatest, most underated band around. They sing their songs from the heart, and on the new one, they continue this trend. I don't think in all the years they have been around, that they have ever written a band song?

Any fans of Minor Threat, Fugazi or Hot Water Music should definitely check these guys out. One Wrench is impressive because it combines the fury of previous albums like Dixie and 4AM Friday with the more reflective, melodic approach taken on the last album, Over the James. The first song, aptly named Fast One, is great. Also, check out N30 and Old Dominion. Avail is definitely one of the best punk bands around today, and this album shows why. Oh yeah, don't forget to check out Avail live if they come to your town. Their performances are unreal."},{"rating":"2","title":"ok","review":"I love Avail and have all of their albumns.

He said he thought that it didn't look very good. He was right. Of the 15 tracks on this album, the only two good ones are \\"When Your Lover Has Gone\\" and \\"Love me or Leave Me.\\" The rest of the numbers are flat, and are not very up-tempoed.

I was so impressed by Mr. Biehn that I search and found his fan club website (www.michaelbiehnfanclub.com) and joined. I will be seeing him live at the fan gathering in Burbank, CA in June 2006.

Charlie manages to get into all kinds of trouble, and how he gets out of each situation is what is so funny. I liked it so much that I read it to my 5 year old brother, and he actually rolled on the floor he was laughing so hard.This is a great book. I definitely recommend it to everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great flexibility, poor manufacturing quality","review":"Although these cables give you a lot of options, the spring-loaded storage discs are rather poor in quality. Getting the cables to retract fully takes several minutes and a lot of tinkering. This would be an invaluable tool overall if they just used a higher quality wind-up device."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Say No","review":"This goes down as one of the worst products that I have ever purchased. To call it retractable is a joke. The concept of the product is great. The casing of the cables looks great but the functionality was a big disappointment. I could pull the cables out but the cheap retraction mechanism would never allow the cables to go back into the case. Don't waste your time with this one as you will end up returning it as I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst buy for sure","review":"Very poor quality. Wires seems easily breakable and there are pointy edges on the earphones, which almost cut me when I tried them. Definitely would not trust this brand/manufacturer at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Atrocious quality","review":"This kit is the single worst quality product of anything that I have ever bought tech related. The first gentle pull of the cable broke or jammed the retract mechanism so now I have a thin usb cable with a big piece of plastic in the middle. The plastic that houses the mechanism even splits apart just extending the cable. The connectors are convenient, as is the case, but the retract mechanism and casing are laughably bad. I have bought foreign made knockoffs of many items that had higher quality than these. I am normally very hard to irritate, but man these irritate me. This kit is NOT recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Product","review":"I bought this product with a rebate, which made it reasonable in cost. I have had a lot of similar products in the past and find it very useful on travel. You never know what you or even a coworker will need. This product uses a generic USB extension cable with numerous attachments to change it to a RJ11, CAT5, or various tip USB cable. The kit also comes with a dedicated Firewire cable too. The only thing I do not like about this package is the extra slack in the audio/mic cable that does not stay in a slot and you have to deal with when you zip the case close."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly designed and poorly made, buy something better!","review":"I used to spend 65% of my time on the road all over the USA and the world. I needed more retractable cables to carry on trips as some of mine were wearing out. I purchased this on sale many years ago and frankly I never used them. I didn't use them because the quality was so poor that I didn't want to waste my time carrying the kit 12,000 miles only to have the cables break or not work. The quality is very poor as the retractors are just poorly designed and flimsy. The wires are very thin and easily broken. The only thing of value in the set was the zip up case. I included a photograph of the set that is 10 years old and never used.Don't waste your time and money; pick up something of better quality!"},{"rating":"2","title":"from the first......","review":"fantastic LP i've owned since new & now replacing with a new copy. gayle moran's haunting vocalizations, chick's keys, this a wonderful album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing ..\\"If you listen\\"","review":"I purchased this album after seeing Chick's performance at the Blue Note this past year with his \\"Leprechaun Band\\".

As a beginning Chick fan, I thought that all Chick Corea albums were good. I was dead wrong. After listening to this album, I was downright embarrassed for Chick, because I knew that he would look back on that album years into the future and just frown.

As many have pointed out, the first chapter (actually a 27 page paragraph) makes the author analyze a room of Polish people and, without knowing the language or actually hearing conversations in toto, assign them roles as if casting the play that follows. I think this is why we are left with incompletely fleshed out characters. The premise of the book ( expatriation from European nobility to American homgenation) has been written before and better. There are pages of beautiful descriptive writing to be sure - Sontag is well practiced at her craft - but in the end we are left not really caring about the stolid, laborious venture through which we've waded. Though Sontag is hypnotized by studies of history's influences on the present, I think she writes better when she sticks to her own metier."},{"rating":"1","title":"In America","review":"What a disappointing bore! Our reading group expected an interesting and vibrant story about the utopian communities that formed in California in the 1870s. What we got was a long-winded diatribe without enlightnment of the supposed subject matter. Where was the plot? Where was the character development? In terms of both style and content, our book club all agreed that this was the most poorly written book we've read. Some of the books we've thought had interesting, thought-provoking stories include: Tales of Genji, White Oleander, Yellow Raft on Blue Water, and The Poisonwood Bible. We didn't feel that there was any beauty to the writing in Sontag's book. We agreed that we would have been interested in discovering more about the characters and their lives. However, it elicited no emotions or insights for us. It didn't capture the beauty of California or inform the reader about early California life. It was just rambling blah, blah, blah!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Could it be more ponderous?","review":"I expected to like this novel; Sontag has a wonderful reputation and the storyline had potential. Instead, it became the ONLY book I have ever found so simply awful that I couldn't finish it. The style had an obnoxious quality and the main character was annoying, self-absorbed and tedious. Astoundingly irritating!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Intellectual Pap","review":"Our book club agrees totally with L.A. Readers Anonymous. Terrible. We spent 20 minutes discussing the book before proceeding to more critical life stories. Most of the members were disconcerted with the Chapter 0 pretension. I however, agree with A Reader from Chicago about the Edwin Booth monologue. Did we miss something there? Or was it merely a device to show off a fancy writing style? Nothing came together, we couldn't get the point and most of the other members were FURIOUS about the lack of/misuse of punctuation and the ENDLESS rambling and repetitiveness. National Book Award????"},{"rating":"1","title":"Really Wanted To Like This, But.............................","review":"OK, it sounded like an interesting novel. I love well written historical novels, and hey thei one won the National Book Award! My only question to that is...WHY? It is passably OK. Mildely interesting story, laconic pacing, settings thathave been desceibed better by even the likes of John Jakes (isn't that sad, since I did NOT like his latest effort either). I keep reading, waiting for something to happen and I have so far beenr disappointed (and I am nearly finished). All I can say is I am glad I took this one out of the library first, otherwise I would have felt ripped off. Sorry, but awards do not a good book make. Two stars for effort and some nicely crafted language, otherwise find something else to read and don't waste your time on on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"I was hoping for a long more than this from Sontag and the National Book Award committee.

I read the rave reviews on the back of the book and foolishly bought it. It is a rambling collection of pages about a period of history in which I have no interest (the 1800's) and the writing in very choppy and boring. The back of the book gave no clue as to the time period or the nationality of the characters. The \\"coming to America\\" stories are my least favorite. I never, ever throw books in the trash-I usually give them to charity or to the library. I threw this one away. I want this book off the street, so no other poor soul would make the same mistake I did and read this drivel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disappointing and self-indulgent","review":"Sontag had fun recreating all this history and I enjoyed reading it, to a point. What was that long monologue by Edwin Booth - a character who did not appear in the book until nearly the end - doing as a conclusion to a book that was about Maryna? I skipped it. Why not conclude as she began with the conceit of the writer being drawn in by the characters, at the end drawing away and telling the reader how their lives went on?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why, why, why?","review":"Award winning literature should provoke thoughtful questions. Susan Sontag's \\"In America\\" prompted my bookclub to ask: 1) Where the heck was her editor? 2) Was it simply Susan Sontag's turn to win the National Book Award? 3) If \\"In America\\" was penned by an unknown author, would it have even been published? 4) Did the guy who was quoted on the back cover actually read the book? Would he please tell us where the \\"hilarious\\" parts are? 5) Why did the chapters that were 1 paragraph yet 17+ pages long irritate us so? 6) Does a single interesting premise like \\"Immigrating to a new country allows you to reinvent yourself\\" merit 387 tedious pages? and finally 7) Why the heck did our bookclub pick this book?"},{"rating":"1","title":"a great essayist, but as a novelist....","review":"I have enjoyed the depth of Susan Sontag's lucid, witty essays in the New Yorker magazine, and recently we saw her on Cspan Book -TV. A caller asked what would be the best introduction to her writings, and she suggested her novel \\"In America.\\"This book was surprisingly disappointing to me. I kept waiting to get swept up into it, but came to the last page with only a sense of duty for finishing. The characters are drawn well enough ,the time frame (post-Civil War America) is interesting, but the book failed to engage me somehow. Sontag has an affinity for the movies and for actors;she has created as the lead character a Polish actress who finds stellar success on the American stage.I will continue to enjoy Sontag's essays but doubt I will read another of her novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lazy readers writing unfair reviews","review":"Generally, the reviews of In America here are dazzylingly unfair. Certainly, reading this novel is not like sitting down and watching TV, or even reading the Sunday New York Times. The novel demands that the reader read changes of style, tone, shift in narrative focus, change from letters to first person narrative back to third person narrative, to a sort of interior monologue. What is wrong with this, if it is done with control, as Songtag does, except for the fact it demands that readers fail to be lazy? So, this is not a novel for the easily frazzled. It demands faith from the reader, but rewards the reader for this trust with a deep investigation of what it means to be an American and human."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seersucker BBQ!","review":"You gotta a shake'n in you legs and it ain't no saber tooth crotch crickets neither!It's Beau Jocque make'n room in your gumbo for goodness!Get Real & Get Jocque"},{"rating":"1","title":"I am the Blues","review":"Disappointed in the mix on this live performance .

In other words, it would be nice to have for reference, but it's nearly impossible to read. The style is akin to what I'd expect from a high school student writing a research paper. Elleh's triple heritage theory (traditional, Islamic and colonial influences on African styles) appears throughout the book, but never is it defended clearly and cohesively. I'd like to see this book re-written and professionally edited. With the amount of research that Elleh put into this work, the potential is there for a truly great book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor book","review":"Dear Sirs,When I have ordered the book I thought it will be excellent sourse for me before studing some particular topic.

Then I realized I'd left all these finger prints on the phone trying to get the case on. I wanted to take off the case and clean it but it would not come off.Finally I got it off and it snapped in the process... I tried repairing with superglue but that made part of the case opaque.

Then Ferdinand and Isabella began their own reign of terror, kicking out the Muslims and Jews and initiating the Inquisition, and Spain (similar to Italy's experience post-Galileo) became a scientific and economic backwater.The best part of this video is the scholarly commentary by experts from Catholic, Jewish, Muslim and non-sectarian institutions, effectively replicating the diversity and tolerance of Moorish Spain.Highly recommended.Warning: There is another video on the same topic,When the Moors Ruled in Europe.

Feder simply makes no attempt at following the most elementary use of logic. His conclusions are pure dogma. For example, he (rightfully) criticizes Nazism and Communism for causing much horror throughout their respective history. However, when discussing Christianity, Feder argues that it cannot be judged because of all the bloodshed and wars it has caused because human beings distorted a good idea. In other words, it is ok to use empirical evidence to criticize ideologies I don't like, but not those I like. In other passages, Feder suggests that conservatives are a tiny persecuted minority. Which is all fine and well if it wasn't for the fact that they control the presidency, the House, the Senate, and the Supreme Court.

You have to let them try for themselves. And if they show that what you're doing doesn't work, you need to be honest about it and admit it yourself. Dr. Emoto fails on each of these points.This book is fake. The scientists in What the Bleep agree that this work is not convincing at all. (The non-scientists are willing to accept it.)There's nothing wrong with fiction. There's nothing wrong with astrology. There's nothing wrong with this book.

I searched the peer-reviewed scientific literature in the PubMed database at National Library of Medicine and, among the 12 million or so articles there, I found a single report by Dr. Emoto in what appeared to be a reputable journal. However, upon closer inspection, the article was described in this journal as a \\"Photoessay\\" and did not even come close to meeting the criteria for a true scientific study. If anyone can validate the results of Dr. Emoto's version of homeopathy, James Randi may have a million-dollar prize for you. If you want to be truly inspired by the awe and mystery and spirituality of nature, check out Ursula Goodenough's book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let's get the facts straight, people....","review":"The Earth's *surface area* is nearly 70% water, but its total mass is a paltry 0.023% H20. That's hardly significant. In the human body, water is distributed differently in various areas: lean muscle tissue contains about 75% water; bood contains about 83% water; body fat contains 25% water and bone has 22% water. Total % body water also varies considerably from infancy to adulthood, between men and women, and between individuals. These things can hardly be considered \\"coincidence\\" by any stretch of the imagination. The connection between water and life is well understood, straight-forward, and ,frankly, obvious. There's no need for magical thinking, weird mysticism, or silly books (like this one) to make the point that our water supply is precious and must be protected. Only an *irrational* person would argue against that."},{"rating":"1","title":"No scientic research","review":"The basic premise of this entire book and the philosophy of Masaru Emoto is that water crystals are affected by thoughts, attitudes and feelings. This is a very exciting idea and one that I really do want to believe in.However, never in this book is there any scientific research - absolutely none. The most basic principle of scientific research is reproducible results by reputable third parties. Who are Emoto-son's researchers? Allow me to quote, \\"I wrote this experiment in the book that I published, and as a result hundreds of families throughout Japan conducted this same experiment for themselves. EVERYONE reported the same results.\\" And that's all you get folks!Really, I want to believe, I really do, but show some respect to human logic and scientific discipline.

But there is simply no basis for the author's conclusions - no scientific studies, no proof, just this individual claiming all these unsupported conclusions on his personal experiments. Moreover, it is simply ludicrous to believe that somehow water, in any form or essence, would respond to our printed language - as some of his \\"experiments\\" allegedly have proven. Are we so arrogant to believe that somehow another force (whatever) is going to place the same meaning we place on a jumbled collection of letters written in what we refer to as \\"Japanese\\" or \\"English\\" or whatever language the author was using in these so-called experiments? This may be the most inane book I have ever seen - impossible to take it seriously."},{"rating":"1","title":"fraud or just gobbletygook","review":"This book is full of misunderstandings of basic physics and even arithmetic. It is either fraud or just utterly stupid. There are many fairly good pictures of ice crystals, and the basic messages, e.g. \\"The world is linked together by love and gratitude\\" are nice and can provoke thought.Some reviewers defend this book saying things like \\"it isn't meant to be scientifically rigorous\\" or \\"it isn't a science journal\\" or even \\"It just dosn't seem like valid science to people who lack the author's brilliant insight.\\" But, the main thrust of the book is an attempt to provide a foundation for thoughts about love and water through what is purported as experimental results and valid scientific theory. The \\"facts\\" are not accurate, are misunderstood, or just make no sense. There seems to be a longing among many readers for scientific validation of spiritual ideas, but I think it is a disservice to take advantage of their gullibility and ignorance, as this book does."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunate Neglect of Scientific Method","review":"I'm not a big fan of dismissing someone's work and I really wanted to find something valid in Emoto's \\"research\\" but his lack of respect for the scientific method has tainted his work. I've seen him in person, my exchange student from Japan was on hand to help him if he got stuck with his English and I was sadly disappointed by how his conduct contradicted his premise and made his work seem like it's about making money, not finding scientific evidence.

The inevitable corollary there is that a positive, gentle, and mindful approach to life is good not only for the subject but for all objects around the subject, because subject and object are ultimately one organic unity.

Other than that, it's pretty unrealistic. The information is set up just like Scientology books (Dianetics). There is just enough info. given to the reader so that they fill in the gaps with emotional ideas, and then get them attached to the ideas presented. The book gives them a sort of hope, because they probably have been having a crappy life.One thing that is known about water ALREADY, is that flowing water effects ions. Ions effect people in subtle ways that are still being studied. People in these reviews talk about feeling \\"different\\" or \\"better\\" around bodies of water. Well, that's because the ions are charged differently due to the water. It puts some people in a better mood. But this is because of something that can be studied and measured: ionic activity.

Author Gail Karwoski has given meticulous attention to historic detail and background, always the hallmark of a superior historical novel. She combines this with an impressive gift for storytelling that will engage young readers from first page to last. One special and unique feature is the Q & A format for the \\"Author Notes\\" at the end of this remarkable work."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Look into the Lewis & Clark Expedition","review":"Gail Langer Karwoski has done an excellent job of fictionalizing the Lewis & Clark adventure by drawing on details from their diaries. Using Lewis' dog, Seaman, as a focal point, she details the many dangers and perils faced by the explorer group while doing good character development of the protagonists. Sacagawea and York, a slave owned by Clark, are shown in their pivotal contributions (often ignored) to the expedition. My only criticism revolves around the portrayal of the various Native American groups encountered by Lewis & Clark. Because she has drawn on the diaries and their viewpoint, various tribes are depicted as either \\"noble savages\\" or \\"thieving Indians\\" and deeper cultural issues are not explored as to the traditions of these varied groups. Overall an excellent book, but perhaps best read with adult guidance."},{"rating":"2","title":"OMG this is like the best book EVER! WHOO!","review":"OMG I just absolutely loved this book!

It's super fun and appropriate for kiddos of all ages. My son loves another series by the same studio so I knew he'd love these.

I would have liked it better had the book been seperate from the rest of the series.

After reading all but one of the series, I care about the characters. I want to know how they ended up. Call me a softy, but I wanted Horatio and Lady Barbara to \\"live happily ever after\\".

I would recommend reading the first short story after 'Mr. Midshipman', and the last short story after you completed the 11 book series.Of course the writing, and continued story line of Horatio Hornblower is superb even with it being a partial book and story. But, I was not particularly happy that this partiallly completed book of 100 pages cost the same as any other book in the series. I give the rating of 2 stars only due to this fact.Otherwise, I will still continue to look forward to reading the next in the series.

The story was fairly interesting. Not as good as the others in the series. But If you are to read the whole series you shouldn't be too cheap to spend the extra cash on 1 book of a series. I think it would be foolish to hold out on 1 book of a series to \\"not get your moneys worth of 100 or so pages.\\" My advise, JUST READ IT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Digital version does not include the short stories","review":"I did enjoy the unfinished story, although it its of course sad that we can never enjoy the fully finished work.

Any serious student of science fiction should read this play. A factory on an island produces robots (actually, in today's terminology, the products being made by this factory are androids, not robots) to do man's labor and to grow his food. But, as the years go by, governments misuse the robots, having them replace soldiers. Robots begin to be used in wars everywhere. They rebel and man is exterminated. However, the robots don't know how to build new robots and discover that they are doomed to extinction as well. But, the sole two robots of a later model discover beauty, compassion, and love. They become a new Adam and Eve. Interestingly, one of the characters in the play builds robots so that man won't have to work. Yet, he doesn't build any to do his work since it is something he enjoys doing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindle Version not in English","review":"Apart from the quality of the play, the Kindle edition of this product is in the original Czech, but claims to be in English."},{"rating":"2","title":"This play speaks to us today.","review":"This is a really good play but most reviewers miss the fact that in the play, the robots are not mechanical or androids but genetically engineered from a \\"protoplasm\\".

There is a ton of spreadsheets you have to fill in but you need to know very specific information to do so, and then the information you get is only relevant to a larger cooperation. Also, and this is the kicker, the author made a reference to an exciting new ad technology coming out, Google Whisper, and he was serious.

I reached Chapter 7 (with skipping some material in between) but can go no further. I read a lot books on management and marketing - this book has just confounded me. Luckily I got it from the library and didn't buy it.

Its \\"MIDI out\\" capability is only for saving your samples to a computer --- you cannot use the DJX-2 to output note information to an external sequencer (or computer or other keyboard...).

He has done some amazing work being a great jazz pianist, complementing Herbie Hancock in earlier albums with piano duets etc. to albums such as My Spanish Heart and the well known Light as a Feather where Flora Purim and Stanley Clarke were very apparent. Herbie Hancock plays electric piano on 2 tracks of this album. Madhatter is hard to find and for musicians as I am relish in his diversity. The Madhatter is based on the Alice in Wonderland theme. What a blow out! Amazing interpretation. His musicianship is endless. From acoustic piano, to control of the electronic synth, percussion and arrangements. A thorough musician indeed and well ahead of his time.Thankyou Amazon for delivering yet another brilliant Chick the Corea album in cd form, at its best.Barbara Meadows."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best album ever made","review":"This was the first CD I was ever given in 5th grade by my dad.

One of the best moments is a \\"duet\\" between Steve Gadd and Chick on \\"Dear Alice.\\" One would never have believed that drums and piano could establish such intriguing interplay.

I have the cassette version meself (got it fomr relapse mail order). I think it's great!Never heard too much of these guys but this release is a stragne combination of really fuzzed out metal guitar and bass, old skoll industrial/machine sounds, dark and weird almost monotone vocals (which somehow come across better than emotion would have) and hyper drum machine beats and keyboard parts.I guess parts noise, metal, industrial, and experimental would do the trick.Complaint: First trakc is pretty repetitive and annoying, but it gets much better later on.

Almost every scene is amasterpiece by veteran nature photographer Bob Glusic. Not only are allof the well-known landmarks of Yosemite featured here, but many backcountry areas of exquisite beauty fill this disc. Snow, ice, flowers,wildlife, walking along trails and river banks abound here - but unlikeother national park videos you've seen, you rarely see people. Nolodges, crowded trails, shops, cars - just the wilderness that gives youa feeling of solitude and being one with nature. You can choose tolisten to a narrative description and great music, or just ambientsounds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I ordered this bluray and the BBC Yellowstone together and was greatly disappointed with the Yosemite production. Yosemite is visually stunning but lacks any substantive information about the park and lacks any progression - it's a random collection of shots from the park at different times of the year often showing just an animal, flower, running water, etc. without context to Yosemite. It reminds me of my own vacation videos (except they have very, very good cameras) with some orchestral music and poetic type narrative added. It rarely, if ever, describes the location in the park or the particular feature that it's showing. I've watched the BBC Yellowstone video several times but had trouble getting through this one the first time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Focus Is Not the Focus of This Camera","review":"This camera is great, wonderful, one of the best on the market...if not for that pesky auto focus feature. I was surprised at how well the video feature works; it's not the same quality you're going to get with a stand alone video camera, but it's not bad either. My may beef with this camera is the auto focus...sometimes it works, and sometimes it doesn't; I noticed that it's usually out of focus in indoor/night shots when optical zoom is being used. For the most part, this can be fixed by putting it on a tripod."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK Camera, Horrible Battery","review":"The camera takes very good pictures, but the overall size makes it cumbersome to carry around. In the two years I've owned it, I brought it with me less than I would've for a smaller camera with worse optics. On hikes it is pretty much impossible to bring along because it's too big to fit in some day packs.And after only having this camera for two years and using it sparingly, it will not work now because the camera electronics will not fully charge the battery. Purchased replacement batteries, which are specific to this camera, but these will not fully charge either. For the price of the camera quality control should be significantly higher, buy a Canon, or something that will let you use standard sized (AA, etc.) batteries at least, instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ideal for the occasional casual photograph","review":"Not a bad little camera with plenty of enhancement products still available for purchase. Although not state-of-the-art, this little camera does the job for the casual user, incorporating the basic features most wanted.

I also saw it when it first opened in theaters and I was really let down.There are a few good moments, all in all not the worst movie ever. There is no way this can be ranked with any of De Niro's really great movies though. If he was trying to use everything he learned from Scorscese he must not have learned too much.Again, this is my humble opinion. What do I know? But if you are thinking of buying this, make sure you rent it first. I wouldn't want this movie in my house."},{"rating":"2","title":"great","review":"fast delivery and great conditions would defenetly recommend to guy from themand will defently buy from them again"},{"rating":"2","title":"a bronx tale","review":"I love this movie and been looking in stores for it, but its discontinued.

The casting is brilliant all the way around and the acting superb. The story is compelling and personally I love how it is narrated by the character Calogero, who is De Niro's son in the movie. It has a powerful moral message and even the musical score is a perfect fit. If you love movies about Italian gangsters and coming of age stories, check this one out."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"A Bronx Tale,\\" fantastic Robert DeNiro work.","review":"\\"A Bronx Tale\\" is Robert De Niro's directorial debut and a superb exposition of his autobiographical story of how he grew up in the Bronx in the 60s, written by Chaz Palmenteri, who also plays the chief antagonist. I'm not certain that I've got here the best copy of the film...but that doesn't take away from the story's grip on my senses; it is exciting, quick-paced, well-acted and skillfully edited to show a powerful story of the lethal reigns of neighborhood power.

I only gave it 4 stars because giving it 5 stars would mean that it was up there with the reigning king of all gangster movies, Scarface (1983). With that out of the way, let me say that this is one of the most underappreciated films of the 90's. Commercially unsuccessful, this should have gotten much more praise and location in '93 when it was first introduced. It's a movie about a kid who's torn between his loving father and the most respected hood in the neighborhood, Sonny. Sounds pretty simple, but De Niro told this Bronx Tale with mastery and precision. I really hope De Niro considers directing more films in the near or distant future, cause like i said, he did a helluva job with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic movie","review":"A gripping story.

Love the doowop background music, New York early '60s scene, and the thoughtful story line of a son growing up in the 'hood, being tugged alternately by the \\"romantic\\" idea in the youngster's mind of the \\"cool\\" local mafia boss as opposed to the steadying influence of a loving, ordinary working man father.

It's racist, sexist, rude and absurd. But man oh man could Chandler write. He dragged me down into the seedier side of 1940 Los Angeles, and I couldn't get out until he let me go at the end of the book. The plot? Not so much to it in the end, really. Just a basic hunt for a killer who hunted for the girl he once loved. The twists and turns along the way just provided excuses for more wallowing in the seamy side of life--decadent rich, smelly poor, liars, cheats, and killers. If you asked me, I'd say it wasn't my cup of tea. But the man could describe everything from people to houses to a crawling pink bug in a way that kept me mesmerized. Read this if you want to know what hard-boiled is supposed to sound like."},{"rating":"2","title":"A film noir treasure!","review":"A hard-boiled detective novel featuring Philip Marlowe. A great read with a surprise ending. I really enjoyed Chandler's description of people and situations -- very colorful, like \\"he stood out like a pair of spats at an Iowa picnic.\\" At one point in the book the author has another character speak like Marlowe, whereupon he says, \\"that sounds like something I should have said.\\" not surprising how popular these became, along with the whole film noir genre.

With this said, the story is completely character-driven, making it full of action and narrative. Just flip the book open to any page, and you'll clearly read slick, muscular dialogue and snappy comebacks. Chandler is a benchmark author for stories stripped of any literary fat.Besides Dashiel Hammett, Chandler is the perennial writer of gumshoe detectives. And Farewell, My Lovely is the perennial gumshoe novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Marlowe sings with the lilting curve of an angel's wing.","review":"Marlowe is in a tough spot.

Fatal debs seem to assault him from every angle, and Marlowe is beaten, drugged and abused mercilessly, but somehow he never gives up and keeps doggedly pursuing the truth about corruption and death in Los Angeles.Chandler's use of language is brilliant as always, and the plot is somewhat difficult to follow, but really, with Chander at work, who needs plot? The book is beautiful and the prose is blossoming with unusual and evocative images. Chander ranks as one of the great American masters of prose.Read this and weep..."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing audio production","review":"This review is for the CD version of Eliot Gould's reading.I love Chandler's writing and have read \\"Farewell\\" at least four times. Gould does a good job of reading it, too.What's frustrating about the CD version is that the disks are not indexed. There was no effort to make a disk begin at the beginning of a chapter, for instance. Also, each disk holds one track only. That means if you want to pause for the night at the end of chapter 5, good luck finding your place when you return to listening in a few days.Breaking the audio into tracks is a very easy thing to do, so primitive a technology that it makes it seem that this CD box set was mastered in the 1980s.There is no competing product as of June 2003, however.

This violent, shabby, hilarious, and ultimately very moving novel rockets P.I. Phillips Marlowe through the darkest, seamiest side of Chandler's textured world Los Angeles. In no other novel does Chandler's razor sharp and witty prose slice so sharply, and his sense of tragic irony (\\"It isn't funny that a man should die, but it is funny that a man should die for so little\\") reaches its zenith. Hard to put down, impossible to forget."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ed Bishop as Philip Marlowe","review":"I purchased this Audiobook on Cd, being familiar with Raymond Chandler as an author, but having never read any. I bought this solely for Ed Bishop being in it. It turns out I really totally enjoyed this book being dramatized. I have since purchased the other Marlowe plays available. I love the honesty, though brutal at times, of Marlowe's character. To me he is a dedicated, likeable guy who gets the job done and done well. For anybody who enjoys the old radio plays from years ago..this is a must for you. Any mega fan of actor Ed Bishop, (like me who totally fell in love with him years ago) this is also a must to own!

For starters, the language was too contrived: \\"...she let him grope the curves of her breasts and tease the nubs into nibbly nuts...\\" \\"Then in Bhasi's eyes, Mukundan saw the star he had sought in the heavens shine and burn\\". The storyline was equally aggravating. This could have easily been the plot of a high-school movie: newcomer (Mukundan) is scared and wants nothing more than belong. He makes friends with a dweeb (Bhasi), who is genuinely concerned about him. He finds true love (Anjana). But when the \\"in\\" clique starts paying attention to the newcomer, he mistreats those who care about him.

The CD tests contained therein are simplistic and do not cover hardly a thing that's contained in the actual test...in fact, the CD tests in this book don't even test you on much of anything you were to learn from the book...just 49 random questions that will have you staring at the screen during a Comptia A+ exam wondering what in the world they mean by that...very disappointing considering I once beleived this was THE book to use to pass the A+ exams."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unbelieveable!","review":"I studied for the exam ONLY USING THIS BOOK AND MADE 85 percent!

I took the core hardware part of the test and passed. I read the book's O/S part over and over again until i couldnt take it anymore and went up for the test. None of the questions in the book matched up to the real A+ test. So i just figured i didnt study it enough and pick up enough so i read it all through again and again until i could practically recite the book from memory and i failed again. This book goes into details about topics that it does not need to and it just a waste of you time when it comes to the O/S part. It helped somewhat on the hardware part of the test.

Meyers delves into the history of computers and gives reasons why they operate the way they do today. For example, instead of just listing the different bus speeds of different chip sets, he goes into detail as to what the system bus does and how it works. My one complaint: the practice tests were not at all the ones on the actual exam.

I should note that the quiz program that comes with the book is also poor and doesn't really prep you for the real exam because the real 2001 exam is 70 questions and 1.5 hours. Also, a note about the hardware exam: I should have done much better but the new 2001 exams have graphics that are impossible to decipher (like identify the *blank* in this graphic). Even if you got 92%+ in practice exams (like I did), study more because you're doomed on these questions.

A lot of what is supposed to be live footage is obviously staged and his impersonation of foreigners is totally cheesy. As a matter of fact, everything about the movie is totally cheesy.

Sounds kinda funny, right? It's not. Morgan just doesn't have it.Morgan also shows snippets of his previous short films as well as random clips of himself as characters. A very tedious film.

Plus the photos of the cards I saw in the bookstore were very beautiful. The major arcana cards were my favorites in this deck.My primary issue with the deck is that many of the faces in the minor arcana look aggressive and cold. That disturbed me a little bit and I would often feel a funny vibe when I did readings with them. However, I had no such feelings when working with the Major Arcana because that aggressiveness was not as strong in these pictures.If you are not sure about whether this is the deck for you, find a new age shop or website where you can look at several pictures of the cards to see if you like the overall feel of them. Just make sure that it shows you minor arcana cards and not just the aces.In general, though, the images are colorful, well drawn and definately different than what you'd find elsewhere. Because of this uniqueness, the deck is well worth a look."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intuitive","review":"It's my belief that certain items are more intuned to certain people. In other words, particular items call out to individuals. Not everything is for everyone. This tarot deck, however, was an instant connection with me. I am an extreme newby but found this deck easy to use. The pictures are thought provoking and not cartoony. The booklet that accompanies it shows one layout, the celtic cross, as well as interpretations. It is a great launching point for learning. Once I've conquered this layout, I will be looking to other books on layouts. Take a look at the card samples that Amazon supplies. If this calls to you, buy it!

We always wash it right away and let it air dry- which I don't think is expecting too much- but apparently we should have been patting it down!? I've never had a cheese grated rust on me before, so this was a big disappointment. Buying a new one right now- total waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works perfectly, just a bit oversized","review":"This cheese grater works exactly as a cheese grater should...only very minor complaint is that it is a bit larger than what I had always thought of as the \\"standard\\" box grater...and as a result is a little more bulky to store in my cabinet, which is a bit tight on space. Aside from that, this was a great value for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good - do not buy this","review":"Bought this grater as a gift for my daughter and was alarmed when it arrived. The rubber handle and nonskid gasket on the bottom had a very heavy petroleum/moth ball (naphthalene) like odor, which persisted despite several washings and airing in the sun. As a matter of fact, it stunk up the entire dishwasher when first washed, and the odor in the dishwasher remained for several days. The size is also huge - much bigger than expected, and therefore not easy to store. I would have returned it had we not washed it, but instead had to toss it into the trash. The odor must certainly be toxic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heavy duty grater","review":"I bought this grater because my old one didn't have the medium holes. It has all the sides I need - slicer, medium/large grater and zester. I don't care much for the zester because I have the Microplane. I will use this mainly for cheese anyway and it has all the surfaces I need. I love the neoprene handle and bottom. Great quality and value! Best of all, I got it as the free item from the 4-for-3 deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heavy duty.","review":"I read many conflicting reviews on this before I bought it. I haven't had any problems with the bottom rubber piece coming off, and the handle has never filled with water in the dishwasher. It is fairly large, but just perfect for my need.

It smells terrible.","review":"Avoid at all costs. What I thought looked like a good product in the picture, has completely disappointed me.

How these two innocents, both age 13, save the souls of the town as well as their own, makes for reading on timeless themes. What would you do if your secret wishes could be granted by the mysterious ringmaster Mr. Dark? Bradbury excels in revealing the dark side that exists in us all, teaching us ultimately to celebrate the shadows rather than fear them. In many ways, this is a companion piece to his joyful, nostalgia-drenched Dandelion Wine, in which Bradbury presented us with one perfect summer as seen through the eyes of a 12-year-old. In Something Wicked This Way Comes, he deftly explores the fearsome delights of one perfectly terrifying, unforgettable autumn. O"},{"rating":"2","title":"Chilling to the core","review":"This book is a fiction masterpiece. It is enormously frightening in a very subtle way. I found it easy to identify with the two main characters, whose lives are forever changed in an instant by the sudden appearance of evil. It reminds us just how very fragile our surroundings really are and how evil can have many, not so obvious faces. At the same time, we see how good can triumph over darkness. Suspenseful to the end, I could barely put the book down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bradbury's Best","review":"Sometimes there seem to be two Ray Bradbury's. On the one hand, there's the writer of Twilight Zone-esque (before the TZ existed!) stories that are exciting or just plain creepy (The Illustrated Man, R Is For Rocket). On the other hand, there's Bradbury the stylist, who can write page after page of poetry in prose form (Dandelion Wine). Not everybody likes both.But in this novel the two Bradbury's meet. His love for boyhood, the beauty of a small town, the love of a father are all captured in gorgeous writing wrapped around a truly creepy tale. The Wonder Years meets Dracula? There's really nothing else like this work: it can stand up right beside To Kill a Mockingbird and a Tales From the Crypt collection.Oh, and whatever you do, don't watch the movie version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bradbury goes to the heart of the matter.","review":"Ray Bradbury's stories always manage to pierce through into a deep sense of longing. They leave you unsatisfied (because they do come to an end) yet, at the same time, filled with pleasure at the rightness of just how he does it (Dark They Were and Golden-Eyed, for example).Something Wicked This Way Comes is no different. The struggle between evil for the possession of the boys' souls and the love, bravery, and sacrifice elicited from Will and his dad just knocks you out. The increasing pace, the looming threat, and the ever more clearly defined personal consequences of squarely facing it, all rachet up the tension in perfect phase--you'll know it when you get to that special chapter. Once I began this book, I did not stop until I finished it. Do not pollute your mental imagery with the movie version. Trust your own imagination. Read the book!

A great page turner for late nights!","review":"Ray Bradbury takes the reader on a fun and very exciting adventure when a whole town is oblivious as to what lies in their future. Two friends teamed with one of the lad's father venture out to corrupt and destroy the evil, the wicked that came their way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"I have to admit that I just don't get it. I'm baffled as to why Ray Bradbury is considered such a genius. This book, considered one of his best, really doesn't stand out to me as anything all that special. The plot is cute, at best. It's not terribly creative; in fact, it's quite formulaic and often predictable. The characters are interesting, but not in any profound sort of way. And the writing is choppy and unrefined. I might give this book to an 11-year-old looking for a quick, easy read. But I have to believe that the past forty years have produced better material in the way of fantasy fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't like it","review":"I'm an avid reader, and I am usually able to comprehend what I'm reading. But this story was a bit too descriptive, I'm sure that appeals to some people, but not to me or any of the other kids in my english class. It seems to the majority of us that one would have to be on acid to understand what's going on, this may be because it's the end of the school year and we're seniors, but I think it's mainly due to the over-descriptive nature of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate this book.","review":"This book used a mammoth amount of undecipherable metaphors and similies, confusing and unnecssecary description.

He uses words with like meanings in long strings and it got old rather quickly. Some parts are like reading entries in a Thesaurus; I skipped over these \\"defining\\" paragraphs/sentences after the first couple chapters.The book was not 'wicked'; it isn't even as scary as some R.L. Stine books I dug up recently and those aren't even a fraction of the size and depth this attempts. With the name \\"Something Wicked This Way Comes\\", I was expecting wickedness worded out; twisted thoughts and evilness dealt out by a ominous force. No deal. The book is rather tame - by its name I was expecting Steven King but instead got Walt Disney.It's a child's book. Had I known that, I wouldn't have bought it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Er!","review":"I read this book for school and it was really confusing. Half the book didn't make sense.

There are some sentences you re-read for pleasure, thinking: 'Wow, well said!' But he doesn't reign in the mannered technique enough for you to relax and enjoy the story. It's a bad habit some authors have, akin to a playwrite walking out onstage during the middle of a performance to shout to the audience, \\"Hey! I wrote this! Me! Ray Bradbury!\\"Obviously a talented writer, but not disciplined enough in how he uses that talent."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful","review":"I think this book tells a wonderful story about friendship and growth and scary things!

I enjoyed how descriptive and how in detailed Bradbury was in this book. Although I really loved the book so far I think What I liked most about it, or atleast cought my eye at first was the saying on the cover:By the pricking of my thumbs, something wicked this way comes. When I read that phrase I knew I had to read this book. If you like to believe in the idea be careful what you wish for and think sometimes things are the way they seem then again this is the perfect story for you. This was an intense story that really you could say addicts you to reading. I could not put it down.I hope the rest of the book is as good as the first 22 chapters. The begining is a little confusing but once you start getting into it it all makes sense. I hope you will read this book and enjoy it. Thanx"},{"rating":"2","title":"An unforgettable fable of good vs. evil","review":"This story is one that I have thought of often in the 15-plus years since I first read it.

I have got some MAJOR gripes with this book. First off, being that there is absolutely nothing believable about Jim or Will. Not a single instance of these characters seeming real. Secondly, the way that Bradbury structures sentences in this book has to be some of the worst grammar I have ever seen in a publication, major or independent. The thing that really gets me about it is that this is pretty much an internationally love piece of fiction and I just can't see the justification of it. Even the actual story itself, which is wonderful in idea, is completely underwhelming because of the way Bradbury writes this novel. I still want to read Farenheit 451, I certainly hope it's much better written than this book is. Not to sure I can honestly give this book a recommendation to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rich prose poetic in presentation...not to my liking..","review":"Maybe it is just that this book it's style, it's prose did not translate well for me here in the UK but I cannot understand the fascination with something I do not understand.

I disagree. Although Ray Bradbury is a superb writer, this book seems to fall short. The writing is overly poetic, and the dialogue is clunky. If you read this you may find yourself re-reading sentences to figure out what the hell was being said. Although not from the book, there are many, too many, sentences like this:\\"Will ran, didn't run. Jumped, didn't jump. He stomped his find on elephant shadows and cat whisker winds.\\"Again, this isn't an actual sentence from the book, but something similar to the type of writing.Buy it, read it, experience it.

The premise is great. An evil carnival comes to town and preys on the emotional and spiritual weaknesses of the residents. The problem is that the story gets lost in the enigmatic writing style that Bradbury chose for this book. Half the time, I didn't really know what was going on. Maybe I'm missing something.

Often very good, it at times however, is just flat wrong, especially when dealing with the subject of election/predestination. Mr. Zodhiates is actually almost self-contradictory at points regarding this subject.Given all that, I must say that the concept is a good one; that is, of having the words indexed to a Hebrew/Aramaic/Greek Lexicon that is included in the back. There have been numerous times I've been able to consult the dictionary in the back, when I did not have the cumbersome Strong's Concordance with me.

And that is what you will find here in the Cisco Press CCNA books by Odom. I find the writing rudimentary at best and Odoms command of real world analogies could use some work.The questions for each chapter are not only poorly written to begin with, but there lacks any explanation in the answers section as to why a particular answer is right and why one is wrong. This is key to learning the material, you need to know why you got something wrong, not just that it *is* wrong. I might recommend this book if you are re-certifying and already know the material, but if you are a first timer, beware. You will find Odoms style of writing to be somewhat confusing and at times completely unhelpful."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING!","review":"I have not yet read this book, as it just arrived a few moments ago, but I ordered it on the basis of a past reading of Ouspensky's, In Search Of The Miraculous.

It helped control the minor skin infections I get on my back because of a mild immune deficiency. I thought this cream helped b/c it had a mild medicinal smell. A soak in a hyper-salinic salt bath solution for 15 minutes works much better. You make this by pouring table salt, rock salt, kosher salt or ice cream salt into the tub until no more can go into solution. There will be salt grains in the bottom of the tub. You probably need at least 1&1/2 lbs. of salt so buy cheap salt in big quantities. A normal thick emollient cream from the drugstore without a medicinal smell worked better to keep the itching down. Also an over the counter steroid cream would work.

Much of her writing was un-realistic and therefore highly un-appreciated. Her writing definately needs to be brushed up several notches. While she develops her characters personalties nicely enough she then twists them around in odd ways that make the book rather undesirable. The book was rather boring all in all, I would not recommend it for an enjoyable read. If your having your child read this book for school and learning, fine then, It does indeed have valuable information concerning ninth century background, but if you want a nice book to enjoy, this is not the one for you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rich in useful compounds (SHORT review)","review":"This book makes learning and finding Kanji really simple.I've found quite a bit of kanji. The best thing about this dictionary is ALL the compounds. I've found for Kanji for YuGi (from Yu Gi Oh), because i knew the reading for it. I've found the Kanji on Goku's gi in this dictionary because i used the radical look up method. the stroke count look up method would have worked well also because its a really clear kanji.I'd recommend this book over the Kanji Learners Dictionary. Its somehow clearer. Plus you also get the meaning of radicals, which the aforementioned book doesn't do (from what i've seen). This is useful for a chunk of kanji. There are some radicals that have are have meanings that really make sense in the Kanji that use them. These are kinds of radicals are A LOT of Kanji. so you can make better associations in your head.That said, a nice compliment to that would be a book on Chinese character history. See how Linguistics impacts our lives?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"Difficult to read, minimum of information, and no sample usage. Only an english definition and a kana pronounciation to go with each word. This is my least favorite Kanji dictionary.Instead, check out the Kodansha's Kanji Learner's Dictionary (ISBN 4-7700-2855-5) which is easy to read, with great explanations, wonderful lookup systems, and demonstrates the kanji as used in REAL words. Each kanji has meaning, but are rarely used by themselves in Japanese.

There is apparently no system at all in Kodansha and you are left to pore laboriously through four pages of compounds, one by one.

If the kanji happens to be an affix (attached to the ends of words), then no compounds will be listed.Second, it does not give all the connotations that a single kanji will have. Why is the kanji for 'north' used in the word for 'defeat'? This dictionary won't tell you.For these reasons I would recommend insteadThe Kodansha Kanji Learner's DictionaryIt uses romaji instead of kana, but don't let that deter you; you'll get plenty of practice reading kana outside of your kanji dictionary. It's learning kanji that's the hard part."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Complaints","review":"Perfect book. Everything I look up is in here and then some. I have absolutely no complaints. This book has helped me tremendously in my studying.All the nearly 2000 kanji are arranged by radical and then by number of strokes in the radical. There is a stroke index and on and kun reading index in the back. As well as a stroke index for the radicals. However, you will need to learn kana, because there is no romaji, but kana are very easy to learn and you can find a chart anywhere and learn them in 2-3 weeks easily.Beginning through advanced readers will find this astronomically helpful, especially those with a focus on becoming literate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"This dictionary is great. It doesn't have every single kanji, so if you are a kanji master, this isn't the dictionary for you. But if you are a student who knows 15 - 1500 kanji, and you can read hiragana and katakana, this is the best choice for a dictionary.Just to correct one thing that Nihongoohanaseru said:The dictionary does list the readings. After they list the kanji, first they list the onyomi, then the compounds, and then the kunyomi (each set is seperated by a marker on the left hand side). For those who don't know kanji too well, the onyomi is the reading used when the kanji is used in a compound. The kunyomi is used when the kanji is by itself, or with certain okurigana (certain hiragana or katakana that goes along with the kunyomi)."},{"rating":"2","title":"This'll make you go 'frrt'","review":"This TV show is hilarious for anyone that likes alterntive humor such as ATHF, Ventur Bros, Ugly Americans and the like.

I have since found out that many women live ordinary lives with only minimal disruption caused by this disease.

The featured players are also excellent and rank with their originators.This cast album is two discs and includes more music than the original cast album. That's also a nice plus.What impressed me most about the album is the stunning reduction of the orchestrations. I believe the original orchestra of Sunday in the Park with George had 12-14 musicians in the pit. That number has been reduced to a reed player, a violinist, a celloist and two keyboard players. The orchestra sounds as beautiful as the large one does and is quite nice.So, although the original cast album is wonderful, this album is fine and recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wait for the new Broadway Cast recording","review":"I just read the NYTimes review by Ben Brantley and he loved the production.

First of all, I need to say that Sunday in the Park With George is one of my favorite musicals. The soundtrack by Mandy & Bernadette will always be at the top of my list. That said, this British Cast recording is still great. The show won more Olivier Awards (England's version of the Tony Awards) than any other production last year.Comparisons to the Broadway Cast Album are necessary and inevitable. Because they're Brits, the characters speak/sing with various British accents--George is refined, Dot is northern working class, etc. This only adds to the charm. Since this is a two disk set, we get to hear more of the show this time, especially more of the dialog. The only negative is that the orchestrations are simpler than the original, and I sometimes miss the fuller sounds.I've had this CD for over a year now and find myself listening to it even more than the New York recording thes days."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entirely unlistened to...","review":"Having only seen the show live and never heard the recording of the cast, I can only advise anyone thinking of spending money on this album to consider spending a few more pennies and hearing the experience live. Sondheim is an auteur I have never spent time listening to. I had always associated him with \\"what is not to like?\\" New York, an entity that has pervaded a great deal of modern culture. But reducing him to those kinds of parallels is to miss the sheer beauty of the man's gift for enlightened beauty. And therein lies the greatness of Manhatten before the turn of the last century. Boy did they have it good. Shame someone had to come along and make a right mess...there is beauty here. Enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap replacement but not really a replacement","review":"I bought these to replace my 2-way fuel valves in my 1966-1977 Early Ford Bronco.First, these valves are cheap Chinese versions of an old American design that you can still buy through Parker Hanfin. I only learned this after I bought them.Second - these valves DO NOT replace the old style American valves because the common port should come out the bottom - not on the side as these are.Third - On the old American version the handle turns 180 deg to switch tank feeds. These DO NOT - they only turn 90 deg.Fourth - the Chinese design took some short cuts and the parts ARE NOT INTERCHANGEABLE so that means what I bought is useless to me.NOT RECOMMENDED if you want a quality replacement for an old American Design that you can still buy from an American manufacturer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Happy","review":"If you just want to copy your images from your CF cards and later to you computer it is good.

The ability to back up my images immediately gave me real peace of mind, and the thing really worked as advertised. Although it would freeze every now and then, I never lost any images--the only drawback was that you had to remove the battery to restart it, as it stopped responding to all button inputs.This morining, as I was preparing for a 5-day shoot, I turned it on to delete any old images and recharge it, and the screen was completely dead. Plugged into my PC via USB, it all still shows up, but I was totally depending on it for this upcoming weekend, and I have been totally let down.

Having bought a new D-100 I could hardly wait to get out and take a zillion pictures. I did buy one and really wish I had not. It is extremely sloooow! Better stick to a 1GB card because the batteries won't make it through a 2GB card. Give up on playback - it is just too slow to be worthwhile at all. Oh yes, forget payback through the TV as it is supposed to do - the pictures look terrible on a standard TV and are very slow to load. Audience will die waiting for the next picture. All in all - it has been a terrible experience. I did solve my problem - I bought an iPod and it works just as advertised. Now I can't even seem to be able to give away the CoolWalker. Best offer I've had was $50. Nikon should stick with what they do well - make cameras. Love my camera, but their software sucks as does the not very cool CoolWalker."},{"rating":"2","title":"First impressions","review":"The main reason for choosing this unit among the many existing in the market was its reiability. It has many good points, it is simple to use, needs just on buttom to transfer all the images contained in the card, the speed is not its strongest point but works fine enough. The menu is simple and straightforward with absolute clear instructions. The weak point is its software. It presents a rigid date based folder system which cannot be changed to suit different tastes. It has to be organized after the transfer has been made. A second fault I find is that it does not work with Nikon transfer application and files have to be transferred to the PC using normal copy instructions. For its role as a small substitute of the laptop I have been using till now, it works perfectly as a primary portable storing device. Now it fits into my photo bag when travelling which is quite the advantage I have been looking for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite an exxagerated tale","review":"Throughout the book, Sonny talks about one of the Oakland Chapters members, who he referrs to as Cincinatti. Now, whether this person is himself or not, I think that this person has imbibed in way too many foreign substances. There's multiple stories of running around and talking to ghosts, taking ghosts for rides on their motorcycles, then hooking the ghost up with ol' ladies in the ghost world, etc. There were other typical Sonny Barger hidden slams about other clubs selling their old ladies in houses of ill repute, when in reality, it's much more believable were it to have been a confession. Either way, I really like the quote from Freewheelin Frank in his own book (a 60's paperback, now out of print) where he Quotes Sonny as saying: \\"When I make money from the patches on my back, I will no longer be a Hell's Angel\\". Bravo. And to think, ghosts riding on your motorcycle, eh?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Was expecting to read something interesting about the self-proclaimed \\"legend,\\" but it was a collection of stories whose truth was always questioned, EVEN BY THE BOOK ITSELF. The foreword warned that not all the stories were true. Then, after a more-interesting story, the next story sharted with \\"Now this story is true, I swear it...\\" Lame.There are much more interesting motorcycle stories (and better writing) on the 'Net. This book was filled with swear words thrown in the oddest places, there was no flow between the stories, the characters were confusing, maybe they needed the money and hurried the book to market, I dunno.The Zimmermans' first book on Sonny was much better, in spite of Sonny coming across as narcissistic as he did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good","review":"I agree 100% with the review questioning whether Sonny ran out of material; sure looks that way. The major problem with the book is that, except for a few very good passages (which is why I gave it 2 stars instead of one) it is just not interesting (then again, I almost dropped it back to 1 after reading one completely disgusting story about a biker's first success with the girl of his dreams; did they really have to include this?).In his ongoing attempt to clean up the biker 1%er image, portraying them as basically good guys who raise a little hell once in a while rather than real outlaws, Barger is forced to abandon what I'm sure would be infinitely more interesting stories. Overall really not worth the time or money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Adequate, but barely.","review":"Although this book was entertaining, it is hardly the best book out there for tales of 'cyclers. I did enjoy the tale of the poor girl who got [...] on a Panhead that was trash. And the story about the guy who picked up a ghost was entertaining, even if it was hardly believable. Many of the stories were just too short and seemed to have no point. I point here in example the story about the kid who saw a bunch of 'cyclers going to a funeral. Big whoop. Keeping to stories of adventure would have been better, but many of these stories do't even fit the subtitle \\"Hell-Raising\\".

The booked lacked reader appeal for me, hence I was not compelled to return tothe book after several chapters had been read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stories from the road.","review":"This isn't really a biography, but more of a collection of stories from Sonny Barger. A lot of them are very funny, and some of them are tales from the road that would make anyone want to hop on a motorcycle. The problem with this book is the introduction when Sonny Barger tells you that some of the stories may be true, and some of them may not be true. He leaves it up to you as you read, but either way the stories are fun to read, and some of them will have you laughing for quite awhile. He even goes outside of the Hell's Angels into other clubs he's aware of and other people he knows sharing stores from them, one of them was on the Dragons leader who was about to buy a Honda until his club members knocked on his door and asked him if it was true."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Disappointed!!","review":"Jeez, aside from about 30 pages of goodness about Steve Mcqueen and a few old-time H/A stories-which are told using lame-o aliases and seem to be recalled through a certain haze...this is just a steamin' pile of crap.

What can I say, I have all the respect in the world for Barger, the H/A's, whatever, but I didn't pay money to read about a yuppie's BMW road trip. Seriously.I just expected better from somebody who has better stories than this (really, he's gotta have better stories...Son-come on, you don't have better than this??).

One made in 1977 with Steve McQueen un the starring role of Dr. Stockman, and a 1990 made for TV version, produced for PBS on an adaptation by Arthur Miller and with John Glover in the role of Dr. Stockman. The 1977 version with Steve McQueen is far superior. In the 1990 version John Glover is much too hyper. He is often just plain silly--or even stupid--and he does not make standing up for truth appear very noble. Actually, this film nullifies the entire intent of the play as written by Ibsen in that it discredits the whole idea of standing up for truth and right.Steve McQueen's performance is sensitive to Ibsen's original intent, a very fine piece of work.I would strongly recommend that anyone considering purchase of this film insist on getting the 1997 Steve McQueen version.I would have to struggle to give the John Glover version two stars. For Steve McQueen I would happily assign five."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible in Comparison","review":"After seeing this, it is criminal that the far superior Steve McQueen film version is not available on VHS of DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kroenke 30 years of DB Experience, 0 years writing an Errata","review":"My first Amazon review.I read the 7th Edition for my graduate student class in Databases.

The complete neglect of non Microsoft products make this book incomplete at best, and present a very skewed view of the database world."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's actually very good...","review":"I find it difficult to believe that there are too many errors strewn throughout the book. Most of the examples are in basic SQL, so some tailoring might be required for it to fit your individual DBMS. Of course, you can always go to the last chapters for practical applications using proprietary software.This leads me to remind the buyer that the book is about concepts and design, not Oracle/MySQL/Java etc etc programming. It teaches you things you might have missed if taught informally, such as database normalization and the use of various keys.For what it claims to be, it suits the job quite well, and is very detailed in how it describes database design and common pitfalls.Again, this is not a dedicated programming book, and only teaches design concepts and standards."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"Ridiculously overpriced, even for a textbook. There are actual mistakes littered throughout the book and the accompanying slides that were provided to the professor.

Somehow after all these editions I don't think they've gone through and cleaned it up with the latest one.Maybe you think I'm just bitter because a new edition came out just in time for me to not be able to sell my 9th ed. back to the bookstore.

We are using this book for our Intro to Database class, and NO ONE is understanding it (there are two sections of this class, and the other section doesn't understand it either). My professor, who builds databases for a living, had to read chapters 3 and 4 about 4 times just to understand what the author was trying to say. I'm not going to say that this is a bad book, I'm just saying that it isn't a good book for beginners. It should be more for graduate-level students.

The questions he uses are very difficult to understand and often are misleading.The answer key is missing, so understanding or checking your grasp of the material must wait until officially tested. Which is now too late, the concepts roll into each other. His vocabulary, used to describe a condition, is incredibly vast. So unnecessary. Too many definitions, not enough examples where to use the concepts.Bashes MS and Access to excess. Nothing in the instructions how to find SQL or install it or use it, so you are forced to us Access which when you query, is broken by some of his sample SQL statements.Finally, many examples and conditions are explained along with his terminology which he says no one uses!!

Some say, the book is always better than the movie, in this case though both book and movie are beautiful, but each in their own way.The book draws so much more depth and power (which is of course only hinted in the movie). It is written with a foreign musicality to it. Sentences are structured in ways that communicate the main character's unusual background--a French girl living in prewar Indochina.

The girl, Marguerite, develops a sexual relationship with a Chinese man, referred to only as the man from Chinon. This book is a commentary on the racism of the period in French Indochina, but it is also a commentary on love in the modern era, despite taking place in the colonial period.Marguerite's experiences, beginning this sexual relationship, lustful in nature and not based on true love, presents \\"love\\" as an object of desire. It is a story of childhood development but also of the pressures of rising adulthood. Marguerite is shaped by this experience, as her memories dictated at a later point reveal, transforming how the man from Chinon is presented as well as how she relates with her family.

The idea behind seemed interesting and helpful. However, half the time I really had no idea what the author was talking about, and on top of that he rambles about the same thing FOREVER. I ended up skimming the chapters just to get the reading over with. I almost feel like he was more interested in wowing readers with his vocabulary than trying to explain other writers' ideas about style. Things that could take about 10 pages to say, it takes him 30. And by the end of the chapter, you still don't really have any idea what the point was because he never actually tells you. The only good thing about this book was the quotes. So, if you are required to take a class, and this book is what you need for the class, just don't take the class. This book is that bad.

Not in a good way, either.I don't usually put sugar or milk in any of my tea-- I am one of those people who drinks strong black chais straight up. So this is a complete killer for me. If you like super sweet teas, this may be for you, but I don't understand why they would put a sweetener in their tea. If they're going to do that, perhaps they should make a separate version without the Stevia.I won't be purchasing this again, and I continue my hunt for very strong sleepytime teas that aren't sweet, fruity, or minty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stevia","review":"Tea helps relaxation when not boiled, try boiling water and putting two iced cubes in water before steeping.

I stuck it out while cleaning the bathroom and it seemed just the right thing to listen to while scrubbing the toilet.I noticed while in the library that there were other books written by this author; apparently she is popular and someone actually pays her money to turn out this drivvel.

This book is about as close to a cheap Harlequin romance novel that one will get. I barely got through the book - it was awful. No mystery, no character depth, totally superficial, totally predictable, totally flat, dull, and boring. I believe that Ms. Brown mentioned that the book was written in 1982 and she should have left it there. Touted as a \\"classic love story, I found absolutely nothing \\"classic\\" about this book.

Kevin Spacey's \\"Prot\\" presented himself as a likable and quite knowledgable visitor from another planet. Of course, Dr. Mark Powell, played by Jeff Bridges was the all too human psychiatrist, assigned to uncover the inner self of his \\"delusional\\" patient. But it was however, difficult to explain Prot's rather unusual characteristics such as his capacity to see ultraviolet light, an arcane knowledge of the stars, and to seemingly disappear at will, among other things. These things were all used as beautiful set-up for a fresh approach to an interesting premise, but then the film suddenly bogged down as if the writers were at a loss and said to themselves \\"okay, now what do we do?\\" The film, in my opinion slipped badly starting with the hypnotic trance scenes. So in the end, the viewer was free to fill in the blanks with a personal take on the question of the moment. Was he real or was he Memorex?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Some people just don't understand...","review":"I can't fathom how anybody can hate this movie. Kevin Spacey and Jeff Bridges are absolutely phenomenal. What a great story. I watch this movie over and over and it captivates me every time. The music is perfect...the acting is perfect...the story is gripping. People are upset because the film never fully explains itself in the end. It allows the viewer to interperet the film's meaning on their own and draw their own conclusions. I have my own, but due to the risk of offending certain demographs, my thoughs shall remain my own. Besides...I would hate it if a first time viewer were to read this review and have a picture already in their head. Watch this fantastic film and make up your own mind and don't let anybody tell you that your interperetation is wrong! There is no such thing as a incorrect interperetation of a piece of artwork be it a sculpture, piece of music, or a film with imagery like this!P.S. - BUY THE SOUNDTRACK, TOO! It's absolutely incredible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Look in yourself","review":"The ability to heal is in all of us. It does not matter whether Prot is from K-Pax or earth. What is important is that humanity sometimes alienates individuals who then as a self-fulfilling prophecy alienate themselves. Prot was the alien necessary to re-socialize the alienated.Personally I think this goes a lot further than mental conditions because a lot of physical conditions are caused by our minds, thus healing these will also lie within our own minds.If you believe that you can heal, you will heal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spacey is AMAZING!","review":"Great acting by both Spacey and Bridges.

And all of the other characters did a nice job, too..."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you must, rent... but don't buy","review":"I really wanted to like this movie because the concept has such potential. But, it had so many [incorrect] scenes! Arrested just for saying you're from another planet, in NY? The ... hypnosis scenes which take up most of the last half of the movie.

This one isn't even funny. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Remake... no more","review":"Film lovers know this movie is no more than the Hollywood version of the awarded Argentinan film \\"Hombre mirando al sudeste\\" (Man facing southeast) of 1986. The difference however, is that the latter is way more profound and philosophic. For those interested, I highly recommend the Argentinan film, although it is very difficut to get outside Latin America, especially with english subtitles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Man Facing Southeast remake?","review":"In the credits no reference is made to the remarquable 1986 Argentinean film \\"Man Facing Southeast\\". Even if there is no admitted connection between the two, K-PAX could easily be mistaken for a remake of this movie, and not a very good remake at that. It lacks the deapt and refinement of the \\"original\\". So why bother with K-PAX, if you can find \\"Man Facing Southeast\\" treat yourself to a real masterpiece, one of the best movies ever made."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shoot this one into outer space.","review":"With movies like *American Beauty*, *Pay It Forward*, the recently released *The Shipping News*, and this turkey, *K-PAX*, the name of Kevin Spacey is becoming associated in my mind with mawkish, pretentious, and just downright bad films. In this one, he plays Prot, who is either a genuine spaceman or just a garden-variety madman. No matter which, really: he's annoying either way. Spacey phones this performance in (from outer space?), content to hide behind a pair of dark sunglasses and his trademark smug smirk. His co-star, Jeff Bridges, as the psychiatrist who is reluctant to believe that Prot is really an alien, is humiliatingly subordinate -- constantly made a fool of by the Spacey character, constantly one-upped. (Even the cover art for the DVD conveys this.) Surely Bridges deserves better . . . to say nothing of the audience."},{"rating":"2","title":"the ending blew it","review":"the ending [was not good]. i wont tell what happens. it will just ruin a already horrid ending. the acting was good and funny. it was excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intriguing!","review":"This is a great movie that manages to intertwine psychological and philosophical aspects. Kevin Spacey as Prot is incredible and Jeff Bridges as a psychiatrist is extremely good too. The story is complex in many ways and at the same time perplexing to the viewer. Is Prot really from the planet K-Pax or is he suffering from some psychological disorder, in this case most likely multiple personality disorder? I am not even sure that the ending provides a reasonable explanation. See this movie, it will make you think!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought provoking and good story telling","review":"K-PAX is in the elite class of movies that combines a good story with thought provoking ideas.The movie hinges on the ambiguity of \\"Prot\\" as either an alien or simply deranged. Although the ambiguity diminishes as the story unfolds, we are never entirely sure about \\"Prot\\": his ability to sketch the orbit of his home planet, the disappearance of his fellow space traveller, and other enticing aspects of the character remain unresolved to the end. Regardless of our take on Prot as an alien, the movie is a testament to the ability of the imagination to transcend the most trying of circumstances, and also to the very tangible and positive effects of our beliefs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally something different","review":"Well done, hats off, creative, brilliant, thought provoking, funny and exciting. Finally a movie with some thought and great performances by both Kevin and Jeff. You can always tell actors that have talent because they keep you interested in what they are doing and can convince you that there character is real. After the movie is over this will stimulate great conversation with the person your with. I liked it because it really could be? Right? Maybe? Maybe kind of wish? This is wonderful entertainment and a great DVD to add to your collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd rather watch the un-credited original movie...","review":"...although I really like Kevin Spacey. He's a great actor and he does a great job in here, but 'Man facing South-East' the original Argentinean movie was way better than the american version.And I still can't believe that the director won't recognize that the movie was 101% based on that south-american gem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding! - And Nice","review":"The creative staff for this film deserve a gold wreath and the two stars, Kevin Spacey and Jeff Bridges, the Gold Wreath with clusters, for a fine film with that very nice feel to it that rarely verges on the maudlin. One need apply no logic of science principles to the reality of the film. The reality of the film is the romance of fiction. In fiction, anything can be real, if it is made to seem so, anything can be unreal if it meets the same criterion. In this film, both alternatives as to the identity of the k-paxian are made to seem equally really thus equally acceptable. The two stars are superb, the supporting players do their job well. Recommended for everyone who can use a little escape in his or her life."},{"rating":"2","title":"WHAT HAPPENED TO BESS??????","review":"Now, I know what some of you will think, but here we go. What if Prot or \\"Prote\\" was actually some being from K-PAX that could take the form of humans or take over the apperance of them sort of like a parasite and a host????????????? We are convinced that Kevin Spacey's character is in fact Robert Porter, but who's to say that Prot did not \\"take over\\" Robert's body??????

He was perfect. The whole show was really well done, in my opinion. However, for the life of me, I cannot understand ==WHY== they would not have made it known, as the book did, that Prot considered Robert Porter his 'host' while he was here on earth. That one detail makes all the difference at the end!My husband and I watched this movie together. He had not read the book, and was a little annoyed at the ending of the movie. When I told him what the book had implied about the host thing, he commented that he was so glad I had read it so I could tell him that. So that's why I'm telling this for anyone else who's thinking about seeing this cool show, but who hasn't read the book. =o)(BTW, it would have been 5 stars if they had included that one detail....)"},{"rating":"2","title":"No special effects, this one's all in the noggen","review":"It's a great story, really well thought out. Spacey is aloof enough to be convincing as the alien traveler. I love movies like this that can succesfully make you use your own imagination to visualize something with an engrossing story.

The plot is almost the same but that's where the similarities end. \\"Man Facing Southeast\\" was an intelligent movie while this was a slow moving, dissapointing mess.From the first scene I knew it was not a very good script. Why was Kevin Spacey's character arrested and taken to a mental hospital, just for saying he was from another planet? Come on, this is Grand Central in New York. Do you think New York police arrest every nut on the street without any valid reason? It just seemed that much of the action in this film was forced, just to move the plot along with no regard for some semblance of reality.Some great actors were totally wasted in this film. Better luck next time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes you think......","review":"This is an excellent movie! I will watch it more than once.If you have seen Starman, featuring Jeff Bridges, it has sortof the same tone as that movie. Kevin Spacey is very believableas Prot.

Outstanding acting by giants Spacey and Bridges combine with an intelligent script and masterful photography (cinematographer John Mathieson also worked on \\"Hannibal\\" and \\"Gladiator\\") to create a unique piece of art that refuses to be easily categorized into any genre.It offers a thought-provoking insight into modern society and the human condition in general.The DVD is con-genial with a reference-quality image and excellent, if somewhat subtle, sound.The black-and-white \\"making of\\" photographs by Jeff Brigdes himself, found in a little gallery in the \\"special features\\" section, are truly remarkable.

The problem is that the uniform company only does even numbered waist sizes. I wear an odd number waist size so I purchased the pants hoping they would fit right and also because they had the exact color as my work uniform. The pants arrived and actually fit very well. The only problem I encountered was the price, It's a little high compared to Walmart which offered the pants about $5.00 less per pair. The reason I didn't purchase from Wally World is that they didn't offer the right color to match my uniform.

As a short, slim guy it makes finding comfortable and well-fitting pants very easy. My only complaint is that these pants do run small. I normally wear a 30 or 31 waist and ended up buying a 33 waist. The return/exchange was easy. In fact, it was much less hassle than returning them to my local mall!The pants themselves are sturdy and tough. They straddle the line between looks and function- I can wear them everyday for work but they still look nice enough for a family dinner. They are great for people with kids, being easy to clean and extremely stain resistant. I wish the pockets were a pit deeper but that's about all I'd change."},{"rating":"2","title":"Traditional Dickies Workwear","review":"Purchased these pants for my retired farmer father.

The material and workmanship is tough enough to wear in the field, and the look is professional enough to wear in the office. The only thing that keeps these pants from being five stars is the fact that they take a while to wear in and get comfortable. When they first arrive, you will notice the fabric is fairly stiff and a bit scratchy against the skin, but after they've been worn and washed a few times they soften up and get comfortable. You will find the fabric and colors are nearly identical to some lines of Dickies work shirts as well, which is nice if you need a uniform look."},{"rating":"1","title":"waist does not fit","review":"Waist is not true to size just like many dickies products, its better if you just go to a store and try them on first"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tight and small","review":"These pants, for me, where a bit tighter than I thought it would be, also stiffer and smaller than I had hoped."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent service","review":"Exactly what I needed, cheaper than the retailer, fast service!

It looks like it was done on a much more modest budget than any of the Blake Edwards films. Despite the Clouseau character, this isn't nearly as madcap as it should have been, and often comes across as a made-for-TV 60s comedy. Alan Arkin's done much better work than this and to his credit does his best to make the character his own rather than an impersonation. Die-hard fans of the series will probably want to see this movie for the sake of completeness. But without Peter Sellers, Blake Edwards and Henry Mancini is there any reason to have a Pink Panther movie?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not The Best!","review":"This is Definately not The Best Pink Panther film. It is not as good as the other ones that I've seen. I've only seen The Pink Panther {1964}, A Shot In The Dark, this one, and The Pink Panther {2006}. If you are into the Pink Panther series just for Peter Sellers, you won't like this one. This film has a great cast.Alan Arkin as Inspector Jacques Clouseau, Frank Finlay as Supt. Weaver, Barry Foster as Addison Steele, Patrick Cargill as Commisioner Sir Charles Braithwaite, Beryl Reid as the crazed Mrs. Weaver, Clive Francis as Johnny Rainbow, and introducing Delia Boccardo as Lt. Lisa Morrel. You will definately laugh hysterically. As Inspector Clouseau says, \\"There's a time for laughing and a time for not laughing- and this is not one of them!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Brutal","review":"This is brutal. Arkin is terrible as the Chief Inspector. Clouseau is inept as a detective, but unfortunately Arkin is more inept than Clouseau in this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did Arkin even watch the other versions?","review":"I had not heard of this film until I found it in a bargin bin at one of my local DVD shops. For a few dollars I thought it might be worth a go,......wrong! This had to be one of the worst spinoffs that I have ever come across. It makes me wonder if the script writers and Arkin had even bothered to watch any of the other versions. Arkin comes across as an arrogant tot, not like the much beloved fumbling fool as we have come to know in other films. The language he uses it nothing like what we have come to expect from the inspector, and the accents are some of the worst on screen, and if not for the scenery of the day, it's hard to find anything worth watching in this film. I had to fast forward to the end, just to see if there might be anything of interest. Unless you can find this for a dollar in a used ex-rental bin, don't bother with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brave attempt","review":"I'm a great fan of the Pink Panther series and a great fan of Alan Arkin. Some reviewers make much of the fact that Arkin doesn't attempt to recreate Sellers character bringing his own take to the film. I, however, believe in not following the formula more closely than he did as created by Sellers in the first two movies, some of Clousseau is also lost. The opening segment of the Inspector disembarking the plane is about as close as the character gets to the one we know so well. Sure, there are flashes of humour throughout but at times you're left questioning whether your watching a comedy or a drama. If you're a die hard fan by all means purchase this for posterity but don't expect it to see the light of day from the shelf too often if at all. As much as it tries to emulate it's predecessors it never quite makes the grade."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inspector C-lose-owwww!!","review":"Despite the presence of screen great Alan Arkin in the title role, INSPECTOR CLOUSEAU mostly falls on its face. I think the problem with this movie is that the character of Clouseau was still in its infancy - leaving Arkin (and the writers) little to go on. There is no Chief Inspector Dreyfus. No Phantom. No Cato. No Pink Panther.It wasn't until THE RETURN OF THE PINK PANTHER that Inspector Clouseau became a huge success. And that was because he became more of an overblown - but lovable - cartoonish character.I will have to admit that the musical score by Ken Thorne is one of the few highlights of the movie. His main title theme ranks amongst those of the immortal Henry Mancini.Interestingly enough, INSPECTOR CLOUSEAU is better than any of the Pink Panther movies which followed after Peter Seller's passing."},{"rating":"1","title":"For Continuity Freaks Only","review":"Hey, I like have a complete set of films in my collection for each franchise. So, this is part of the Pink Panther legacy and although Arkin tries, he's no Peter Sellers and the plot is so weak that it collapses at the end and the movie finishes so fast you'll think that that ran out of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"And now for something not so different after all","review":"I overcame my reservations about this movie because, well, it has Alan Arkin. He's funny, right?Well not in this thing, though you can tell that he's trying, but he's dealing with lousy direction, a horrible script, and he's trying to play a character that has been definitively played by one of the comic geniuses of the century.The plot, as feeble as can be expected for the genre, would actually have some interesting potential if it could have exploited today's digital technology. Imagine a dozen Clouseau's bumping into each other as they all accidentally rob the same bank.I haven't seen the other Clouseau flicks recently enough to remember if they all were like this, but this G-rated flick had enough gay innuendo to almost consider that this was brilliantly hidden subversive material. Somehow, though, I doubt it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nancy Wilson, Live in Las Vegas","review":"Another classic artist from the past.

I only started collecting her music last year after seeing clips on Youtube. I think that she had one of the greatest voices in Jazz/Pop history. However I was dissapointed with \\" Nancy Wilson Live from Las Vegas\\". She is not in good voice on this disc. It sounds like she is suffering from \\"Vegas Throat\\". Her voice sounds husky, rough and tired. Her signature belting, breath control, flexibility, lovely soft notes, and vibrato are not present. In addition the song choices are not inspired, although I did enjoy her version of \\"Black is Beautiful\\".

Then, inexplicably, Nagata changes pace and it slows considerably.After losing the science/thriller pace, the story leaves doesn't drive to a full examination of the theme; other central characters, including the enigmatic \\"Mother Tiger,\\" remain forever obscured by mystery.Entertaining, but the utterly profound examination of the central question, having been abandoned, the novel languishes. After almost finishing, I left the remaining 40 pages or so many days before I summoned up the gumption to finish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Setup for a Sequel","review":"Nagata sets up the big questions in this book and then punts at the end. Her maturation as a writer happens right in front of our eyes but don't buy this book. The ending can only be described as 1) A cliffhanger designed to get you to buy the sequel, or 2) A failure of literary courage. In either case, this is editorial irresponsibility at its most heinous. Even the most transparent first book of a series resolves the major plot elements and answers the questions raised by the narrative. Not this time.None of this would matter if Nagata had written just another media tie-in, dumbed down and evanescent as rime. But it isn't. As Norman Spinrad noted in his review in the March 2002 Asimov's, this is a spectacularly well-written tale for literate adults, all too rare in the current market. If you must have more Nagata, enjoy the setup but don't expect a payoff. It isn't there"},{"rating":"2","title":"No shrinking violet!","review":"Possibly the decade's boldest voice in speculative fiction. Most writers hobble and contort their ideas to fit a preconceived plot or theme, but Nagata's mind appears to be wired exponentially.The idea of brain-enhancing implants is hardly new, but until LIMIT OF VISION, we had never seen a full-throttle treatment. Nagata carries the idea to its logical conclusion, and while the fears of the technologically timid are duly noted, they're shown little mercy by the steamroller of progress. The future is coming on fast whether we want it or not, and the author's point rings true: it's way more fun to be _on_ the steamroller than under it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fine Effort from One of Nanotech SF's Best Writers","review":"I concur with a previous reviewer who finds Nagata's \\"Limit of Vision\\" to be an inferior repetition of Greg Bear's splendid \\"Blood Music\\". Although Nagata does an excellent job describing LOVs and the politics of the mid 21st Century, her writing never seems as sharp or as lyrical as Bear's. Still I must commend Nagata for writing a fine debut hardcover novel. Fans of nanotechnological science fiction and hard science fiction will unable embrace Nagata's latest novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST READ","review":"This book is probably THE most informative book I have ever read, irregardless of the subject.

He falls in love with Nancy Sinatra, and that's about it for the plot.The only saving grace is that the cast is better than average. It's quite interesting to see Elvis act alongside \\"Lucy\\" regular Gale Gordon. The songs are a little better than average, especially the quite good \\"Let Yourself Go\\".Again, it's not that bad.

Elvis just looks embarrassed by the whole mess.The songs are awful, some daft song about the IRS(!) but the worst is Your Groovy Self by the aforementioned Nancy, out of tune, looking terrible and, well, just awful.This would have disappeared into oblivion if it had not been for big E who just sleepwalks through this mess.Truly awful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get white teeth for a decent price.","review":"LOVE.

With this info, I used the strips with good results and no discomfort.If you're wondering what it feels like to use these, it's very similar to getting an x-ray or mold at the dentist.

Some gripes: I wish they made the upper strip longer to cover more of the upper teeth and I wish they had cut the lower strip better because you can very well see 3/4 of an inch wasted when you peel off the lower strip from its plastic backing.

The strips are really hard to put on, and they only cover a 8 teeth, when 10 teeth show when you smile.

The strips are hard to keep on for 20 minutes, and the product tastes gross.I paid 40 bucks for these, and half are still in the box. I went out and bought the 20 dollar Rembrant set with the gel and trays and it works so much better. The gel stays on the teeth and tastes like a pleasant toothpaste. It whitens and the trays are easy to keep in. I will throw-out the Crest strips, if I can't give them away...do not use them!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Barely Noticeable Difference After Two Boxes","review":"I'm 19 and tried Crest Whitestrips Premium expecting great results. After finishing one box and using it correctly, my teeth were maybe half a shade whiter. Since Crest will send a free box to anyone who is unhappy with their results (awesome offer), I requested a box and it arrived within three weeks. I used the second box and it whitened my teeth maybe another half a shade. Overall my teeth are basically the same shade. I was hoping that the Whitestrips would actually whiten my teeth, but they are still yellow! They are also a little hard to keep on, but it gets easier with each use."},{"rating":"2","title":"overall this is among the best whitening products I've tried","review":"I have used these for a while and I have seen results with them. They are easy to apply and usually stay on for the full time once they are applied. If the strips start to fall off (and that is rare) I just press them firmly back into place with a cotton swab and that usually does the job. I did take off one star because at times they can be somewhat painful because of the added pressure. Overall the Crest Strips are among the best whitening products I have used."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Pretty Good","review":"The whitestrips worked pretty good. I experienced no sensitivity, and only minor burning to my gums. I can't really say how well it works long term, but the short term effects were good. Overall the product is a great value and a good buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Close to expire","review":"This is a very good product, and a good price for it, but they send me the product close to expire, that's the only thing that I don't like."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't stay in place","review":"Can't really judge how well they work becuase they keep sliding around on my teeth. Within a few miinutes on putting them on they're sliding and I haven't been able to keep them on my teeth more than about 10 minutes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't use again","review":"I used the white strips once, but didn't even finish the package because they're such a hassle. I found that after a while the strips simply stop adhering to my teeth and I literally can't keep them in place inside my mouth for the recommended time - they end up wadding up like plastic wrap. Since I had braces, my teeth are very straight, so I switched to Aquafresh white trays, which worked out much better for me as they are VERY easy to keep in place."},{"rating":"1","title":"okay.","review":"not all that, i somewhat think that i saw a change in my teeth but i think it was my imagination lol. it was annoying trying to adjust them & whatnot. its best to do the upgrade. well at least i like the taste lol."},{"rating":"1","title":"dont waste your time or money","review":"these strips don't whiten your teeth AT ALL, even if they did the bottom strip only covers 6 teeth so you would look stupid with both white and yellow teeth when you smile. You should use trays and gel, it gives you great results and dosen't cost half as much as these strips....stay away!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe I wasted my time doing that.","review":"I'm a coffee/tea drinker; I bought the stripes to try to combat some yellowness from that. I wasn't expecting supermodel teeth-- just a noticeable improvement. The bottom line is that they didn't work. I can think of a million things I wish I'd bought with the money instead.I also experienced the tooth sensitivity that other reviewers have described. It has been 3 days since I stopped using them, and my gums still do not feel right. I cannot believe this is truly a safe product for repeated use.In addition, I am a small person with small teeth. The stripes barely covered enough teeth for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"OUCH!","review":"I bought the TARGET brand. This is my first day and I did notice a difference - a little whiter.. But omg.. it hurt. I never thought I had sensitive gums.. but OUCH OUCH! And I barely made it through the time needed!! And my mouth is still tingling.. not to mention my tongue hurts... so I think I will do it once a day at the most. BTW.. I have been through childbirth and have a high tolerance to pain.. but... this was just REALLY uncomfortable."},{"rating":"1","title":"EMPTY BOX","review":"I opened up the crest strips to \\"NO AVAIL\\" it was completly empty with the instructions I am asking for a refund I will let you know what happens..

If you have very sensitive teeth I would recommend using crest regular (14 days) system. It's more mild, takes longer, but gentle on the teeth.easy to use and really works!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My teeth are definitely whiter!","review":"Well these strips work great. I'm always skeptical about products like this because I've rarely known a quick-fix product to work for me, and I think alot of the time the results are all in the consumer's head. I also never have the patience to go through the entire duration instructed on the box. However, I've been using this product for two days now, and I already notice a difference, and my friends do too. I can only imagine how white my teeth will be at the end of the week. The fact that it only takes a week is worth it to me, too.The only reason I don't give this product 5 stars is because it is making my teeth ridiculously sensitive! I've had my mouth closed for an hour now and the pain still hasn't subsided. I might just be a big baby, but it's a very intense tingling, that of which I'm not sure I can handle for the entire week. However, all in all I do recommend this product and I doubt your experience will be as painful as mine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick and easy and super cheap (compared to dentist!)","review":"I bought this because my teeth were beginning to yellow. My dentist (of course) suggested that I use an in-office whitening system that would cost a LOT of money. I decided I would give the Crest system a shot before I took the plunge with the dentist. This worked GREAT. In a couple of days my teeth had already begun to get lightened. Now, after the whole 7 days, I am pleased. They could be whiter for sure but they are absolutely good enough (especially at only $25). Application was pretty easy - be sure to press down the strip as much as possible as a lot of saliva collects while they are on. I got a little tender but nothing I would even remotely describe as painful. I am super glad I bought these!"},{"rating":"2","title":"White Strips Review","review":"Im suprised, these things actually work. The stuff left on your teeth puts a bad taste in your mouth but I guess thats the price of whiter teeth. Could have made them a little whiter but overall I'm satisfyed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crest Doesn't Live Up To Its Guarantee","review":"These white strips didn't do a darn thing for me, not even a tiny bit whiter. What really galls me is the \\"guarantee or your money back\\". I sent in my receipt along with the bar code, just as instructed, and never received anything back - this was 5 months ago."},{"rating":"1","title":"my teeth are in screaming pain","review":"After the first application I felt a little soreness on the area where I applied the strips.

Jessie drives to another diner, looking for the police station, but she found the sheriff, Dan, at the diner. The storm gets worse, and they spend the night in his small house next to the diner. Passion flares, but Jessie leaves the baby with Dan to go on and become a country singer.Tired of the touring, she decides 4 years later to come back and see what happened to the baby. Dan's brother had adopted her, but when he and his wife died, Dan took the child. He's not sure if he could trust Jessie to know this, since he was never fully convinced of her hitchhiker story, and was afraid she'd take the child back. So how could he trust his heart to her too?A very good romance, well written and recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nocturnal butterfly!","review":"Over the years, three remarkable female singers have stamped and pictured like no other, a personal trace among the most outstanding soloists of their generation. Edith Piaf in France, Elis Regina in Brazil and Billie Holiday in USA.For all of them, the voice was another musical instrument, a remarkable extension of the music regarded as a mood of expression and feeling.Tracks like Lover come back to me, God bless the child, Blue moon, Yesterdays, Willow weep for me, A fine romance and Autumn in New York (her maxim musical achievement in this compliation at least to my view), make of this album a must-have, because no one like her has suggested with such sensual vehemence, the unsaid in what the nocturnal love concerns."},{"rating":"2","title":"more than a snake book","review":"I was given this book for my 10th birthday in 1957. I've read it over and over during the 50+ years since. Kauffeld had a gift for painting pictures with words. His focus was snakes and the thrill of the hunt but I learned a lot about their haunts too... places to which I was fortunate enough to see for myself in later years. Even today, those places evoke the feelings I had as a kid viewing his adventures through it's pages.

It was hard for me to keep up with whatever was going on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Our hero, Ebenezer Scrooge","review":"I agree with what Micheal Levin writes at a website called The Daily Objectivist, Scrooge was better at the beginning! He says: \\"You know the ritual: boo the curmudgeon initially encountered in Charles Dickens's A Christmas Carol, then cheer the sweetie pie he becomes in the end. It's too bad no one notices that the curmudgeon had a point-quite a few points, in fact. There can be no arguing with Dickens's wish to show the spiritual advantages of love. But there was no need to make the object of his lesson an entrepreneur whose ideas and practices benefit his employees, society at large, and himself. Must such a man expect no fairer a fate than to die scorned and alone? Bah, I say. Humbug.\\" How could it be that an obscure website like The Daily Objectivist would have the most intelligent review of this book that I've ever seen?"},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst book ever!","review":"I know this is a classic amd you are supposed to admire the great writimg skills of Charles Dickens but this book is tortureous.

Do Not Confuse this version with any of those others. I have _this_ version on CD. I wish I could find it. I listen to it many times each Christmas season. Audio quality is good. His performance is rich and wonderful. It _is_abridged_ which I don't like, but I still recommend it.

I guess because I'm used to seeing the movies, which they have to flesh out a bit and use rich colors and holiday cheeriness, I wasn't expecting the story to be so... simple.The language (from the mid 1800s I believe) can be a bit challenging for those of us who need a little help here and there with anything beyond the modern English language, but it really wasn't too bad. I enjoyed it, but it was hard for me not to compare it to the movies and put faces to the various actors who have played the parts.It's still definitely worth a read.

Let me tell you, if anything, this is a better read if you've already seen the movie. The sense of bitter cold in London in 1840, and in Scrooge's heart, are all the more real in this slim text. Scrooge's isolation is shown to be something we have all felt at some time in our lives. His joyous redemption will evoke emotions you didn't know you had.

Reading the book allowed to take things in at my own pace: if I wanted to pause and think about a particular wording, or if I wanted to back up and re-read something, I did, and it took the experience to a whole new level.

As an English teacher, the no holds barred story penned by Dickens is essential to remember not only during the holidays, but each day before and after. My students remember the Muppets and Mickey Mouse versions, and while they are pretty good for nostalgic purposes, this read really brings about the true message of living with Christmas in your heart. To some people this may seem like a \\"dark\\" book, but that was the purpose; to scare the readers into the realization that there are consequences for our actions."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite book!","review":"I have always loved this story and read it every year.

Charles Dickens not only presents an entertaining story, but a philosophy of joy and goodwill."},{"rating":"2","title":"A gift for the eyes and the heart","review":"Innocenti's illustrations add to the beauty of Dickens' classic tale. Here are greed, lost opportunities, love and regret. Here is a story of selfishness and redemption we can all identify with. This is the perfect tale to remind one again of the selflessness of the Christmas spirit. Everyone knows this Christmas story; Dickens' narrative never grows old and his writing is beautiful by itself. Anyone who enjoys this story should own a copy with illustrations as beautiful as these full-color works.

I recently bought a nice, new hardcover edition of the novel that I can keep for years, and rereading some old passges, especially around this time of year, just warmed my soul. \\"A Christmas Carol\\" is as much a part of Christmas as Christmas trees. I have read much Dickens, but of all his books I like this the best. He writes about Christmas like no other writer. He captures the very essence of the holiday.

I'm not entirely sure if this is a true story or not, but the overly-dramatic writing made me feel like it was an attempt to minimize the struggle of those who truly have cancer. The events didn't seem to tie into the emotions in the story, unless of course the events, or the emotions, were over-exaggerated in a way that reminded me of an old college roommate I suffered through that had been diagnosed with histrionic disorder (where there drama surrounded even the smallest of things).As far as a book to help those struggling through cancer, I would recommend highly No Place Like Home by Girard, which is very beautifully written and will give the reader more of a feeling of relating to the author."},{"rating":"1","title":"This DSD is not well done","review":"George Thorogood's slide guitar playin' ROCKS!

The update removes subtleties, turns Murray's eloquence into dumbed down language, and sometimes just plain changes the meaning. No one updates Shakespeare. This update only gives a rough idea of Murray's intent, and often changes the meaning to a Gnostic drive for power. To hear what Murray really intended, by all means find an old used copy.

Bretton Truett and E.J. Kerwin ( B0000639O1 ) that is outstanding for educators. They perform most of the play and include a great deal of video analysis as well. The performances are very good and they use a modern setting which is very effective. There is also a wonderful feature that lets you get right to the text from the video and back again."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a tragedy, all right.","review":"Poor Jeremy Brett must be turning in his grave every time this film is run. This is an unintentionally hilarious version of the play that should scare the high schoolers for whom it was made 'off' the Bard forever...The problem is the director, the acting, and the costumes. The only good thing about this version of MACBETH is the script, which is still Shakespeare's... If you are fond of this actor, do yourself a favor and watch another SHERLOCK HOLMES episode, or MY FAIR LADY, instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"APPALLING DVD despite great actors","review":"I love Jeremy Brett and Piper Laurie. Their combined talents offer what few enjoyable moments there are to be found in this Macbeth, but they unfortunately can't salvage this atrocious production. Seeing it is enough to turn someone off Shakespeare. (Should that happen, Al Pacino's delightful LOOKING FOR RICHARD is the perfect antidote to restore passion for the Bard). But I digress. I want to issue a warning to all who might assume the DVD version of this Macbeth would be superior to the VHS. In this instance, tape was simply transferred unto disk with no remastering or enhancements, and there are no extra features. The visual and audio quality is appalling. I regret buying this DVD when I already owned the VHS (..like I said, I love Jeremy Brett...) The only advantage is being able to skip the boring parts to get to the monologues. But that isn't saying much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tragic Production of a Great Tragedy","review":"Unfortunately, I have to agree with just about everyone else who has reviewed here this film production of \\"Macbeth.\\" I found the video in my local library and was eagerly anticipating another fine performance by two of my favorite actors: Brett and Piper Laurie, especially Brett. I've seen and thoroughly enjoyed every one of the BBC Sherlock Holmes productions numerous times, and just recently was impressed with Brett's interpretation of Bassanio in the '73 TV production of \\"The Merchant of Venice.\\" So, imagine my great disappointment when I was amazed by how awful this \\"Macbeth\\" really is. I would prefer to not fault the actors, but can only think that the director and producer were responsible. Not to mention the costumer and the \\"set\\" designer. I would strongly advise anyone who loves Shakespeare, Brett or Laurie, or all of the above, to avoid a most unpleasant experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass by this one and don't look back","review":"With so many good versions of Macbeth out there with such great actors as Orson Welles and Judi Dench, why waste your time and ruin your mind by watching this.

Definatly try this one out"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of the best","review":"While trying to fit the best of Ella on one CD is kind of like trying to tour the Louvre in one afternoon, this CD is a great collection of uptempo and ballad numbers. The Songbook period was a high point in her legendary career, and the first rate songs, vocals and orchestrations on this album bear this out. This album works better than either the Ballads or Love Songs albums, with its mix of fast and slow songs, but all three are worth owning.'I've Got My Love to Keep Me Warm' swings the way only Ella Fitzgerald could do it, 'Bewitched' is perfect, and there are many other gems here. Even if you own the songbook albums, this is a strong collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautiful book!","review":"I was more than pleased when I received this book.

The book covers far more than just Moscow but ranges into the Ukraine, Belarus, Siberia and Poland. The author has a good eye for physical and personal detail and sets scenes well. He is also able to draw the reader into an understanding of the larger implications of the events he witnessed. Brzezinski also has the advantage of growing up in French Canada as the son of Polish immigrant parents. The resulting linguistic and ethnic understanding has given him a feeling of closeness to the Slavic people of whom he writes. He is able to write in a fluid style for an American audience but at the same time he reveals a sense of irony toward the wonders of the capitalistic system that many Americans, no matter how well traveled, lack."},{"rating":"1","title":"Russes Terribles","review":"I think Mr. Zbignev Brzezinski - a former US National Security adviser under President Carter - would enjoy the book. This is because \`Casino Moscow' was written by his young nephew - Matthew Brzezinski. Plus it portraits Russians in the most unpleasant light - some people like that! Certainly, to his credit, Mr. Matthew Brzezinski has reached new heights in his creative Russia - bashing. The author has actually moved a full circle from his uncle's traditional Truman-like anti-communism to the age-old loathing of everything Russian by the Polish ultra-nationalist aristocracy from Marshal Pilsudski camp.I am not sure if this loathing is unjustified, but the question I am asking is simple: is Mr. Matthew Brzezinski really the right person to represent US business community in Russia (as a WSJ correspondent), or may be he is a little biased to bridge Russian and American points of view? No wonder US investments in Russia are less than in Costa Rica."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brzezinski Pontificating with Ethnocentric Tunnel Vision","review":"Brezezinski offers nothing more than personal asinine butchered urban tales that appeal to people like himself--droll dunderheads lacking in both originality & sincerity. \\"Moskviche\\" would love to thank this \\"author.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Red Whine","review":"I've never felt compelled to throw a book away. Until this one.A reporter for a widely respected newspaper, dropped into '90s Moscow's whirling clash of cultures, should be able to come away with quite a collection of stories. And, to be fair, Brzezinski has some humorous stuff, and some interesting tales, but they're buried among too much personal detritus. There is far too much about the author, his family ties (enough already about \\"Uncle Zbig!\\") and his resentment of all things Russian. I've never read a book with such a smug (yet whiny) protagonist.He didn't much like Russians (and had a big chip on his shoulder throughout the book), and he had little use for the expat community. With all his complaining, I wondered throughout this book why Brzezinski agreed to go to Russia, then why he stayed there, then why he bothered to write about it.There's a good book somewhere in the Russia of the 1990s. This isn't it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bar Tales in Book Form","review":"Brzezinski displays the acumen of a tourist. The abundance of factual mistakes in Casino Moscow damage the author's credibility when he makes a rare reference to Russian businesses, which were the supposed topic of the book. As a collection of anecdotal stories, this book was more entertaining than what you'd hear from an average guy in a bar. But as a source of information about Russia in the 1990's, it is not WSJ quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny, accurate, informative","review":"Thought this was even better than his other work on Russia, \\"Red Moon Rising\\". And \\"Red Moon Rising\\" was pretty great.Brzezinski is witty, humerous, and completely honest about his years in Russia--detailing the good, the bad, and the ugly as the country transitioned from a Communist system where everyone stole everything to a Capitalist system where everyone stole everything.He also paints a pretty accurate picture of being a foreigner visiting Russia. As an American who has been to both Moscow and Siberia, I can vouch for the voraciously unscrupulous taxi drivers hawking 200$ rides from one airport to another, and other things Brzezinski so accurately depicts. However, his experience was much more interesting and treacherous than mine, him visiting Anatoly Chubais, meeting with many of the richest oligarchs, and seeing the remains of Chernobyl.This is a great book to start with learning about post-Communist Russia."},{"rating":"1","title":"Holy holes in a story, Batman!","review":"Trashing long-time characters wearies me. I won't divulge any key plot elements, but the solution to the mystery is such a stretch, it reminds me of when writers were commanded to have Alfred rise from the dead and be revealed as \\"The Outsider\\", way back in the early days of the \\"new-look\\" Batman. E.g., at one point, Hal Jordan, another DC character they keep re-trashing, who knows who the killer is since he's now the Spectre (whew!), tells Green Arrow to really punish said killer when they uncover him/her. Well, when you find out who the killer is, you'll realize that Hal would never have said that. Any rate, the motive for the murder is so convoluted, all I can say is, DC should let the pros (Frank Miller, Alan Moore, Keith Giffin) write these epics. And enough with killing and defiling the memories of long-time characters!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the faint of heart","review":"A darker view of comics and not for children or teens.Many plots circle around murder, psychosis, brain-wipes, and the absolute authority to make decisions. DC has moved from the safe superhero (who are morally justified) into an area where there is little to distinguish their actions from the bag guys. No longer is it good guys against bad guys. This is a real good example of how once cherished absolute ideas of our youth have been subverted into shades of grey to shock the new generation.

The purpetrator of said rape is one Dr. Light, who is able to generate high temperatures through his skin. The panel in question shows only his hands burning those of the victim; aparently not someone that you want to be raped by.Why is there a rape in a comic book?

I have always chosen Marvel comics over DC, but this book alone, has caused me to become fascinated by the Justice League.This is a drop dead serious story that is not appropriate for kids, but a masterpiece that adults and older teens can enjoy. It will make you think and it might even make you give a family member a longer hug the next time you see them. It's that good.

Well, this was that. Really lame story. Really dumb ending.The story is a ripoff of the Watchmen. It's Watchmen-Lite featuring Superman. If anyone were to say it wasn't, well they're deluding themselves. The Dr. Light rape scene was just really juvenile and stupid. I get it. Watchmen had a rape. Therefore if you're ripping off Watchmen you need some guy in a stupid white hat to rape somebody. Make's so much sense!Meltzer is good at writing narration. He makes the characters almost believable. If only this story wasn't so awful.And the huge anime eyes were just too much.Overrated crap. Hype to sell comics. Garbage. There, I said it.

This comic is a major exception. Deaths of minor characters in this book are explored thoughtfully, instead of being glossed over, spring cleaning moments like in Avengers: Disassembled.Even though I wasn't really familiar with some of the characters murdered in this clever superhero mystery, I really cared about their deaths, their implications, and what they meant to their friends. The crossover and mystery elements are handled ably, making it an easy read.The art is acceptable -- I'm not a huge Michael Turner fan, so the cover and publicity art didn't excite me, but there's nothing terrible here. A good all-around comic, which just happens to be a big summer event. A nice surprise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it or hate it...","review":"I never thought a comic would make me cry. More than once.The extreme violence involving characters that traditionally were untouchable support characters through the decades is very upsetting to a lot of fans; but I don't think a death for someone like Sue could be done better.Batman is done brilliantly. He's not just a character, he's a presence, unseen, but watching and thinking. He dosen't appear until after 100 pages plus, but his messages and his effect on those around him are very loud and clear. He dosen't attend the funeral; too busy working in the Cave to solve the murder.Read this book. If not for the touching moments, for the perfect rendering of the characters.

I purchased Nyana last year and it did not impress me a bit. I have seen Tiesto spin live and it was a great experiance, but he has never been on the top of my dj list. But with this mix he seems to be getting a bit more into the prog. style of mixing rather than just staying with the same old energetic trance. Now dont get me wrong this cd has plenty of prog. trance on it but he lays down some very nice prog. house as well (though the whole feel of the cd is prog. trance). I prefer cd 1 its a bit more chill and has more of a prog. house sound to it. tracks 5-10 are very nice (track 6 has a spanish guitar rift that jazzis things up a bit and then form there cd 1 gets into some very deep and nice prog.. Cd 2 is great as well just a bit with more of an up beat trance feel to it. Tiesto has done a fine job with this mix and any Prog. house/ trance fan is sure to enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A musical journey","review":"is the best thing to describe this mix. The seemless transition of different generes is extremely brilliant. However, you wont find any addictive trance anthems which was dissapointed coz i remember previous ISOS compilations having loads of those.So I have to agree with a previous reviewer in that the album is best suited for background music, party, in car when you're not focusing much on the music because if you do so, the music of this album is gonna get repetitive and boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"He finally found it.","review":"I was never a huge tiesto fan, I was always more akin to BT and PVD (alothough recent works by both artists have left me questioning my musical savvy) However, the ISOS series and the atmosphere they represent have kept me glancing at tiesto from time to time. When this CD came out a short while ago I couldnt help but purchase it with such a low price for a double cd. What a sound impulse buy it was.Perhaps I was not expecting much, perhaps I have not heard his sound for a while, come to think of it...I dont really care. All I do know is that this mix is an intelligent selection of airy and emotive songs that truly do emphasize the title. This one hits the spot for the summertime vibe.Through all the searching he has done, I think he finally found that epic sunrise we have all been waiting for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely beautiful","review":"Tisto is a true visionary when it comes to trance music, and he is fast becoming a legend. He has a great talent for mixing and putting together CD's, and each new album is like another chapter to his ever-growing collection. In Search of Sunrise 4 is no exception, and it is a true work of art that is not to be overlooked by Tisto fans or any trance fans. From beginning to end on each disc, it's like listening to his past albums, and yet it has a sound all its own. That's Tito's talent, and that's why he's the #1 DJ in the world. My only problem with this album is the remake of his song \\"UR\\" featuring Matt Hales from Aqualung. If you listen to Tisto's 'Just Be' album, the original mix of \\"UR\\" is much better in my opinion. On this album, it's much faster-paced and it doesn't have the same melancholy sound as the original. Aside from that, this album is pure gold, and it's a must-have for anybody even remotely interested in Tisto."},{"rating":"1","title":"Im sorry it came to this...","review":"This cd was a huge let down. #6 on the first cd (La Noche)is the best song one both cd's.

But this cd is just plain boring and bland."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tiesto delivers!","review":"After still being blown away by ISOS3 everytime I hear it, I was more than ready for ISOS4. It does not dissapoint as it is a chill voyage through trance. I have to agree with an earlier reviewer that it doesn't have many peaks...it just is kind of stable the whole way. \\"Do What U Want\\" and the ten minutes that follow are simply incredible.

Not only was he one of the greatest ever, his drum SOUND was without parallel. Reading about how he tuned his drums and other information about he got that sound was invaluable. Like another reviewer stated, too much time was spent on his pre-Zep days, and not enough as part of Hammer of the Gods era. The last chapter, with individual tracks explained was great, but it also have been nice to see some transcriptions of some of his amazing fills, etc. If you buy this book, you also owe it to yourself to buy the new Zeppelin DVD, which allows to see Bonzo in action in a serious way for the first time (it's light years better than \\"The Song Remains the Same.\\").

He was the reason I wanted to learn to play the drums. This book falls short by skating over many of the Led Zeppelin years. I have read both 'Hammer of the Gods' and 'Stairway to Heaven' and I had high hopes that this book would be as good as those, but just focused more on Bonzo than the whole band. Unfortunately, this book just doesn't cut it as a biography. It's got some neat photos and the analysis of Bonham's playing and his drum setups are great, but the rest of the book is more like a high school term paper. The authors should read 'Stevie Ray Vaughan: Caught in The Crossfire' by Joe Nick Patoski and Bill Crawford for clues about how to write a biography, then try again to write a Bonham biography. The Led Zeppelin DVD is a FAR better investment than this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST HAVE FOR ANY SAILOR","review":"Great book, easy to read, you do not have to be an expert to read it.

It does add humidity to the room overnight. It's possible that it does restrict airflow from the vent, but it's minor. Plastic is very flexible if stepped upon.

It might not raise humidity in large rooms significantly.

I was on roads I had never taken but it worked and worked better than I expected!

The Nuvi 670 compares favorably in every category. The hands-free phone and the MP3 function work well. I highly recommend this item. However, there are a few negatives. Rarely, it will send you the wrong way on a one-way street. The traffic alerts have not been useful so far. Traffic is reported that has already cleared or traffic appears with no alert.

The customer rep was very knowledgeable and courteous, and confirmed that the 670 comes with outdated maps and you will have to call Garmin to get EITHER a free USA map update or a Europe update not both. Garmin will charge around 169.00 for the European map update. The usa update is around 69.00. This confirms many of the feedback comments on Amazon's site for this product.

The 4.3 screen is big enough and the volume is adequate enough to be heard under most driving conditions. I especially like the ability to enter coordinates.

When I went to a lecture by the Reverend Mr Fox on \\"creation spirituality\\" at the local University, it was interested to see tables set out outside the lecture theatre selling his books with a merry jingling of cash-registers. No prizes for guessing what it reminded me of. Who:whom? Lenin was wont to ask. In this case; who got the money? And how does this alleged apostle of anti-capitalism get the wherewithal to travel the world promoting his ill-written and error-filled books?

It's size is quite good, it looks very nice, and the making looks great to me. My friends loved it at once, and I have even bought a couple more as gifts. Even the people who know nothing about the magical and symbolic meanings of the triskell notice it at once, and love it. I certainly recommend this particular triskell, as well as Silver Insanity, the seller. They're very responsible, and always include a small cloth bag in the package for the jewelry.

The bottle EXPLODED in the box, the cap came off of the bottle, and more than HALF of the shampoo is GONE. Not knowing it exploded i opened it and all of the shampoo got on me. I would return it but I don't have the time or the car to get to the post office and send it back. I'm extremely disappointed and I'll never be buying this from here again.

It is decently written, has an imaginative premise, and is considerably better than many better known books in the genre.

Well worth reading if you can find it in a used bookstore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, and major improvements since the original PSP version","review":"Just bought this game today and checked it out. First let me say that the game is on a more serious level than Hot Shots Golf. I personally think HSG is more fun simply because its easier and just as challenging at Tiger Woods. But Tiger golf has a feel for it making it feel like real golf. The game has over a dozen courses, including 9 real life courses such as Tahoe's Edgewood and Monterey's Pebble Beach.The graphics are good but not great. The load times are less than 10 seconds (original was about a minute!).The putting is newish and better than last version.

It was Billie Holiday's first Verve album, and she is in fine voice - her slightly tangy timbre is well-captured by the Verve engineers, and she improvises with all her usual taste and subtlety. The songs, too, are great: many of them are poignant and a little melancholy, which creates a sustained mood of intimacy and worldliness. You simply will not hear a more convincing reading of Cole Porter's \\"Easy to Love\\" than here: it's a very hard song to get right, with its demanding intervals and sophisticated lyrics, but Holiday somehow manages to reshape the melody in her own style which mining a deep vein of understated passion.

It turns out, it came into both of our lives at just the right time.

My edition sits on the bedside table, but is often tucked in my suitcase alongside my journal when I hit the road.

Northwestern (also located near Chicago) relies on applicant interviews--not the University of Chicago. I found the chapter on the University of Minnesota amazingly inaccurate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Believe us -- precisely the same as the 5th edition!","review":"I didn't believe the earlier writer who suggested it wasn't worth purchasing this book if you had already read the 5th edition; I wish I had. This edition is exactly the same as the earlier version - same phrases, same schools (do you know, it only has 112 of 179 ABA approved law schools featured?). If you're thinking about buying this book, I would recommend that you go to the library instead and read whichever version they happen to have on hand, even if it dates back to the early 90s. On the other hand, if you don't know anything about the reputation of particular schools, this book can be helpful in giving you a snapshot view. If you do know something about the reputation of certain schools, you may find, as I did, that this book is more of a confirmation of everything else I had heard/read about those schools -- it didn't seem to offer any fresh insights."},{"rating":"1","title":"Basically the same as the 5th edition","review":"A friend loaned me the 5th edition of this book, which was published in 1991.

While reading the latest edition, I noticed that the only info that had been updated was the stats--most of the reviews and anecdotes about each school were the same--and I mean word for word! I guess things just don't change much in law school. I suggest spending your money on the LSAC guide to law schools, instead.

Takayuki Kubota presents everything in a clear fashion so viewers are able to see techniques in detail as they are broken down and demonstrated. He shows step by step how to joint lock and use pain compliance to subdue an attacker along with many other things. He shows how to deal with the untrained street fighter's hooking punches in a safe and effective manner and he speaks of his philosophy of neverending karate which means to strike and strike again until you've won which I'm sure all martial artist's would agree is the proper approach. This is a very good production that any martial artist would love to add to his or her personal collection. Kubota's techniques are used worldwide so the effectiveness of them speaks for itself.Jeff MillerShohei-ryu karatedo"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ben Webster","review":"This is the cd that started my love for Ben.

He describes the massive changes he made to improve the product, changing a low-cost, unreliable airline to a top competitor that emphasizes customer service. The transformations he brought about by exerting strong leadership reshaped financial controls and employee-supplier-creditor relationships. The book is a fascinating read, written in a straightforward, this-is-how-it-was style, typified by Bethune's characterization of the company he took over as a... \\"lousy\\" airline with terrible service. Sometimes he gets a little repetitious in summarizing the action at each new step in the transformation, but that's just a minor complaint about an otherwise excellent book....."},{"rating":"2","title":"Motivational, in the best sense of the word","review":"Being one of the many customers turned off to Continental Airlines during the Frank Lorenzo years, I was interested in reading about how people today can call them one of the best. Once again, the formula turns out to be simple: ignore the stock traders, and concentrate on your customers and employees. Keep them happy, within the bounds of financial sanity, and the profits will follow naturally. A well-written book with lots of solid examples. Mr Bethune, however, comes across as very much filled with his own importance -- although he repeatedly makes the point that he is replaceable -- and doesn't give enough credit to the subordinates that worked hard to carry out his ideas."},{"rating":"1","title":"From worst to First to Very Boring!!","review":"I am sure that what Gordon Bethune has done for Continental is truly worth a great deal of appreciation. However, the account given in this book fails to describe the turnaround process at Continental in an exciting and informational way. It is too repetitive. I think that I understand when a person says that \\"the employees hated Continental\\" after I read that five times, but to mention that in every second paragraph is unnecessary. What Bethune fails to give us is interesting incidents where he actually used the strategies that he employed. Although the \\"Go Forward Plan\\" has been broken into four parts, each part somehow connects to something else in the middle of the section and talks about something not concerning that section at all. But above all, if the Continental employees contributed to buy Bethune a Harley Davidson, it shows that he did an incredible job at Continental. So, maybe he should stick to fixing airlines and leave the writing to someone else."},{"rating":"1","title":"This could have been a great book!","review":"This book was way to Repetitive, Repetitive, Repetitive.

But for someone who was searching for a way on HOW they changed Continental, I was a little disappointed.Some of the explanations are enlightening and many others are standard textbook material. A crucial message is imparted on the reader, however the great disappointment is that this message is repeated over and over and over. You understand the point after 20 pages or so.A book for a junior in the airline business or just someone with a particular passion for the airline world.

Also, I had already paid for priority shipping, which I did not receive and did not get reimbursed for. This was one of the three items on my ticket. The other items were not important and shipped fairly fast. The BlackBerry battery that I ordered on a priority basis, was critically important, and didn't arrive for about two weeks.

I then thought it must have been the phone - I bought a new phone and took that new battery to test in my old phone. You guessed it - Worked fine! So because these guys sent out 2 bad batteries I ended up buying a new phone. Now I have 2 good phones and 1 good battery. I would recommend NOT buying a battery from this company."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what USED pay for...","review":"A few other reviewers tried to warn me the same way but I went for it anyway. Contrary to the listing as a NEW battery, this was a used battery that performed the same as the 2 year old battery that came with my Blackberry 8830 World Edition. After 2 years, it holds a charge for about 1 day.Save your money and the hassles. Then go to a chain or big box store and hand over the cash for a (real) new battery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Battery is not New","review":"When I bought my blackberry, my battery lasted for 2 days of intensive use. It went like that for a full year and then in a matter of a week or two my battery life halved, I could only get a day out of it of not so quite an intensive use. I was delighted to see that Amazon offered a new battery at what seemed a very attractive price, in comparison with what a cell store would charge. However, after using this battery that I purchased from amazon I get the same sort of medium sized day that I get with my old battery. This leads me to conclude that the vendor is recycling used batteries as new ones. It is cheap, but it is not new. If you don't have a battery at all get it. If you want to replace your old battery pay the $40 at a cell store and get the really new one."},{"rating":"1","title":"garbage","review":"Battery was purchased from OEM Planet. The first battery delivered was clearly used. The contacts showed excessive wear(worse than the original battery that is 3+ years old). The green sticker/label/wrapper was severely damaged and scatched through. Worse yet, the white indicator(for water exposure) had a red strip. I contacted the seller for a replacement, indicating that I wanted a new battery as advertised, and not a used one like they had provided. The replacement battery was delivered promptly. However, it too was used, but not damaged. My experience is very similar to that of other reviewers. $5 buys a used battery, not a new one. I will not be purchasing anything from this seller again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worth the $5, but not much else","review":"The battery worked fine, for a while. But within a month of purchase the connection plate quite literally split off from the battery and rendered it useless. Granted I use two batteries (to allow complete discharge/recharge cycling) so they're pulled in and out of my phone often, but the original battery is still going strong and this one fell apart.Truth be told I probably got my money's worth out of this battery and you probably will to, but don't expect that $5 to get you very far."},{"rating":"2","title":"An OEM Battery at a Fraction of the OEM Price","review":"I bought this battery as a replacement for a weak battery in a Blackberry 8800. It was purchased from the Amazon merchant Webtreo. Delivery was prompt and the battery looks identical to the OEM battery that came with the Blackberry. I have been using the new battery for about three weeks without any problems. This appears to be an OEM battery at a fraction of the price I would have had to pay AT&T for the same battery."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bands are great - Disappointed in the DVD","review":"The bands are great. The DVD was a total and complete waist of money. I expected a professional trainer to give instructions with each exercise as well as show proper technique.

The groove in the verse of \\"Chupacabra\\" is almost impossible to describe in its Beefheartian stagger. Try to dance to that one. Very hot-on-the-midrange production with horns, theremin, and lots of loud main instruments; you can tell that the band is angry at modern alt-rock and probably has issues with many of the underground posers as well. I'd bet my van that they REALLY dig old Minutemen records. \\"Cup of Sunshine\\" is their pop song but it's just so unmanufactured in its performance and instrumentation that I can excuse it this time and, actually, it's now probably my favorite on the cd.

The recipes are full of Worthington meat substitutes, which I doubt are very healthy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not For Me","review":"I had to buy this book for a class that I hated and almost couldn't force myself to read it. I had such a hard time with it and found it incredibly boring and confusing. I would never read this book for fun. Unfortunately it does talk about a lot about important things and I could sound like an educated person if I had read it but I just can't understand it. Maybe when I'm over 50 I'll be more interested since I might have a genuine interest in what the book talks about, instead of being forced to read it for a class that I hated so much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting, but a struggle to get through","review":"This book is the classic bible of capitalism and it explains the mindsets of advocates of free-trade perfectly. It gives a clear, proper - though sometimes a bit long - explanation of the laws of the market and exposes the logical workings of the \\"invisible hand\\". However, as it was written for its own time, it refers tocontemporary events, people and nation-states, and that makes it hard for anyone but a history buff to understand many of Smith's points. Outdated and mutated words appear on almost every page and adds to this complicating It seems as if Smith's text was left completely intact. The book is also very long - almost 600 pages - and at times it relatively dull. For these flaws I felt it necessary to remove one star. However, the book deserves the other four stars for its remarkable clarity in destroying socialist arguments for the conscious ability of humanity to put the interest of the group ahead of their own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch Out!","review":"I have no criticism with Adam Smith's \\"Wealth of Nations.\\" My criticism is with the Great Minds Series edition of the book. The Great Minds Series is an abridged version. Huge chunks have been edited out of the book, yet nowhere do they let you know this before making the purchase. I bought this book specifically because I wanted to cite it, and I can't because the parts I wanted to quote have been edited out.Adam Smith's \\"Wealth of Nations\\" is a worthy book for any private library, but purchase an edition other than the one offered by the so-called \\"Great Minds Series.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"The Great Minds Series version has parts missing!","review":"I was origionally reading the text version of this book on the internet until the printed version came. I was downtroden, sickened, and even frightened to find that the Great Minds Series version of The Wealth of Nations is incomplete, yet gives no indication whatsoever of being so.The introduction and chapters 2, 3, and 4 of book 3 are simply not there. They are not even listed in the table of contents. There is no discrepency in the page numbers, or any other teletale indication that it is incomplete. It is not written anywhere that it is an abrigement.I want to point out how careless it is and how misleading to the reader in comprehending the philosophy of Adam Smith to print an incomplete book without any warning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Everyman's Library edition is also ABRIDGED!!!!","review":"Beware of the Everyman's Library edition of this book (green hardcover, ribbon marker, isbn # 0-679-40564-X). Book V dealing with the revenue of the sovereign has been completely ommitted. According to the introduction, this was to limit the book to one volume and keep the price low. I wish I had known this BEFORE I ordered the book since now I have to buy a different edition in order to read Book V. What a ripoff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth its century-spanning reputation","review":"I didn't read this exact edition, and I did read an abridged version. I'd also like to add that I'm not a student of economics. That said, I'd now like to unreservedly recommend this book to anyone who wants to get a handle on economics. I thought going back two hundred years might be a dicey move, but Mr. Smith's voice remains perfectly lucid, compelling, and marvelously informative. I cannot praise this book highly enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horribly reformatted for the Kindle","review":"This is not a review of Smith's work, but more a review of how the book has been formatted for the Kindle.There is no TOC (at least not when I bought it in Aug 2010), which makes it horribly difficult and close to impossible to navigate through the many books and chapters in the Wealth of Nations.This one thing alone means that despite being free, this edition is practically useless, unless you are intent on reading the entire book in order and don't intend to use this for any research. I would recommend getting a hard-copy of this, just because of the sheer volume of the Wealth of Nations, it is of greater use.Kindle-philes, please don't go crazy over my recommendation of a hard-copy (How dare I!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Wealth of Nations","review":"Of course this is a classic, and hardly needs my recommendation. My only reason for limiting it to four stars is that it is a difficult read. Smith, an 18th century Scott, doesn't write the English that we speak today. He is extremely detailed, and one must remember he is writing of the English economy of three centuries ago. Some of the analysis is anachronistic, but most remains true to this day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Abridged ???","review":"When they say \\"abridged\\" they are not kidding!

As I use this classic as a source of quotes, I find Kindle the best medium for reading it, and a PDF the best source for copying passages to include are references in other works. Amazon's price is so low that there is no question of value. Just getting it on my Kindle, in a format more useful than PDF, makes it worth the price. Also makes it not worth my while to look for free ebooks, which I'm sure are available. Just as Steve Jobs hit the magic price point with $1 per tune on the iPod, Amazon has found it here.I also recommend John Stuart Mill's autobiography. As an extraordinarily precocious child he knew his father's friend David Ricardo quite well, also Jeremy Bentham, Hume, and many other leading lights of the era.

There is no indication from page to page where you are in this book, making it impossible to flip back to the beginning of a chapter or book. The reader is constantly driven back to the contents to find subjects which may be only a few pages away.

This, the Modern Library edition, contains an introduction and footnotes that essentially amount to Adam Smith as interpreted by 20th century socialists -- placing Smith and Karl Marx at the same level in the pantheon of social thinkers. (One can imagine that the Modern Library may continue the trend and subsequently publish an edition of the Federalist Papers in which Madison is compared with Pol Pot.)If you wish to understand Smith, avoid this edition.

The Kestrel interface requires either a serial port (most laptops don't have them anymore) or you can buy their \\"USB\\" kit, which is really just a Keyspan adapter added to the old-style serial connector. The problem is that your computer must have one of the COM1 through COM4 ports unassigned for this to work. If you don't have an old-style serial port, you will probably find that your USB has assigned COM ports up to 5 or 6 already."},{"rating":"2","title":"new light for an old model","review":"since my truck is old i was having a hard time finding the replacement rear taillight. as soon as i went to amazon there it was. and at a reasonable price too. i received it in no time at all and it came in perfect condition. i have used amazon for several items so i dont know what i was thinking not going to their site first!! great job amazon"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it!

The average viewer won't notice it, but hard-core fans may be disappointed.The DVD has bugs in it - it locked up the DVD play once, and the only way to return to the main menu to go from one movie to the next seems to be ejecting the DVD and putting it back in. It gives the entire product a feeling that the film was around, and it was put together during a 'bring your kid to work' day - and this is what the kids were allowed to work on.Other than that - a good way to relive those car chases."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some Good Ol' Redneck Entertainment","review":"The Smokey and the Bandit movies won't appeal to everyone.

The main purpose of the book is to attract business to spend money on primal therapy. The monocausal trauma-centric model for psychopathology and the trauma-is-repressed theory make this therapy dangerous, and potentially cultic. There is danger of false memories, or just a general blackening of real memories - a negative re-evaluation of neutral memories that can cause relationship problems with one's family.

They didn't work. My player has a battery-life reader, and it said they were nearly empty before it died. I tried another pair in a remote, and they seemed to work, but I had bought the whole set specifically to use with the mini-disc player. I've never heard of a battery that works with one item and not another (I tried using fresh regular batteries in the mini-disc and they worked fine).I also noticed today that I received the BU-200 model, which is not the one I ordered.

Unlike some of the universal chargers for camcorders which tend to overheat and undercharge batteries when operated on 240V, this one works fine. It is not as fast as some of the \\"smart chargers\\", but you should always carry an extra set of batteries with you when you are out for the day anyway.The only reason I did not give if 5 stars is that the design is not super compact.

It may also be one of my most favorite comedies of the eighties. Yes, it's so bad it's funny and it's so funny it's good. The only bad point to the dvd is that it is not in widescreen format. The picture quality is good but your still missing some of the picture without the wide screen. Hopefully MGM will release a special edition to this cult classic like they did with Escape from New York. A clue to the future-- this film is a couple of dollars more than parts 2 and 4.

It just reaches perfection."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing","review":"Death Wish 3 is an amazing movie that never stops being incredibly entertaining! I'm so glad it's on DVD! The bit with the giggler is the best, but there are so many awesome moments in this movie and most of the other reviews have got them covered. OK I'll mention a few other great moments from this movie: Loved the bit where Bronson is eating with the old Jewish couple and he hears the punks breaking into his car so he goes out to 'talk' to them! The 'catapult' device that stops the thugs that sneak in through the windows is extremely funny, the final gun battle is incredible, and the missile launcher!!! Man this is an amazing movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BRONSON RETURNS TO TAKE OUT THE GARBAGE","review":"Poor old Bronson doesn't have much luck. His friends and family keep getting murdered by low lifes. By this entry though he has no family left because his wife and daughter were killed in the first two movies. In this entry Bronson is visting an old army buddy, but when he arrives at his house he finds his friend's battered corpse. Immediately the cops burst in and arrest him, he is allowed to go free only if he wipes out the evil Straker and his fascistic gang. This is a pretty bad movie, though it has a welcome lacing of humor in it (well, I thought the guy getting a nail through his head was pretty funny) and some ludicrous dialogue, as well as an absurdly high body count. Unlike the disgusting DW2 (which I think is marginally better) it doesn't rely so much on sexual violence to repulse the viewer. Keep your eyes peeled for Alex Winter of the BILL & TED movies as a bad guy, and ST:TNG's Marina Sirtis as a rape victim.The music is once again by Jimmy Page."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charles Bronson- Judge, jury & executor","review":"Death Wish 3 is about an ex-cop whose wife & daughter was killed by street thugs and takes on the role of vigilante to avenge their death.

The cartoon violence and stupidity of the plot and the dialogue had me laughing out loud at every turn.What the hell are these old people doing living in this neighborhood? \\"I think I'll walk home with my groceries through Beirut. oy vie!\\" How is Bronson getting RPG's shipped to the UPS store? Why do the thugs just run blindly at the guy holding a machine gun? Why can't the thugs manage to hit the guy standing in the open with a machine gun with their own guns?

Clearly lots of Americans knew we were going to end up participating in WWII. We needed to get ready materially and emotionally. This book documents how we got there. I had always thought the entire country was ready to go to war after Pearl Harbor was bombed. That wasn't entirely the case. The authors research could have been just a dry recitation of facts but he really did a good job of keeping the human element in this book. I recommend this book to those interested prewar and early war America. There was a ton of information about what was going on behind the scenes."},{"rating":"1","title":"It may be oil, but the smell is not cedar","review":"Having some very old cedar closets, I had hoped that a good sanding and this product would rejuvenate the wood.

He is particuluarly influential here in America. When this book was first issue it was recognized as one of the great books of popular philosophy/theology yet written. In it, Tillich takes the reader through the different ways a person can be (essentially different ways of living). The reader will find this book not only useful in terms of their own self evaluation and helping others, but they will find it a book that, when properly understood, changes peoples lives. A word to the wise: Many people have complained that this book is a little difficult to read at first. This is because Tillich uses terminology which he has invented. He is not always good about telling the reader know what he means. However, after you read more and more of the book you get a good grasp of what he means. Stick with it. You wont be sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't know much about the Civil War?","review":"This is the book for you!

I was skeptical but intrigued, so I bought the JXM and surprised at how clear the reception is on both AM and FM. This is easily the lightest radio I've ever held. Like holding a feather. The reception is strong. Don't waste time or money with an AC adaptor, which will cause interference, just use two double A batteries.Weaknesses: tuning. It's hard to tune to the exact station number and once you do, the station drifts. The only good thing is that the drift doesn't seem to adversely affect reception.This is not a perfect radio by any means. I didn't expect it to be for ten dollars, but I keep it in my brief case and use it at work when a baseball game is on and my office interference impedes reception of my \\"plug-in\\" radios."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clergy sex abuse: personal tragedies","review":"This was a superb series on TV a couple years back.

My hinge broke after a day I was carrying around my gps unit but didn't have my leather case with me.However I think the hinge started getting more loose after about 9 months of use because the flip cover started falling off my pda occaisionaly after about 9 months of use.Even when using the leather case you'll still want to use the flip cover. The leather case is softer and if you don't have the flip cover on inside the case there a good chace your unit's on button will get pressed on inside your pocket and the pda battery will get drained. The flip case is more rigid and it helps prevent the on button from accidently getting turned on while you are carring the pda inside the leather case."},{"rating":"2","title":"Capon's \\"Buechneresque\\" style is refreshing.","review":"This is an uplifting book. Capon is particularly adept at unveiling our shallow \\"theologies of the Cross.\\" This stuff is Calvin with a flair. Those who preach will appreciate his lively Buechner-esque style. I enjoy the way he anticipates various protests from his reader, then answers him/her with earthy honesty. For example, to those who insist on topical over lectionary preaching, he quips: \\"Like topical anesthetics (topical sermons) don't go deep!\\" The price of the book is worth the first part. The second part, on the mechanics of the sermon, is not as fun to read, but will be helpful for those just starting out in the pulpit. --Phil Jones, pastor Ayden Christian Church, Ayden NC."},{"rating":"1","title":"Contrarian review","review":"I'm gonna be the contrarian amidst the 4- and 5-star reviews. This stand works beautifully in the beginning but over time my Blackberry Curve keeps slipping off.

They should have put some kind of stiffener."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blackberry Leather Desktop Stand","review":"First off, I like the stand and would buy it again. Its just not what I initially expected. My expectation from the pictures was this stand was rigid, but its not. When I received the order, I was really confused. It was delivered in a flat mail envelope. I was wondering if they sent me the correct item. After opening the package, the stand was flat and needed to be folded at the creases. Once folded correctly, 2 internal magnets keep the stand from unfolding. The only issue I have is my 8310 doesn't fit as snug in the stand as I would like. But it doesn't fall out. Other than that, the construction and quality are top notch."},{"rating":"2","title":"BlackBerry Leather Stand Review","review":"For the money, good product.

This seemed to fit the bill & the price was right so I went for it. SO glad I did! It's perfect for what I wanted, a simple yet nice stand that keeps my BB upright at a good angle & the best part is that it will hold it while it's in the silicone sleeve! It's made of a nice leather & magnet system so if you need to travel with it, it will hardly take up any room at all, it folds totally flat. It even has \\"BlackBerry\\" imprinted across the front, something I hadn't noticed when I ordered it, it's a nice touch. It also has 2 holes in the back flap, I'm guessing it's so you can thread the charging cord through to keep it neat. If you're looking for a subtle phone holder that will look good on probably any desk I'd highly recommend this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jewish Good Arab Bad","review":"This book contrasts sharply with his Arab Mind. Reading the two together, one can see clearly Mr. Patai's bigotry and hate of Arabs. For a professor who is said to have held high positions at prestigious US universities, I found his stereotypical writings quite scandalous. However, when I balanced this with the fact that his is the son of a well known Hungarian Zionist, I came to realize that his agenda could easily be understood (the vast majority of people hostile to Arabs are Jews). Added to this, his work is highly descriptive and speculative - reinforces the view that Anthropology is not really a science."},{"rating":"2","title":"True American Literature","review":"Every western since this book was published (1950's) has tried to capture is power.

Now, perhaps I loved it because it was not assigned to me, but because I checked it out of the school library.At any rate, I doubt a better novel will ever be written. The only novel to equal Shane is Old Yeller.I'm working on my own novel, Hear Me Whimper, Feel My Pain (about Arabia after T.E. Lawrence) and can only hope to elicit a small portion of the emotion from readers that either Shane or Old Yeller yanked out of my heart.To be sure, there are a lot of good, heart-wrenching stories available. Where The Red Fern Grows, Gentle Ben come quickly to mind. Shane, though, and Old Yeller, are the top two stories of all time. In print, audio, or video, either of them will touch any open-minded person's heart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible and pointless","review":"I had to read this book for school and I hate it. It's too detailed and far too complex for my taste. About 2 chapters of the book talks about a man and Shane chopping at some big old stump, and the characters are all astonished and proud of them. It really makes no sense to me. I do not recommend this book to ANY high-school student if you need to read a book for school."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY BORING and could not keep my attention","review":"The book started out extremely boring and it took me a while to get into it.

Schaefer took the simple, direct prose style of Twain and Hemingway and used it perfectly, carefully weighing every word for emotional effect.The book is usually kept in the children's section of bookstores, because the vocabulary is basic. It was the first I ever read, when I was seven or eight. But it is a great book for anyone, crackling with tension. The first page alone is worth the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Paper","review":"Don't get me wrong, the guy has talent. To fit a 1 paragraph story into a 119 page book takes skill.

I strongly object one of the other reveiws,the one who says kids who don't like this book haven't read \\"great literature.\\" I love to read, and even though Western novels aren't my favorite, I do know the difference between a good book and a bad one- this was clearly one bad book.

Who cares about a stupid stump. I mean I get that it's symbolic and everything, but the author definetely could have had some way of making this book more interesting. There is almost no action throughout the book until the last few chapter because the whole book is centered around how a cowboy stays on a farm and a kid's perspective of the story. A few of the chapters were just dialogue about absolutely nothing. And how much do we really to know about the cowboy anyways! If you want a book with good symbolism and connotation with still some action you should read The Giver. Overall, one a scale of 1 to 10, this book is a -1! The only thing that saved it from a -50 is the last few chapters in which they have some fight scenes.

Is it me, or is America getting more stupid by the second? This book requires a lot of your brain power. It implies a lot of things. But seriously people, how easy can understanding this be? To any intellegent people out there, this book will suit you fine. If you especially like historical fiction, and westerns also, you'll love this. I don't even like historical fiction, and I liked it! I hope you enjoy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb Americana!","review":"Of the hundreds of books I've read, this is the one that I've re-read the most. To say that this is a classic would not do it proper justice. In a short, compact narrative, Mr. Schaefer manages to convey an unforgettable sense of a time, a place, a man and his destiny in a most accurate, convincing fashion. The movie version, as good as it was, does not come anywhere close to the book, and this is due in part to Alan Ladd's portrayal. Again, Alan Ladd was a great actor, but he carried none of the implied menace that the book's character had. This is a great book for first-time readers, in its depiction of right, wrong and the price each carries. I recommend it wholeheartedly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"This book was in perfect condition when it arrived. It even came in earlier then expected.

If you enjoy Cole Porter because of the creative tempos, the mix of rythmns and lyrics, the way that words play together, and the great melodies - then this is not your CD. The musicians are jazz specialists who see a tune only as the base for them to express their own attitudes, and they destroy Cole Porter by employing their own tempos and melodies and inserting long segments of instrument skill demonstrations that have nothing to do with the song. If you like Jazz, it's probably decent.

Sorry...I'm from New England, and the light displays on grassy and leafy yards just don't emit that warm, colorful, reflective glow as on snow. The Christmas spirit was definitely lacking on this disc. One reviewer hit it on the head by saying \\"...but if you play this DVD while decorating your tree or opening gifts, only a Grinch would dare to complain.\\" EXACTLY!!! As long as you DON'T watch it, it's decent (except for the Willie Nelson song...UGH!!!). So, tell me...why not just buy a MUSIC CD instead???I feel Sights and Sounds of Christmas FAR exceeds this DVD on every level."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the snow????","review":"Maybe it's because I'm from New England, where we actually see snow during the Winter months, that I really hated this DVD. Sure, there were plenty of Christmas lights to see, and some fairly decent music to listen to (Willie Nelson should have been left off this disc) but there is NO snow!! No SNOW!!! I saw maybe 2 seconds of snow falling beside I street light, and that was it. No kidding! All the yards and ocean scenes and everything had NO SNOW...just grass and brown leaves!

That was a bit special and consequently I ordered a couple of his 50's recordings and this one. Despite bassist Chuck Israel's comment that \\"We'd done better\\", and the suggestion that Bill didn't like the studio piano I don't feel that any of this comes across. This is a beautiful album which can still be found on Amazon at a very good price. Anyone not yet in to Bill Evans would not go wrong by using this trio recording as a starting point."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very interesting","review":"Syd Dernley is not nearly as well a known name amongst British hangmen as are those of Albert Pierrepointe or John Ellis. He was employed as such for just 4 years or so and only assisted at just over 20 executions. His book, co-written with Davis Newman, is, however, one of the better ones on the subject. It is not merely a dry recitation of facts about a series of executions but is a good chronicle of the life and times of one of England's judicial hangmen. There is lots of colorful detail from the author's own life and plenty of anecdotes and interesting information about some of his colleagues and some of the people he helped hang. It is a short little book but very entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK","review":"This game is great for people who do not know much about baseball.

My kids sing, \\"I was cleaning my jackknife when you did appear, had to fight with you I cut off your ear,\\" whenever they feel pressured. The album sounds like an enlightened Cletus the Slackjawed Yokel. It led me to check out Michael Hurley, The Holy Modal Rounders, Jeffery Fredericks, and Ed Sanders.

This album by above & beyond is by far the wrost journey into trance I have ever been to in my life. It doesn't come close to anything I recognize as trance. This is what I would consider the boring techno you would hear at a club and that you think it might get better after 10 shots of patron...it doesn't. To summarize, it is lack luster, anticlimatic and by no means a journey to Xanadu.I am very disappointed that I was finagled by the raved reviews it got on amazon.

It was a really fun idea and now we have a fun reminder of who came to her 7th birthday party. The horses come in all different shapes and are made out of a nice wood. The paints are very good quality and are great horse colors. It was amazing how well they turned out being painted by 7 year olds. I definitely recommend this kit to anyone who loves horses."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dragged on too long","review":"The book is almost 500 pages and it took about 250 to get to the intersting parts. The character development is incredible but the whole time you're like \\"well, when are they gonna be connected?\\" I previously read \\"Rage of Angels\\" by Sheldon and enjoyed that a thousand times more. I was a disgusted by Larry and especially Noelle. Adultury is a SIN!!!!!!!! I was disappointed to see Sheldon make it seem like it was no big deal. Not everyone has affairs and it is not normal. His book makes you believe it's OK to Sc**w the world. He's a great writer but I don't recommend this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad","review":"This book was yet another good one from sidney sheldon.The story is about two women ,Noelle and Catherine who both fall in love with the same man Larry.Larry promises noelle that he would marry her but then he has told it to many women.Noelle beleives him and then realises what had happened and then seekes revenge on Larry who is married to Catherine in a different country.Another important character in this story is that of Constantine Demeris who is a very rich Greek man and Noelle uses him without his knowledge to destroy Larry.Also I would like to point out the mistake that Sidney Sheldon has made : on page 246 in 'the other side of midnight it is told that Melina (Demeris's wife)told her outraged parents that Demeris had many affairs. But in ' memories of midnight' (part two in this two part series) on page 47 it is told that Melina lost both her parents when she was thirteen . How can this be????"},{"rating":"2","title":"Genuine Page-Turner","review":"This book was very intriging without being bloody and gory.

Sheldon certainly did his homework on this one. Good til the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is one you can read over and over.","review":"This book is awesome. Sidney Sheldon's absolute masterpiece. I've read it countless times and it grips me every time. And considering the fact that I actually saw the movie first, (which was awful) that's really saying something. I felt for Noelle. It explains why she is so cold and uncaring to men. You really get in her head. And Catherine is easy to like also. Creating empathy for two rival women is a tricky thing to do, and Sidney Sheldon delivers with a punch. He is one of the greatest novelists ever. Don't pass up this book. The part where Noelle helps her friend who is a leader of the French Resistance will keep you on edge. This book is a great ride.

I mainly bought it for the high amperage boost application to start vehicles with weak or dead batteries. What I found is that the machine cranks up the voltage on the 300 amperage settings to alarming levels. I noticed this when my Mid 70's Pontiac Volt gauge got pinned during a boosted start. Turns out 30amp and 60 amp is enough for most starts anyway and the voltage is not crazy at these levels. I also wish I would have bought a automatic charger instead of having to baby sit this thing. It asks for using a hydrometer for calculating charge times(good luck with a sealed battery). I ended up buying a cheapo automatic Menards charger to compliment this charger. The battery load test/charge test seems to work ok. Only two stars from me.

In the past his novels have alternated between the scathing and the poetic; this gem is for the first time a finely-wrought mixture of both: the scabrous and the elegiac, the hilarious and horrifying. The story of three friends working on a modern-day Star Trek-like TV series, in a Hollywood that is captured by sharp eye and pitch-perfect ear, it's a haunting and heartbreaking meditation on the wounds that leave their mark in art and how those symbols pulse and persist through the years, eventually to reach their targets. It ended too quickly and I only wish I didn't have to wait for Wagner to write another one. (And I can't believe I beat Harriet Klausner.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"After reading Wagner's other work, and especially after reading Carolyn See's enthusiastic review in the Washington Post, I had high hopes for this book. But The Chrysanthemum Palace was a disappointment, a thin sketch of a story with weak, unlikable characters and a Hollywood backdrop that many writers -- including Wagner himself -- have made much more vivid. At about page 140, I skipped the next 50 pages or so and read the last 15 or 20 pages, none of which made me want to return to the part I passed over.Wagner is a talented writer and adept storyteller, so I'm rather baffled by this tepid effort. Maybe this was just one of those mistakes that writers occasionally make in selling an idea to a publisher, then finding that it really doesn't engage them or that they can't flesh it out well enough in time for a deadline. I still look forward to Wagner's future projects, but this particular book was a waste of my time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Come Close to Still Holding or I'll Let You Go","review":"Still Holding and I'll Let You Go are among my favorite novels of the past 5 years. By comparison, The Crysanthemum Palace was a huge disappointment. At no point did the characters, the plot or the Hollywood environment grab me the way those other two novels did.Children of celebrities is a potentially great subject for a novel. Unfortunately, the three major characters in this novel held very limited appeal for me. And the parallels between the science fiction TV series and what was happening in the characters' real lives just didn't work for me in the least.For a new reader of Bruce Wagner, I'd start with the second, then third of the cellphone trilogy and leave this one alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gave up.","review":"I stopped reading this at about page 50.

On each piece in this collection, the artist is identified as \\"The Most Relaxing Classical Piano in the Universe\\". No specific pianists or orchestras are listed at all. In addition, the files have nothing in the composer field. It's just blank. However, the composer's name is listed...in the name field. Just before the name of the piece.

I'm told there was an extended edition released after that, and this cover art Amazon shows is not the the same as my book. So it may exceed past 1995's ballbreaker album.It has a vast display of history, photos, informations and album guides. As well as some cool details, and the reviews written in Kerrang and Sounds over the years.

He is right about the fact that this isn't a defense of sola fide. But then again Dr. Sproul makes it quite clear that it isn't intended to be. This is a call for evangelicals to get their acts together. Mr. Sippo's anti-evangelical bias was the sole basis for his reveiw. I suppose my frustration towards Mr. Sippo was mine.

On using the equipment, I experienced similar issues to other reviewers. I found that the unit's charge measurement rated poorly as follows; 8.43v at 2amps, 9.89v at 10 amps and 12.23v at 40 amps. The starter mechanism seems to function perfectly well but the internal fan does not work which limits my charge times to 10 min intervals to allow the unit to cool.

He presents an excellent story with an enjoyable insight into his relationship with various animals in addition to his dog, Mutt. His honest affection for all living things is apparent in all his writing. There are some folks that may have different opinions about the interaction of the critters he chooses to portray, but no one can deny the reality of those encounters. Mutt is an amazing dog, possessing almost human traits. That is something all of us see in our pets or other animals we observe. Farley Mowat has the ability to capture and portray those traits. Whether we agree or disagree, he presents reality honestly and skillfully. The author gets five stars, but the hard cover on low quality paper takes away from his masterpiece.

This was a total waste of time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a classic","review":"This book is good, has it's fair share of excitment and adventure, but it being a classic does have it's boring moments. These are the periods that just drag on and on with description or with attempt at building anticipation. This might just be a problem to me because I have grown up in a day and age where the build up has to be darn good to keep the population's attention. All in all, because of it's classic status and it's effect on literature and movies about pirates, I would definatly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Treasure Island","review":"Treasure Island is about a boy, Jim Hawkins, who discovered a great treasure by means of a treasure map from an old seafaring man that stayed at his father's inn. With this map he sets off on a voyage with a crew picked by another sailor named Long John Silver, who is the cause of the trouble on the ship.A little while into the voyage, Jim hides in an apple barrel when some of the crew comes into the room he is in, and overhears that Silver has planned a mutiny. The captain and the loyal crew members must decide what to do about the mutiny and how to get the gold back without a ship.This is a classic adventure novel. It will keep you reading until you are done, and then you will want to read it again. I can't see how anyone would pass up the opportunity to read this great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Treasure Island","review":"When I first picked up this book, I thought it was a little boring. But after I got to about page 20 I started to figure out why this is a classical favorite of millions of people today. This is a story about a orphan boy named Jim Hawkins that finds a treasure map in a dead mans room and goes on a daring adventure that will change his life. He and the whole ship's crew go through many challenges during their voyage like mutiny, murders, and trying to fight the evil pirate (also the ships captain) , Long John Silver, that would kill his own friends to keep all the treasure for his own.

I think the book is quite good and the adventure within really captures the imagination. Obviously that's true or we wouldn't still be talking about it. I also think it's an easy read. As an adult, I can't rate it quite as highly as I did as a child, but this is still a wonderful book.The edition itself is excellent too, especially for a free book. I love that these are out there so people can read the classics.

I had always thought I should sit and read this one and I am happy I did. The story never really got stagnate. As in the story hanging around the sea port town too long or sitting in the island cabin. The story keeps moving along with twists and turns. It was a great adventure on a great ship with the cook to a little known island. If you havn't read it and enjoy adventure stories and mystery, dissete, and double crossing and most of all sea adventures, I suggest you try out this gem. It's not too long and a great read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor eBook Conversion","review":"Good book, but it was formatted for kindle terribly.

Whatever the case may be, I was still saving money purchasing through Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of fun","review":"Treasure Island is a rip roaring adventure tale full of treasure (surprise), pirates, and action. Narrated by young Jim Hawkins, Treasure Island is nonstop fun.Jim is the son of innkeepers when a mean and nasty sailor (we soon learn he is a pirate) walks in and captures Jim's imagination. When the pirate dies (after two run-ins with pirates from his former ship that have tracked him down) Jim finds a treasure map and is chased by the same band of pirates. This leads Jim to take the map and with his allies attempt to track the treasure down. Complications arise including mutiny that force Jim to grow up and leads him to the adventure of a lifetime.This was a really fun book to read and is a true page turner throughout. Treasure Island gave us Long John Silver, Yo ho-ho and a bottle of rum, a talking parrot on a pirate's shoulder, pirates with a wooden leg, and a treasure map with an X."},{"rating":"2","title":"treasure island is treasure!","review":"I really liked treasure island but their is one thing: it's not a book for four year olds. it has a lot of people dieing an d getting injured in that book.

Although Robert Lewis Stevenson wrote it in 1883, the classic is still in print and is appropriate for anyone in grades 5-8. The journey begins with no major problems, but when Jim and the rest of the crew approach their destination everyone on the ship gets their own idea of the way things are going to work. Throughout the story Jim Hawkins, the main character, takes risks for the well-being of himself and his colleagues. Finally, his shipmates lose faith in him but he prevails. The events that take place in this story are extremely exciting and surprising. This book is one of my favorites and should be read by all."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good adventure story","review":"I recently read this book for the first time--in one sitting.

I found this book to be not so enjoyable. It begins with slow, hard to follow beginning, and continues with a somewhat sped up middle with many confusing twists and new people. The end I also found to be boring. This just seemed like a short story streched out on many pages lots of new places, characters, or things in between.The parts of this book that I could follow along with were few and even still not inturesting. It took effort to read and keep everything in your head. I had to read over many things twice.If you are an advanced reader, who can keep up with many things I might suggest this to you. If you are inturested in a fantasy like story with pirates, you also may enjoy this. However if you are an average person who just enjoys casually reading or you like to have a book that leaves you on the edge, I would have to say you would not want to read this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Typo on the first page?

I recently reread this, about 25 years after I first did as a 10 year old, and, again, enjoyed it immensely!It is a real rip-roaring page turner that I found hard to put down as there is very little let up in the action. It isn't a cheesy fairytale either, with several truly awful people portrayed in it, quite a few of whom die some nasty deaths.It is a riveting read for any body with an active imagination, full of salty sea dogs, piratical sayings, nautical manoeuvering, sword play and double crosses.

Yes, the language used takes some getting used to, and it is certainly quite different from what most youngsters are reading these days in terms of the language style and form, but the themes in this literary classic are still relevant today and those who are not put off by the style will appreciate this work. It's disheartening to see many of these literary classics ignored in favor of generic stories which seem to captivate younger readers these days, but I hope making these works available as free downloads will entice more readers to give these classics a chance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Probably the scariest pirate story ever","review":"I was not expecting much when I started to read this book. I have a mostly unfounded fascination for contemporary cultural images of piracy, and I wanted to get this under my belt to earn a little street cred. Turns out, it's amazing. It took me a couple of chapters to pick up the rhythm and vocabulary of Stevenson's style, but once I was able to focus on the story itself, I didn't want it to end. Stevenson does a brilliant job of portraying pirates for the criminals that they were, mostly by viewing them through the eyes of an innocent young boy, who overhears a dark conversation while hiding in an apple barrel and also spends a tense scene trying to escape his home with his mother before the bad guys materialize out of the misty night to kill them both for treasure. The book is scary, with some real surprises and well-developed characters, and I loved it."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Treasure Island\\" for little boys","review":"This classic went to a 7-year old boy.

The book was published in 1883. The main character,Jim, suffers losses at an early age. This influences him to go on a ship to find Captain Flint's treasure. There are several people on this ship, some that Jim can trust can some that he really shouldn't. Some of these people use others just to get what they want. I did not like the book at all. It could not keep my attention. I found the book quite boring. The wording is confusing and I had somewhat of a hard time reading the story and fully understanding it. It took me a while to finish the book because I just could not read it. Personally it has way too much violence for me. But, it does teach good life lessons such as,be careful who you trust,some people will do anything for money,and many more. All of the problems helped the main character learn these lessons. I would not suggest this book to young children or people who don't like violence and pirates."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chapter 5 missing!","review":"If I had known that I could buy this from Barns and Nobles for $4.99, I would have gotten it there.

He helps an old pirate, Billy to find a buried treasure. They are on a ship with pirates, one of them being a one-legged pirate named Long John Silver. Long John Silver is a hero in some eyes but a villian to most - but truly an adventurous sea dog. There is alot of action in this book - the good guys vs the bad guys. This is a good book but the vocabulary was diffiult to understand because of the time it was written. I recommend this book to people who like adventure stories. It is a book you should keep because you will read it over and over throughout the years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Treasure Island","review":"In this book I thought that the sentence structure was more complex in most parts. But some of the time the sentences were really basic.The word choice was complex though out the book. some times the words were too complex.the auther did a great job describing all the events that took place. But i thought that the characters needed a little more description. the auther only took a little time at the begining of the book to describe the characters. I don't want to give away the book to much, there on a boat. they get attacked.My opion of the book is that. it's a great book full of edveture. But at some points the book got kinda dull. like in chapter 8 I found my self dozzing off a little. Most of the book i was wide awake for like in chapter 21 the attack.
