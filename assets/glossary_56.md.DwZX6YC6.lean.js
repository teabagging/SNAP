Hendrix did record with Richard, however, the songs aren't included here. Disc 2 is split between more fake Hendrix tracks and some actual ones recorded in a bar (the Scene Club, NYC)in '68. The actual tracks are rough sounding and can be found more complete elsewhere. Disc 3 is mostly Hendrix (exception - Two and One Goes) when he played back up for Lonnie Yougblood in '66.

Too much of this stuff is out there and it is tarnishing the fact that Hendrix was a great songwriter, a good singer, and one heck of a guitarist.

From the splendid 'Just call me' (I prefer the remix version) the excellent' Since I fell for you'(which is my favorite song on the CD)and the mid tempo'Running from Love, show, when they are given the right material to suit their vocals, they shine. Alas some of the other material, as well as being weak, also highlights the fact that their vocals weren't the strongest that have been heard.

They really could have done a better job at making it enjoyable. I was unable to leave the volume up high enough to hear the background music because the instructor was constantly off-sync with the beat and it drove me crazy. The routine itself was very repetitive and somewhat boring. I could only force myself to do the tape about three times. I gave it away to my unsuspecting sister when she was pregnant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable workout","review":"I have tried several prenatal workout videos, and this was one that I was able to repeat on a regular basis. The aerobics section was easy to follow, and keeps me in relatively good shape without making me feel exhausted.

Only one devotion per week is great for this book because it gives time to mull over and contemplate the teachings, while putting them into practice. Don't wait to read this.

He looks into a rabbit hutch and sadly wonders if he will be able to live in such a tiny house himself when he is grown up. Tess feels sorry for him and takes him to a Fortune Teller, even though her mother told her people are only told what they want to hear.

An example: Odin was best known as a God that gave us the Runes and searched for knowledge. The author calls him a God of the underworld. Really?

At three and a half minutes, the date of his death comes up. One never gets to see a photo of the artist (cameras did exist at that time). So this was almost entirely about his work.They stress his musical background. I think his work was meant to create a type of synesthesia. They mention so much painting that he did in the 1910s, but World War I never comes up. Maybe he was a purposely apolitical artist.

It relies on sophomoric formal criticism that is dry and completely unrelated to the world Klee lived in, inner or outer. There is a mention of the Bauhaus, but none of World Wars I and II. Klee was conscripted in the German army in World War I and before World War II he was forced to leave Germany due to Nazi policies against modernist art.Klee was one of the most articulate and poetic of artists. Why not use his own words?Much of the film is a recitation of the title and date of each piece with nothing else. The actual photographs used of the works are of poor quality.Music played a huge part in Klee's life; the film score is unrelieved wallpaper.The narrator mispronounces Klee's name throughout the film, which is irritating.

Also...I don't think it was such a hot idea to make a film, as it only added up to a few stories told episodically. There was no single story line to sustain a film. It ends with James and Helen getting married and James seeing his nameplate on the door.Hopkins was a very capable Farnon, though, Hardy is better. And Simon Ward was adequate.

The video starts off talking about cells and how life got started on earth a million years ago. I was disappointed to see that the first 30-45 minutes didn't really talk about babies at all, but more the fertilization process. There is a short segment at the end that shows a few different stages in the pregnancy, but not nearly enough. I also bought Life's Greatest Miracle by NOVA at the same time.

Worth the money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"the Miracle of Life","review":"Except for the fact that the voice of David Ogden Styers does not appear anywhere on this CD, I was thrilled with it....Beautiful, miraculous photography. It jumps a bit too fast from pregnancy to birth...maybe another whole video on just the birth process, but what it covers in fertilization and development of the fetus is splendid."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Have For Parents","review":"I saw this film on PBS over a decade ago and have searched for it every since...it is a must have for parents, as it can act as a segwag into that dreaded conversation about the \\"birds and the bees\\"..."},{"rating":"1","title":"puzzled","review":"I ordered The Miracle of Life based on the product description of a DVD running time of 186 min.

It is a wonderful and informative DVD, however, I do think that it is a little over his head with all of the medical terminology. We still had to stop at several spots and explain it to where he could understand what exactly they meant. Other than that, it is definately a great buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nova - The Ultimate Journey","review":"The photography is wonderful however, I found the outline to be misleading. The video starts out covering the preconception and conception phases of human development. It quickly changes focus and spends about 40 minutes comparing the human fetus to that of a fish, chick, and pig. Too much time was spent covering theories of possible links between all land and sea creatures. This left about 10 minutes to sum up a 10 second delivery and show toddlers at play.This video did not flow well and left you frustrated waiting for more concrete information."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is in the public domain--you can find it for free elsewhere","review":"It's always good to check a place like Project Gutenberg when you're considering older texts, especially things published before 1923.

It does a good job in describing some of the most hysterical manias over the course of history, but not in a very exciting manner and I'm not sure to what point: no deep motives are presented and no conclusions are drawn. Some frenzies are described in too much detail (like in the case of 'The Duels') while others are very succinct (like the case of the Tulipomania).Overall there are some interesting parts but it's mixed with some very boring ones... I recommend it if the reader is interested in a plain history of Mankind manias.PS: By the way, it seems that we are not able to learn from the past. History keeps repeating itself..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overated","review":"Based on the previous 5-star rave reviews written here, I decided to give this book a try, especially since it's two books for the price of one. But when I opened up the book, I discovered that you don't even get Mackay's complete book; you get just the chapters relevant to finance/investing. Because I was reading the book primarily for insight into trading/investing I thought I would make do. However there was very little of that to be found, and when it was found, it was typically written in verbose, archaic English, sandwiched between many pages of irrelevant historical minutea such as how exactly transactions were conducted in the 1700's. There are a couple good gems, but nothing which has not been repeated in more modern books in much simpler language. E.g. The Money Game by Adam Smith or Market Wizards, or Mindtraps by Barach or any of Tony Oz's books. There are sooo many good trading books out there to read that reading this was a complete waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"this is the best!","review":"With the exception of the title track, this album kicks! blackie needs to write more like this.

Like the 5-11-2000 reviewer, I found it to come in two parts. The first part details technical details about birch-bark canoes and how Vaillancourt became a self-taught master of their construction. The second part describes a canoe trip with Vaillancourt and others.That other reviewer found the second half to be parody of Vaillancourt, but I disagree. As in The Deltoid Pumpkin Seed, real life sometimes takes a turn that a dreamer would not expect. Like his other non-fiction, I felt that McPhee offered real insights to the peoples' character and doesn't hesitate to sing their praises nor describe their shortcomings.I enjoy the copious background information that McPhee includes in all of his books. Even more than a Tracy Kidder book, you come away feeling like you have some in-depth understanding of the subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"beautiful trip on the allagash","review":"I've read this book twice now.

My eleven-year-old son used it immediately out of the box with excellent results (and of course without reading the instructions). Clean cuts. A bit big for my aesthetic taste, but it does what it's supposed to do.My last foil cutter was simple to use and operate (coming with one of those elaborate opener fixtures), and the plastic disintegrated after only a year. This looks to be much sturdier. Time will tell.$9 isn't cheap, nor is it expensive -- I am satisfied.Postscript: It broke. I would say after about 20 or so bottles. The company immediately replaced it with a substitute -- not the same one. I noticed that it has been discontinued. It was still pretty cool and an attractive design. I would downgrade to 2 stars.

It wasn't a bad video (very good in terms of how she explained things & the variety of pregnant women there, and modifications, also very few props (only a blanket & a chair) needed which is helpful for people new to yoga, but since i know the poses already i would be in them while she was still explaining them for a while & there was only one option as opposed to the two other dvds i have that give many different routines so i dont get bored. I would still recommend the video for someone who is pregnant, but hasnt done much yoga, or is able to do the same tape over and over. I can't do that, I need variety."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice workout but......","review":"The workout part was a good one for me, but I feel that for someone more experienced in Yoga or in better shape it would be way too easy.

I consider myself a novice, but I've taken beginner classes, so it's a bit too slow for me.

Her rehearsed commentary is a bit too fru-fru for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I have been doing yoga for about 5 years now. This video just did not seem to flow.

I ordered it because I wanted a shorter workout than my other CDs, but this was a real disappointment. Perhaps it's OK if you're a beginner, but I wouldn't recommend it for anyone who has done any substantial yoga before pregnancy. I also found the instructor's chuckling throughout the CD annoying and really not in the yoga spirit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too easy for some moms","review":"This tape will disappoint if you are at all in shape and have any body awareness. It is designed for moms-to-be who are either deconditioned or who do not exercise on a regular basis.The pace of the workout is so easy and the instructor proceeds so gingerly it's as if she's teaching physical therapy or rehab patients. Also way too much sappy commentary. A normal, healthy pregnant woman could handle a bit more challenging pace. Contrary to what another reviewer said, inversions and most yoga poses are NOT contraindicated in low risk pregnancies. I have verified this with my obstetricians. On the contrary, many doctors are now encouraging more robust physical activities.I also agree with another reviewer who said that there is too much talk between poses.It seems to take 10 minutes to even change positions. No flow whatsoever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good if you've ever done yoga","review":"I've been doing yoga off and on for a while, and I'm taking a prenatal yoga class once a week. I wanted a tape to guide me at home so that I could do yoga at home. This tape fails in many respects. Poses are rushed through before you have a chance to enjoy the full benefits. The instructor is annoying and talks non-stop. There is no discussion of how to modify poses or positon feet to compensate for your changing center of balance (my class instructor does this). The mediation section at the end is way too short. While the length of the tape is good, if you've got any experience doing yoga, you'll find this too easy and way too rushed. It's like they tried to cram a 75 minute workout into 40 minutes."},{"rating":"1","title":"No thanks.","review":"I love yoga and have a few Living Arts and the Ali McGraw tapes. I am not a certainly not a master yogi, or even close, but this tape was way too basic. The music and the studio backdrop get old after about 5 min. Finally, I could not handle the instructor telling me to say \\"Hi\\" to my baby while performing the cat tilt pose. I have to give this a thumbs down-way down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good workout, annoying tone","review":"This is a good prenatal yoga workout. It is suitable for beginners, but I still enjoy it even though I have been doing yoga since 2002. It moves a little slowly for me, but I can just hold the poses longer while she's talking about the next one. Good amount of stretch and even some strengthening. She doesn't use a bazillion props or take forever to set up every pose like some prenatal yoga dvds I have used, which is nice.The narrator, bless her, falls prey to a common mistake - talking to pregnant women as though they had the emotional maturity of the children in their bellies. LOTS of people do this. I have no idea why, I don't recall regressing emotionally in my first pregnancy, and was hormonal enough to want to bite peoples' heads off for doing it. That said, she clearly means well, and if you can ignore her tone, I think it's a very good DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good tape for entire pregnancy","review":"I've done yoga for years, but was surprised with this new shape of mine how strange some of the moves felt. Tape is 45 minutes and the instructor (pregnant, too) was very good at connecting the moves with things we'll need during labor and the connection with the baby. I can see me doing it throughout pregnancy. Was pretty relaxed afterwards. Only problem I had was my wrists hurt -- instructor said if that happens (carpel tunnel common in PG) to rest your wrists on a rolled up towel."},{"rating":"2","title":"a good video for days you don't feel like working too hard","review":"I have two videos, this one and the Living Arts prenatal video.

The stretching exercises definitely made me feel better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Instructors voice and demeanor is too peppy for yoga","review":"A short little stretch session (20min).

I would recommend this to someone who has some experience with yoga, but you needn't been an expert to enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Short enough for the time crunched","review":"I really like the instructor for this video, and I like that it is not an hour long - the exercises may not be challenging enough, but it is a nice workout to do once or twice a week, alternating other types of exercise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Low level workout","review":"The tape wasn't educational in how it explained why moms-to-be were doing the poses instructed. Additionally, it wasn't much of a workout just long rests with fill-in talking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good and Relaxing","review":"I had only been to a yoga class twice but kept hearing how good it was for pregnancy so I got this video since it was recommended by Fit Pregnancy magazine. I did it every couple of weeks and really enjoyed it. I found it easy to follow but still a nice workout and I felt calm and relaxed when it was over. I would recommend it for any mom-to-be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good","review":"It almost seemed too easy when I first started using it, but by my third trimester I was GRATEFUL for the gentle pace. I always felt good after doing the session. I had a pretty easy delivery - I don't credit the yoga exactly, but I'm sure it helped a bit (and every little bit helps!)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Irritating yoga misses the point!","review":"Smug. That's the only word that can describe the instructor and assistants in this video. If you practice yoga on even a semi-regular basis, you'll find this video to be nowhere near challenging enough- even when very pregnant. Add in the \\"smug\\" factor and you'll end the workout more stressed out than when you started. Save your baby the video-induced preeclampsia."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for women who want to be challenged","review":"I watched this video knowing it wasn't going to be super challenging, but I was surprised at just how easy it was. I was looking for a yoga workout that would be invigorating and help sculpt my body, but this just felt like a whole lot of breathing. I didn't feel like my muscles were being toned at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best","review":"I bought this dvd along with 10 Minute Solutions: Prenatal Pilates. I really didn't like Yoga Mama very much. It moved really slow and was overall pretty boring in my opinion, and a little cheesy too. I also didn't really like that it's just one workout and that it's 40 minutes long. I recommend10 Minute Solution: Prenatal Pilates- it's a way better workout, you can select one of five segments to do or combine them to make a longer workout, and I feel the instructor does a better job of explaining each exercise in a way that makes sense."},{"rating":"2","title":"Relaxing pregnancy workout","review":"This DVD has been great for those days when you are too exhausted to do a \\"real\\" workout, but want to do something. It is not difficult, but feels good! The poses are very basic and all the moves are adapted for pregnant women. All the women in the video are in various stages of pregnancy and the directions are easy to follow. The DVD is not going to get your heart rate up, but it does help with easing aches and pains and increasing flexibility and balance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, especially in third trimester","review":"I really like this video. I was taking yoga classes before I got pregnant and then stopped for some reason. At the end of my second trimester, I was experiencing back pain and thought I should give yoga another try and decided on this video. It is not very difficult, but it does make me feel relaxed and does relieve my back aches. Now that I am in my third trimester I find that I really like the length and ease of the video. You are still moving around, even when your body is finding it more diffficult. As for the commentary, I did not find it annoying. I actually enjoy her comments about the baby. Isn't that the reason you're doing a video titled Yoga Mama anyway?Overall, this is a good purchase, especially for late pregnancy. It may be too easy earlier on."},{"rating":"2","title":"An easy video for days when you are tired","review":"I have practiced ashtanga and iyengar yoga for about 3 years now. I used this video alongside Prenatal Yoga from the Yoga Journal series. Yoga Mamma was the easier of the two, but they worked together nicely for variety - and I used the easier video on days when I was feeling less energetic. The instructor is good, the participants are varied and reflect all sorts of different shapes and sizes in pregnancy, which is refreshing. Overall, the video could have been a bit longer and would have benefitted from some more difficult variations, but it kept me interested in my 2nd and 3rd trimesters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not challenging enough","review":"This video is too easy- I never felt I was exerting myself. I did some yoga before getting pregnant but was in no way an expert. If you want to be challenged at all I'd suggest Yoga Journal's Prenatal yoga, which I really like."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not focused","review":"I bought this dvd because it's recommended by Fit Pregnancy Magazine. I was disappointed. Specifically,1. While there were women in all stages of pregnancy and she says you can \\"modify as needed\\", she doesn't tell you who you should watch for each trimester and only once gives a specific modification example.2. The flow of the exercises is uneven and doesn't flow the way a yoga class normally would.3. The music is clubby and not a good fit for yoga.4. Not great directions for poses.I think that Prenatal Yoga by Shiva Rea is muuucchhh better. She continually gives gentle guidance and suggestions for comfort, no matter your stage. It's challenging, but feels good after."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a \\"workout\\" dvd","review":"I am disappointed by this prenatal dvd. I am a late beginner/early intermediate yogi and find the routine boring and not at all challenging. The poses are not held long enough to be effective. Agreeing with other reviewers, the instructor talks too much and tends to be cheesy. She is also not consistent in the breath reminders...leaving you wondering if you should be inhaling or exhaling. I really don't know how anyone with a reasonable amount of fitness could find this dvd worth a second view."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much of a workout at all","review":"The instructor talks A LOT throughout the entire video, overexplaining everything. There is a lot of stretching and downward-facing dog poses with your head constantly at your knees. I'm a beginner but even I found the pace of this DVD to be too slow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rushed!","review":"Anyone familiar with Yoga knows that one of the key principles is slow, abdominal breathing. This tape seems to totally ignore that principle. The exercises are so rushed that the instructor has to be PANTING, not taking slow, deep breaths.The tape does cover a wide range of stretches and poses. However, the veiwer would be better served if they'd reduced the variety and focused on doing fewer poses better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Relaxing and fun","review":"I really like this video. It gives you a gentle workout, not too difficult, but still worthwhile. The instructor and all the other women in the video are pregant and they give you modifications on all the harder stuff. Overall, if you want a 1/2 hour - 45 minutes of gentle yoga with some stretching and a little strength work, this is a great tape for you. It is my favorite."},{"rating":"2","title":"Relieves Pressure...I love this CD","review":"I started using this CD when I was about 5 months pregnant. The weight of the baby was starting to put a lot of pressure on the lower half of my body. I noticed that when I was consistent with the yoga, my back hurt less and the pressure was eased on my bottom...it even relieved the hemorrhoids! When I wasn't consistent, the back problems and the rhoids returned.I will say this, when I first tried this video, I thought it was kind of lame and that the moves really didn't do much for me...I was SO wrong.Although I love the CD, I did not rate it with 5 stars because it is a little slow and there's too much hippy talk. But I totally recommend this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for yoga beginners","review":"Unlike some of the other reviewers, I don't have yoga experience. For this reason, I love this video! The moves are challenging enough for a beginner, but not so hard that I feel like I am over exerting myself. The back stretches on all fours taught in the beginning are a great way to relieve lower back pain. I can do them even when not watching the tape, and my lower back pain goes away. Its a great way to avoid taking Tylenol all day! I love this tape and would recommend it for all pregnant yoga beginners."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth it","review":"I usually LOVE \\"crunch\\" videos, but this one was just to slow, I am pregnant not quadriplegic... they did downward dog WAY WAY to much, all the blood was rushing to my head and it was just way uncomfortable. I wouldn't recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crunch Yoga Mama","review":"This video is pretty easy to follow. It's not a very intense workout but it's good for working out some kinks after a long day at work. I enjoy the fact that as my belly grows, this is still a workout that is easy to follow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thankful to de-stress","review":"I enjoy this video very much. I was not a workout \\"freak\\" before pregnancy, but I did exercise. I enjoy the stretching in this video, especially after a long day of teaching. I find that my back and legs hurt after work; this video helps me de-stress. I use this video about 4x a week, so yes, Sue does get \\"corny,\\" but who isn't corny after the 40th time you've viewed a video?"},{"rating":"2","title":"An easy workout with lots of stretching","review":"I have some experience with yoga and I found this video to be very basic. The poses are very easy and the instructor takes a lot of time to explain each move. Yoga Mama would be a good choice for someone who's never done yoga before.Since most of the moves are merely for stretching rather than toning, this video isn't very challenging. You won't break a sweat. However, I think that it's a great video for a pregnant woman to do before bedtime because it really stretches out your whole body.For a well rounded exercise routine during pregancy I would add a video with a cardio workout like FitMama, or perhaps walking or cycling. This video won't give you all the exercise you need, but as I said the stretches are excellent and I'm sure I'll be doing it a lot towards the end of my pregnancy when I start feeling aches in my back and legs.The instructor is okay--she seems a bit dippy when she giggles but all in all she's not too annoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont suggest this","review":"This video was very slow to get going and I didn't feel I got a workout from it. Would recommend purchasing a different video"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"This DVD is hopeless, and too easy even at 40 weeks. You dont even get a basic stretch out of it. The instructor is so fake, it drives you mad. Definitely try another DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Easy!","review":"I purchased this video early in my pregnancy, and I was not very happy with the intensity level of the work-out. I am extremely active, and this video does not even make me feel as if I have used any energy at all. This video may be good for someone that is new to exercise, but for anyone that is expecting a challenging work-out, this will be too easy."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible video, not fun, not good","review":"thought the Crunch name would make this yoga a bit interesting, but this was terrible, the women were bored to death in the video and the teacher was just there, not motivating enough, yoga is certainly a great thing during pregnancy, but this video doesn't do it for me at all"},{"rating":"1","title":"I hated this dvd","review":"I was so looking forward to this dvd and now I feel like I wasted my money. I really dislike the instructor. She is like a flake. I can't stand her. The workout it self is boring as hell. I tried my best to warm up to it but that never working out at all. I had to buy another dvd because I just don't enjoy this DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"too slow, hard to do the whole routine","review":"I usually like most yoga style tapes, but if I only have 15-20 minutes of time to work out I cannot do this tape. If I put this video on for 15 minutes, I don't get much of a workout because the instructor spends so much time talking. She is a very over talker! I don't seem to get anything accomplished with this video. Leisa Hart's FITMAMA is so much better and worth it, I don't think people who truly like video are yoggies or fitness people, they are very curious to me if they like this video, it is a poor production by Andrea Ambandos with Dragonfly, she is producing more junk these days."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Bother","review":"This video was a waste of my time and money. I found the voiceover annoying and the yoga sub-par."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crunch Yoga","review":"This product is catered to pregnant woman and it reminds you to do it at your pace. I used it during my pregnancy and loved it. Just remember, everybody's condition is different, determine for yourself how you want to adapt to the instruction. Doing yoga during pregnancy is very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Relaxing","review":"This video makes me feel relaxed. It is not stressful on the body and takes you step-by-step through the poises. I think even if you have not exercised in the past you would easily be able to keep up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful way to keep relaxed","review":"I just bought this DVD and loved it. If you are still maintaining a hard-core workout mentality, this is not the DVD for you. However, if you are accepting of your changing body and priorities, then this is perfect! The DVD shows you how to properly breath, relieves stress and aches/pains associated with an expanding body. Its focus on overall wellness during pregnancy, including listening to your body on a day-by-day basis. I use this DVD and also walk a couple of times a week and this combo has helped me stay healthy, properly gain weight and stay tuned to the miracle that is pregnancy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work with my Traynor","review":"So I opened it, installed a TRS jack, wired it accordingly to my amp needs and got it to work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spare me the [junk]","review":"What complete [junk].

At Least I think they are. Picture quality is excellent as far as I'm concerned. The only extra that I can find is an interview with Stephen J. Cannell. The episodes are written on disks. Just like the other reviews some of the music is missing. It comes in a hollow case and the disks are in envelopes. There is a square in the middle of case to hold the envelopes. I could be wrong because I haven't seen them for a long time, but it seems some scene's nay be missing.

I do have to say that if you're looking for great family entertainment, then you won't be disappointed here. The show used to come on at 8pm on Wednesday nights. It was our family's mac & cheese night. I think it was the only night that we all ate dinner together. It has the crime/drama for the parents, and the action/hero stuff for the kids and comedy for all. It's definitely a family worthy show!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great DVD set of a great show at a great price","review":"I used to watch this show on TV and when I saw this DVD set I bought it on a whim. I figured I had fond memories of the show because of nostalgia and that I wouldn't enjoy watching it now. Was I ever wrong. This was a GREAT show - lots of fun. The special effects are a little cheesy and some of the plot lines are off but the actors and the dialog are the best. I think I actually like it more now than I did then.The DVD's are in a stack in the box - minimal packaging, which I actually prefer. No extras in this one.

Still, it's fun to watch, the premise is funny, and the whole nostalgia effect is very rewarding.

Mega has a sick flow, and carries it out througout the whole album. The production is very strong, no pop type songs, all with an underground feel. Mega basically raps about how nice he is and the drug game. But you feel his presence on the MIC, unlike other rappers who pretend to be this. His flow is really top notch, and he should be rated up their with Nas, Az, Mobb Deep. He has not gotten the recoginition he deserves, but this is a must buy for real rap fans. If you like Nas, you will love this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different","review":"This is no ordinary rap album that you pick up and buy to listen like Jay-Z (especially), Nelly, Master P, etc. This is Cormega.

The alternate takes and occasional brief outtakes on tunes like \\"Johnny B Good\\" just hit home his hepness, and the great (and way underappreciated) tunes like \\"Run, Rudolph, Run\\" and \\"Bye Bye Johnny\\" make this album an absolute pleasure to listen to. This is an absolutely solid collection of unique Chuck Berry music.That said... if you are just becoming acquainted with Chuck Berry's music, this CD might not be the place to start. There are scores of Five-Star Chuck Berry albums out there, which will likely have you addicted to his legacy in no time. After you have sufficiently primed your ear with a few classic Chuck Berry albums, I advise you add this to your CD rack.Bottom line, Chuck Berry is the coolest of the pioneering rockers!

I was very interested in learning the language of this country and this book was supposed to help me.... but it did nothing in that way.The book is well done, very easy to grab and to follow but I was the problem I think. Mandarin is very hard to learn, takes times and I just got side track by learning yet another language."},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly for a very specific group","review":"Unless you're an absolute beginning learner of Chinese or extremely interested in the minute details of the written language, this book will be somewhat of a disappointment.I learned Japanese for a year before moving on to Traditional Chinese, which most likely boots me right out of the intended demographic of this manual. It goes into great detail regarding the essentials, the pieces-parts, the make-up of Chinese characters but doesn't do much else. There are some drills, some write-what-you've-learned but nothing else. I was hoping for some really interesting etymological tidbits but I was sadly let down.If you're just starting, go ahead and get it, but it will become obsolete quickly as your thought-processes change and you begin to naturally and effortlessly write even the most \\"complicated\\" Chinese characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointing release of the early '80s gigs","review":"This could have been a lot better. It misses one the most typical things of a td gig - Edgar's guitar solo. Bondy Parade featured in their '81 tour of the UK and Edgar's guitar line, and the accompanying bass line, made it outstanding. On Sohoman, the track is twinkly and lightweight, as with the other tracks. Sohoman is also only 45 mins long - the remaining 20 mins or so could have been used for previously unreleased stuff only available on poor quality bootlegs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay away!","review":"This is only a very mediocre concert by Tangerine Dream. There are no classic tracks, and the sound quality isn't the best. As the other reviewer said, there's a lot of space on this disc for CD-ROM material, studio outtakes, and other objects of desire. I think \\"Logos\\"(1982) is a far better live concert. \\"Sohoman\\" is the best example that pompous packaging can't make up a real lack in good music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorryman","review":"Incomplete recording of the Sydney concert, for some reason the prices on the used section are still outrageously steep. Yes this is the awesome trio of TD 80's with Schmoeling and Franke the music is really vintage TD but this cd release was short, incomplete, poor sound mastering it's like listening to the concert then suddenly the whole concert was aborted leaving you with a few tracks. The Bootmoon 2 cd is the genuine representation of this live show it was actually a radio broadcast recording with commentary. This 2 cd makes Sohoman obsolete! Buy only at $5 or less, I got mine at 20 so it was really a total loss I was very stubborn, persistent and if only I have listened to the negative reviews...."},{"rating":"1","title":"In a Vault for a Good Reason","review":"Sometimes the best thing for past material is to stay buried very deeply in a vault and this is the case with these live tracks recorded in 1982.This \\"Classics Edition\\" contains five pieces ranging from 4:31 (White Eagle) to 13:22 (Bondy Parade) from Edgar Froese, Christopher Franke and Johannes Schmoelling. There is a bootleg-like quality the way the listener is dropped into the opening number - Convention of the 24 - and there really is not anything special in the material that makes it a fascinating or historical release.Froese has been criticized over the years for reworking supposed live tracks with studio material and this may be his way at firing back at those who question that process. But no matter the reason, the live set adds nothing to the incredible legacy of the legendary band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent resource for health and fitness professionals","review":"I found this book to be an excellent resource for not only pregnant women but also for the healthy and fitness professionals who care for them during this special time.

I've been devouring a good number of textbooks relating to maternal fitness, and this one is the weakest I've read yet.The text is poorly written and uninspiring, with typographical errors liberally mixed throughout. The exercises shown are standard strength training exercises, and very little insight is offered as to the benefits one might receive by doing them.For the beginner or untrained athlete, this book might offer some useful information, but the reviews here led me to believe that a trained athlete might find this book useful.

Plotkin believes that the more you know before you go to the theatre, the more you will get out of your experiences of live opera. I had never attended an opera without supertitles before reading this book, but feel comfortable doing so now.Good information on popular operas and obscure operas, retired singers and current singers, what to look for and what to listen for. Doesn't talk down to the reader. Published in 1994 so some resources (phone numbers of opera companies) out of date."},{"rating":"2","title":"My top choice for learning about opera","review":"This is an absolutely wonderful introductory book about opera.

A must buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Just for the Novice","review":"Plotkin's guide is an excellent short course for anyone new to the art form, but it is also helpful to the experienced listener who has not seen all the information assembled into one volume. It's hard to overrate how useful his references to specific recordings are. I give it four stars, instead of five, only because that is how useful it was to me: I have spent many years listening to opera."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect!","review":"This book was exactly what I needed and expected.

If you want to learn about opera from \\"scratch\\", if you don't mind being tought how to purchase a ticket for instance. Other items in the book (for instance the \\"complete\\" list of opera houses over the world) are maybe for rather advanced operagoers.

On the stereo, its not so hot, but on a boom box, outside by the pool and your bbq, this LIVE CD re-lives the feeling of being at Spring Break at a poolside bar with a ton of booze flowing. They do a bunch of covers. Buffett. The Dead. JT. Marley. My favorite is song #9, we'll get by..... The recording is solid. I would reccomend this CD for anyone who is having a pool party.

The stitching on the flag started to fray and then the stripes would start coming apart. By the end, almost all of the stripes were coming apart about 6inches up each strip. We had it for about 3 months, if even, before we had to get ride of it. If you want a flag outside on a daily basis...this is not it. I have used several types as flags, as we are a military family and take great pride in flying our flag, and this is the worst one I have used."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed in workamship","review":"I was very disappointed with the workmanship and quality of this flag. It does have sewn stripes but none of the stitching is straight at all, it can literally vary up/down an inch on a single strip. Also, none of the stripes are the same width. The stripe on the bottom in about 1 inch wide while some of the strips are more like 3 inches, and the stripe just below the stars is just a little over an inch as well. The variation is very noticeable. Where the stripes wrap around on the outer edge of the flag they don't even lay back on top of themselves, they overlap on the adjacent stripes, which is very noticeable since it's fairly transparent. Seriously bad work, someone is being rushed somewhere to pump out more flags per hour. An 8 year old could sew straighter than this. At least printed flags are rectangular and uniform throughout."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reasonable Price, Solid Construction","review":"I bought this flag to decorate one of the walls of my residence.Good: Durable construction, fast shipping, good coloring, inspires pride in this great country.Bad: There were a few fraying stitches that I had to cut off of the flag before displaying it.

After another month, one of the grommets had completely separated from the 'sturdy part' of the flag itself and the flag would no longer fly. Apparently, central Indiana is a very harsh environment in which to fly a flag. Fine. Next time, I will get one that is a little more robust.I contacted Annin (via their website) to let them know that I didn't feel that the flag had lasted very long. I received a very prompt response; they merely stated that 'a nylon flag will last approx 3-4 months, which is the standard established by the National Flag Foundation'. That's all...no recommendation, or anything, for which replacement flag I should possibly consider for the harsh Indiana climate.

However, I'm already seeing damage to the flag. The stars area has significant damage and it looks like it is slowly becoming white in that entire area. From the road, the flag looks fine.

I bought it from BC novelties and this wasn't the only defaced flag they sent. So others should be wary when ordering this flag or from this company. You may not get a new or even an Annin Nyl-Glo flag.I'm just disappointed, no stores near me seem to have any good US flag for sale and more and more, online sellers are sending cheap made in China flags of which there is no bigger disgrace to buy a US flag made in China."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly Disappointed","review":"Flag is made of very thin material.

The selections are truly excellent! \\"Black Coffee\\" is marvelous, and \\"Stormy Weather\\" is out of this world! The vocal quality of the 3 singers is truly amazing.

If you want to do some sissy shimmying instead of working out, buy this tape. If you want to exercise, go elsewhere! Several of his transitions even seem unsafe, particularly the turn flow into the V-step. If he were half as worried about giving you a workout as he is about being so perky, this tape would be killer! As it is, I'm afraid, the only thing killed was my wallet by wasting my money on this worthless junk!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Step Routine","review":"This video is for the intermediate to advanced exerciser. I've been doing step aerobics for the past three years and found this video challenging, but not frustrating. The instructor uses good calls which makes it easy to follow. The step routine is mixed with a few interval \\"power move\\" sections which really gets your heart pumping. There's a live drummer in the background playing motivating music. The beat really gets you moving. You will need a step for this video. My only complaint is that it's only 30 minutes long. It's a great video when you're crunched for time, but I prefer a longer cardio workout. You will work up a good sweat, however."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too dancy!","review":"I'm an intermediate-advanced exerciser, and I was rather unimpressed with this video's athletic content. It focuses too much on doing \\"dancy\\" footwork and not enough on athletic moves, therefore it does not keep my heartrate high enough. Good for a beginner or someone who wants to exercise moderately, but if you want a vigorous workout, this one isn't for you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you still have a VCR, this is great!","review":"I was looking for a CD, not a VHS. I had a VHS with Kendell Hogan step aerobics which I loved. I wanted it on a CD. When I got it, it was VHS.

I can't even believe that VHS is still being sold at merchants online today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Workout and Never Gets Boring!","review":"I have been using this step video for the past 2 years in conjunction with weights and other cardio workouts (running, eliptical trainer) at the gym. I usually use it around 5 times a week and can honestly say that I never get bored. The main reason I think is that Kendell is amazing! He is motivating and energetic and not in any way obnoxious. I feel like I have my own personal instructor! I also love the live drums. It adds a level of energy that you just can't get otherwise. I would also love to find other videos with this instructor. You will not be dissappointed with this purchase!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, Exciting Workout","review":"This is one of my favorite step videos. Kendall Hogan keeps you moving and motivated. If you are new to stepping this isn't a good video to start with because a lot of the time he doesn't give you any warning about new moves or the sequences. But if you are an intermediate to advanced stepper then after doing the video a couple of times you will be able to follow along no problem. At times the combos use simple moves that don't keep your heartrate up, but if you are intermediate to advanced stepper you will know how to modify the moves to make them higher intensity. I only wish he would stop for a water break or to check your heartrate or intensity level.I highly recommend this video to intermediate to advanced steppers if you want to sweat and burn calories. This is an awesome workout!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Learning Experience","review":"I have known farmer and ms meadows sense i was 9 years old.

I appreciated the thoughtfulness of the Meadows insofar as their employees were concerned. Truly, God has blessed their lives."},{"rating":"2","title":"Full of Galant-y Goodness","review":"The liner notes for this CD are really stinky, and the recording was made in 1990 (even though it was just released in the U.S.), but it is a nice little snippet from an oft-neglected period in the history of Western music. While Mozart is usually credited with being the first to give the violin equal footing in the accompanied keyboard sonata, Mondonville's Opus 3 is filled with a surprising amount of virtuosic, galant-style violin performance. Florence Malgoire (violin) does a fine job as does the always enjoyable Rousset (harspichord) on their unspecified period instruments. The aria from the third sonata (track 8) is especially notable. While this is by no means essential listening, it is quite good and has some curiosity value in terms of the development of the sonata form."},{"rating":"1","title":"lacks depth","review":"I tend to agree with reviewer from Sunnyvale, Ca. I am currently on page 85 of book, and have been informed perhaps ten times, that Joan is a. obbsessed with movies and, for some unknown reason, enamoured of cooking....and that Emma is artistic, by reason of carrying around a sketch pad , musically inclined, so far one sentence to that effect; and also studious and full of wanderlust to see captols of the world..for me, none of the characters in the book seem particularly interesting due to lack of depth. If this were an layperson's autobiographical memoir of a childhood in wartime Hong Kong, I would find it much more engrossing for the insights into two particular young girl's lives, but I believe literature demands more of a professional writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very juvenile and shallow writing.","review":"After reading the early customer comments on this book, I could hardly wait to start it, then I had to force myself to finish it. I had chosen it after reading \\"Memoirs of a Geisha\\". What a disappointment. All through the book I had the feeling that it was being written by a high school student. The plot was dismally predictable and the characters lacking in any depth.

Unfortunately this was not evident in this book. None of the characters ever really came to life or reached their hinted at dreams or potential. Despite some level of vision, insight, independence and drive, no one was able to change the \\"fate\\" that was so often mentioned. One might argue that this was done deliberately as some commentary on people, society and contemporary literature, but I am not sure this is the case. Full of repetitious stereotypes and undeveloped ideas, I would never recommend this as an inspiring story of strong women or families. \\"Dreaming Waters\\", Tsukiyama's latest, is a much better read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I really thought from the description of the book that it would be a great story. But despite the fact that the characters and setting lend themselves to an interesting story, the author doesn't seem to write very well.

If you're interested in novels about women's relationships (such as sisters) in an Asian setting, I highly recommend Divakaruni's \\"Sister of My Heart.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Please Refrain","review":"I picked up this book because the story looked interesting; little did I know that this book would be so horrible I would put it down in the middle. Good grief! Unfortunately, Gail Tsukiyama has a nasty habit of writing choppy books. She'll touch on one idea for about a page, never really going in-depth, then move on. In addition, the characters all seemed one-dimensional and never convinced me to care about them. As a result, Gail Tsukiyama's work came off as very amateur-ish and unworthy of my time. For good fiction about Asian women, please read some of Amy Tan's older works or Arthur Golden's Memoirs of a Geisha."},{"rating":"1","title":"Night of Many Dreams","review":"I cannot recommend this novel to any reader. It had too many aspects of the countless, over-the-top feminist rants that are becoming so tiresome. It was predictable that one of the few decent men in the story was dispatched toward the end so that the women could resume their life together. The history, the relationships and the settings were unbelievable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chrysler Muscle - Still a Mystery!","review":"If you see a part at a swap meet, auction or garage sale you want to know if it will work with your motor.

Sadly, I was greatly disappointed.For starters, the opening credits before each episode do not necessarily reflect the credits ORIGINALLY shown with the episode. A 1968 episode, for example, has an opening scene with a 1974 copyright!!! Given that this is a mainstream release, and not a public domain release, this is pretty unforgiveable!Secondly, the pictures have obviously not gone through any kind of restoration. The color episodes are particularly rough looking. The black and white are okay, though nothing great.I might also add that I am disappointed in the small number of later episodes included in the set.

It's a confused and confusing book, poorly ordered, with out-of-date intellectual references; in short, it's a work of genius that is a must-read for anyone wanting to understand Brazilian contemporary politics and who wants a better fare than the eulogy connocted by conservative American academics that think Cardoso to be \\"good enough for them\\".

I was looking forward to a really good read, but unfortunately I was disappointed by the way Scott handled her plot. The action plodded when I wanted it to move quickly, and then sped through a lot that I thought needed more attention. The last fifth of the book, in my eyes, deserved four-fifths of the page count, and vice versa.To balance all that, I did enjoy the descriptions of the technology for the most part, and the environment in particular.

And don't be misled by the fact that Coleman is author to a fine set of works about the American West - this is no western. It is a story drawn from the heart, a story of life and love that we all can embrace. With The Italian Quartet, Coleman has produced a classic for our generation. With this perhaps one of her greatest achievements, she has crafted a romance that is poetry for the soul and wonderfully descriptive of the human spirit. Her characters are drawn from life itself; her situations ours; her descriptions of time and place beautiful and unforgettable.

The HydroSet meter sat inside the humi on the upper shelf so I could judge the overall humidity between the lower and upper halves. Both meters were calibrated at the same time in the same zip lock bag. Five months pass and I notice the HydroSet staying at 70/70 while the analog fluctuated between 67/73. I took the HydroSet out, turned the knob, nothing happened, the readings remained the same. I tried a reset, nothing happened. I pulled the battery, let it sit for 30 minutes [in direct sun], put it back in and the sucker read 70/70. Talk about a false positive reading.

It seemed to go from 10+ to 15- with one \\"click\\" of adjustment. Even budging it less than a click would make it go completely haywire.

Amazon quickly sent another. This time I got what I paid for, but it's barely functional. The digits are often replaced with dashes, giving me no readout. When it does report temperature and humidity, it will sometimes jump erratically. Just now it went from \\"75F 32%\\" to \\"150F 18%\\". Sometimes it's more subtle, jumping from say \\"68F 35%\\" instantly to \\"74F 26%\\". I can't depend on it to show me anything, and when it does show something I can't trust it.Given how cheap the unit seems, I have no confidence a replacement will be any better or will last if it's initially ok. I'm returning it for something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Useful for monitoring guitar case humidity","review":"I purchased this (plus the calibration kit) due to suspicions of the accuracy of an analog hygrometer that came in an acoustic guitar case I recently purchased. After calibration (it was only off 2.5%) I've now determined the analog hygrometer is off by 40%! This gadget probably saved me from some guitar damage had I trusted the cheap analog hygrometer and unnecessarily increased the guitar case humidity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely does NOT work right out of the box","review":"Unfortunately, this hygrometer requires on site calibration to work properly. I put it into a water saturated environment and it read 80% humidity. Coming back to this site, I realize I should have bought the calibration kit that the manufacturer offers. The shipping charge makes the whole endeavor a wash. I'll probably throw the thing away. Bottom line, if you buy this product, get the calibration kit at the same time. Hopefully that will make it worthwhile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap junk","review":"Bought this for my cigar box humidor along w/ the test kit after reading the reviews. Opened it up and tried to calibrate it--but the 3-step instruction ignores some pretty crucial components--like what each button is supposed to do. I put it in the test kit for 48 hrs as instructed, and it came out at 61%--but since you're only able to adjust the humidity percentage a very small percentage either way, I was SOL. The instructions also say each click adjusts the reading by 0.2%, but mine appeared to go by a full percentage point.I tried to use it anyway since there were so many glowing reviews. Two days later it shut off. I tried to turn it back on and the LCD was completely screwy, just showing partial digits.This thing was a horrible waste of money. If you need it for a humidor, I'd advise going analog!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Accurate out of the box","review":"I bought this to keep in my small humidor which had about 20 cigars in it and 2x 72% Humidipacks.

Exposing it to the room for just a few minutes shows the humidity was around 60% in the room, so I know it works. Great little Hygrometer!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great small hygrometer","review":"Great hygrometer especially for the size. Most digital ones are bigger or have a hard time keeping accurate. The other thing I will say is that I wish the magnetic backing was a little stronger. I use this in a terrarium and was hoping the magnet would hold through the glass. I know the intention of the product is a permanent mount with magnetic removal, and for that it's great. It does however hold through the screen on top. I use it in different areas to monitor the humidity and temperature so don't want the permanent mount.I test this against multiple different units and brands and either it is very accurate, or all of them are wrong in the exact same way. After testing, I purchased additional units for my other terrariums and humidors!"},{"rating":"2","title":"HygroSet II is a Great Hygrometer!","review":"I read the reviews about this product and purchased it.

Would buy again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get something else.","review":"I purchased this under the mistaken assumptions that it would be larger than it is, and that it would be ready to use. This unit is actually little bigger than a silver dollar, making the temp and humidity numbers difficult to read. Also, the unit HAS to be calibrated in order to work properly, something not mentioned in the product description. So, I had to order the calibration kit for $5.15 and it cost me an additional ten bucks to ship it, too. My gripe is, if a calibration kit is needed, sell it with the product!Lastly, it affixes to its mounting base via magnetism. Three days after I had installed it, I heard something fall. I didn't find anything, until a day later when I opened the refridgerator where it had been installed, and the hygrometer was lying on the bottom, having lost its magnetism. I wonder what's next."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cannot calibrate","review":"I bought two of these things a few days ago. I was immediately stunned by the fact that the instructions require a third-party calibration set in order to calibrate these hygrometers (by the way, you should always calibrate a hygrometer upon purchase). Oh well, fortunately I still had the instructions for my other Xikar hygrometer which described a simple salt calibration method. Did that. One hygrometer read 10% too low and the other 5% too low. So I proceeded to the adjustment phase as described by the instruction sheet that came with the product. That is, turning the knob clockwise should have adjusted the hygrometers to read the correct values, one click at the time. Problem is, turning the knob did absolutely nothing, on both hygrometers. I read the instructions over and over, tried many times, without luck. I came to the only conclusion that the adjustments knobs simply do not work. These hygrometers are completely useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy","review":"I needed a new hygrometer for my humidor. I ordered this one because it was a great price. I was never able to properly calibrate it as the adjustment knob never worked. I decided not to calibrate it and stuck it straight in my humidor.

After 24-36 hours the unit read 8% lower, 67% instead of 75%. I attempted to turn the adjust knob with my fingers without success, so I used a pair of pliers. Since you don't know exactly what's going after the adjustment, I placed the unit in the humidity packet again. You need to wait another 24-36 hours before checking the humidity.This time the humidity read 85%, 10% higher.

Every recipe I've made is absolutely delicious, and for non-veggie eaters like myself, it is a God send.

Don't be fooled though--while some of the recipes are quick and simple to make, some take quite a lot of time--all the better to savor the finished meal, however.

They are still lives of real dissections and are much better then Netter. Netter tended to abstract and totally lose proportions of the human body. After having gross anatomy, I can assure you that Netter's pictures don't look natural. From what I' know, it's a debate wither Pernkopf ever used Jews in his dissections. There's not much written record of the bodies used, but most of it's authors were actually serving in the war and weren't putting much time in the books. They were done over several decades, and used executed convicts. Though there still is a great deal of cynicism over them, as first editions carry the SS symbol on them. A good history of the series can be found at...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ethically untenable.","review":"Pernkopf's anatomy textbook has been praised for its quality. I wouldn't know - I've never looked at it. And I never will, because Pernkopf participated in unethical experiments on living human beings while gathering information for this atlas. His unwilling subjects, mostly Jews incarcerated in Nazi concentration camps, underwent experimental surgeries and dissections, some having spinal or peripheral nerves severed. They were then awakened and made to report on the effect of the lesions. As a physician, scientist, and human being, I find these experiments and Pernkopf's work entirely unacceptable on ethical grounds. I will not be a participant, not even to the extent of reviewing the results, some of which appear in this volume. If you have an interest in human anatomy, do yourself a favor - buy Frank Netter's atlas. It's the finest available, and was based on cadaveric dissections; his models willed their bodies to science."},{"rating":"1","title":"Go figure.","review":"If you are looking for a book that will explain point and figure charting, keep searching.

Even the marvellous Claudette Colbert is dragged down to what seems like a limp recitation as a result of the ponderous storyline and sometimes excruciatingly bad dialogue. A scene about a third the way into the film is representative of the strange aimlessness of the whole production. Colbert's character and an old admirer (overplayed by Joseph Cotton) are attending a USO dance when they are informed that a young flyer she knows, and with whom they had been chatting minutes before, has just been killed in a plane crash. The lad's death dulls their enjoyment of the evening for a minute or two... before they are back on the dance floor and he's making a pass at her.

It was a different time and simpler life and this really nails what it was like - for all..... if you don't believe it, you've got to also get The Clock with Robt Walker and Judy Garland, when she was at her most radiant and beautiful and best as an actress - And one of the finest epic war movies very early on which was superb with Robt Walker, Battan.You won't be disappointed.

Selznick and director John Cromwell give epic treatment to this story of the war back on the home front. No one's really great in this one. Claudette Colbert and Shirley Temple hold their own and Monty Woolley is better than usual. However, you may cringe at Jennifer Jones's performance when she's usually so good. And the black-face lines they feed to Hattie McDaniel are embarrassing, though she manages to make her character into more than the script would seem to allow.But somehow it all holds together, taking us through a year in the life of an American family while Dad's away at war. The undertone of sacrifice and perseverance during hard times is compelling. And, by 1944, Hollywood had created such a rich mythology around the war that a movie only needed to make quiet references to people's fears and hopes in order to pull you in. It still works today.And, just as you might hope, our story winds up to its heartfelt climax on Christmas Eve."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS ONE IS A FAMILY TRADITION","review":"This video is a neat representation of life during World War II...My sisters and I used to grab a box of Kleenex and gather around the 19 inch TV in the living room whenever this movie was aired...Now each one of us has a copy of it in their video library and share it with our children and now grandchildren...Anybody who likes the old movies like \\"Laura\\" and \\"Anne of Green Gables\\" will love this movie and don't forget a hanky...Barb Frick"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Widescreen","review":"I was very disappointed that the DVD is not widescreen although it claims to be.

I was already feeling firmer after about 3 workouts. Emily Welsh is a great instructor, she is cute, and has a positive motivating energy about her. Emily is amazing the way she can continue to instruct throughout the abdominal exercises.Anybody who says this video doesn't have a warm-up obviously didn't get past the first 15 minutes. If you get discouraged with the steps, keep trying! The steps become way easier and a lot of fun if you stick with it.I am a guy and have been using this in between my weight training sessions, its much more fun than just running."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I did not know in advance that there were so many different pieces of equipment required for this DVD (body bar, step, etc) and so I didn't get any benefits from doing the workout. I will do more thorough research in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still a winner!","review":"I bought this DVD over a year ago and I still use it at least once a week, as part of a 4 - 5 day exercise program. I consider it to be low impact but I am dripping with sweat when I'm finished. There is very little jumping involved but the workout comes via the step and sculpting stick. Even the equipment is worth the money. Emily Welsh does mix up her left and right cues at times, but it's really no big deal. This Firm workout is one of four that I own and I like all of them. I sweat hard with all of them and they make me feel like my hour was well spent. Keep your water bottle and sweat towel close by because you'll barely have time for a sip or a wipe between routines. The music matches the routine and it all flows perfectly, in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Workout","review":"I have been using the firm for 2 years and this is the absolute best video they have made. Emily makes the video fun and easy to follow. She switches from weights to cardio a few times and then to the arms and abs. It is a great one hour workout and I recommend this video to people who need that extra visible result they have been looking for, this one covers all the bases. Don't forget to purchase your firm fanny lifter and sculpting stick, you need 3, 5 and 8 pound dumb bells. The firm by far is a great program for me and I hope that you give any firm video a try because it's great for your heart and their cardio routines are fun, the fanny lifter makes you work your thighs and butt it's really a great system I actually recommend the whole program, hoping that it will work for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent workout!","review":"I've hardly ever been disappointed with the FIRM workouts tapes. They are very challenging and tough, but not so much that you don't want to do it and give up. I found myself breaking a sweat when the instructor was going through the first 4-limb movement (combination of bicep curls and lunges on the fanny lifter). The whole workout is fun and I love the last sequence with the abs. The chest processes were good, but not the most challenging sequence. The tricep exercise toward the end (right before the ab sequence) is great. I like how she provides us with ways to make the workout easier or harder. I'd recommend it to anyone looking to get toned fast! Hope this helps :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"one of my faves","review":"Great workout!Emily's personality makes the difference.Beginners will need to work up to it as it is nearly a full hour but the time flies.Not every firm tape is as good as this one and if you can only afford a few tapes to start out with, this one is good.You will not quickly be tired of it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Might be a decent workout, but...","review":"I'm an avid fan of workout DVDs, and I just got this one, never having bought a Firm DVD before. What a disappointment! The first 5 minutes of the DVD are an advertisment for \\"The Firm\\" products...and to be sure, you have to have each and every one to follow along with this workout. I don't have the double-decker Fanny Lifter, I don't have the Sculpting Bar (or whatever it's called)...I just have myself, some dumbbells and an urge to workout. That's not enough for this workout."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Video Gives me the Most Results","review":"I originally had this one on vhs when I purchased The Firm System II in the summer of 2003. I have this workout on dvd along with the maximum cardio burn. I have been using The FIRM for many years and I am 21 years old now and I have to say this workout is the best one I lose more weight with this one. It's fun she can be a lil annoying with her accent but she's great nonetheless. The only downside is they don't call their products, \\"The Firm,\\" for nothing I tend to bulk up so I run daily and and I have lovely legs thanks to Emily. If you are going to buy a Firm Video buy this one I sorta dislike many of the other ones that came out like Cardio Dance Express Alison Davis is a weird lady she's too advanced or something I just don't like her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another top-notch Firm workout","review":"This is another effective Firm workout that is both challenging, fun, yet doesn't aggravate my bad back. My only beef with this workout is that the instructor, Emily, keeps saying \\"whoo\\" throughout the workout. Ease up on the fake-sounding enthusiasm. But the workout itself is great. I definitely recommend the Fanny Lifter with all these new tapes. This tape doesn't rely on the Sculpting stick too much so you could get away without it and not lose much effect."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Total Disappointment","review":"I bought this dvd thinking that it was a beginner step aerobics workout.

This tape is not for beginners. It says to follow a certain person if you are new,,,,then they put that person in the back behind others and never put the camera on her, duh!! There's no warm up, the moves are complicated (especially for a beginner), it's a sports injury looking for a place to happen. The moves are complicated. The instructor does not build on each move, she goes straight for the complicated one and only does 4 reps of it before zooming on to the next move. I felt lost and only able to figure out 1 rep of each move before she went to the next one. She seems like she's spent way to much time at Starbucks. Don't waste your $ unless you enjoy watching the same tape over & over & over to figure it out. Also, you need hand weights, their $60 fanny lifter, and their sculpting stick....there's way better for alot cheaper out there. Keep looking."},{"rating":"1","title":"I want my money back!","review":"I have a few of the newer The Firm videos and I have the same complaints about all of them. The aerobics segments are extremely confusing and hard to follow. The instructors speak way to fast and their movements are too fast as well. By the time I figured out one movement they were already onto the next. Also, I think it's important to have a good warm up before getting into any workout and you won't find that here. I also found it very annoying the way you have to keep moving your fanny lifter, sculpting stick and weights out of the way as the segments change. It completely interrupts the workout. The weight training segments are decent, but for the most part, I didn't get a very good workout from any of the videos. For me these videos were a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Un-met expectations","review":"I was very disapointed with this video. If you are not a pro dancer these steps tend to go way to fast. By the time I got the steps, she had moved on to the next move. She talked a lot without explaining much. The sculpting stick was hardly used to make the purchase worthwhile. A broom handle would work just as well given her lack of use. Overall I have used much more effective video workouts. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much for me","review":"I had the complete opposite experience with this workout than did the previous reviewer.

The video works the abs from all angles. Chris Freytag is a friendly instructor and cues well. I liked the stability ball and classic crunch segments best. I felt the most burn from them. In the stability ball section, you'll do crunches on the ball, reverse curls and lift and lower the ball with your legs which really works the lower abs. The classic crunch section had lots of leg variations. The exercise where you lie on your side and pull your legs towards your chest really works. I didn't care for the core training which started with standing balance moves. They were pretty easy and I didn't think they did much. The ending plank moves were tough. The pilates section was just o.k. It had familiar exercises. One exerciser shows modifications, so this is a video you can grow with.

While the author talks about depression as distinct from, for example, healthy grief, and takes seriously the utility of, for example, antidepressant medications, the book generally seems to me to skew too far toward thinking yourself out of depression and isn't attentive enough to the reality of e.g. neurochemical factors beyond the sufferer's control."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not another battles of the Civil War book","review":"More than just a military book about the American Civil War, this book shows how the war impacted the regular population, economy and countryside.

The acting is great, the story rocks, the only thing that's not good about this is the fact that we'll never see how any of it ends. THANKS NBC"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Stuff!","review":"This is definitely worth watching. On a par with the Sopranos,except the brothers are IRISH and fighting with the Italians. Then fighting with other Irish. It only gets better and better toward the last show. You are drawn into the family and forget that this is a show and they are actors. Like other reviewers I wish there were more seasons. Order the DVD series if you missed it when it was on tv."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than I expected.","review":"My boyfriend really wanted to see this series, and I didn't care to. I decided to watch the first episode, just to see what the hype (after it was cancelled) was all about. From the first episode, I was hooked.If you like mob dramas, such as Boondock Saints, Sopranos, The Godfather, you would most likely enjoy this."},{"rating":"2","title":"NBC blew this one","review":"This show has to be one of the all time best shows to ever get cancelled NBC never even gave it a chance. Heck even Seinfeld had bad ratings at first you have to let a show grow and give it a chance at least more than 6 episodes. Anyway enough of the stupid execs this show was intense, unique and kept you wanting more after every episode I highly recommend this show to all who love mob movies or shows it won't disappoint."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Black Donnellys","review":"One of the greatest television shows I've seen, The Black Donnellys offers viewers a glimpse at the lives of four brothers thrown into the world of organized crime.

A man who didn't want to be a criminal but had to in order to save his family. This is the story of the beginning of a mafia, the takeover if you will. It's dramatic and extremely well told, moving through the story, shaping the change in Tommy throughout each episode. The neighborhood plays a particularly strong role in what happens as well. This show incorporates everything, brotherhood, family, love, drama and really it's a show about what one needs to do to survive where survival seems impossible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutly one of the best shows I've worked on.","review":"This show has brought a lot of people together and I know that it's fans are truly in shock by NBC's descion. I decided to order this product because of the emails I get everyday asking me why they cancelled such an awesome show. I have really no news to say at the moment, but I know that one of my co-workers recently reunited with some of the crew to discuss season 2. I don't exactly know how that went because she hasn't emailed me back, nor have I heard anything from anyone else, but The Black Donnellys is one hell of show.

I had never known of this show while it was being aired. The show is amazing and once again a great show got canceled. It seems as if any show with a storyline worth following can never last these days. Even though you will only get one season out of this, it is worth watching. You will be happy with this purchase and after watching the entire season you will drop down with amazement and wonder how in the world this show ever got canceled!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Show","review":"I got this series off of Amazon for $10 a while back, I don't know why they raised the price so high?maybe the sales were good and so they hiked it up to take advantage as they usually do.

Get the show, one of the best I have ever seen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bring Back the Donnellys!","review":"My boyfriend and i loved this show and were very sad to see it go.

This series deserves to be watched."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'd rather have Tony Soprano for a neighbor","review":"Next to any of these four brothers, I'd rather live next to Tony Soprano. Excellent acting from everyone (especially from brothers Tommy and Kevin, and Tommy's drug-addicted girfriend), but these chracters have very few redeeming qualities so it's hard to root for any of them after a while. Also, too many people get stabbed, kicked to death, chopped up, etc. without any apparent remorse or reflection on the part of the perpetrators. I enjoyed watching it, but at this point I no longer care about the characters and am glad to move on to something else. The characters in the Sopranos and Brotherhood are more likable and enjoyable to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Black Donnellys- 4 Stars","review":"This DVD arrived pretty quickly, a few days later than some others that I have ordered, but still pretty fast.

The show was largely based on Bobby Moresco's life and Hell's Kitchen. TBD is narrated by Joey \\"Ice Cream\\" and follows four Irish brothers, Tommy, Kevin, Jimmy and Sean Donnelly who place family above all and find themselves catapulted into a life they never dreamed of. In the pilot episode, Tommy and Kevin do the unthinkable to save their brother Jimmy from himself and to keep him and the family out of harms way...and this is where it all begins. Throughout the season, we see the emotions erupt, motives unravel and suspicions revisited. This show offers drama, comedic relief, emotions and most of all, family."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everyone should buy this!!!!","review":"This is the best series ever!

Afterwards, they are both deeply affected by the debate and begin a religous journey that changes their lives forever.The writer of the negative review forgets that Jesus came not to destroy the Torah or the Prophets, but to fulfill them. The writer of the negative review also forgets that Jesus claimed that the most important commandment was to love YHWH your God with all your heart.

Expertise nonwithstanding, however, the book suffers and ultimately fails for two reasons: poor writing infused with distracting try-too-hard humor, and an index that's so far off in the weeds as to be utterly useless. If you feel you must purchase this book, try reading a few pages first; if the author doesn't annoy you within two pages, you may get along with him just fine.Count on this, however: you WILL need a different book as a reference. The index, when it contains what I'm looking for at all, is often several pages off target. Most often, though, I can't even find what I'm looking for in the index.The party's pretty much over for MFC anyway, and thank God for that.

Luckily it was a friend of mine who bought this current version. I borrowed his VC6 copy and I've looked through it quit a lot. As near as I can tell, the books are pretty much the same except for the beginning parts that talk about the environment. If you buy the book for VC5, I don't believe you're _really_ going to lose anything, but you will get a CD that includes the fully searchable text of the book as well as the source code. By buying the previous edition of the book, you can send the message that no longer including a CD with a fully searchable version of the book is unacceptable.

The material he covers is both usefull and advanced. To this date i haven't found a better book on MFC (some win32api) that will cover subjects as much as Blaszczak does. If you'll read his book and cross reference MSDN, and write the code at the same time, you'll literally master MFC development. Usefull as a reference for variety of MFC topics.

The only thing better than this book is his toupee. He is the only man I know who wears two or three different hair pieces at the same time. And the colors never match. But I digress. This book is the monument Wally deserves. It is as sharp, intelligent and bitingly funny as he is (or isn't). It also manages to capture the complex human being who is Wally George. Is he really a master performance artists who lowers himself to the level of his audience? Or is he the borderline retard who doesn't know anything about politics or humor? You decide. All I can tell you is that watching Wally's show on Saturday nights is a bit like taking mushrooms: nothing makes sense. (For the really bold, try doing them both at the same time; it will scar you forever). Anyway, this book sucks just like Wally does.

From George and Pyne to Downey and Limbaugh and down, they act in the most unChristian like manner possible as long as there are political points to score and ratings to be had, then try to convince the throng they're really swell fellows after all. George's book is part and parcel of this, and while it is not awfully written, it tells the Big Lie: that even though George was one of the first footsoldiers that led to the corruption of public discourse in America, he didn't really mean it like that.Sorry, but if I am going to read metretricious, self-justifying twaddle, at least I'll read some with genuine historical import; Mein Kampf is about that speed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wally George is a shriveled up old hack","review":"Wally George is a shriveled up old hack.

But Kyle Thomas simply adds more power, more emotional intensity and just plain opens the nozel and stokes the flames to unheard of heights. Ryan Lake and Erik Larson provide enough inspirational riffage and earth shattering solo work that my head hasn't stopped bouncing to some of the catchiest budweiser pounding, mug rasing mastery that the Thunder provides on this masterwork.

There are so many different moves, styles and fast pace exercises in it that I didn't get bored and will definately be keeping this one in my routine..I noticed Allie's new tattos right away but they were not distracting at all and as for her look I thought she looked great and very fit..

If you are serious exerciser and have used a ton of the FIRM tapes in the past it might be easy, but if you are new to exercising at all (as I am)or really out of shape and am finally motivated to get moving (as I am) this is a tough place to start. The instructor goes so fast that I miss have the steps and don't really know if I am even doing them correctly because it's so rushed. Plus, having five other instructors as the people exercising in the background really isn't that motivating- they have obviously done this routine a million times!

However, there are some toning sections but the video is primarily cardio and I definitely worked up a great sweat. I have the Body Sculpting System 2 and this video was one of the 3 tapes. The other two are targeted more for toning with a little cardio. I like the BSS2 compard to one BECAUSE of this video since there is one good cardio workout and 2 toning workouts. The BSS1 was all toning and not much cardio. I loved the kickboxing moves in this video. When I was doing BSS1 I had to supplement another cardio workout inbetween the 2 toning workouts, oh and the third one was only abs(that's right) and I never used that one. So if you want a system that has all in one, good toning and a great cardio workout, the BSS2 is great.

You'll do fine with handweights & a broom stick (or something)."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth the money","review":"This is the only FIRM video that I have not liked. I liked how she did five-minute segments; but I didn't like what was in them. There is kickboxing which is mostly arm movements, the step part was okay, and the low-impact is things like moving your arms and legs in front of you and behind you. I felt like I was back in junior high PE. I didn't use the sculpting stick; one could substitute 3 to 5 pound weights in each hand. And I am perfectly able to balance. I also have had no results.

I really don't know why people are complaining. Sure, it might not be as hard as previous Firm workouts, such as Body Sculpting Basics (which is still my favorite!) But only The Firm gets me sore in the places right where I need it. The workout is fun and Allie is a great instructor. When I was done, I felt like I got a great workout. This is definitely better than Total Sculpt! By the way, I do not have the sculpting stick, and you certainly do not need it. When you use the twigs, I substitute 3 pound dumbells. I could easily use 5 pounds to challenge myself even more. And my husband built me my own 'fanny lifter'-6,8.and 14 inch really sturdy steps. If you can build one on your own out of wood, do it, it saves a lot of money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"misleading product description","review":"The item was described as having A/V outputs that included an S video jack for the video output.

The one and only reason to buy this product is the s-video output, otherwise it's no better than the original accessories that came with your Ipod. I had hoped to connect to my home stereo.

Hoar doesn't give you time to get comfortable - he just pulls you right in and starts the motor! I couldn't turn the pages fast enough.I think that what gives this book its legs is that Jere Hoar is a kind of writer that doesn't come along very often. He doesn't just write the story -- he tells it to you. This book speaks to you as if Hoar were reading it to you himself. If you are familiar with his first collection of stories, \\"Body Parts\\", then you know what I'm talking about. (Another great, dark offering from Hoar, BTW)If you still need more encouragement to buy this book, take a look at his review and interview (the interview is fantastic!) at USA Today online from April 16, 2003.

The design of the guinea pigs was a lot more detailed and not as nice as the simple ones shown in the images, but I guess that's preference.

The return experience through amazon was pleasant and hassle-free."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, sturdy bowl for Pigs","review":"I've found that ceramic bowls work best for guinea pigs because they tend to like to stand on the rim while they eat and if the guinea pig is heavy, this causes the plastic bowls to tip over easily. This one has a nice soft rim that will be comfortable on little cavy feet! Also, guinea pigs eat a lot of pellets during the day and this is a good sized bowl.

In real life the thirteen year old could have gotten the job but would've done more than strip (see Traci Lords). The two runaways live a really depressing life.

I can't imagine anyone with any remote intelligence, (maybe curiosity) sitting through this film more then one time, and even that's a bit painful. Popular probably only because of a rocking soundtrack. It's cult, underground, and rare, so that must be what all the fuss is about. Seriously, good only for curiosity's sake.

IT IS GENEROUS TO GIVE THIS ONE STAR!"},{"rating":"2","title":"IZZ - Nice Debut Album","review":"Izz is in my opinion one of the best new bands to come out of the east coast progressive rock scene in the last decade. Their brand of progressive rock mixed in with a good dose of pop is a great combination. On their debut album \\"Sliver Of A Sun\\" the band shows obvious promise, but is somewhat in search of a direction. The material ranges all over the place from modern rock, progressive rock, pop, Celtic, ballads, you name it, it's here. Some songs work better than others, but overall it is a nice blend from a talented bunch of folks. Highlights for me are \\"Endless Calling\\", the Celtic \\"Lornadoone\\", \\"Meteor\\", and the closing track \\"Where I belong\\" where the girls take the lead vocals. \\"Sliver Of A Sun\\" is a very nice debut album. The band would go on to do better stuff, but this was a very good start."},{"rating":"2","title":"It pays to look through your brothers magazines!","review":"I love this CD.

There a great live band but the CD sounds like a band trying to mimic the sound of the great Beatles or Pink Floyd. The groups has talent, but need a fresh sound, not a mimickrey of someone elses.

My only advice, play in bigger clubs so more people can experience the great music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid","review":"The fact that a band is eclectic does not necessarily make them a \\"good\\" band. Izz is both diverse and entertaining. There is the obvious influence of such modern rock as Dave Matthews and Radiohead, combined with flavours reminiscent of Marillion and Yes. Tom and John Galgano produce such pleasant harmonies, while the two percussionists and AMAZING guitarist catapault Izz into \\"great\\" band status. Word of mouth says the sophomore album is coming soon. Hopefully, it will showcase the best of Izz, the stellar technique and vision of the bandmembers. Way to go, Izz!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A BIG Disappointment","review":"I saw IZZ perform at a local college festival and liked what I saw so I gladly ordered their fist CD. Bad move.

Someone needs to tell Jennifer the truth, she needs to start acting in roles that are different for her and show her true acting abilites. And What is Gerard Butler doing is this movie this is so beneath him, he has done some great movies for instance: Reign of Fire, 300, one of his best roles to date Law Abiding Citizen why did he choose this role?! As for this film just like Greenburg it is another movie that should have never been made!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting...","review":"It's interesting how I absolutely LOVE \\"Friends\\" mostly because of Jennifer Aniston, but I absolutely loathed this movie mostly because of her too.

I wanted to like this movie so bad, but it was impossible."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a waste of my precious time","review":"The Bounty Hunter isn't even remotely funny. Even though it's not really a romance comedy, it sure *feels* like one because of how fruity and nonchalant the whole storyline is. The action bits feel like they were created by a bunch of 5 year olds, or rather, created by a group of writers that were going for something only a *very* select few would be able to appreciate.I guess I shouldn't be surprised with the main character being Jennifer Aniston. She's not the kind of actress to star in really exciting action-packed films. No, this is definitely NOT a suspense- it's a really pitiful attempt at a comedy involving far-fetched and pointless \\"bounty hunter\\" *comedy* segments- completely unsuspenseful.As soon as I found out there was no suspense, well, I said to myself \\"Maybe I can appreciate it as a comedy film\\". Nope. I couldn't. Not when I had to sit through one failed attempt at humor after another.Just skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful","review":"This could have been an enjoyable romantic comedy. Yet, so much went wrong with it. There is a lack of chemistry between the leads. The tone of their relationship is cruel, abusive, manipulative, and demeaning.

Despite differences and egos between two people, we all have mistakes. Owning up to it is the hardest thing and finding love through a second chance is special. Even if it involves this absurd journey where two people who start off hating each other are thrust into a tight bind and need each other to survive.The Bounty Hunter, starring Gerard Butler and Jennifer Aniston is just another comedic romance. The film tries to develop the story by introducing suspense and mystery as to why the bounty hunter who is chasing his ex-wife is suddenly being hunted himself.It has an identity crisis that never fully lives up to anything more than just another comedic love comedy movie. There are too many movies and I would only recommend if your a fan of both Aniston and Butler."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of Gerard Butler's talent","review":"Gerard Butler is a good actor that is wasted on this movie. Just check out \\"Dear Frankie\\" and \\"PS I Love You.\\" But this movie was just so boring that the 111 minutes seemed like forever. Jennifer Aniston looks great but in my opinion, it doesn't matter what movie she's in, she acts the same. I don't see the character, just Jennifer Aniston. The Stewart character was especially annoying. The character I loved in this movie is Nicole's mom, Kitty who is played by Christine Baranski.

At times this movie borders on slap stick comedy.If you are a woman, and you are romantic, and love Jennifer Aniston, and like boy meets girl movies, then you may enjoy this one.If your a guy, bring lots of beer for this one.It is so predictable with virtually ever story line having been over explored since the early 1900's in cinema and later in TV."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Formula, No Sparkle -","review":"Milo Boyd (Gerard Butler) is a bounty hunter, recently divorced and recently fired from the police department. He has gambling debts to pay and becomes ecstatic when he realizes his latest gig is bail-skipper ex wife, Nicole (Jennifer Aniston). Not only does he get to nab Nicole, this job pays a whopping $50,000, much more than the usual fare. The plot is set, but this becomes formula comedy chase and make-up. Nicole has no intention of getting nabbed without a fight. Complicating matters, Nicole's wannabe-boyfriend, Stewart (Jason Sudeikis) joins the chase.The movie was just a basic formula script, thrown together to make a buck on the star power of Jennifer Aniston. She does her best to save it, but it just falls like heavy bread. There is no sparkle to make it work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was thinking that with two solid actors playing the lead roles in this film, it would be funny to watch and a good satire on bounty hunters. But it turned out to be a big letdown in more ways than one. The story didn't have a very good plot, and the writing came across as really sloppy with a very bad ending. It started off with promise - as so many bad movies do - but it only went downhill from there. Definitely not a best for Jennifer or Gerard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Movie!","review":"I watched this film on a flight home from Europe. It was completely unfunny and one of the worst films I ever saw.

I wasted a whole hour of staring into space time on this clunker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse Than I Expected","review":"Wwow..what a dud! I didn't have high hopes for this one. The trailer looked like this would be a movie with a few laughs. This movie sucked. There was nothing to it. The potetnial was there but it fell flat. Neither Butler or Aniston were funny or made the movie work. the idea that they got involved in a police investigation and the activities that followed were just ridiculous. Characters were stupid. Certainly not a comedy.What a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I guess I am disappointed in the roles Gerard Butler is taking lately. His work earlier in THE JURY and DEAR FRANKIE showed much more depth in feeling and better acting skill.

Complete waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Action Comedy","review":"Thoroughly enjoyed this action comedy. The first time I saw it, I think that I was expecting something like The Ugly Truth. It is not anything like that movie and I think that I was disappointed. Since that time, I have seen it 4 more times and really liked it. It has several story lines and it's interesting the way they all come together. I think that Jennifer and Gerard have a great chemistry together. So many people keep acting as if this is a romantic comedy while there is a facet of that, there are other story lines involving car wrecks, fights,casinos and gun play. I will really be happy when it is released on DVD. As far as I'm concerned, it's a keeper. It is just entertainment and at this time, I'm really enjoying that."},{"rating":"1","title":"low budget","review":"I was hoping the best for this movie. The movie was drawn out and had a lame story.This movie was a desperate attempt to keep Jennifer Anistons career going.The story was basically a run around catch me if you can. Can clearly see that Jennifer Aniston had botox put in her upper lip-certain times she looked liked she was punched in the mouth (deal with age Jennifer).I still don't see what directors see in Gerard Butler. He is not a very good actor. So happy I viewed it first.watch it if you have nothing better to do. But all in all it was a really stupid movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Romantic comedy - without the romance or comedy","review":"Based on its plot,The Bounty Hunterwould seem like anotherMr & Mrs Smith [Blu-ray] - a married couple at each others' throats - literally. However, it doesn't work nearly as well. Frankly, for a romantic comedy, there's not much romance or comedy.The twists and turns aren't very exciting. Jennifer Anniston's acting is lifeless. As a movie, it's not horrible viewing, but I wouldn't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Well, I think the whole movie fell to pieces due to Jennifer's acting, which was not very good. Then how could you go wrong with Butler's performance? He was the heart of the film.

I didn't believe for a moment that Jennifer Aniston's character was a reporter. They didn't establish her character or any of the characters enough for us to care. What was that co-worker reporter for in the script? I thought he was annoying. The chemistry between the lead actors was just okay but not great. What is so special about Gerald Butler? He may have his charm but not in this film. Better direction might have helped.Jennifer Aniston is due a good film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Movie","review":"This was a wonderful movie.

Granted there was a sappy moment or two, but it was minimal and really was more comedy & action than it was a romantic comedy. I watched \\"Date Night\\" a few days before watching this movie in the theatre and I definitely like this movie better. Date Night was so one-dimensionable, it just tried to be a stupid, silly comedy and I don't think succeeded very well at it. This movie had a bit of action, a lot of comedy, and a bit of romance. Unlike Date Night, the story in The Bounty Hunter was really pretty good.The pairing and the acting of both Butler & Aniston was great - there was some great chemistry there. This is a much better \\"date movie\\" than Date Night, so if you are deciding which one to see in the theatre, I would definitely recommend this one.

In every role she is simply another very similar version of herself.

You do need to be quite close to the unit to get the benefit of it but since it is silent and doesn't let off steam this is fine.I wish the refill pads were carried in more stores but I am able to get them online, I recommend getting a few refills right away as it only comes with 5. You will go through that many in one cold.I used it myself when I had a severe head cold and it does help, but not as much as a regular vaporizer when things get really bad.

This was really nothing but an art appreciation lecture burnt onto a DVD. Nothing moves in this work because it's all just his artwork and nothing more. No scenes of Paris or Northern Europe at the time; no Victorians nor Edwardians attending art exhibits; nothing. There are two self-portraits of Mondrian. There are no photographs of him nor his family. As an artist, he seems to have moved from expressionism to abstraction/avant-garde work. Mondrian is principly known for the latter, yet this DVD focuses on the former. Further, the narrator never says why Mondrian switched artistic styles. That would have made a great discussion, particularly if it would have been historicized a la the change of the centuries. However, this was not done. I almost like the artist less because of this poor study. His spirit should leave its grave and sue the makers of this awful DVD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea with a major flaw...","review":"If you're looking for French resources to learn the language with your children, I can't recommend French For Beginners without reservation. Many of the songs are cute and catchy (with the exception of the highly irritating alphabet song), and teach common vocabulary like numbers, food, colors, days of the week, animals, and greetings. One side is mostly French to English; the other side has the same songs - English to French.However, the children on the recording (with one possible exception) are NOT native French speakers, and don't even sound as if they were well coached. The pronunciation of many sections is so bad, it sounds like a person with no knowledge of French saying the words for the first time. This ruined it for me - catchy tunes are of no benefit if they can't pronounce the words right! What a shame, because this would be a lovely resource otherwise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely a disappointment","review":"Considering some of my favorite authors were involved in this collaboration I had high hopes of a fast paced, fun mystery. It was OK but the little things bothered me. The policeman who was described as a bear and a Columbo type and then described by another author as a hunk. Caroline, the main character, didn't seem to be consistent in her behavior or her characterization. And the ending seemed rushed and a little trite.

I don't care for nonsense. With writers like Lisa Scottoline and Anne Perry involved, I was hoping for a mystery that would be worth reading even without the \\"serial\\" gimmick.

Rather than laying out only checklists and protocols, the authors focus on the process of decision-making and relationships formed with families. This edited volume retains a strong and supportive voice throughout as it sensitively and directly addresses some of the most difficult situations that health-care-providers (and families) face. It weaves in not only specific suggestions for managing medically difficult and emotionally complex situations but also frameworks for understanding and more broadly applying these approaches.

In this album, each of Mr Crawford's renditions is a celebration that keeps you under its spell for hours after hearing it. The 'Medley' is glorious.

It stands apart, almost a genre in itself. So I heartily recommend this piece. Listen to it again and again. It may sound like chaos at first (and it is, because it's Ives!), but it's glorious chaos, and the material is actually quite unified.Now: this recording leaves something to be desired. First of all the acoustic is a little distant to my ears, as if the mikes were not placed close enough to the soundboard. Of course this is how it sounds in a hall, but I don't think this sound works for a recording, especially of piano. Piano is a strange instrument that doesn't record well. Anyway, the distant sound is forgiveable, but there is some serious distortion in the second half (or so) of the recording, which I find annoying.If you can get this for a few bucks, it's not bad, but the distortion is distracting.But the playing is quite good.

You seem to wade through countless repeats of Ildiran treachery to come to a teaser of information from some of the other, more interesting chararcters. The last 20 pages click into place and develop the new storyline for book 5...and, yes I'm going to buy that one too, if only to find out what happened with Margaret Collicos!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of Action","review":"This series seems to be dragging on a bit, as there seem to be new elements introduced to the story in every book to further complicate things. However, in this book, the action seemed to pick up quite a bit, with a lot of things finally happening and setting up what should be an exciting full blown war with many different sides.There were some things that bothered me in this book that seemed a little silly, but nothing that annoyed me too much.I think this is one of the best books in the series so far, and hopefully, they will pick up from here. I just hope we don't have to wait an eternity between books."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY DISSAPPOINTING","review":"i end up skimming through way more than i'm actually reading. there are only a couple of characters that seem to be developed beyond interest. i intend on finishing the series, because i've come too far to not want to find out how the big picture ends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be kind to your reader, Mr. Anderson","review":"I agree, it is a page turner but not a very good one. The story jumps from one event to the next without much cohesion. My feeling is, the author tries to get as many sequals out of this story as possible. To make this possible, he adds strange new characters. For example, mom, after having been frozen for 30 years, turns out to be an unfriendly monster, after she thaws. Help!Afterwards, I had to read for balance some of Asimov's novels, who was always kind to the reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment, after the wonderful first three","review":"Unfortunately like many other writers, Anderson falls into the \\"money Pit Syndrome\\". Starts a series with a wonderful and refreshing beginning (first three books) and tries to extend the success as much as possible. Not by creating an equal maintenance to his well written start, oh no, but in trying to squeeze in a book which will produce a nice earning but not necessarily readers enjoyment. in this forth book to the Saga of Seven Suns, Anderson decided to fill the pages with scenes we have already read in the previous books (and in this book as well). Worse, the logical writing that was embedded into the first three books, just vanished and in many events in this book, he contradicts himself, as if he writes for the sake of filling the pages rather than increasing the tale. As a result of which, the story is not surprising anymore and most of the events are well expected, so much so, that you find yourself taking more and more \\"breaks\\" of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible book and series","review":"This book and the series are boring, predictable, and had no characters I cared about.

I'm writing this review because I have wanted to say \\"thank you\\" to the author for many years for writing it. Having suffered on and off with panic disorder since I was 12 (I'm now 40), I had never encountered anyone who really knew what I was going through until I read this book. When times are difficult, it is still a consolation and comfort to think about this book and know that I am not alone. I appreciate the courage, humor and compassion of the author so much!"},{"rating":"1","title":"WAY too dumbed-down, needs more math","review":"For a undergraduate text, I expect more mathematical explanations and modeling and less dumbed-down concepts. This book is really geared toward the lowest common denominator. The course that uses this book at my college is hands-down the \\"dumbest\\" class required for majors. It reads like a middle-school science textbook."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast 2 Player Action with a some stratigic thinking too","review":"The 2 player mode is great, you chose from 6 cool charactorseach armed with a long range weapon and a variaty of traps. you haveto trick you opponent into running into hidden bombs, mines or 4 other great traps. the one player game is the same exept you have to go up against a computer controlled opponent who is usally too easy or too tough. this game is great with two, and dull with one after you beat it a few times."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's great if it's what you're into.","review":"If you're the kind of gamer who can enjoy lots of ass-kicking without much in the way of plot, and like your single-player games to be pretty hard, you'd have a hard time doing better than Trap Gunner. It offers a lot of ways to kill the other guy, and is terrific in single or two player. There's not a lot in the way of plot or diversity, so I can't think of much to say. There are a pretty wide variety of traps and pickups, but it's essentially always the same idea- use a wide variety of devices and weapons to kill your enemy before the reverse happens."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun book...","review":"patterns look great and easy enough for an experienced crochet-er...can't wait to give some of these cozy looking socks a try..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crocheted Socks","review":"I don't like knitting socks, so I tried this book to crochet socks. I found these patterns virtually impossible -- most of the stitches were slip stitches and on these small crochet hooks and thin sock yarn, one could go blind. Also, even working very loosely, it is practically impossible to insert the hook into the loops. I don't recommend this -- and I've been crocheting for over 30 years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Creepy Feet!","review":"As a non-crocheter I can't comment on how simple the patterns are or whether the yarn is easy to find. I'm glad other reviewers have the expertise to highlight these issues. I bought this book as a Christmas present for my wife, Amy, and she seems happy with it. (No, it isn't the only present I got her. Don't go there.)I'm getting a nice present in return. She's crocheting me a pair of those creepy socks with individual toes, like a pair of gloves. Very cool! I once came home from work to find my daughter Jenn crashed on the couch, wrapped in a blanket with her feet sticking out and wearing a green pair of these. It was a startling sight--I thoughtShrekhad broken into my house.And now I will get to scare people with my own creepy feet. I will take off my shoes at the office and high-strung Federal workers will run screaming from the room. Not the first time for that, actually. But still...big fun!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Socks","review":"Having taught myself to crochet I spent two months experimenting with making socks and landed up with a method that results in no seams or bumps and is reasonably soft. This book might have helped a little with the process but it is one of those books that lays out a pattern and off you go. Fancy patterns for sure and nice for the distaff side. I was hoping for something very plain with more attention given to custom fit and comfort. I stuck the book on the shelf perhaps I might give it a hook sometime in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was hoping for more.","review":"I consider myself an intermediate crocheter, by means that if I wanted to design my own sock pattern I could but I'd rather be sure and use other people's (professionals) patterns.I am really sorry for spending money on this one. Out of the 16 patterns only two are for toe-up socks. They are hard to interpret and the difference between them is not that great. They almost all, look the same until you start crocheting the leg and by then I'm sure you can find a nice stitch to use by yourself. Seriously, there are far better patterns for free out on the internet."},{"rating":"2","title":"ALWAYS PLACE A STITCH MARKER IN THE LAST STITCH","review":"I absolutely love this book. This book is a must have for you crochet library. I have made a couple pairs of socks and they turned out wonderful.I do feel there is one bit of instruction that is left out. YOU SHOULD ALWAYS PLACE A STITCH MARKER IN THE LAST STITCH OF THE ROW YOU ARE WORKING ON(except heel). Move the marker up with each row. When you get to the *HEEL* instructions, never touch the marker.Leave in last stitch untouched until you get to the *GUSSET*. For example on page 16 under *HEEL*, sc 25 sts and leave your marker untouched until you get to the instructions for the *GUSSET*. Then they will have you place additional markers on the sides. When you get the instructions for the *FOOT* only remove side markers. Keep last stitch marker in place and move it with each row. Keep using the end of row stitch marker till the end of the project. By keeping your marker in place you sock will be alot easier. Have fun!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Sock Book EVER","review":"I love to crochet and I especially like making socks (the kind you can wear with shoes, rather than slippers). I'd purchased several other books and tried a few free Internet patterns but hadn't found anything I really liked until this book. The patterns are easy to follow and the directions are concise and complete. I highly recommend this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Trying Too Hard-Boiled","review":"I thought this would be enjoyably bad but it was just plain lousy. The lead character is idiotically invincible in every way, like James Bond meets the Terminator meets John Holmes. The plot is all about revenge for childhood mistreatment by villians who are one hundred percent bad. Our hero uses bullets and a conveniently infinite pile of cash to get what he wants. The whole thing is self consciously \\"seedy\\" and \\"sexy\\" in a way that a junior high age boy might have found impressive in 1979. Oh yeah, I almost forgot, there's also an anti-gravity invention tossed in, with about as much relevence as a space ship in the Maltese Falcon. I've read some Spillane before and I know he's not Shakespeare, but skip this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for military buffs","review":"This well written compact book allows the reader more than battle details. It helps one understand the circumstances that made the allied shipping vulnerable though ultimately successful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally Stupid","review":"I hate to disagree with the other reviewers, but I found the book a big disappointment. The main character, Streeter, is almost one dimensional, the dialogue is a string of cliches, and the rest of the characters are intellectually limited and hopelessly predictable. My impression was that Streeter wasn't \\"tough\\", he was just too slow to know what he was up against. Perhaps the other books in the series are better, but this example guarantees that I won't bother to find out."},{"rating":"2","title":"The entire family liked the Lever 2000 Anti-Bacterial ...","review":"The entire family liked the Lever 2000 Anti-Bacterial Soap.

I just bought a second for work after a tendonitis flare-up partly due to working long hours on the computer. This is much better than all the bean-bag style junk out there. My first one had a funny chemical smell that took great pains and soaking to remove. Although, this second one is at work, I don't notice much of any smell so it seems the new ones are better in this regard. Kudos to 3M for another great product. Odd that I wasn't able to find them in the usual computer superstores though. Thank goodness for Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"To Gel or Not To Gel?","review":"This is not the best wrist rest.As wrist rests go, only one wrist rest must exist as best.It is billed as a \\"gel\\" wrist rest. As such, the reviewer must defer to the manufacturer's best judgment, because this wrist rest does list (in my case, it lists to the right). I do find that the odor emitted by the new wrist rest is not the best, but you do get used to it.Should a user get used to the wrist rest smell, though, the user used to the best flex wrist rest's existing smell is rewarded.So, to sum up, here we don't have the best right-listing flex wrist rest that exists."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slippery Mat","review":"I bought this mat, used it once for flow yoga, then exchanged it for a Prana Eco mat.When I bought the mat I told the sales girl at the sporting goods store that I wanted a mat that wasn't slippery. This is the mat I went home with. Took it to a yoga class and as soon as my hands started to perspire I slipped all over the place. I tried flipping the mat over, thinking I was using the wrong side. The other side was as slippery as the first. After spending several minutes trying to stop slipping I finally grabbed a face towel and used that for traction under my hands for the duration of the class.I do yoga 1-2 times a week. I'm really pleased with the Prana Eco mat. It costs a few dollars more, but I do not have the slipping problem that I had with the Hugger Mugger."},{"rating":"1","title":"Compresses Too Easily","review":"I used this Hugger Mugger Tapas Ultra 74\\" yoga mat for the first time today. Found it to be much less comfortable than my old thin mat. It compresses immediately under any foot, knee, elbow or hand pressure and doesn't release the impression of the pressure for about 5 minutes. Stickiness is adequate, and the length is good, but that doesn't come close to offseting the lack of pressure resiliency. It's being returned today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Buy","review":"I bought this mat 5 months ago. It has been used for an Ashtanga class twice a week for 5 months and wore out! Wore a hole completely through it. The cost is such that I expected better service. A huge disapointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quality Disappointing","review":"I bought this mat about 4 months ago. I did like the mat initially. However, after about 3 months of use the mat started showing wear and now little foam pieces are starting to come off the surface of the mat in the heavy use areas. I don't have much experience with yoga mats, but I did expect that it would last longer than that. I contacted the manufacturer about the problem with the mat, but they did not offer to exchange the mat."},{"rating":"2","title":"First-time Mat buyer, excellent purchase","review":"I recently bought this mat to accompany my new work-out video and I am very pleased. It is much longer than I need (I'm only 62 inches tall), but I'm not complaining! Yes, there is a chemically smell, but I don't really mind. It is comfortable and protects my back and bones against my hardwood floors. It rolls up very nicely and lays against the wall of my small condo. What more can I say other than it does its job, and does it well?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very, very slippery when wet!","review":"I bought this because of the extra thickness and it is thick; however, this mat gets very, very slippery with just minimal sweating. I am fairly new to yoga and I'm not doing hot, sweaty Ashtanga - we're talking basic yoga with some vinyasa. This would be unsuitable if you were a really proficient practitioner. I've had this less than a year and have tried various cleansers but nothing makes it less slippery. I'm in the market for a new mat and will try something more highly textured."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best mat I've tried","review":"I bought this mat after I tried a friend's. I had two other mats, but they weren't very sticky, were too thin, and one smells strongly of chemicals even though I tried to let it air out over a few months. Laying on it in a yoga class actually made me feel sick.The original tapas mat is very light (even though I purchased the \\"ultra\\"-- which is thicker than the original \\"orignal\\"), very, very sticky and does not reek of plasticy, rubbery chemicals at all.I think it would be hard to be disappointed with this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I unfortunately received a hugger mugger tapas ultra mat that started to breakdown almost immediately.

The best times for me to watch it was when I was home alone because at many points, eg when the NSEA Protecter had to run from Sarris, the pod landing on the planet and the final battle, I would turn the surround sound to very high levels. If you are the same as me you will love this cd, listened to it a dozen times in the first week and during some tracks will start quoting the movie. Favorite thing is hearing the main theme in different ways, very quick and exiteing In the battles then slowed down for parts like seeing the ship for the first time and very slowed down for dramic screens like Jason admitting that he was lying. If you love the movie you will love this CD and will not disappoint like the comic sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"After reading this book I went out to buy copies for friends with Asthma.

For those of us who hate textbook reading, there is also a little bit of fun thrown in for good measure.

As the only core member of the Tsunami Rangers that paddles a decked(true)kayak, he lends a real, practical level of expertise to the science and execution of safety practices and rescue procedures. Unlike many other treatments of this subject, Lull looks at the big picture of hazards and conditions that can complicate recovery and rescue, rather than looking at the practices in a vacuum. Great photos give a real sense of progression to the rescue and recovery methods presented. These photographs are backed with well-written explanations that help paddlers choose and apply methods that appeal and apply to them. A really concise book that packs Lull's extensive experience and knowledge into a portable format, this is required reading for anyone venturing into water in a kayak."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read for Sea Kayakers","review":"This is the best safety and rescue book with a wealth of information every boater should know.

Although the writing is mediocre and the descriptive passages are too long and obviously padded, I was propelled by the misguided expectation that the solution to the mystery would be logical and satisfying, neither of which is true. The disappointing revelation of the identity of the murderer is almost an afterthought, the unlikely relationship between the protagonists is nonsensical, and the ethical decision forced upon Faith is the stuff of romance novels. A sensible person would have made another choice.

Oh my! How disappointing. I figured out it was a \\"first book\\" right away, but even allowing for that, the dialogue was stilted, the characters were poorly developed, and the ending was awful.

That alone would have make me reconsider. The narration is never interesting, never grabbing, never anything but repetative plodding, but her style is not the unexcusable part. The worst part is the completely un-shocking twist in the don't-even-tell-me-you-don't-know-whodunit.

If you're looking for insightful close-readings of some Platonic dialogues and their ethical implications, this book does that quite well.Derrida's two essays deal with the foreigner in Plato, and he does quite a nice job of articulating the tensions inherent in hospitality--the home into which the stranger enters is my home, but I have to yield place to the stranger while remaining solidly the proprietor of the home. That tension extends to national identities, theological questions, and all sorts of other fun stuff by the end of the book.I still have not read the commentary in the facing columns of the book, so read some other reviews if you'd like to know about them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nesmith more than one of the Monkees","review":"One of the most underated artists around.

Each of her reprinted stories has a lesson, or special matter of understanding within its pages that she feels worthy of sharing with us. With her guidance at the end of each one we may gain some better understanding of ourselves or someone around us. A perfect example of this is in Conrad Aiken's Silent Snow, Secret Snow which deals with a twelve year old boy and the beginning of mental illness that goes undiagnosed even though his parents know something isn't right. There is a great lesson in this story. Bond is to be commended for this work. Excellent reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"the text","review":"The text doesn't provide what it advertises to provide.

But every band has a history, and this 2CD set by the The Living End proves theirs is a good one.I wouldn't call them \\"punk,\\" by any means. If you examine their song structure, it's merely the age-old pop-rock motif, merely dressed up in greaser clothes and outfitted with an upright bass. But that aside, this is a great example of how good aggressive pop music can be. The first disc is slightly rawer than the second, but there is nary a clunker in the lot.So if you were thinking about filing these guys under the \\"One more Stray Cats wannabe band,\\" you should think twice. The Living End are absolutely qualified at what they do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sick Hip Hop","review":"This album is the bomb, All the songs are tight the beats ride perfectly with there vocies.

After the show ended I bought the book, and found that even though the t.v. series was wonderfully funny, the book was knock-down, drag-out HILARIOUS! Not a book to take to bed with you, while your spouse is attempting to sleep!Each chapter is complete in every way, a perfect humorous short story and could stand alone by itself. So it makes the perfect daily read, as long as you can resist going on to the next chapter!I have now read it 5 times and will be going on my 6th soon. I usually save the book for Fall reading.I gave it to one of my friends, whose husband is a literature professor, and she loves it. HE, \\"who must be obeyed\\", hasn't read it, HATES it since it makes her laugh, and has almost shamed her into not rereading it, by calling it \\"vacuous\\".

These are re-recorded and not always by the original artists. If you want the real thing, don't waste your money here! If you are as familiar with these songs as I am, then every different note will jar your nerves just as they do mine. These recordings are simpy fakes, forged perhaps by some of the original musicians, but not the same sound. The fine print on the label reads: \\"This album may contain re-recorded tracks by the original artists. Tracks featuring groups may not include all the original members.\\" Folks, every track features a group, and there are no two ways about it-these are not the hits of '67."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seems to be a trend here....","review":"I just wanted to echo what \\"Music Fan\\" has already stated in his review above. I have not listened to this CD, but I found the same thing to be true with another compilation called \\"1967 Juke Box Hits\\", and left a similar review there. That CD states \\"original artists\\" on it.I don't why somebody would want to go to this much trouble to plagiarize the original songs; but in any event, it is false advertising. Shame on them for this fraud."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Book For Children By L.J. Smith","review":"Wow. This, of all L.J. Smith's books was the best for kids. I'd say 10+. It had a very different concept unlike all of the redundant books in the world. That's L.J. Smith's talent, giving readers something new. No cussing, no sex (very little romance), not gruesome at all. A great magical world that readers of all ages will enjoy. It really is an amazing book.WHAT THIS BOOK IS ABOUT:Four siblings, three girls and a boy, all have stumbled into a world through mirrors in attempt to save the world by freeing a magician who can save our world. They have to defeat and outsmart evil magicians and creatures. There is even a little folklore in it. Over all, a good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Captain Streeter Pioneer","review":"This biography/autobiography has led local historians astray ever since 1913! Streeter wanted one kind of book, and his collaborator wanted another, and they reached a compromise only after Streeter stopped publication. As a result, there is an interesting account of his Michigan boyhood, lies about his early manhood out West and in the Civil War, and wonderful whoppers about his years fighting over ownership of Lake Shore Drive in Chicago. Streeter was a con-man, forger, and colorful mythmaker. Read it for entertainment, but not for history."},{"rating":"2","title":"These work great","review":"I use them for most of my stereo installs.

I was so bored with step workouts always being the same up up down down that I decided to try this. Crunch always has very good workouts and I was not disappointed with this one. I've done the The Next Step a ton of times since I recieved this dvd. It is my favorite workout right now and I'm smiling through just about the whole thing. I like the music for this workout, it really gets you pumping instead of just being played quietly in the background. There are some problems with the cueing, but once you do it a couple of times you'll have the steps down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Choreography DIFFICULT","review":"The choreography of both workouts on this DVD is much too difficult. Even after a few run-throughs, I still don't have either one down and now am giving up on them.

Save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent dvd","review":"I've had the vhs version of the step fitness training called Fat Blaster for at least 5 years and I love it. Now I am buying de DVD. Kendell Hogan, the instructor, is excellent. The step drills keep us fit and in high spirits. The instructor explains the exercises carefully and prepares us for any change in advance. Besides, the drills help a lot in brain fitness too. I am 68 and need to keep my brain cells in good shape. The coreography is not difficult. The choice of music is excellent. The second step presentation I do not know."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over-rated!","review":"Don't buy this dvd unless you are looking for an unfulfilling dance party. First of all, there is so much going on in the background of \\"Kendall's\\" portion of the workout, that you can't even focus on what you are supposed to be doing...which is just as frustrating. I thought this was going to be a STEP workout. I have been taking step classes for several years, and have never been so unsatisfied with a workout. The same goes for the other half of the video. The instructor is terrible at calling out cues, and once again, nothing but dance moves. I didn't buy this to learn how to do the mamba. I hardly broke a sweat with this video, and would not recommend it to anyone looking for a serious step workout."},{"rating":"1","title":"to slow and to complicated","review":"The first workout on this dvd was for first time steppers and the second workout was for very experienced steppers, so for those who are in between newby and novice it was either too slow or too complicated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stepping with a twist of Salsa Dancing Wow!!!","review":"I just purchased this cd and it is wonderful.

(Especially since I am latina and know it a lot better than these people could ever try.) I just want to work out. I find this work out slow and the faces the back girls make annoying. He has some good routines which are interrupted by slow salsa or mambo moves. UNNECESSARY!I didn't even finish the other work out. Again, if I want to take a dance class, I'll go to the studio.

For sweating and getting your heart rate up, keep looking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who needs a step for this?","review":"I didn't care for this dvd at all, the first workout hardly used the step, it was mostly marching. It was not much of a cardio workout. Also some of the moves were hard to follow, and I'm not an amateur. The second workout is just as bad, especially since one of the girls [rear] is hanging out of her shorts. It also concentrates on dancing too much, not enough step..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Burned more calories in my sleep--but perfect for beginners","review":"I'm a pretty advanced stepper (I have an extensive dance background and the step classes at my gym are now all too easy for me), so I was pleased to see the reviews stating that this was a challenging workout. Bo-ring! I didn't break a sweat at all and my heart rate didn't change one whit, even though I tried adding my own mods to make it harder. I have a busy schedule and don't always have time to get to the gym, so video workouts are a good solution for me. When will *someone* come out with a series of videos for people with advanced fitness levels?!?!?! This video is a huge waste of money unless you're a beginner. Then it's really the right thing for you because the instructions are very clearly laid out and the instructors and atmosphere are very positive and upbeat."},{"rating":"2","title":"First half Very Good.....Second Half Not so Good","review":"I purchased this video along with some Yoga Zone videos, just for variety of workout after having a baby. The first half of this video is very fun and upbeat the drums add an extra to the workout. The steps are explained for you before you start doing the repetitions which is very helpful for a first timer or somebody trying to get back into the swing of things. The second half on the otherhand was a huge dissapoint. The instructors voice is very annyoing and the movements are very choppy at the least. I don't think I will ever do the second half of the video which is a waste. If the second half was as good as the first this would definitely get a 4 star rating, but it fell far short."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful....","review":"I purchased this dvd nearly a year ago and have done the workouts only twice. Actually, I couldn't keep up with the workouts, neither the first nor the second. Cueing is bad, too many dancey moves, I felt I was going to injure my knees (and I don't have problems with my knees!). I quit. This was the first time I viewed it. A few months went by and thought I'd give the dvd another try. My first impression was right, it was awful & I couldn't do it. If you're looking for a GOOD step workout, try Kathy's Smith's Step Workout from 1992. It's a sweatin' workout without complicated moves. I only wish it was released on dvd rather than this piece of garbage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top-notch","review":"Sometimes a cookbook is so comprehensive, in terms of recipes and in capturing an attitude toward cuisine, that its greatness is obvious. This is such a book. If you know anything at all about Rick Bayless, you know that this isn't your Chi-chi's Mexican cooking. Within the pages of this book you will find dishes of incredible depth and you will learn a lot about the culture that engendered this cuisine.If the complicated main course items are rather daunting, the salsas are quite do-able. By going through the salsa section I feel like my own cooking has gained a new syntax. Whether this is going to be a frequently used cookbook depends on your ambition and of course the amount of time you can devote to cooking. Even if you make a small fraction of the recipes, you will gain a lot of insight into Mexican cooking just by reading the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm sorry I bought it","review":"I am an adventurous cook, but try to stick with cookbooks that have fairly normal ingredients. This book will probably never be used due to the fact that the staples in my pantry do not include:Huitlacoche (a blight that grows on ears of corn)Epazote (Rick says use these IF you can find them)Fresh cactus paddlesFresh or frozen Banana LeavesPuffed amaranthand Prickly PearsThis is just a few of the ingredients that I noticed by skimming through the book. No telling how many other Exotic ingredients he instructs you to use. I am very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"overly complicated","review":"I've owned this book for two years and every time I try to find something to cook I end up putting it down with nothing selected. The recipes are creative but overly complicated. Authentic Mexican food, in my opinion, is deliciously simple and unpretentious. If you want a definitive or authentic guide to Mexican food, don't buy this one. If you want a good read and some fairly creative American gourmet takes on Mexican food this is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Error I counted the number of pages.

She promised test results and nevergave them to us for creating a manual. So one needsto test a population to get the proper statistics.A number of psychologists have used this test. Butthey don't want to reveal their results.

Prior to purchaseing this player, I purchased a Rio. I returned the Rio after having problems with the pair that I purchased and picked a pair of these- no problems with either.. Great Product-Buy it...."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this thing!","review":"Perhaps I'm not as savvy as most of the reviewers, but I had trouble with the software. I didn't think it was as straightforward as some others did, and there are no written instructions on how to transfer music from CDs to the player. For example, it was not plain for all to see that you can download the music so that you have different levels of quality.However, once I figured it out, downloading went quickly. The ear buds are awful, so I am using the earphones from my portable CD player (which won't be used very much anymore). And, even with the full 2 hours of music downloaded, it still sounds great. I love the fact that I have 2 hours of music without having to lug a CD wallet with me, and that I can change tunes pretty quickly. The additional memory is my next purchase.This is a terrific product, and shop-intel (where I got mine) is offering it at a great price. Amazon's price is on a par with other vendors' prices."},{"rating":"2","title":"Personal Audio Player is jammin and easy to use!","review":"I bought my personal audio player on shop-intel.com last week. They are phasing out the division that makes them so you can get some great deals on them now.

I already had the software installed (downloaded from intel.com)so i just plugged in the USB cable, and presto! I was listening to songs like that. The earphones were very uncomfortable, just like was mentioned on here, so I bought some sony excercise earphones which make it a complete package.I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for an mp3 player. Its small, has good memory, and even after bouncing on a trampoline with it, it didn't fall off my belt."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for exercise","review":"This is an excellent device for someone who wants to put an hours worth of exercise music, this is the device.

But it does not take long to gt the mp3 files on the player.This is a good player with not to many extras youcan adjust the bass and treb and it has repet and random but that is about it.

Again, I would not use this feature anyway.I use my player for entertainment... it has excellent sound, is fairly simple to use and is compatible w/ XP, stores enough music for me to run 7 miles without listening to the same songs (even without memory card) and doesnt seem to be HORRIBLE with the batteries. why didnt I give it 5 stars? the headphones are the most uncomfortable things I have ever put in my ears.No kidding. good sound, but they are huge and uncomfortable.

I'm sure when the product was introduced, it did a fine job.When it arrived, it was sticky. When I say \\"sticky\\", I mean that someone used a solvent or something on it that I cannot remove. I also did some research on-line to determine various functions, etc. At some point, I just had to weigh the time I was investing versus the nominal cost of the item and sadly concluded, it was not worth the time (\\"sticky\\" was a factor)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good little MP3 player","review":"I just bought this a month ago and I do really enjoy it.

Intel is sending my third one to me this week. First one broke inexplicably after maybe 5 months of moderate use. Second one broke after no more than ten uses. It's important to note that I DO NOT use the player during excercise so the players have obviously been faulty. Intel was super nice the first time this happened. The second time, I spoke with the same person, and he said they can't keep sending me a new player everytime I break one. How's that for customer service! The player is great when it works and I love it. However, I would stay away from this product based on my experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Buy","review":"I found the MP3 player easy to install and easy to use.

Intel AudioManager and the included version of MusicMatch simply did not work due to some conflict with the Rio software, so I was out of luck. Since I knew the Rio player and software worked, I returned the Intel player and picked up a Nike PSA, which works well. Be forewarned that Intel has stopped supporting this product. On the style side, I thought the included faceplates were ugly, and the whole faceplate attachment felt flimsy, one more small plastic piece to break the first time you drop it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A quality, no-frills player that's a great value!","review":"Intel did a really good job with this player. Had the software installed, tunes tranferred, and a new CD ripping on the included, full-featured MusicMatch software within minutes. Really pleased with this purchase.

(Isn't that always the way?) Anywho, it's not long before the creepy \\"going's on\\" begin, the only problem being that none of them are actually creepy. Apparently the tribal folk have cursed our hero with the flu or some such ailment, as he spends a large part of the movie wracked with feverish sweats. (If only it were dysentery). Pure nonsense and obviously not produced by Hammer, the studio responsible for the best of sixties British, fright-fests.

The pieces are tumbled glass in four colors (ours are white, green, blue, and black), the pieces are a bit too big for the set - more than six in a cup tends to spill around, so care is needed.Still, for a five-year-old, this is a great starter set and it is portable enough to come on vacation with us.And he LOVES it!

First there was \\"Simpson's Road Rage\\" which was Crazy Taxi with Simpsons characters, which was half decent. But when they tried to apply the Simpsons to the Tony Hawk formula, they fell flat on their face, much like you will find youself doing quite often if you play this game. The controls so horrible that they render the game practically unplayable. The physics will not allow you to do what you'd like to do, making many of the goals completely unrealistic. The only thing this game has going for it are its graphics.Bottom line: If you are going to buy this game, make sure you are willing to spend a lot of time learning the controls, because otherwise you will put it down after fifteen minutes and never have a desire to play it again.

My son, who loves the Tony Hawk games as well as the Simpson's Road Rage, found this Simpson's game to be virtually unplayable. It was frustrating to him because the tricks were difficult to perform in the time allowed and the combination of buttons to press were too complicated. I have watched him master other games (including SSX Tricky) and can't imagine how he manages to manuever them so well, which leads me to believe that this game is not well designed, as others had described in their reviews.

There seems to be no stomach for bands like this one, Shed Seven, Cast, etc. in Canada and the U.S. And, it takes a huge label push to make Travis a \\"hit\\" here as well. More fool us. This is yet another album I recommend to people who think rock is dead. No way, No how. Michael Head is a superb writer and performer and the group scores on each of the album's 12 cuts.

In fact, the menu provides only English with closed captions, with all the little sound descriptions like [water sloshing], [cattle lowing], [people muttering] which, while possibly useful to the hearing-impaired, are a constant irritation for a hearing, non-Swedish-speaking viewer. I'm returning this DVD and will wait 'til Fox gets their presentation right, in line with the features description on the case. Sheesh."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing movie but read the books for the full story.","review":"Pelle the Conqueror is a great movie and can be seen as a movie that explains why Scandinavians migrated to the US. However the movie and the Martin Andersen Nexo books are really about the working class and what drove the Danes (and others) to set up the first labour unions. If you want to know what events made workers rebel, this is a movie that will show what went before labour rights in an inspiring and heart warming story."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT HAPPEN!","review":"I was TOTALLY DISAPPOINTED with this compilation... what a waste.

The motivation dates back to U-2 flying over the Soviet sky. From the Cold War, Mid East conflicts, Vietnam War, Gulf War and Afghanistan, the experience leads to the evolution of UAV's and makes them more and more powerful and robust.Unlike the large-scale UAV's such as the Predator and Global Hawk, small-scale or even micro-scale UAV's also found their importance and are being developed. This is also an interesting part in this film.The content of this DVD is pretty thorough and comprehensive. After having watched it, I just feel it completely delightful and entertaining. Although I've already had certain understanding about UAV's, it is still an eye-opener for me.I have seen couple tech-related films by NOVA and found them well made. This one is no exception. For people who like military aircraft, this is the one you never should miss."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT for the real beginners","review":"I bought several exercise dvds from Amazon, knowing that some would be duds.

Get those arms up! Abs tight!Hunh?I haven't the faintest idea what she's telling me to do, nor does she stop to demonstrate anything, just plows on ahead. I jogged along feeling annoyed and inferior.

A knight must have a lady, but while many books have been written about medieval women, few have focused on the knight's female counterpart in society. Again, emphasis is on the aristocracy, since that's where the records are, though Coss depends heavily on surviving letters and contemporary literature as well as household accounts, and he even employs such sources as monumental effigies and brasses. Both books are stimulating studies with many examples drawn from noble families of the period."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally some Pagan Solstice Music!","review":"I am very happy to finally find a CD with Pagan Carols. I really like the fact that it uses traditional tunes but with Pagan lyrics so they are easy to learn and everyone knows the melody already, so it really makes it easy to incorporate in rituals. The only downfall I have found is that the written lyrics in the CD cover has a LOT of typos and a lot of the words do not match what is actually being sung in the CD. So in order to type up copies of the lyrics for others to read when caroling i have to compare the lyrics to the CD itself to make sure the errors are fixed prior to ritual.

These Spanish soaps when they make it on DVD get edited by up to 70% that it's a waste of money to purchase them. I won't do so again. Maybe if you the sellers mentioned to your distributors of this problem they would improve the editing. Keep the entire story but sell it for a bit more money. Many people would pay more to get the entire FULL story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceptional Telenovela","review":"This is an excellent period novel. The actors are well convincing in their roles and there is plenty of action. Includes realistic sword fights and scenes filmed on location instead of in a studio. If you enjoy reading historical romance; you will just love this. Fernando Colunga does an outstanding performance. Daniela Roma shines as the villain in this. Besides the main story, there are several minor subplots between supporting actors which are also very intriguing. Watching the four male lead actors together reminded me a lot of \\"The Four Musketeers\\". The background musical score was quite appropriate and enhanced with singing by Placido Domingo. The DVD does have English subtitles for those who are still learning Spanish. I enjoyed it tremendously and wish they would do a sequel. American soap operas don't even come close to this. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"FINALLY ALBORADA ON DVD","review":"I LOVE novelas that are set in the early times!!

I was bummed, because I really wanted to see the Ethel Merman episode, but I am happy to have ANY episodes of this great retro show on home video. I bought the VHS box set several years ago and am wondering if anyone has noticed if they fixed this accidental goof. I would buy the DVD and chuck my VHS set if I knew the Merman episode was on it.

It's like an escape to a flower garden."},{"rating":"1","title":"TALES FROM the OVAL OFFICE or IF WALL COULD WRITE","review":"If walls could write stories, this would have been a more interestingly written tome. MONICA'S STORYs' dispassionate tone suggest that the author was trying to protect Monica by cleverly presenting the tale as if nothing sexually exciting took place between her and the president; or the author is merely a gallant gentleman who came forward to give hope and support to a suffering young woman who had made several silly mistakes that had caught up with her and was giving her a public chastisement she and the world will long remember.Regardless what the author's intent, he managed to produce a profoundly BORING BOOK. I highly recommend it to insomniacs who have counted every sheep in the galaxy. It works better than Nembutal, guaranteed! Hopefully, this experience has taught this young lady that she can't have everything she wants and that she better stop wanting other women's husbands."},{"rating":"1","title":"Monica's Story was a struggle to finish..","review":"I plunged into Monica's story with much anticipation, anxious to hear her take on all events that had transpired over the last year. The beginning staged Monica's life growing up, much more detail than most people probably care to know - I wanted to know about her relationship with the President (or at least her perspective) and not her entire life story. She isn't that valuable to society to have us all know this information. The book is not very well-written, with many typos and backwards English. If someone was writing this book about me, I'd make sure I came out looking a little less like a mental case. I found myself skipping pages toward the end and eventually just skipped to the last chapter. It's basically the same thing over and over again - and never once does Monica take ownership, she's always blaming others (maybe that was illustrated in the parts I skipped)."},{"rating":"2","title":"The inside story of the scandal of the decade","review":"I was surprised by this book. I was expecting a rehash of the details of this most bizarre of relationships. Instead, Andrew Morton managed to get to the woman behind the public persona and reveal a touching, complex,and honest profile of Monica. By the end of the book, I had readjusted my opinion of the whole affair - and realised that, President or pauper, human emotions are the greatest leveller. This book is not just juicy scandal - it's a love story. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"appeared to be a simple recreation of a sexual affair.","review":"Was like so many affairs with married men and ended in much the same way. The end result is almost always the same. The man satisfies his need for outside pleasures and then lives happily ever after with his wife or until the next conquest comes along. In all fairness to men this isn't just confined to the male gender since many married women do this as well. Was nothing different about this other than the fact that Monica's man was the President of the United States."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm sorry to say that I couldnt even finish it","review":"It may be wrong of me to even write a review here since I couldnt even finish the awful thing, but I would like to just say that this was the most boring, unreadable, obnoxious piece of garbage I have looked at in a long while. I would give it no stars if I could,and if any of you are thinking of buying this book, stop yourself, it isnt what you think it's going to be. Borrow it from the library as I did, it'll save you some buyer's remorse."},{"rating":"1","title":"She thinks she's middle class? That explains a lot.","review":"I had a higher opinion of Monica before the book. It was obvious Morton had difficulty making the minimum number of words required, so he found it necessary to repeat things over and over and OVER. I got it the first time, thanks. At least he hit the nail on the head when he said \\"she has a high sense of entitlement\\". No kidding.A painful read. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating...","review":"After reading this book, I think you'll find a very different Monica than the media portrays her to be.

It's not so tough to do, if you're young, lonely and inexperienced. I can relate, having been where she is -- being involved with a well-to-do married man, though not famous. It's tough straightening out your life afterward. But this girl, I feel a kinship to, with us being nearly the same age, and I believe she will pull her life together, as I have. The author wrote a fair, unassuming depiction of her life, which I found refreshing. despite the nasty reports that other media have reported. Monica is no bad guy.

We are shown the inner pain Monica carries with her stemming from her summer fat camp experiences to not being invited to Tori Spelling's birthday party as a young child. We see that all she really wanted was to steal a man from another relationship and obsessively make him hers. Such innocent and simple yearnings should be applauded and not chastised as they have been too frequently. Andrew Morton paints a picture of a beautiful girl, willing to handle a medium-sized tobacco product inside of a most sacred of places, the Oval office. Surely the irony is not lost on any of us. I highly recommend reading this book, it offers immense insight into the world we saw just a glimpse of on the nightly news."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible literature. Forgetable.

This book is nothing else but pure sensationalist garbage. To me it's much more like a mexican soap opera full of tears and disapointments from an (supposed) innocent girl concerning to her middle-age boss, the most powerful man on the planet, THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.Keep yourself and your money away from this book, if you can.This is my sincere advice to you all.One star well deserved, considering I can not give half a star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get on your knees...","review":"This book left TONS of juicy details out of the book.

Sadly, I am one of them. Do yourself a favor and spend your money on some intellectual stimulation. Otherwise, the supermarket tabloid will suffice the \\"tell all\\" groupies just fine"},{"rating":"1","title":"Someone Spare Us","review":"Andrew Morton proves he can write more drivel about poor little rich girls as he laughs all the way to the bank.Morton's flowery, sappy prose makes the book read like a cheap pulp romance.Morton doesn't understand the notion of personal responsibility, which is to be expected all the more from those of privileged backgrounds. A girl who pulls up her skirt to the married President does not deserve sympathy. Monica says she is of a generation that is comfortable with its sexuality, but there are clearer ways to describe her behaviour.The part about Monica dumping her boyfriend because he saw another woman -- while she of course was also seeing Clinton -- says it all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enlightening","review":"I didn't know this was a commonplace activity.

Despite his best efforts, Morton's Monica still comes off as a spoiled, irresponsible brat. Believe me, there are 25 year old women who don't live in their mother's million dollar apartments. Nor do we show our thong straps to our supervisors as a means of playful flirtation. Indeed, I can empthasize with Monica for her weight issues, but refuse to believe that obesity pushed her into affairs with married men, as Morton hypothesizes. I am a voracious reader and am able to finish books quickly, but this was was like reading pages and pages of tax manuals interwined with whining.

Laura Belgrave spins the kind of story that mystery enthusiasts crave while sitting up and reading by a nightlight, listening to the quiet calm of night and hoping the story doesn't end.

The first sentence in this novel grabs you and doesn't let go. Ms. Hitchcock delivers lots of details of how bitchy and superficial the really wealthy people are and I love reading about it. The book itself was great. It was interesting enough that I read it in 3 days but I was a bit disappointed with the ending. I won't give away the finale but it was not what I expected and I felt let down. I guess not all books can have the ending that you want but I just expected more from this one. Besides the ending the book was awesome."},{"rating":"2","title":"Social Crimes my favorite","review":"I could not put this book down.

I bought the book because of and interview on NPR's Diane Rehm show. I will be more discretionary in the future. Huge disappointment. Don't waste your book buying dollars. It has some very positive reviews on the jacket. One from William Safire of the NY Times. \\"It's the novel to watch for best-sellerdom in 2002.\\" Wow! Did he like it or does he think that the reading public is ignorant?"},{"rating":"1","title":"likable but unbelievable","review":"I liked reading this book and was intrigued with the descriptions of the very wealthy. Unfortunately some of the most significant aspects of the plot absolutely did not ring true. One example is that the lawyer and witnesses (notary publics)did not ask the Monique impersonator for indentification. I don't think this would happen in real life. There were a few instances where the reader was asked to suspend belief and this kind of ruined the book for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay, okay, I get it...","review":"So the writer is well versed in Marie Antoinette and proceeds to use 300+ pages to beat this expertise into our heads. The book was just a little too precious with its cast of characters and their turns of phrase. I was not the least bit surprised who would be murdered and how it would take place, as the author chose to telegraph the method at least 100 pages beforehand.I believe there is something inauthentic in writing what you know when the first 250 pages speak in exquisite, never-ending detail of historical anecdote and the author glosses over the actual point of the plot. By now it's anticlimatic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous","review":"\\"Social Crimes\\" is the perfect fast beach read and very entertaining. I read it over the weekend. Most mysteries are predicable and I don't think the author is trying to be Agatha Christie.

The book is exactly what it should be - fun!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If you love Dominick Dunne","review":"Loved this book! If you love Dominick Dunne, you will love this book.

I was greatly disappointed by how slow the story moved. You start getting to the good part at around page 240. When the story begins to get good is when Ms.Hitchcock seems to rush the story and not detail that part as much as she bored you with detail about the Marie Antionette furniture and jewel. It took me weeks to read this book versus a day it usually takes me to read a book if it's good. I couldn't advise this book to anybody."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good read","review":"Boring, predictable, and unimaginative. Don't waste your time.

The selections on this CD are some of the best Upstart songs, the problem is that these are not the original recordings that were released on vinyl years ago. The recordings are not even acceptable alternate versions. Droogskins comment that this is the best Upstart album has to be a joke of some sort.

As someone who's been curious about the Angelic Upstarts but doesn't really know their material, I'd have to say this is darn near worthless.The album cover and insert are completely uninformative. You see this in a record store or advertised online, and assume that it is what it claims to be: a compilation of the band's best songs. But there are no liner notes, no discography, no source information. The sound isn't very good. For all intents and purposes, this might as well be a bootleg. And a lousy one at that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crud on Plastic: Not What I Expected","review":"Note: the low rating refers only to the quality of the recording, not the group or their songs.I bought this CD from another source which, unlike Amazon, did not reveal fan reviews and the like. It just said that it was a great collection of an essential punk group (UK OI type).I think the Upstarts are a great, great group badly, badly misserved by this compilation. I have to agree with the consensus--terrible recording sound, worse than many bootlegs. The sound is so thin, you just can't imagine how awful it is; it has no hope of capturing the power and majesty of this group.If the group consented to this release, they must have decided to cash in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific novel","review":"I'm not a sports fan, but I found this book enthralling, well-written and generally terrific. Higgins spends a lot of time on the sports world as seen through agents' eyes, and even though you couldn't pay me enought to make me watch a hockey or basketball game, it was fascinating. Just as John McPhee in the nonfiction arena can write about oranges, or geology, or taking out the trash, and by his prose skills make it fascinating to the general reader, so too Higgins pulls off the same thing in this novel. I have been a fan of his since 1972 when his first book, The Friends of Eddie Coyle, was published. He writes a lot and rarely disappoints; he certainly does not do so here. Any reader who enjoys a good story, excellent prose and first-rate dialogue will enjoy this book tremendously; if you're a sports fan, you will have an additional dimension added to your enjoyment."},{"rating":"1","title":"A treatise on sports agency disguised as a murder mystery.","review":"I was very disappointed with this book. The majority of the story was a description of the trials and tribulations of a high flying sports agent and his insufferable clients and employees. It seemed that all at once the author decided that there was a murder to solve and only one chapter left to do it. It read more like an expose than a fiction novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book isn't good","review":"Come on people; a \\"literary thriller\\" should still be readable, with discernible plot and some nodding acquaintance with reality. This book has none of these things. It is entirely dialogue-driven, which is fine, but nobody talks that much and so well. I could go on, but bottom line is that as much as I had heard about Friends of Eddie Coyle and looked forward to reading it, it was good but not great. This book is just plain bad. Face it--if \\"George D. Higgins\\" and not \\"George V.

I've read lots of parenting books and had hours upon hours of training by professionals. None were very helpful as the circumstances and dynamics of our family are so different.We have two special needs children and all of our kids had been abused. This devotional is not a how to book. Gary Thomas uses Biblical principles to teach parents the design of God. He shows us that parenting is a tool the Lord uses to shape parents into humble servants. I had already found that to be true. Each child the Lord placed in our home exposed certain selfishnesses in both of us. I would work on that sin, then another child would come and off I go into another training session. This book will change the way you view your kids and yourself, if you prayerfully consider the principles and put them into practice. I bought two for my married daughters. Check out Gary's DVD SACRED PARENTING. I highly recommend this material."},{"rating":"2","title":"good product","review":"I first knew this product from the positive reviews of it on [...]. But because the shipping fee there was more expensive, I decided to go with amazon.

They are also very good, but in concert Coltrane's performance is really 'undescribeable'.After 40 years, there is still no sax player who can come closeto Coltrane in terms of virtuosity, expression power and fire-playing. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coltrane collectors take caution","review":"This box earns four stars (and should earn five) simply for the quality of the performances. On stage, the classic Coltrane quartet stretched the tunes out, often to more than double the studio length, building to incredible levels of intensity. There's no complaint with the music on this collection--eight hours of Coltrane at arguably his peak. But the record company has been careless (if not blatantly dishonest) with the recording information. The worst example is where they mislabel one set as \\"Hamburg 1961 (previously unreleased)\\" when in fact it is a frequently issued 1962 recording from Birdland in NYC. There are other similar errors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceptional","review":"I don't know of anywhere else to hear \\"my favorite things\\" and \\"blue train\\" with dolphy. The first two discs are practically worth the price of the set, and I deliberated buying it for a bit. Plus, there are three versions of MFT with dolphy (six total). I agree totally with another reviewer who says that this set is the next logical place to go after the complete village vanguard, which people will buy first simply because it's more known.Do not just buy Afro blue impressions and consider it a condensed version of this set. You won't get the dolphy. And the twenty five mintute version of MFT is simply amazing. Time will get warped should you listen to this when really relaxed.

It is not worth more than $15- $20, (definitely not worth > $50.) , and I highly doubt it will last more than 3 - 6 months. I do NOT recommend this product at all. My recommendation is to go a local home health medical equipment store and purchase a twin sized egg crate mattress (for about $20) and cut it out to fit (you will have enough left over to make 1 or 2 more), and go to a local home improvemnt store and get a blue or gray colored tarp and cover the foam up with it.

'Sherpa'is an unlikely masterpiece about getting high and dreaming of a mountain-top. 'Gift Shop' and 'Springtime in Vienna'--underwhelming as album tracks 1 & 2--are still mainstays of the band's live show.

This is a fascinating disc of the Requiem which Cavalli composed for his own funeral. Although worlds away from the extravagance of Monteverdi's Vespers, this requiem blends elements of old and new with considerable virtuosity. The choral sound is warm, often dramatic and nearly always in tune; the minor errors of tuning are forgiveable in the face of the committment which the group brings to this music. The disc is rounded out with the four Marian antiphon settings from Cavalli's Musiche Sacre. I was particularly impressed by the very subtle connections which bind these antiphons to the Requiem; the pairing of these works seems entirely natural."},{"rating":"2","title":"exciting and thrilling","review":"I really like this book so far.

It is amazing to me, and testifies to Spielberg's genius,that he could come up with such a classic thriller from this soap opera garbage. There are extra-marital affairs, slanderous politicians, and other such melodramatic claptrap. Spielberg managed to leave out all the melodrama and still create deep characterization, never once forgetting that we are dealing with a shark in the water. In this book, the shark is merely a bit player, merely serving as a reason for one woman to have an affair. Fans of afternoon television will enjoy this; fans of the movie will be sorely disappointed. The only reason I gave this book a star at all is because it served as the inspiration for one of the greatest, most suspenseful thrillers of all time."},{"rating":"1","title":"I LOVED THE MOVIE I DIDN\\"T CARE MUCH FOR THE BOOK.","review":"Anybody who buys JAWS the novel and expect to be as great as the movie will be very dissappointed.

Also I was a little uncomfortable with some of the ethnic references in this book as well such as harlem by the sea etc. I also found that chief broady and quint were the only characters that I could relate to. I really didn't like the character of matt hooper at all he seemed to me a troublemaker type espically when it comes to his friendship with MRS BROADY. I found that the most exciting part of the story was when BRODY HOOPER AND QUINT hunt the shark.

Character development is weak and it contains none of the suspense of the movie.

All I can say is Spielberg did a hell of a job if this is what he had to work with. The book has NONE of the magic from the film. I was hard-pressed to find anyone to like in the story and found myself rooting for the shark to hurry up and eat EVERYONE. There was nothing likable about anyone, no clever back and forth oneupmanship between Quint and Hooper, no Quint charm with his off-color songs or catch phrases, no real suspense or climax, ridiculous plot tangents involving love stories and organized crime. Pages and pages of filler that had nothing to do with anything. This is a glowing example of the exception that proves the rule that the book is always better than the movie. Skip this and pop the movie in again instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gross Plagiarism","review":"Ever read Melville's Moby Dick? Let me promise you that it is one heck of a lot better than this piece of wholeasale plagiarism. It's a real shame, too.

What a shame."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the rare books that pales in comparison to the movie","review":"I gave the book 4 stars only because without it, there would never have been a \\"Jaws\\" movie, which is the greatest film of all time. The book is good enough, but there's just not enough shark. Plotlines meander between the mayor's financial crisis and Hooper's (a stud in the novel) dalliance with Brody's wife, which makes him completely unlikable. Once our heroes get on the boat, things pick up and that's the best part of it. I read this when I was a kid and then again last year. I was surprised at how average a read it was.But like I said... no book, no movie. So thank you Peter Benchley."},{"rating":"1","title":"So disappointed","review":"As a life long fan of the movie Jaws I recently thought that I should read the book the movie was based upon. So, when I got a Kindle for Christmas this book was my first purchase. I was really looking forward to it thinking that of course the book will be even better than the movie. It wasn't. Overall the book was a big disappointment. You don't care enough about the characters and end up not liking quite a few of them. I did enjoy Brody's character, but not enough to give the book any more than 2 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Feeling Bad I've Not Read This By Now","review":"Slightly different from the movie but equally captivating.

Benchley also uses some extremely foul launguage in this novel. The plot is really good though, it develops the characters a bit better than in the movie. It's a good book if you can get around the filth that slows the story down"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book I ever read","review":"This is a great book although I don,t recomend it for children under 9 years of age. You know that Jaws the novel came first then the movie for you knumskulls out there.Its a book about a shark that atacks a beach resort in New England called Amity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Writing, lame Ending","review":"I can't believe that people gave this book more than 2 stars. The only reason this book was popular was because the movie was based on it. If Jaws the movie had never been made, Peter Benchley's book would not have sold more than five copies. The writing is terrible, the affair between Hooper and Ellen doesn't make any sense and the ending is rushed and unimaginative. Don't bother reading this book, just stick to the movie and enjoy the legend of Jaws. If you do read this book, you'll be hard pressed to figure-out how Spielberg was able to create what he did on film. If this book was the inspiration, Spielberg really must be a genius."},{"rating":"1","title":"not even the shark itself could digest this","review":"i am a huge fan of \\"Jaws\\" the movie and i had seen it many times before i decided i wanted to read the book. i was told it was a \\"horrifying read, perfect for afternoons spent on the beach.\\" for lack of a better word, i was disappointed. this book, as usually is the case, is different than the movie and im surprised something so wonderful on film could be concocted from these pages. steven spielberg is truly a master in his line of work to make this book into something so great.do yourself a favor and leave this one on the shelf. instead, get to your local video store as soon as possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as the movie.","review":"It was alright at first, then went completely downhill. A good half of this book was about some small town drama, with the shark being near non-existent. The ending was lackluster as well. It was horribly disappointing and I would not recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fallible memory?","review":"I first read \\"Jaws\\" back in 1974 before the movie came out. Maybe it is just my fallible memory but I recall that book having much more detail than the \\"Jaws\\" I am reading now. Reading the book in the 70's built an excitement about the movie. I recently purchased a 278 page \\"Jaws\\" that isn't even an inch thick. Is it my fallible memory or has \\"Jaws\\" lost a huge number of pages over time? If anyone has an original 1970's copy of \\"Jaws\\" I would appreciate any help you could give me on this. By the way, the movie by far is better than the book I just purchased."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deeply Disappointed","review":"I was deeply disapointed by this book. I have seen the movie and it is much better. This book is very wrong and gives sharks a negative picture. Sharks are very rarely known to eat humans, in fact, you are more at risk of getting struck by lightning than by getting eaten by a shark. When sharks do attack humans it is mostly because they have been confused and have mistaken you for other prey. This is why after the shark bites it usually swims away.When people look at the cover of the book, they might think that it will be about a shark who goes on a killing rampage, but the book is not mainly about the shark, most of it is about a lady who wants to get sexually involved (for some unknown reason) to a man other than her husband. This takes away from the excitement and is very boring to read. The conclusion is also very bad because it doesn't end with a sense of finality. It just ends when the shark eats a man and another man that was on the boat with him swims to shore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jaw's a dispointment","review":"I didn't buy this book off Amazon I bought it at the local barnes in nobles but non the less I feel I should warn you about this horendous book.The book has very few deaths compared to the movie and centeres around the people more.The cheif is a bitter middle aged man who bitches about his wife and her anoying yuppie background.The wife is an insecure and what she feels under aapreciated wife she has an afair with cooper who is a yuppie marin biologist unlike in the moviewheres kinda of a nerdy hippie.The old shark hunter guy is pretty cool hes about the same.the mayor has a sub plot with some mafia people and that takes up some of the story.I felt it was more about the people than the actual shark eating people mind you this was peter benchleys first book.Also the death of the shark isnt as exciting as in the movie where it gets blown up."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the few books not as good as the movie","review":"Yes, this is a very good book. Some of it seems a lil rushed, however. I'm not going to go into specifics for fear of giving away the plot... but the movie left out some parts of the book that were only there for filler and that part is what made the book less enjoyable to me. The movie was also more suspenceful then the book. Some people don't believe that books can bt suspenceful... but it is possible. This book is fun and is a must read for anyone who's seen the movie. But if you're looking for suspence, go for The Relic."},{"rating":"1","title":"The movie is way better.","review":"For one thing the book has so much bad language. Even though the book can get quite exciting at times it still can not compare with the movie.I also like the idea of Brody and hooper being friends in the movie instead of enemies like in the book.I also think that Hooper didn't need to die when he was in the shark cage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book, Great Movie","review":"Peter Benchley's best-selling novel has a voraciously hungry shark strike without warning, leaving readers frightful with anticipation. By feeding on bathers off the coast of Long Island, the shark has the town and its tourist industry quite upset. The author is at his best describing the shark as it swims silently and effortlessly beneath the waves. There's also a steamy affair between Oceanographer Matt Hooper and Chief Brody's wife, thus feeding our taste for sex along with violence. Other differences in the book as compared to the film are a more aloof Quint, and a shark that doesn't succumb from a rife-induced explosion. This easy-reading novel falls short of the 1975 movie by Steven Spielberg, in one of the few times a movie outdoes the book it's based on. Still, the novel was a best-seller for 44 weeks and it remains clearly worth reading.Trivia Note: Benchley appears briefly in the film as a TV newsman broadcasting from the beach."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plodding Book, Watch the Film","review":"I have to agree with previous posters on this book; the movie adaptation of this novel is much better than the novel itself. The movie was evenly paced, tense, suspenseful, and had its share of memorable characters. The book lacked all these qualities. It's hard to feel sympathetic for an alcoholic policeman who, despite being from the rough streets of the big city, is unable to spot corruption and mob involvement despite its obvious presence. In fact, the entire mob subplot (as well as the short lived affair subplot) seemed completely superfluous to me. Halfway through the novel I thought Benchley might be suggesting the shark was a hitman of some sort. I have heard that Peter Benchley once said, \\"It took me 15 years to discover I had no talent for writing, but I couldn't give up because by that time I was too famous.\\" I don't know what took him so long to discover his problem, it only took me 15 pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brilliant Movie, pretty bad book.","review":"Jaws is my favorite movie. I love everything about the movie, but most of all I love the characters. I found when I read the book I did not recognize a single character. The book is almost nothing like the movie. The film makers took the basic premise of the book, and created something different and vastly superior. There is not a single likable or well developed character in the book. The most upsetting character is Martin Brody. The character is such a moronic lunkhead he actually come off as mentally challenged. In the book the shark is secondary. More time is paid to the longings of Ellen Brody and her affair with Matt Hooper, which goes no where and has no payoff. One insightful moment is we learn from Ellen Brody \\"that every little girl dreams of being a prostitute\\". If you love the movie I can tell you there is no need to read this book. Don't give up on Peter Benchley though, I did very much enjoy his other works. I feel this was his worst book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The shark rules, Jaws bites","review":"I read Creature. Ive seen Jaws the movie. Ive even ridden Jaws:The Ride at Universal studios. After those experiences, I thought Jaws would be the movie, plus more intensity, more character development, and less standard horror movie characters. What I found is more like an exploratory essay on greed, fear, and adultry. If the movie had nothing to do with the book (and if the book had a better ending) I would have enjoyed it much more thouroughly. As it is, it left me wanting more... much more. Benchley needs a sequel just to improve upon the characters and what happens to the town."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I am very disappointed with this book. I love the movie and I thought the book would have the same story with more details. But it isn't so. I'd like to know more about the shark and its impact on the city but a large part of the book is devoted to Ellen Brody and her social problems. I couldn't even finish it. Maybe it's not that bad but if you expect something similar to the movie, you will be certainly disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Forget the movie, this is the real deal.","review":"I first read Peter Benchley's \\"Jaws\\" back in the 1970's, several month before the movie was released. The story gripped me at that time and I still find myself re-reading the book every few years. I like the movie also, but the book is a far different experience. All the basic characters and plot are in the movie, but the book has a vastly different pace and an a rather enigmatic ending that may confuse readers. The central portion of the book involves a love affair between oceanographer Matt Hooper and Chief Brody's wife and you'll wonder what this has to do with the shark, but keep reading. This is a mini morality play in the making. If you can keep an open mind you might notice that this story is far more realistic. The shark is slightly smaller, less acrobatic and not as vicious as its film version. And if the ending puzzles you, then re-read the book's first paragraph. It hints at what really happens to the shark in the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Benchley's debut still has bite.","review":"\\"I sat down to write this story about a guy and a fish.\\" From that simple idea Peter Benchley crafted a superthriller that spawned one of the biggest horror hits of all time.Based on inaccurate science and folk legend, as well as the historic New Jersey attacks of 1916, Jaws tells the not so simple tale of what happens when a shark takes up residence in the coastal waters of a hot summer vacation spot and the town seeks to cover it up. Only one man, Sheriff Martin Brody, chooses to stand up to both the shark and the town, for which he pays a hefty price.Jaws is not high literature, it's just a brisk thrill ride of a novel. One that tapped something deep inside the audience of its day and proved that monster stories could acheive mass market success. The novel still works, especially whenever the shark rears it ugly snout and bares its teeth. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent thriller that'll keep you reading","review":"This is one of my favorite books. You always hear about those books that once you pick up and start reading it you can't stop till you're done. I had never encountered such a book until I found Jaws. It was just so well-written you have to read on. The characters and the plot are well-crafted and interesting. The idea of a 25 foot shark in the water just creeps you out"},{"rating":"1","title":"Potboiling dreck","review":"Jaws the film was terrific entertainment by a filmmaker who knows how to entertain. Jaws the novel was an obvious by-the-numbers potboiler that wanted so badly to be a bestseller that Benchley stuffed sex and profanity into it even though it had no place in the story (see movie for proof) and merely stuck out like speed bumps in the plot's momentum. An awful, dreadful, amateurish book. If it had been a good book by a good writer, you'd have seen Benchley moving on to other things over the last few decades instead of rehashing the same old concept for maximum exploitation."},{"rating":"1","title":"I vote for the movie!!!!","review":"For years I have read books that are eventually turned into movies and I am usually disappointed in the movie. But in this case I have to say I am more disappointed in the book version. Benchley's characters are hard to like. The only character I liked was Hendricks and he wasn't a major character! The book seemed to be more focused on the rich vs. poor theme then the shark. The whole book seemed to revolve around Ellen Brody's character and the mayor's business partners. Who cares! Half way through the book I wanted all the characters to get eaten!! After finally reaching the end of this whine-fest I could not believe the totally stupid ending! Unbelievable! I felt cheated! I would like to thank Steven Speilberg for turning the miserable book into something incredible. See the movie, forget the book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad books do make great movies","review":"It's an old adage among screenwriters that good books often make bad movies, while bad ones often make great movies. And here's the proof. JAWS is a horrendous novel written in cheap and artificial prose, filled with boring stereotype characters, loaded with dopey descriptions of gore, and miserably structured. And just look what Spielberg did with it! Read the book only as a lesson about how to adapt bestsellers to the screen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly Improbable","review":"I'm not alone- Peter Benchley himself once said that if he had known anything about sharks he would never have written this book. Besides cliches like the Mayor not wanting to heed the sole voice of reason's warning, and the mayor really having mob connections, this book can be dismissed merely as MASSMARKETED MISIMFORMATIVE PARANOIA.The two biggest factual problems (not counting the numerous smaller ones) are:1. The shark stays offshore of Amity for weeks. Large sharks are NOT territorial- they travel and are unlikely to stay for more than an hour in any spot.2. The food- There is no way a twenty-five foot great white, which relies on fatty foods, could make a living off of humans alone. It would essentially die of malnutrition.Also, various series of attacks have happened, but not one (no, not even the 1916 attacks) have been conclusively linked to one shark.Over all, a very outdated book and highly unlikely book."},{"rating":"2","title":"totally awesome","review":"the sound track is a must have for any 80's diehard glam rock lovers.perfect mix of rock from the best and originals motley crue,bon jovi,and kiss just to name a few.and even though they don't exist the steel dragon songs are the best.the movie was great,but the soundtrack is excellent.long live rock'n'roll."},{"rating":"2","title":"ROCKSTAR SOUNDTRACK CD","review":"When the movie Rock Star came out I looked for the soundtrack but couln't not find one and I know it's been years since the movie came out I still wanted the soundtrack, I finally one day looked on Amazon.com and there was the CD that I wanted and it wasn't a bad price and the shipping wasn't bad either,so I went ahead and ordered it, let's just say I was impressed with the speed that I got my CD, and it was wrapped great too to keep it from getting damaged during mailing.

My favorite songs on the CD are \\"Blood Pollution\\", \\"Long Live Rock and Roll\\", and \\"Stand Up and Shout\\". \\"Blood Pollution\\" is a great throwback to all the 1980s heavy metal. For me, the drums in the intro and the opening chords are the stuff that got me addicted to this song. I almost got ear-bleed the first time I listened to it 'cause I just friggin' cranked it all the way up (well, almost anyway). \\"Stand Up And Shout\\" is an awesome song, but not an original. I think Dio was the original artist. \\"Long Live Rock and Roll\\" is the new rock anthem for the ages. My own anthem used to be Twisted Sister's \\" We're Not Gonna Take It\\", but it's not anymore because Twisted Sister just plain stinks.Well, that's my two cents on the album.

Such is the value of this film which presents the viewer with a reasonably good variety of Magritte's work.The problem with the film is that we are told almost nothing about Magritte himself or the artistic and social culture in which he worked. The commentary for each picture is provided in total academic speak.

The author did a wonderful job depicting the island."},{"rating":"1","title":"way to BIGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG!!!","review":"ordered a 3XLT and it waS WAY TO bIG- I'm 6-4, 265 lbs- COULD FIT 2 OF ME IN IT - SO LONG IT ALMOST GOES TO MY KNEES. mY FAULT BUT i WON'T ORDER AGAIN FROM Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Russell sweatshirts","review":"I have ordered Russell sweatshirts before, and have some that are many years old and never had a problem. I bought these two for my husband for Christmas. The first time I washed them, they became a small, and not even a tall small. He cannot wear them. The sleeves are four inches too short, and the body is four inches too short. That is why I ordered Tall! DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for the guy with less than perfect shape","review":"I'm a big guy, but not pear-shaped. Most stuff for big guys tend to be cut for the pear or blob shaped. I however, just have a huge gut. The rest of me is shaped pretty normal. So most 5x sized shirts tend to look like Omar the Tent-maker sewed em up. Let's face it, nothing is going to flatter my shape and I don't expect miracles. But man is it nice to put this thing on.Covers the tummy completely, which almost NEVER happens with any shirt. I almost always order XLT's to get enough out front to cover the gut (resulting in the huge, sail-like profile of most shirts), but this does. And without 50\\" long sleeves or other silly looking results.Bottom line, if you're a big guy with a big gut, you'll like this sweatshirt. Best fitting one I've ever found."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Sweatshirts Ever Made","review":"I bought 3 of these sweatshirts and could not believe how bad they could be. The cuffs, neck and bottom were a different shade than the body but were supposed to match. The more they were washed the worse they became. By the time I got rid of them I was ashamed even to wear them to the steel mill that I work in."},{"rating":"2","title":"sweatshirt","review":"Nice quality sweatshirts, but very pricey. I misunderstood and thought I was buying 2 for 24.99, but turned out that was the price for just one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Russell Athletic Sweatshirts","review":"In the past to me, \\"Russell Athletics\\" meant quality, the latest sweatshirts that I purchased where skimpy at best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Fit for the Borgnine","review":"There are plenty of us burly folks with thick necks and a muscle or two, who do not want to feel squeezed in our attire. This ungenerous sweatshirt is composed of thin fabric cinched on top by a too-tight neck. I should have read David Marvin's true and informative 1-star review. This is over-priced for the low quality. I've bought thicker, better quality sweatshirts from WalMart. That's how cheaply made this thing is. I can't tolerate a tight neck pulling on me all day like a rabid dachshund; totally uncomfortable to say the least. As the group Little Big Town sings on their CDThe Reason Why, \\"There's a price for keeping me, I may be cheap, but I ain't free...\\" This cheap fuzzy offering in larger sizes (2x, etc.) turned out better:Soffe Men's Classic Crew Neck Sweatshirt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sweatshirt Review","review":"The sweatshirt was a lot thinner than I expected. I thought paying a medium high price that it would have been better quality. I was very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice bag,","review":"Beatiful soft leather, nicely made, great look. Haven't had it long enough to comment on the durability yet, but so far I'm very pleased with my purchase. Plenty of room for books OR a computer (if you're a college student you will likely not manage to get both big books and a computer in there). I got it to go to my 3rd year medical school rotations and so far I find its comfortable to use, convenient to organize all my stuff (wallet, computer if I brought it, small review books, white coat, change of clothes etc). I'm glad I chose this bag, nice, comfortable and professional looking and a good size!"},{"rating":"1","title":"More Hippie Claptrap","review":"This is just one more in a line of books that put forward no original ideas, but simply decries our interaction with the earth and suggests that something needs to be done. It suggests that the indigenous people of the world were right and we are all wrong.It addresses serious problems, but does not provide any practical or novel contributions to the discussion.In short, there are many books on this subject and this is not one of the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST-HAVE ALBUM","review":"I've had this album for several years now, and I happened to be playing it this morning. It struck me just how good the music is, so I thought I'd mention that if you like old-time music, this cd is an essential for your collection. It doesn't get any better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fell short for me","review":"I really wanted to love this book but I just really well didn't. It reads so badly and is hard to follow making my mind wander and just hard to get through at all. One minute you are in a scene, the next Boylan jumps a few years ahead or back and I am left wondering how we got from this point to this one. Then she goes back again. Very confusing and frustrating read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really good one","review":"Just in case you aren't prepared for it, this is a book about the transgender experience. But, as searingly personal as such a nonfiction topic must, by definition be, it is strangely distancing in its manner of telling. Jenny Boylan lived for 40 yrs as James Boylan, an author (fiction) and college professor. It's been 5 yrs since she became female.It's not the facts that are \`off' in this book; it's the tone. It's too breezy and leaves me with the feeling that a lot of the psychic pain and emotional valleys have been omitted.But still, it's good. Consider, for a more literary approach and a truly amazing story, reading Conundrum by Jan Morris."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Real Life Story of a Transgendered Woman!!","review":"This book is really a great book for all transgendered women to read as it describes many different real life typical experiences and dilemma's that help accept the challenges we have to go through and how to not only survive them but to thrive from them! Thank you Jennifer for writing it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Reading","review":"Read this book in a weekend's time. The book gave me some really good insight for some of my own personal issues in my life. The book is an easy read, I loved some of the writer's personal witty humor in some of the situations. I liked the book very very much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Just a typical book in reference to gender. There's no real proof as to reall make a person feel they belong in another body."},{"rating":"1","title":"strangly impersonal","review":"There is something wrong with this account of Finney Boylan's experience of going from not even able to admit his secret to biologically becoming a woman. Maybe because s/he's a Professional Writer s/he can hardly let such a rare life experience go unexamined, unwritten about, s/he has written a book about a deeply personal life experience in the most superficial way possible. It's quite banal, and as a result, boring. The correspondence between Richard Russo and Finney is transcribed, almost as if to show just how clever the emails between Professional Writers can be, and maybe holds the ulterior motive of pulling in fans of the far more successful Russo. This book seems very calculated, as if maybe this is an effort towards a Pulitzer like Russo's and of which Boylan is so transparently evious."},{"rating":"1","title":"Provactive, Beautiful, and educational","review":"This book is simply amazing. I loved it. It is exquisitely provactive and moving. Jenny keeps me laughing with her talented and humorous writing. I couldn't get enough. I learned so much about changing genders, family, and my own views and oppinions. This is a must read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well written but disappointing","review":"I really wanted to like this book but ultimately was unable. I've known many transgender people and none have witnessed the world travelling, money-no-issue lifestyle that Ms. Boylan has 'lived'.Sorry to say it but this reads more like a fictional fantasy than fact."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall a pleasant book","review":"It is very interesting the past people that she did run into from her previous life as a male. However, one thing that sort of threw me off about the book was how it seemed to be disjointed and went from one time to a totally different time. I am still grateful for her courage in writing on it and have not been able to progress too far into the book so it may change my ideas, but I am just grateful that there are books dealing specifically with transitioning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfully Told Story","review":"This was a fascinating book--by a great storyteller--about a man's transformation from male to female. The parts I loved best were when s/he did a private study of the different reactions s/he got depending on gender. (For example, as a male in search of new car, he was shown the engine. As a female, she was shown the cupholders and charged a thousand dollars more for the car.) When s/he started taking female hormones, s/he became more sensitive about everything, and at one point said \\"There were a number of times when I wish I had the male shield (of testosterone) standing between me and the harshness of the world.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"What kind of transgender?","review":"When looking at trans books, there's a specific type of review I'm always looking for but can't find. So I'm writing it. This was a very good book, but didn't cover the issues I'm looking for. I got my hopes up because of the subtitle: A Life in Two Genders, but if you want a book that discuss what gender is, how it influences our lives, understanding wider gender expression, and confronting the binary gender system, this is not it. Also, the concept of trans as a medical condition that is \\"fixed\\" through hormones and surgery doesn't gel with my experience of being genderqueer.Nonetheless, if you're looking for an excellent, insightful, and compelling story that focuses on the moving from one binary gender to the other, I would definitively recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to Follow","review":"While I appreciate the courage it must have taken the author to write this story of her life I found this book difficult to follow. It jumps around in time which in this particular case made it difficult for me to really gain a sense of what the author's journey entailed. If you are looking for a book that reads like a story versus an informative resource on transgendered individuals then this might be for you. Personally I was hoping for more of the latter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brave, fascinating, inspiring, disturbing","review":"This is a wonderful, honest, fascinating insight into the life of a transgendered writer and intellectual who becomes transsexual in adulthood."},{"rating":"1","title":"high on name dropping, short on content","review":"I found little heart in this self-congratulatory book, little care or concern for anyone save the author herself. Everything is a joke. Everything is trite. Everything is an excuse to exclaim (once again) that the author is friends with a famous author. I waited to be touched or moved, but closed the book thoroughly dissatisfied with the flatness of the prose, the extreme self exaltation and inflation, and the thorough lack of regard for other people in the author's life. Once again hard covers have been used to enclose a marketing ploy, as opposed to a story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacking in Candor and Poorly Written","review":"For an English professor, this is a poorly written memoir of a man's transition to a woman. It is sprinkled with lengthy conversations that seem contrived at best. The author is supposedly a writer of humorous novels, but this work contained very little. Most puzzling at all is the lip service the author gave to the agony and confusion that he inflicted upon his family and friends. A father of two boys, he displayed very little sorrow over what this could all mean for his children. His wife's (and his mother's) eventual complacency was the most bewildering. Any normal wife would be dumbstruck with seething rage. Apparently his transition was mostly a big group hug."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it","review":"Had a Mickey mouse themed party for my son 3rd birthday and brought this mold to make lollipops from which came out great.

They are super cute too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not look like Mickey","review":"This chocolate mold does not look like Mickey Mouse. If I had seen it in the store, I never would have baught it. It resembles Mickey, but the features are not distinct enough to call it a \\"Mickey\\" Mouse Chocolate Mold."},{"rating":"2","title":"Closest mickey mouse mold I found","review":"I use candy molds all the time to create decorations for my cupcakes (I own a cupcake business) A customer placed a order for mickey mouse themed cupcakes and I had a hard time finding a mold that resembled Mickey without it looking distorted. This package arrived very quickly. I ordered it on the 20th and recieved it on the 25th. The delivery date was estimated to be December 1st! It looks like mickey minus a few details but who is going to pay that close attention to it? The negative reviewer sounds to nit pickey about the features of this mold. Close resemblance and affordable!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Customer Service","review":"Be careful, I bought some molds for a Christmas gift, they were supposed to ship a week before Christmas, it has been over a month and I haven't heard anything.

I do jot recommend such cheap plastic"},{"rating":"1","title":"A big disappointment","review":"I too bought this book because it had Richard Wright as the author. I read with great appreciation his Native Son a long time ago, and just recently read Black Boy and found it very attetion-holding. Savage Holiday is ridiculously plotted and the central character is extremely annoying. The long account of his running around naked in his apartment house was irritating and frustrating to me. All he had to do was hold his newspaper in front of himself and go to an apartment and tell what happened and the manager could have been summoned so he could get in his apartment. I know, the guy was nuts, as we see as the story moves along, but I was very unenthused by this book. I can see why it was ignored by critics when it came out in 1954."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just okay","review":"Very basic, and worth the price. This item is just okay, nothing more-nothing less. May have to use with other items."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard to find!","review":"It isn't easy to find these refills, and after falling in love with the pen I couldn't imagine giving it up. These last a fairly long time and the writing quality is lovely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed in Di Donna's Reiki Spirit","review":"What a disappointment! I purchased Reiki Spirit, because I thought it was a CD my wife was looking for named Cho Ku Rei. The latter is the name of the first piece on Reiki Spirit. Not only was this not the CD we wanted, but we didn't like the music that was on the CD! For the most part, the music was too melancholy. It just didn't seem to have the flow we have experienced listening to other Reiki music.We also felt that the CD was intellectually dishonest, because the music for the piece named Dai Ko Mio is actually taken from a piece of classical music - Jules Massanet's Méditation (Thas), which is not mentioned or acknowedged anywhere on the text accompanying the CD. My wife would still prefer to get the Cho Ku Rei CD by Weave, which she heard at her Reiki Master's house and I would rather have any of the Reiki music by Merlin's Magic or the Chakra Suite by Steve Halpern."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very average","review":"Ok, the secret is out... I'm a closet soap opera fan. I watch As The World Turns and Guiding Light regularly, and occasionally All My Children. This magazine is ideal for someone who's a casual viewer and only follows one network. The writing is that great, although it isn't bad, per se. It's just very elementary. Other magazines about soaps have more intelligent critiques of acting and stories. The \\"spoilers\\" aren't as good as in other magazines, either, and the recaps aren't as up to date as in SOD or SPW. Overall, for what it costs, I'd say just get Soap Opera Digest or Soap Opera Weekly. It's a bit better than Soap Opera Update, though, which is why I gave it 2 stars as opposed to 1."},{"rating":"1","title":"CBS Soaps","review":"This magazine is a weekly publication addressing events that will occur in the next week on the soaps. It is intended to inform you of coming events to improve the viewing experience. My issue with this publication is that it rarely is received by Friday and most often comes in the middle of the next week. Not likely to order this item again."},{"rating":"1","title":"KINDLE PLEASE!!","review":"I do not understand why this magazine is not available on Kindle.

What ya got here is pounding rock tunes with attitude and cool lyrical flair. If yer lookin' for stadium, sell-out anthem rock, look elsewhere. The tragically Hip are going to be too cool for you. If you want good riffs, snarky-street lyrics with references to Canadian legends and rock tunes that make you wanna drink beer & kick it all night...just get this disc!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What an awesome collection of songs!","review":"Think of them as REM meets Smashing Pumpkins meets Pearl Jam.

A true jem from north of the border."},{"rating":"2","title":"soooooo good!","review":"I've had this CD for a couple years but hadn't listened to it for a while. Then I caught a couple live Hip shows recently & dug it out. I am amazed at how good this album is.

But decided to buy thru Amazon at a good price with free shipping via Prime membership. This stuff is fabulous! A week after using it (I wick water so use 1/2 strength for constant feed) my African violets all bloomed or got new buds. The leaves are greener and more crisp than ever before.

The ending left you a bit uncertain as to what actually happened. I would have preferred to have seen something else!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very durable at all!","review":"I agree with the other reviewer, this is nothing more than a $20 plastic step stool, and a pretty pointless one at that since it barely elevates my son at all. He can't use it to step up and reach the potty, he can't even use it to stand and brush his teeth. I have to use a separate stool ( that only cost $4). The toilet seat fell apart after a day and can't be put back together completely. So it just sits on top of the rim, and I have to watch like a hawk to make sure my son is okay on it. The whole thing was a complete waste of money and I'm very disappointed. For the $20 you'll waste on this, you can get a more durable potty seat, a separate stool, a book about potty training, and a sheet of cool stickers they'll actually like."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING, SOUND GREAT BUT BUILT LIKE CRAP","review":"I had a pair years ago, sounded great and built like a tank with Birch Plywood, Just got a pair and they are half the speaker they used to be, i.e. they still sound great, but they are built like crap using MDF and glue guns. Save your money and buy a speaker from a company that cares about build quality as much as they do sound. Also, dont buy the excuses that they use high quality MDF and it has tighter tolerances,better resins, blah-blah, crap material is crap material."},{"rating":"2","title":"1984, only it's not fiction!","review":"My son was reading 1984 for school and I suggested he read this afterwards. 1984 can seem unbelievable when you live in a free state. Why would any society need thought police? Well this story puts real flesh and blood on the concepts raised in 1984, right down to big brother. It also takes place at an interesting time in Eastern European history, when the fighting STOPPED after WWII. What happened to people who really didn't support Hitler or Stalin after the war? Listen to this and get a taste of what it took for those people to survive in Hungary in the 50's.I love this \\"book\\" and I wish it would come out in print so it could be considered by our Junior High School for required reading.

Our baby falls asleep to this same CD every night and now that he's 5 months old, it's time to replace it (the first tune skips) and purchase more as gifts for friends who are pregnant. As you can tell, I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD","review":"I got this CD and the other CD that is by the same company and they have been great.

Because they are \\"warm\\" slippers, I couldn't wear them in the summer/warmer weather. This knocks the effective wear time down to about 9 moths, and that's being generous.

Because I LOVED my old pair sooooo much, I purchased these anyway hoping the reviews were wrong. I should of listened. The price is up and the quality is way down, these will not last me as long as my old pair. I do not mind spending that kind of money on slippers if they last 5 yrs.

Fortunately, Ugg customer service is sending me a refund and I'm going to get a different brand of shearling slippers.This construction is quite surprising to me as I own other Ugg shoes that I think are just fantastic and I wouldn't trade them for anything!

However, after only 20 minutes of wear time they make my feet and ankles ache so badly because once your heels settle into the sheepskin it is like walking on bricks. There is zero shock absorption so if you have plantar fasciitis, weak ankles or spurs then these are not the slippers for you. For the money I expected more than just wool over hard rubber. An underlayer of memory foam or something could have made a world of difference.

The bottoms are a nice rubber and grip nicely no matter if it is carpet, tile, wood flooring, concrete. My own personal complaint but not hers is to me it looks like the fluffy part could come back around her heel a little further keeping more of her foot warm.

Aird is especially helpful in his passages about how and why the air correction jets and emulsion tubes work and how they interact with each other and the main circuit.As a novice trying to understand and tune my Webers, I'd still buy both books, but I would rely primarily on Aird for comprehension of why the darn things work the way they do.I feel like a nerd getting excited about a carburetion book, but hey, epiphanies are where you find them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very biased report from a Texas source","review":"Just something to keep in mind as you read this book: much of what Heard states about OU's indescretions is based upon rumor, and much of it is groundless. Heard's sources are typically UT alumni and people who dislike OU; it's no wonder he was able to dig up so much dirt.OU has surpassed UT in nearly every possible way, save for the series record (which was amassed prior to the 1950's).

This book (apparently some houses will print anything) is nothing more than the work of a tired, bitter, frustrated old man. It shows on every page. Objective reporting? -- No. He was so desperate to lift Texas, that he even took a cheap shot at the Oklahoma City Zoo. I am not joking, go to the library and see for yourself.

The backer had run into censorship problems with the second movie, and wanted to make sure that didn't happen again. The result is a disappointing attempt at being serious. It completely lacks the warm mood and physicality of the two earlier efforts. Even the background music has a very different style, one that I found far less successful in framing the visuals and dialog.It tries to show Emmanuelle and husband Jean growing into a more stable, monogamous relationship. Instead, it just descends into petty jealousies and possessiveness. Jean, especially, pulls tricks that would have seemed silly even in high school. Perhaps the movie meant to show swelling affection and bruised feelings. Instead, it just showed swollen egos and bruised pride.//wiredweird"},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent conclusion to the \\"original\\" series w/Sylvia Kristel.","review":"This video, is the third in the series, with the exotic, and erotic, Sylvia Kristel; who always had her voice dubbed I think, as I'm not sure if she could speak in English, but I could be wrong.

Anyway, she still looks great, sans clothes, and even though the dialogue is \\"hokey\\", and there's some ho-hum male nudity, just to make things \\"equal\\", she does a pretty good job of being the wife, the lover, and more.

I had to spend more money and get the book from the campus bookstore."},{"rating":"2","title":"High quality worth the price","review":"This has served me well, and my grandkids also love it - no excuses to be jumping on the bed or the couch when you've got this! Good exercise for me, a 69-year old without the resultant stress injuries so common with other forms of exercise. This is extremely well made, and no comparison between this and the cheepies out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely worth the money!","review":"This rebounder is high quality and is worth the \\"extra money\\" compared with the cheaper brands available! I have been using poor quality, fifty-dollar range, rebounders for a few years and finally purchased this excellent Needak rebounder in June of 2009. It is now 4 months later and I wish I had purchased this rebounder years ago! On my old, cheap rebounders, the springs would begin to snap one-by-one after as little as a few weeks use (And by the way, my weight is well under the suggested maximums!) I have used my Needak rebounder several times a week for the past few months and none of the springs have snapped. Also, this rebounder provides better cushioning than cheaper brands so it is more comfortable to use and easier on the joints. If you are enthusiastic about rebounding and will use your rebounder frequently, you will want to buy this good quality product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sounds like Britney Spears","review":"Man,Sir Mix-A-lot had great albums and constantly evolved with his sound and lyrics.Seminar, Swass, Mack Daddy, Chief Boot Knocka, Return of the Bumpasaurus all great albums.But this here... if I wouldn't have known that this garbage was from Mix I'd never guessed so.This CD is a Nightmare.Maybe he tried to sell out I don't know.This CD sounds like a mix between Britney Spears, NSync, 50 Cent on LSD.It's a cheap disco nightmare.Daddy is definitely not home or at least I hope he don't is."},{"rating":"2","title":"what happened?","review":"I'm not saying this is a bad record, in fact it is a really good one but why did you have to change your voice up for? Thats the only thing that gets to me but other than that it's worth getting to any mix fan. Please return to your traditional sound on your next cut mix. I respect that you want to experiment but i really hope that this is the only album. The lyrics, beats and styles are tight so don't think this record is bad but if your used to the old mix sound this may take a while to get used to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sirmixalot is back!","review":"After 6 years, Sirmixalot is back. Daddy's Home has all new material. He moves from the \\"Baby got back\\" stage and gets in to other subjects. In my personal opinion, Mix is deciding to keep his fans up on what's real. I used to live in Seattle so I know some of the areas he mentions in his songs from the past, up to now! One of my favorite tracks is the title track, \\"Daddy's home.\\" He says that after his 6 year disappearance, he's back and he collectin' rent...! Go Mix! If you don't like this CD, your not a true Sirmixalot fan at all and you need to listen to somethin' else. It's going to be the realist thing you ever heard! My other favorite track is called, \\"Y'all fools don't know.\\" When Mix says that somethin' has happened to him, it's real. Get this CD and play it loud!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Damn you, Mix!","review":"I listened to this entire cd in less than a minute. I guess not even Sir Mix A Lot isn't infallible.

How can you beat the combo of Warren Oats and Monte Hellman? However, the video quality is poor. Looks like a DVD-R from a second generation VHS derived from a 16mm print of the original 35mm. I guess such is the fate for those craving the obscure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cockfighting Exposed","review":"While the film makers goal may not have been to expose just how cruel the world of cockfighting is, he achieved that aim anyway.

First of all, it is in pan-and-scan fullscreen when the original aspect ratio is 1.85:1. Also, the image and sound quality suggest that it was ripped from a VHS copy. Overall quality is of a bad bootleg.

There is a god or jesus reference in just about every song. LMNO's lack of diverse content just gets way too boring. About 3 songs into the album, you feel like you are at sunday school. I mean that's cool if that's all you really wanna hear, but i like music about a variety of topics, and i think others like me were just as bored with this album. LMNO's lyrics just seemed way too complacent and at times his delivery even makes him sound like he's not into it. The production is pretty good and was one of the only things that got me through the entire album, but lyrically LMNO comes off boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reggae? Start here.","review":"This is a seminal album in Jamaican music, made by one of the coolest guys in history (if you don't believe me, check out the movieRockers - 25th Anniversary Edition(1979) where Burning Spear sits on the beach and sings 'Jah No Dead' A Capella to the wayward protagonist. This album was created in the burgeoning reggae scene that produced the legendary Bob Marley, though many people overlook some of the brilliant artists that set the standard. Spear is among the greatest.Recorded at the legendary Studio One in 1973, Burning Spear's debut album has everything you want from 'roots reggae': the crunchy distorted sound of Studio One, a sweet vocal and the best vibe imaginable.The most impressive aspect of this showcase album is the diversity of styles - from upbeat reggae to chilled proto-dub. But most of all, even on his first album, Spear sings with the love and authenticity that has sustained his career for over 30 years. Check out all his stuff - but start here!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just a Few Questions","review":"The CD's name, Just a Few Questions, by Clay Walker, is my favorite song on the CD.

It was sixth grade narration, sometimes related to the picture being shown, sometimes not, and pictures. I felt that I was watching my uncle's slides of his vacation to Nice.

It is so done the american way. poor. instead of thrying to fix re-fix and fix over what was fixed, they just simply get the rid of the old stuff and put brand new stuff. COME ON. use your ingenuity. still it did not work. my father, who knows about this. was pointing mistake over mistake.there is another reason why this is so American. They only show American planes. Be a little more open minded. the world is larger. also the Amrican aircraft moddles came from copied or stolen designs of other countries inventions, or design in America by foreigners.still is something that will let you burn time. but definitely ita can be better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great film... I enjoyed the hell out of it!","review":"Clever, quirky characters, and excellent acting. Full of sex and violence--not for the easily offended--but delivered with panache, and always in service to the plot. Really funny too... I loved all of the dark comedic moments. An excellent first-effort by screenwriter Paul Osborne. Can't wait to see what's next."},{"rating":"2","title":"A surprise gem. New noir!","review":"I saw this film a couple of years ago when it was making the festival circuit. I was taken in by it's deceptively simple premise. It is a wild, edgy ride (although extreme violence, sex, and nudity make this a film for mature audiences). This film deserves a look by by anyone who enjoys a solid, noir experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible writing.","review":"Reviews in various places mention poor acting, but I disliked the writing even more. The ignorance and lack of creativity demonstrated in the movie's title should have kept me away, unnecessarily abbreviating the word until (like the fast food marketing idiots of MacDonald's and Taco Bell) rather than using the word till. A waste of time for an unsatisfying conclusion, this movie isn't even worth renting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outragious shipping charge","review":"The shipping charge on 5 of these was almost $10.00.

The Clapton one has the songs he did with Page which is great to hear, but the Beck songs are mostly Yardbirds tracks and instrumentals-I'm not sure where those songs came from. The Jimmy Page disc is basically worthless-some second rate R & B singer with a studio band that apparently Page is playing with. But you sure can't tell who is playing guitar. Some of the tracks are repeated on the different discs so there is no telling who is really is on the track! And, of course, there is absolutely zero information about the tracks listed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Confused mish-mosh of three great players","review":"The repetition of the tracks between discs and the awful sound quality makes this boxed set definitely one to avoid. I had been looking forward to hearing this trio collection but when played, the acoustics and background accompanists were terrible. It was Yardbirds all over again. If I were able, I'd give this set zero stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"the total pack","review":"It is wery old numbers and the sound is bad.

(With titles like \\"Are you a Good Girlfriend?\\" and \\"Does He Like You?\\" and \\"Are You a Flirt?\\") It has \\"Winning Looks\\", where they rate how stars look. In \\"Totally Embarrasing Moments\\", people write in about embarrassing moments they've had, and J-14 rates them as - \\"You'll Get Over It,\\" \\"We Don't Know You,\\" and \\"Leave Town Now!!!\\" In \\"Truth or Dare,\\" people write in about stuff they had to say or do ina game of Truth or Dare. J-14 will rate those as \\"Total Daredevil,\\" \\"Pretty Risky,\\" and something else I can't remember. In \\"Cool Comebacks,\\" people write in about cool comebacks they've made.

Hidden underneath all the teenage, wannabe-tabloid fluff were actually some interesting articles and fairly interesting celebrity gossip. Plus, I really liked the glossy posters.But now, J-14 has taken a turn for the worse. The articles have gotten really dull, most of them revolving around the likes and dislikes of celebrities. Do any of us honestly care about where (insert Disney Channel star's name) or (insert teenybopper's name) shop or who they have a crush on or what's their absolutely fave lip gloss?The answer is: NO.And I hate how they show the same celebrities over and over again now. In every issue, there's Taylor Swift, Justin Bieber, Miley Cyrus, a Jonas, Selena Gomez, Demi Lovato, etc. And when they do show someone new, it's just some teenybopper who starred in some movie I never watched and never will see.If you really like this kind of stuff, I recommend reading magazines for adults like People."},{"rating":"2","title":"j-14 or not","review":"i dont care if it is for fourteen year olds, this magazine rocks. it has all the inside info and has awsome poster, door hangers, fake tattoos and stars, stars, stars. it tells you about everything and its the only magazine that has special articles for stars. who cares if your 12 or 11 this magazine is for everyone. i love the games about your favorite stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was good.....but not great......","review":"It was good but not great some of the rumors, facts, and stuff about stars was pretty obvious but if you don't know zilch about stars and would like to this magazine is LOADED with everything you want to know about stars!

I sure as hell wouldn't want my 12 year old daughter to wear mascara. If you have a tween and you want her to grow to become a pimpstress, get this. The only entertaining aspect of this magazine is the embarassing moments kinds of things (but of course). Other than that, no. They feature pretty bland fashion.All in all, this magazine is JUST like Twist.Therefore, the age reccomendation is just 11 & 12, but you're better off getting GL for even more years worth of goodness (10-15 yrs.) because no, it's NOT cool to steal your sister's damn boyfriend for pete's sake."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really lame","review":"This mag has nice production values but lousy content.

When I purchased this product, I thought I was getting another fine Tonka software product. I wasn't.The controls are keyboard-oriented, which makes it more difficult for a child to master. He is used to mouse-oriented controls (contained in the older Tonka titles). My six year old has a hard time remembering which key does what function. Even after playing if a few times, he doesn't enjoy it much.Also, the game simply isn't as fun. The latter titles offered more interaction...more diverse play scenarios. This title lacks the \\"oomph!\\" that carried the other games.If you're a first-time Tonka buyer, I'd reccommend either the Tonka Construction set or the Search and Rescue program. Oh, and be sure to check the system requirements before you buy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This can't be Tonka Joe","review":"We purchased this computer program thinking it would be fun and enjoyable like all the other Tonka Joe adventures. All we found was pure disappointment.

When we pulled the game back out a few months later, we purchased a gamepad, since it was a little hard to manuever the spaceships with the mouse....this made all the difference!!

It's great to hear him take some chances again and not worry about the commercial appeal of the music. My personal favorite is Close Enough For Love - which is a clever little ditty complete with a nifty lounge piano segment and the shout-out - the drummer is an Indian - referring to Trilok Gurtu. In all songs Jack's vocals are superlative. In fact, his singing is reason enough to get the album. These are full, warm. loose vocals - a mjor improvement over some of the stuff found on Monkjack where he seems to try just a little too hard and gets shrill and thin. Clapton's playing on - what is it - 3, I guess, songs is tasteful and to the point, and I believe that anyone who likes Songs for a Tailor should find much here to savor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not too good","review":"Not one of his best.

The old bad louness was the one with mike on lead vocals. it was nice to get minoru back for awhile with loudness, but they can't go any further. bring back masaki or get someone new. all the singers they ever had were limited in range or style. but akira is still one of the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reviewers are confused","review":"The instrument is a little confusing to use, but it is quite accurate. Read the instructions, and measure at the right point on the belt. It has to be placed properly and you must take care not to disturb the lever after it clicks.The above reviewer is confused. The belt tension as recommended by the vehicle manufacturer is in pounds or kilos. that is the tension on the belt between puleys. It is not the same as what it would take to push the belt in. In other words it is a gauge not a scale. It is calibrated to deflect the lever a certain angle dependent on belt tension with a steady force(thus the \\"click\\") It does not mean you deflect the belt with 50lbs of pressure.I use this and others use this on high power exotics with critical timing belt tension. It works quite well, and is quite accurate. If you don't know how to measure belt tension ask someone who does, or go to a mechanic."},{"rating":"2","title":"It works - if you know what to look for","review":"This is NOT a belt deflection gauge, it is a belt tension gauge. You will likely need your factory service manual to get the true tension measurements. Most manuals will say something like \\"1/2 inch deflection at 20lbs of pressure\\" - this will NOT measure that. In the FSM, it will have specifications more like \\"80lbs (or it will be in newton meters more likely) - that is what this gauge measures. Both specifications would end up with the same \\"tightness\\" to the belt, just different measurements. These have been around forever and almost every professional technician will have one in their toolbox. Shop around on price, NAPA sells them for quite a bit less than here."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Plan 9 of Outer Space of Toscas!","review":"This version of Tosca is so bad it's funny. In a failed attempt to \\"modernize\\" the classic, the producers weigh down the story with hilariously inappropriate stage setups, including a tilted stage (at one point, Scarpia even has to grab a piece of furniture about to slide off into the orchestra pit!) that is actually fitting given the fact that the whole production is about to sink like the Titanic at any moment. The singers writhe and roll all over the stage, they go up and down on pulleys, clothes are ripped at, hairy chests are exposed (oh, brother!). All would be excusable if the singers gave us something new & great, or even good - they don't. The cast is not equal to the task, but is pretty to look at. Even the audience seems incredibly underwhelmed by the needless bombast and ham-fisted Broadway musical acting. And what is with the eyeball? Ugh, could you possible get a bigger sledgehammer to ram that metaphor home? C'mon, its Puccini, not KISS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Tosca Ever!","review":"It's not just the bizarre staging and the hideous costumes and the fact that we are constantly prevented from being even remotely involved by the camera jumping into four black and white scenes from time to time.

But, the long-time fans wanted more rarities and the first-time listeners wanted a single disc of their hits. The Best Of The Doobies Vol.1-2 wasn't enough. So, in 2001, Rhino made another Doobies collection. Greatest Hits is a valued compilation of 20 of their best hits. It sums up their best years from 1970-2000. They are all here, starting with their 1972 hit, Listen To The Music. Some of my favorites are What A Fool Believes, Minute By Minute, Real Love, You Belong To Me, and Takin' It To The Streets. The booklet has a lot of rare photographs and other great information. Buy this with Doobies Choice, which includes album cuts and rarities, before you get any of their albums.

If you're a big fan, the Michael MacDonald Ultimate Collection CD is highly recommended.

One other note, I had a specific question and e-mailed Mr. Homer, and his response was quick, cordial, and solved my problem on the first try.....many software companies should do so well.The complete application presented is easy to understand, but at the same time filled with features that display information in a visually superb manner.

Eric is at the top of his game at this concert."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing sound and picture","review":"This concert is one of the first complete performances of Eric released in DVD. With amazing and crisp sound and picture, it represents a true document on contemporary music for future generations. Eric performs his classic tunes like Badge and Acoustic Layla plus great blues songs like Five Long Years and Tore Down. Here we see a Slowhand in top notch shape, soloing greatly, and singing with a lotta feeling, like a true blues man. This concert was taped in Hyde Park in 1996, in the midst of a heavy rain, which did not manage to scare away the thousands of souls touched by Eric's music. There are virtually no behind the scenes or interviews footage, which would've been great, but one addition to the DVD is the the classic blues It Hurts me Too, with great slide guitar by the amster. Don't let it pass, I can honestly say this is the best E.C. DVD out yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Reporting Has \\"Left\\" the Building","review":"\\"The Killer Bees\\" are made out to be heroes by Heard, who covered Austin politics for many years as an AP reporter. Though interesting at times, it is fatally flawed by being chock full of spin. When reporters can shed any veil of objectivity and cut loose to deify the Democrats, hang on to your hats, kids. Even the title declares their actions a \\"miracle\\".This is, in short, a 124 page cheer for the Democrats, dressed up as a history lesson. Be not fooled.Heard is actually a good writer, but was obviously too emotionally involved in this case to put together a cogent account of the subject matter. He is better when focused on other passions, such as his sportswriting. The Killer Bees made some waves, but Heard makes the event out to be the watershed event in Texas political history. The drama in 1979 was palpable, to be sure, but really...take it easy. A more objective writer would let his reader make the decisions.

The fatal flaw of the book is the utter failure to recognize his own shortcomings or failures under his watch. He does so artfully though, simultaneously projecting an air of humility while really being quite blind to any failings. In the end, it projects a tone of \\"aw, shucks, I guess I really was pretty smart\\" which just doesn't jibe with the reality of the recently disclosed 2005 report from the CIA inspector general that outlines many of the CIA's failings under Tenet's leadership. This is a painful read (to see a guy so clueless and without any sense of self-awareness), but compelling enough to finish (to understand some of the mechanics of how we got ourselves into this mess)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tenat's Side of the Story","review":"I did enjoy learning about his early life and roots his father etc.Then my interest level started to \\"wane\\".He has many details which were not available to the general public up to this point.However, other than two or three details I learned, the book did not keep me deeply interested."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Footnotes, Much Opinion","review":"Mr. Tenet is a great storyteller. The melodrama is rampant here. Where does the story end and the truth begin? There is only an index at the back of this book. No footnotes whatsoever. Other books that I have read from former gov't officials have copies of un- or de-classified memos and documents to back up their arguements. Arbitrary discretion does not inspire confidence in the story. It will always be a mystery to me as to the reasoning behind President Bush keeping this holdover from the Clinton administration on as CIA director. Mr. \\"slam-dunk\\" fails again.Fortunately, I waited to buy this from the \\"bargain books\\" list. Read the book, just take what he says with a grain of salt."},{"rating":"2","title":"Debt of gratitude","review":"Very enlightening, especially the insight into post Irag war rehabilitation. Whether or not you were appalled that the US would even think of going to war with Iraq, knowing what we knew at the time, it could have come out reasonably ok if wiser minds had prevailed and the VP's close-minded neoconservative friends had been kept out of it. We owe a debt of gratitude to George Tenet and others of his ilk, for sharing his thoughts and sacrificing much of his professional and family life."},{"rating":"2","title":"good story","review":"Detailed story of how the CIA operated during his leadership.I think he got a bad deal from the administration and in general from the congress. Such is politics and nothing to do with one's achivement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still at the center of the storm","review":"As someone that likes to read all side of a story, I find this book well written. It is definitely worth the read beyond the 60 Minutes sound bites. But the cloud will still persist over George Tenet head as only a part of the story. When it comes to understanding Saudi Araba and what the CIA was doing there, I find the bookIf Olaya Street Could Talk -- Saudi Arabia: The Heartland of Oil and Islamas a more objective book on the subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"Center of Storm = Not My Fault","review":"This book started out OK but quickly evolved into something that should have been titled \\"Not My Fault\\" (except someone else already used that title). It has some good information but for the best part seems to be Tenet's personal defense of all the criticism the CIA has received during his tenure."},{"rating":"1","title":"self justification in the center of a storm","review":"The fact that this book has already vanished from public attention says it all. In my opinion, it is an attempt to varnish over his years at the CIA when the performance of that organization was an abomination security wise. The book just not justify CIA failures pre 9/11 nor vis-a-vis the WMD's alleged to be in Iraq. Nor does it explain where the weapons that Hussein once had and did use go to. A wasted effrort at self vindication for which there is none."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointed reader","review":"I had anticipated a more direct, clearly expressed and no nonsense book. I did not received what I anticipated.

I finished it somewhat disappointed with him. My overall interpretation of what he has written is that many of the \\"mistakes\\" that were made were due to his detachment from many of the details of important intelligence information handled by the CIA. Many times he infers and outright states that \\"such and so was handling this and I should have paid more attention to it\\". I don't think anything George Tenet did or didn't do was done with malice, rather he was just not competent in the position he was in. It is not uncommon for a \\"star\\" performer at lower levels to rise to their level of incompetance. This is true in business and government. I have no doubt he was doing his best, but was simply the wrong man for the job at that time. However, hindsight is always 20/20."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chapter on Hussein's links to al Qaeda","review":"For those in the mainstream media and elsewhere who continue to insist that there is and was no reason to suggest Saddam Hussein had no links to al Qaeda this book is going to be a dissapointment.There is an entire chapter detailing Tenet's battles with Feith, Cheney and company over how strong the links were but Tenet reveals that Zarqawi was in Iraq in 2002 (after a decade of meetings between Saddam's regime and al Qaeda leaders), as were hundreds of al Qaeda members. Zarqawi and associates of Ayman al Zawahiri were shipping weapons from Baghdad to their camp in Northern Iraq, surely with at least the knowledge of Hussein's regime, according to Tenet.It's important to keep in mind that quite a bit of classified material was undoubtedly removed from the book on both this issue and the WMD issue but the book certainly dispells the notion that the links between were made from whole cloth by the Bush administration."},{"rating":"2","title":"Teaches me a lot","review":"I was looking for a book that really teaches about Windows NT System Programming, and I was lucky to find this one. Most of the Windows programming books will teach you MFC and maybe a little of system call (which is usually of negligible usefulness). This one exposes the inner working of Windows system.

Perfect for people with C++ knowledge, and Unix programmers who want to learn Windows system programming."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended.","review":"Even as a book for beginners, it doesn't really cover NT sufficiently.

He teamed with Castro Neves, Baden Powell and the great Tom Jobim, the composer of Quiet Nights and The Girl from Ipanema to cover bossa nova standards and more percussive mainstream samba numbers. The result is irregular but always inspired and worth listening.

This particular double-album CD is a steal not only at its price, but because the quality of the music on both records is so consistently good. Using his flute to guide the ambience and not simply to embellish it, the tracks are infectious bits of bachelor pad/martini napkin-wet coolness; so much so that even on tracks that burn-out a little (\\"Menina Feia\\" and \\"Voce E Eu\\" leap to mind) retain their essential Mann-ness.

I'm a mathematician,not a statistician, so much of the material, and the authors' ways oflooking at it, were not familiar to me. My statistician colleaguesassure me that the techniques in the book are correct, useful, andmostly up to date. And I believe them.Alas, the book is poorly edited, and in just the few chapters wecovered, I found a score of errors, including misstated formulas,misplaced graphics, multiplication where there should be division, andeven some numerical errors.

Tough for the gifted amateur, but interesting and the depth of the analysis truly helps.Major negative comment : The manual often provides one sentence answers to mathematical questions. For example : \\"....slight improvement in the model.\\" But this is not helpful. It lacks truly worked answers to the questions; which is essential to help those who are struggling to get to the right level.This is not a limited observation, it is the trend and considerably more work could be done to explain how answers were derived, as it also helps find out why an answer might not be correct.As for the up side.

The biggest problems with the book are details that aren't needed to move the plot forward, strange repetitions (tall athletic man,) a criminal boss who doesn't really seem in charge, and illogical descriptions of a would-be murderer jumping up and down in frustration, and expressions like; \\"Wait,\\" he yelled to himself, and, \\"What do you think so far?\\" she screamed over the loud music and screaming girls.With an experienced critic wielding a red pen, I believe the essence of the book could have been covered in 235 pages and been made much stronger.

I served eight years in the Army, and though I never was sent into combat, the bond that exists between guys in uniform, regardless of whether or not you know them, is what make this both the hardest and the greatest film I've seen. I held it together pretty well until it ended, when the names of the fallen were shown. Couldn't hold it in after that. This one really hits you in the gut.There's also some great humorous stuff that keeps the film from being morbid.

Its like they didn't even try.I thought the battle took place in Vietnam? The terrain looks like it took place in a glorified paintball park.The VCs are cartoonist extras from Rambo.

Words can't really even describe the film......but it is VERY powerful. It is about a specific battle during the Vietnam War. It was quite graphic but not in a needless sort of way. The theater was silent during the whole movie and after it was over, I was completely speechless......no small feat for me! I felt completely emotionally drained and unable to even discuss what I had just seen. I highly recommend this movie and both my friend and felt that this was probably the best movie we have ever seen. **NOTE - PEOPLE!!!! Don't take small children to this movie. There were several in the theater when I saw it. There were a few times that I couldn't stomach some of the violence and I had to look away.... and not too much offends me.

The daily news reports and the folks on your very own block that received bad news about a loved one, for what?This movie captures both the emotional side of the women left to worry about their men and the closeness of the men that went to fight. Of particular interest was the studious leader (Mel Gibson) who researched everything before going in to battle. Knowing the enemy and his traits, this is not something normallly portrayed in a movie about the Vietnam War.And what an excellent movie that kept me (and my date) both glued to the end of our seats. The action is both excitiing and depressing at the same time. The true face of war. An awesome reflection on the tragedy of it all.I highly recommend this movie to anyone who can look past the violence and senselessness of war, any war, but especially the Vietnam War (as far as senselessness).Do yourself a favor, see this movie ASAP."},{"rating":"2","title":"awe-struck","review":"A must see. This movie left me in awe. It truly shows the brutality of war and the courage and heroism of the American soldier. Mel Gibson was outstanding in his role as Lt. Colonel Hal Moore and portrayed the essense of this man. Sam Elliot was also outstanding in his performance as Sgt. Major Basil Plumley. I highly recommend this movie, especially for those who want to see and understand what the American Soldier faced in Viet Nam."},{"rating":"2","title":"As good as it gets","review":"Put aside your opinions of Gibson. This movie isn't about him or his character. Character studies of lunatics driven mad by this insane war is the Vietnam movie we've come to expect. This is something different. In fact Gibson in a helmet looks so much like John Wayne that its easy to mistake this for a WWII movie. But fortunately this isn't an old-fashioned propaganda film. This movie gives heroism and realism a fine balance and both sides of the fight are treated honestly and with respect.Heroism aside, the death toll in this story proves the waste of it all. Nobody has to die in these wars of choice and the cursed names of those who commit troops to die in them will live in infamy. That is their legacy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent movie!","review":"The first time I saw this movie was in the theater with my dad. Tears silently rolled down his face as we watched the brave men fight. I'll never forget that.Greg Kinnear was excellent in this film.

It brought back many memories as a child when my mother received the notice that my father had been killed in Viet Nam. Now I understand it more than I ever did as a child. Life goes on but those that did not live through this war, perhaps you may want to take a look at how things really were. What a waste of lives and for what...NOTHING! And now we are in Iraq. Frankly, I see very little differences. Read the book, watch the movie and then you will understand Viet Nam and get a better understanding of what our soldiers are going through in Iraq. Treat those serving in Iraq with respect and dignity upon their arrival home. Those serving in Viet Nam were not granted anything, least of all respect from their Homeland. At least give it to those that are being placed in Iraq, a place I will assure you most do not want to be.

It is thoughtful, respectful of the enemy and gives our soldiers the credit they were denied when they came home. I have gotten into rows with \\"Anti-War\\" friends who protest any effort to glorify our soldiers. They talk the talk but basically were chickens--with ideology but no empathy. Communism has nothing to do with it. whatever The Vietnamese were as the book says a brave and worthy foe--and our soldiers (who the chicken anti-war movement jeered) were brave and worthy--heroes in what I regard as a monstrous war.

The book this movie was based on was one of the finest Vietnam histories I've ever had the pleasure and honor to read. So it was with great eagerness that I awaited this film. Mel had access to the book's author,Lt. Gen.Harold G. Moore, as well as all available historical reference materials.So it was with deep regret that I saw Gibson take HUGE liberties with historical facts that were painted onto history's pages with the blood of those brave men. The performances were great; I've always been a Sam Elliot fan; but this doesn't excuse the end result.Do yourself a favor- read the book \\"We Were Soldiers Once And Young\\" if you want to truly capture the feel, as well as the facts of that battle.

As he did so well in THE PATRIOT, Mel Gibson performs marvelously as the American general (granted, he was no MacArthur, but who else was?!) and gives an award-winning, heart-rending, authentic acting so sincere that his tears cause the moviegoer to respond in kind. He may be from down under, but he makes a pretty good, Southern gentleman turned soldier. There were a few funny incidents as when the women's group talk about going to the laundry in that small Georgia town. It breaks your heart when you see that yellow taxi's appearance; I almost had a heart attack when the general's wife looked out and saw it that last time. Don't miss this powerful movie; it will leave you with fulfillment and the knowledge we were denied when this event actually took place.

This is one of those films that really take you in - and when it's over, you snap out of it and realize where you've been for the past hour and a half. Wow!The acting, the story and the battles are all so stirring. Mel Gibson plays this weighty role wonderfully. Supporting roles by Greg Kinnear, Sam Elliot and Chris Klein also help to express the amazing courage these soldiers possessed. Very moving.Making a movie about such important and sensitive subject matter must be unbelievably daunting. This movie both entertained me and disturbed me more than any war-themed movie I'd ever seen. That is precisely why I know it was done successfully.

Graphically violent film features almost non-stop fighting after the first hour. Technically, the battle scenes are well-choregoraphed, but those sequences never achieve the \\"you are there\\" feeling, and the film completely lacks in genuine dramatic power and nail-biting intensity. The character development is second-rate, the symbolism is heavy-handed...This is what happens when...people try to meditate on the meaning of brotherhood. Good message, but poorly executed.

Now all he accomplished is nothing more than a technically stunning, but patriotic and truth-denying Braveheart in Vietnam film.Don't get me wrong. This film is good. But it fails at telling the story of the Vietnam War. Totally.There are nice approaches, but the general audience - who assumingly did not study the history of Vietnam - isn't told anything about the conflict, and how the USofA ruined Vietnam and the surrounding countries.The DVD is good.

Not only are the characters poorly developed and the script lacking in credibility but the combat scenes are reminiscent of those badly filmed war movies of the 1950s and 60s. Though this film might be historically accurate, its visually absurd at times, with the Vietnamese troops blindly running into torrents of fire, often in single file. Ridiculous. Frankly, its insulting. There are far better films than this to spend your money on. This one falls flat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry Depiction of war","review":"Seeing this movie in the theater I walked on being so disgusted at the poor portrayal of Vietnam. Overglorified battles when actual combat in Vietnam were chaotic skirmishes... it looked like a civil war battle with all the Vietnamese charging blindly and falling by the dozens... riiiight.

Doesn't show any other aspect/atmosphere of Vietnam than a big battle. Some cool scenes, but overall the shooting gets boring real quick.WATCH PATH TO WAR INSTEAD!!!!! IT WASN'T ALL MACNAMERA'S FAULT!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Makes one feel guilty.","review":"This movie was horrible,don't get me wrong i like my war films, and I am not the son of the devil, I found The Thin Red Line horrific, but this film had me in stitches, I was laughing so much and this made me feel very guilty. You know when someone is going to die, because something good has just happened to them. This film tries at one point to show the story not just from the americans side, but our hero from the other side runs along in dramatic slow motion only to have his head blown off. Mel Gibson just seemed to be his usual self, with no emotion this time, I didn't care what happened to these characters which since it is a true story made me feel more guilty. Watch Black Hawk Down, there's a very emotional war film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth one star.","review":"I ordered this video after skipping over the offers of used ones. I wanted a new, quality product as it was to be shown first to my group of veteran friends. When it arrived I attempted to review it first to see if, in fact, I did get a good product. I found that it was on a blank CD, and that the label had been placed, (haphazardly), over a previous label of some sort. After letting my group of friends know that Anazon had not given me what I had paid for, we found another video of the same title at a local rental store to get us through the scheduled meting, and I applied for a refund. Amazon did see that I had my expenditure refunded, and except for not being able to live up to my offer of furnishing this particular video, all came out all right.This was my first,(and last), attempt to buy through Amazon.

The courage and heart that our Soldiers displayed is wonderfully portrayed, and Mel Gibson does his usual great job as their Commanding Officer. (Sam Elliott is also great as his second-in-command...) We also get to see another, seldom-seen side of the Vietnam War- The Home Front, where wives and families lived in fear of a telegram from The Army...The movie's violence is VERY graphic, but war is hell, so....We Were Soldiers gives us another view of America's most unpopular War, and in this time of increased patriotism, it's a welcome view at that. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"We Were Soldiers","review":"A truely great film! One of the best movies I've seen in years. This movie is very realistic and shows not only what the soldiers went through, but also the reactions of the wives or fiances they left behind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flawed but good","review":"To all those who cripe about this movie not being realistic and trudging up 'Apocalypse Now' as an exemplary Viet Nam flick, I say \\"Get out of the 1970s.\\" Not every colonel in Viet Nam was a psychotic, megalomaniacal fool. Not every GI burned villages for sport.Did those things happen? Sure. But they were not the ONLY thing that happened. The war was fought primarily by average people in a totally fubar situation, created chiefly by our own government and its provincial myopia.Are there a ton of John Wayne-ish cliches in this movie? You bet. And it also shortchanges the futility of the heroism of the Air Cavalry. But it's a long overdue positive look at the guys who fought and died."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wallace made his best, but....","review":"I read the book before seeing the movie. IT was not a dissapointment, no, it's a good movie, but something's weird here...In the book, Moore traces a brief background about the Vietnam situation (French dominance, American involvment, the politics of it all). In the movie, it is seldom mentioned. Also, half the book is about another battle fought two days later, at Landing Zone Albany, where American soldiers suffered even bigger losses than in Landing zone X-Ray.Also, I'm positive that, in the book, Moore does not talk about himself killing anyone. The movie shows him killing a lot of vitnamese soldiers, some of them at point blank range... I understand that, since, the second battler would be completely wiped out for the movie, Wallace had to make Moore (Gibson) more dominant on the screen.Just a note: what's wrong with Madeleine Stowe's mouth here? Have someone noticed that? There's something werong with her lips!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great movie","review":"All i can say is i cried during most of this movie.We did not lose this war.Politics lost it.I know i was there,and it's the first and last time the N.V.A.regulars came out to meet us man to man."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very educational and exciting","review":"This is a very good movie to know the basics about Vietnam, it is also good if you like war history, or just to watch a blow 'em up smash 'em up type of movie. I won't give anything away but there is some parts where someone with a weak stomach shouldn't watch or a very young child. Overall I think it is a great movie and I would buy it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Movie; Bad Transfer","review":"This review is for the blu-ray transfer only, and not the film itself. This edition of We Were Soldiers is problematic. It is excessively grainy and gritty, and does not have the level of detail that one normally expects from a blu-ray. The colors are strong in the nighttime scenes, but the daytime shots look washed out at times. I am not a sound expert, but the battle sounds were realistic enough for me, so no problems there. It is a shame this picture was not given better treatment, because it is a good movie.My four-star rating is for the movie. The blu-ray transfer by itself would only get two stars. If you are considering an upgrade from DVD to blu-ray, sadly, you will probably want to pass on this one. Perhaps the studio will remaster it and do a better job sometime in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gibson rocks","review":"so far one of the best historical , and accurate movies about the vietnam war, and its consequences of the ptsd traumas."},{"rating":"2","title":"almost beats out platoon","review":"if it werent for that zzzzzzzzz part with madelien stowe and her new lips(who gave her the bright idea,melonie griffith?).only 1 scene was needed to show her HEROICALLY pass out death slips.i guess it was politically correct to show what ever part women play during wartime,HOWEVER,we got the idea after the 1st shot.and what the heck was with that womens group meeting?(more zzzzzzzzzzzz's)mel did a little bit of grand-standing pacing back and forth on the battlefield.sam elliots charactor was a wee bit unconvincing.overall,this is the 2nd best vietnam movie,and high on the top 10 war movies in my ever popular opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fitting Tribute","review":"This film was a tribute to those Americans and Vietnamese soldiers who gave all for their countries when called upon. It gave balance from the perspective of the home front and the battle front.The battle scenes were graphic but not gory (although no children under 13 should probably see it). It leaves you with a sense of gratitude toward those men who gave all in an \\"unpopular\\" war. It will do for the Vietnam War what \\"Private Ryan\\" did for WWII veterans in my opinion. Great movie, one of the few that I'll see twice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth watching","review":"The only reason I watched and bought this DVD is because I admire Mel Gibson so much. It isn't the greatest film in regard to war, but the films attraction is how it weaves the horrors of war with the families left behind and what it must be like for wives and parents to get the notice their loved one has been killed in a land far away. I know the hell of war, having had immediate family in WW2, Korea, Viet Nam, the first Gulf War, and now Iraq. But the constant barrage of killing scenes did leave me a tad overwhelmed and after a few minutes I found myself thinking \\"ok enough already\\". This is where I wish they had interspersed more homefront connection scenes. But in the end, it is a movie I appreciate and would recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"See it.","review":"It was gory. It was hard to watch, but I got very involved with the wives left behind -- been there, done that.Eye opening, and made the divorce statistics for men who served in the wars from WWII on easy to understand -- the amazing part is that any of them stayed together.With the international complexities today, I think this movie and others like it are important -- and every politician should watch them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great film","review":"This is such a historically accurate film. They pull no punches in this film. It makes me want to read the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"War is hell","review":"This movie was a decent remaking of the vietnam war. Mel Gibson was superb but Sam Eliot took the cake. He was awesome in his role. The movie itself was allegorically correct. It begins very structured, just like the military training, and then when the bullets and bombs start going off and all hell breaks loose, the movie becomes a convuluted miasma of cut scenes and confusion ---just like a war. Greatness. The director of this movie hit it right on the mark. I say it was a decent remaking of Vietnam only because my uncle, who was really there, says it was much different. Eh, who am I to know? I just think it was a good movie. WATCH THE OUTTAKES!"},{"rating":"1","title":"John Wayne would be proud !","review":"I am a fan of Mel Gibson movies, but this one was no Braveheart or Patriot. There have been alot of great war films like Platoon,Saving Private Ryan, Blackhawk Down, Full Metal Jacket, Apocalypse Now. We Were Soldiers is not one of them. This film belongs in the B-grade section with films like Green Berets , Hamburger Hill, Casualties of War ,Thin Red Line etc.I thought the acting cheesy and the battles scenes were very unrealistic.If you love John Wayne movies then you will love We Were SoldiersIf you want to see a great war film grab a copy of Platoon or Blackhawk Down."},{"rating":"1","title":"disoppointing","review":"This is SUCH a disoppointment!! After two great movies like Braveheart and especially the Patriot, you would expect an even better one from Mel Gibson. But this one didn't even make me want to see the end. Though it's not THAT bad, it's a disoppointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"It came scratched!!","review":"Although this movie was a great price, my dad opened the brand new movie on christmas to watch it and it was already scratched, and we couldn't watch part of the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"OverRated","review":"The movie did not develop any characters beyond the normal sappy sterotypes of soldiers. The first half is a romanticized view of soldiers (and their families) lives. Once they go to war, the second half, the movie picks up steam. However, the war scenes were without a clear purpose and not really part of the story. Bottom line, it could have been shorter and much better if the characters had been developed before the war."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible mess by Mel","review":"Has mr. Gibson got totally grandeur? This film is so bad as it could possibally be! Mel should be nominated to the Razzie award!It's very unpleasant to see him with those other young, welltrained bodies, and you can even see the sucking spirit in his eyes!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A piece of utter trash....!","review":"This absurdly patriotic film is sickening. Obviously the creators of this film haven't read much of the bible (the whole part where you are to forgive your enemies and so forth). Mel Gibson's character is constantly talking about God, however he doesn't seem to realise that if you kill people for a living you aren't a good Christian!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible","review":"Being a guy who loves action movies, the parts showing the wifes were a slight setback, but I didn't mind watching them because it all fell into the story great. I also love movies that are heroic or inspiring (Braveheart, The Patriot, Saving Private Ryan), and this is another movie that I thought did the same. It looked great also just overall, and was just stunning. I am not in the army, I don't know much about vietnam, but after I saw that movie I just felt so connected to it (although Hollywood changed some of the parts comparing to the book). This movie is really only good for action and parts of drama. But the history behind it, and the feeling I had that people actually did this made me appreciate this movie so much more."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good movie, but a little disappointed.","review":"I found the movie entertaining and for those who were not there, enlightening. I was really disappointed when the movie veered off from what really happened at the battle of the Ia Drang. There is no indication at all of what happened when Moores' battalion moved from the first lz, at the end of the first part of the battle, towards the second lz, where they were scheduled to be choppered out. That part of the battle was very different from the first part, that shown in the movie. The second part of the battle was even more brutal than that shown in the movie. Which is probably why it was just simply cut short. I would recommend watching it, but if you want to know what really happened, there are several fine histories available. You should know what really happened there."},{"rating":"2","title":"If even the vets liked it...","review":"...that's gotta say something. The casting was brilliant, the actors did a wonderful job, the cinematography was fantastic. This movie did an excellent job of portraying the war from all points of view, from the soldiers on both sides to the families at home who had to watch their loved ones go off into the unknown and unknowable.In my opinion this movie did nothing to 'glorify' war as some critics claim, but did plenty to tell the story as truly as it could be told. Buy it for yourself, buy it for your friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like pulling teeth - read the book","review":"This movie butchers an incredible book.If you (a) think Mel Mel Gibson is a good actor; (b) didn't graduate from middle school; (c) are a racist who finds it possible to believe that the Viet Cong & North Vietnamese fought the war solely by screaming at the top of their lungs and charging like Civil War cavalry; and (d) enjoy cheesy, predictable Hollywood [junk], this movie is for you.If you answered no to all of the above, read the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Finally, a movie that fogs the Vietnam War","review":"I will admit right now, I am no fan of Mel. He is very talented as an actor and film maker; there is no doubt about that. But I think he's always had an extreme Christian-right leaning agenda that he managed to keep somewhat hidden for decades, and in this film, his veil of secrecy is clearly removed. Forget about the whys and morals of that particular war, he indicates. You get from Gibson that the real point is that war is bloody hell and we may as well win while we're at it, and we have plenty of practice with it. And to hell with all those peace loving naysayers. So in effect, his film throws our society back another 30 years. Stick with the real Vietnam films like MASH, Apocalypse Now, Deer Hunter, and Full Metal Jacket. Even Hamburger Hill made more sense than this piece of junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Revisionist history at its worst.","review":"I just watched this movie and I had to force myself to see all of it. Lt. Col. Hal Moore's (Mel Gibson) speaches were syrupy sweet melodramatic drivel. In fact, much of the dialogue is the same way. This film had none of the reality Platoon had, which is the most comprehensive Vietnam War movie. We Were Soldiers is a very sanitized and fictionalized version of the Vietnam War. In addition to Platoon, I would recommend, Tigerland, Hamburger Hill, and Full Metal Jacket."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure garbage.","review":"I would have never thought that I'd one day laugh hysterically at a war-genre movie. Then I saw \\"We Were Soldiers.\\" With all honesty, this could have passed for a comedy in my mind. \\"We Were Soldiers\\" is one of the most ridiculous war movies I've seen in recent years, with a story that is embarrasingly hysterical. Mel Gibson did his best to try and save the film, but it ended up sinking faster than the Titanic. The films weakest point was the story of Gibson's wife, Julie Moore (Madeleine Stowe;) it's where the film gets the most laughs, for me at least. \\"We Were Soldiers\\" is easily one of the worst films of 2002, and will most likely remain on my list of the Worst Films of the Year permenantly. What a horrible movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Truckload of simplistic cliches","review":"Utterly unrealistic glorification of war. I happen to know a few real soldiers who fought on the other side. The war was much more brutal and savage and americans were much less civilised and gallant."},{"rating":"1","title":"An OK Movie","review":"They compare this movie a lot to Braveheart because it was written by the same guy and stars Mel Gibson. Well, in my opinion this movie was no where near close to Braveheart.Mel Gibson's acting is decent but I dont' think he'll ever do better than Braveheart. The Patriot was better than this movie if you want another Mel Gibson war movie.If you want another war movie from the 20th century, check out Saving Private Ryan or Band of Brothers. Also, Platoon kicks this movie's butt as far as Vietnam movies go.Overall this movie was too drawn out. The action was great, was very random and long. The beginning seemed like it took forever. I got really sick of Mel Gibson talking about God and never leaving his soldiers. It just seemed cheesy and out of place.There are better war movies out there, so try something else. If you want some pretty decent action and blood and guts and gore, check this one out. I suggest renting it though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated (....at least on Amazon)","review":"This is a movie with excellent potential, yet it doesn't quite 'hit'. For one thing, Mel Gibson's war general accent seems totally fake. Especially given the way his character is portrayed. Character development, although attempted, turns out to be weak. Perhaps this is related to the fact that the fighting dominates the movie. In fact, the fighting sequences are the one part of this film that's great. Obviously director Randall Wallace wanted to show the non-stop killing and unrest, but he does so at the expense of the rest of the story. Also, the subplot of the wives back at home is interesting but poorly placed. Wallace jumps from brutal killing to the peaceful wives in a way that seems obscure and awkward.Perhaps I was hoping too much for another Saving Private Ryan or the like but instead its more of a detached experience of explicit brutality. Worth a watch; not the buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utterly boring movie for war junkies only who don't like plots","review":"No attempt was made to make this movie entertaining. It's two hours of shooting Vietnamese soldiers, over and over again. I've seen TV movies handle this sort of material better. What a shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unrealistic and annoying - one slow motion kill after another","review":"There are hundreds (at least it seems that way) of deaths shown in slow motion.

I think I would have loved the movie had the problems did not exist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simplistic and poor quality","review":"It seemed like a whitewashed film from the 40s in many ways. The acting was mediocre and Mel was not at his best or second best or third best. A flat film with lousy camera action. I am surprised at all of the 5 ratings,"},{"rating":"2","title":"As close as we'll ever get to being there.","review":"This movie is surprisingly accurate. All the way to the type of weapons, gear,and uniforms used by both sides. The battle is, for the most part, portrayed very accurately. All of the actors turned in strong performances. Even the Vietanmese translation was good (my mother is Vietnamese, she checked for me). This is probably the most accurate and best movie showing the early part (or any part) of the Vietnam War. Highly suggest this movie to war movie buffs and history buffs. The book is also a good read and gives even more detail."},{"rating":"2","title":"Home Run","review":"I really wasn't sure what to expect with Mel Gibson playing this type of role. I should have known better. Mel Gibson's portrayal of Hal Moore is absolutely the best. He shows that in order to be a true leader you must put your men first and always have their best interests at heart. Moore/Gibson shows that he truly cared for his men and contrary to a \\"by the book\\" leader, he took a very personal interest in getting them all home. They were his responsibility and he made sure that he was the first person in harms way and the last person to get to safety.Kind of funny...in a way this is a love story, not about the kind of love between a man and a woman but rather about the love comrades in arms have for each other, the kind of love only they can truly understand. Warriors don't fight for flags or countries, or ideals...they fight for their buddies. Worth every penny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really 4.5 Stars","review":"I believe that this is one of the all-time best movies about the Vietnam War. I read the book after I saw the movie and the movie did a pretty good job of following the book (although the movie did add in more of the story about the families). The only thing that bothered me about this movie was the ending. I think that there should have been either a commentary or a little paragraph at the end explaining that after LZ X-Ray there was trouble at LZ Albany and maybe even a list of those that died in that Ia Drang battle. But otherwise a truly touching story on the Vietnam War."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vietnam....they finally got it right for this movie","review":"Having watched war movies for the last 40 years...this one takes the cake. Finallyyou get the feeling how its really was....Political inteference and other stuffmade this war very hard on our guys.And by having being around the time that the war was happening you could see thenews were not giving us all the information. Now after seing this film, wenow have that information....its was brutal.Recommended and a keeper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mel Gibson's Finest Performance","review":"This is one of the best films made about the VietNam war; a brilliant script drawn from a brilliant book. The action is breathtaking and the film also cleverly puts us into the social consequences of the war - what the wives of the soldiers went through. I was left with a deep respect for the soldiers as well as their families. The criticism that the film is sentimental fails to take into account the first premise that the war is about people, combatants and families both. This film's innovation is that it shows that war brings challenges and pain on and off the battlefield. This film succeeds on a range of levels, but it is Mel Gibson that makes this film really special - his performance is just brilliant. Forget 'Braveheart', great film as it is - this is Mel Gibson's finest performance in a film. This is a GREAT war film and I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"We Were Soldiers (Widescreen Edition)","review":"I was happy with the Widescreen Edition.

This album definitely covers most of the hits (and most of my favs) from way back in '88 (\\"10% Dis\\" and \\"Paper Thin\\", to name a few) on up to '96 (\\"Cold Rock a Party\\" with Missy Elliot). However I am a little disappointed that \\"Lyte as a Rock\\" (title track from her first album) is not a song on the album. That had to be at least one of the songs/videos that put most people on to MC Lyte. (Yeah, maybe they could have added as a bonus track Positive K and MC Lyte's \\"Excuse Me Miss\\") If you don't already own all of the albums, or even if you do, add this to your cd collection.

The only excuse for not owning this album is if you can't stand harsh vocals. Even then, you should listen to it and get used to it.This album is very fragmented and there are a lot of things going on which is part of what makes it so good. At the same time, you have to listen to it holistically.The only downside to this album is that it's divided into 61 tracks when fewer could have sufficed. The main problem with this is that when you rip it to your computer, it is quite difficult to put the pieces together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been good","review":"This album is really strange. 60 something tracks...Most of which are useless sound effects which could be an intro to a song.

The album itself was supposed to be the soundtrack to a movie that was never made, but even without the movie ever being produced, \\"Death's Design\\" gives us 20 dynamic movements that defy a single genre. While each movement may change direction, it still retains its consistency by being a successful make-believe soundtrack, not unlike Ulver'sPerdition City.While Diabolical Masquerade may be no more, it has surely ended with a powerful swansong that captivates the ears."},{"rating":"2","title":"The riddle of steel for Basil Poledouris.","review":"I will not go into depth about how awesome this album is because a lot of other reviewers have already done a good job. This album has remained one of my favorite avant-garde black metal albums since it was first released.I just wanted to point out that Basil Poledouris wrote the music from track 30 to 32, the 9th movement. There are a few other songs on here that have been influenced by Basil such as Spinning Back the Clocks. I salute Anders Nystrom for being able to make a completely awesome cover of the Conan the Barbarian theme without even having to give credit to the original writer. I don't know how he got away with it, but job well done!With this album being virtually perfect in what I love about experimental black metal, it is a shame that this was the final Diabolical Masquerade album.Buy this album and go ahead and buy the Conan the Barbarian soundtrack, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Horace Brown: One For The Money","review":"Track Listing:1.

My favorite part was when Jacob left the ghetto because I felt he was better off living with a Polish family. On a scale from 1 to 10, I'd give it a 10.

Then Alex (a Polish man with a wife and two two kids) decides to hide him. Jacob has two brothers David and Shalom. There are many problems but in the end it all turns out well. Read the story to find out the true story of Jacob's rescue. It is a very good book about World War II and the Holocaust which lasted from about 1939 to 1945. I liked the way it was always exiting and kept me on the edge of my seat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jocob's Rescue","review":"I thought it was very interesting and I would read it again.

The interaction in the game is great and allows the user the chance to do lots of different things, such as loading coal into a truck or connecting gears in the proper sequence to enable a crane to remove a disabled train from the tracks. It encourages critical thinking from the child while providing hours of fun. The graphics are very bright and colorful as well.

Now think about how small each black and white picture must be when there are 4 to each page. Yep, 2x2 and when your line of vision is seeing 8 (both pages) at the same time, it's difficult to focus on one individual block. I really dislike the black and white pictures. I know adding color would change the look of the block, but they all just seem to blend together without color. There are a few color pictures for directions. I'm not saying I won't use it, but I doubt I'll use it often."},{"rating":"1","title":"Instructions Not Included!","review":"This book is for very experienced quilters only, in my opinion. I didn't see instructions regarding how to sew the various block parts together to make the block.

The problem came when I started trying to make the quilt blocks in this book. The first two I tried had incorrect measurements, but were salvageable. The third one I tried was so distorted that there was no fixing the pattern, and I had to end up re-designing my whole quilt into something totally different. I'm keeping the book for ideas, but I'll be checking elsewhere for measurements.I would recommend the Around The Block series by Judy Hopkins.

A day at the park through several different people's eyes? Sounds like a fantastic idea for a book right?Well, this book screws it all up. It is difficult to do a good job with multiple perspectives when no one perspective is done particularly well, and this book runs the gauntlet from boring to confusing to just plain bad. The writing is not particularly strong, which only adds to the drawn out feel that the book has by about 50 pages in.A day at fenway is something most people remember for years to come, hoeever \\"One Day at Fenway\\" is overly forgetable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"I love baseball, and I love this book!

I was going to buy it without browsing (my standards for baseball books are fairly generous).But I decided to thumb through it; and I'm glad I did. The book is profoundly flawed. It's simply written and lacking substance. It reads like the sportswriting in the NY tabloids- mindless and reliant upon truisms and conventional wisdom- an expanded version of the drek I stridently try to avoid. If you're at all educated in the history, traditions, or science of baseball, read what's available on the internet, or, if old-style writing is more your speed, wait for a \\"New Yorker\\" in November. Skip this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is a must read","review":"The author does a fantastic job of capturing the many nuances of Fenway that make her so unique. I was particularly interested in reading about the Red Sox executives and their passion for their team - as fans. As casual fans, we often forget that baseball is more than just a business to the many officials within the sport. We at home often criticize the many decisions that they make, yet most do not have any comprehension of how complicated the business of baseball is. Kettmann does an excellent job in bringing this out to the reader. As another series gets under way between the Yanks and Sox, I feel like I have a deeper understanding of not only what makes this rivalry the best in all of sports, but also what makes rooting for the Sox in Fenway so special. Kettmann and his crew of reporters deserve to be praised for their spot-on coverage of old Fenway. If only they can make Shea seem half as interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Book","review":"The book is a boring and poorly written tale of a single Red Sox game.

Apparently, however, it does matter if you are a fan of any other team in MLB because I thought this book was awful. It was written with the sophistication of a 7th grader on the short bus and had about as much insight as a rock.

This album captures a true worship event and is not impressed with itself, although given the roster of talented musicians it could easily be.There's nothing original to this album (the arrangements are somewhat original) except the one studio track \\"Purified\\" - good song but probably not a congregational piece. But the creativity and musicianship still abounds as does Michael's excellent leadership.

But the collaboration of Gerond Davis, Amy Grant, Out of Eden, Philips Craig and Dean and others, combined with live praise and worship, has created a very special musical experience.Don't be alarmed when you are playing this at home or in your car, and you're singing along to these wonderful songs, and the Spirit of the Lord begins to fall and you find yourself praising the most high God, long and loudly.Let it Rain!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Transported","review":"This CD is one of the best worship albums I have ever listen to and it transports me to a place I can not put into words."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"This is a wonderful album!

Listening to \\"Let It Rain\\" under the circumstances had a powerful effect on me. I cried out to God, not in fear, but in praise. Unlike Lili, the spirit of the Lord felt while listening to this CD grows stronger with every song. \\"WORSHIP\\" is wonderful, especially \\"Let It Rain\\" and \\"Awesome God\\". Michael W. Smith and those with him have once again shared the talents they were so richly blessed with to inspire and strengthen others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worship our Awesome God","review":"This is just an awesome CD. I have enjoyed the music of Michael W. Smith for years, but he was never one of my favorites. This is such a departure for him though that it really kindles a fire in anyone's soul. Recorded in a large open church as a live concert this recording captures people as they are truly worshipping the Lord.Live recordings usually turn me off because there is an abundance of background noise, but that was not the case with this album. There was no problem hearing the music or the vocals. Smith makes a few comments between songs and there are times when the audience's cheers can be heard, but they are at the appropriate level so as to add to the music and not detract form it.Why 5 stars?:This album is a beautiful recording of people worshipping the Lord and it will make you want to do the same. My favorites are a cover of Mullins' \\"Awesome God\\" and \\"Open the Eyes of My Heart Lord\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you want real praise and worship....","review":"I was totally surprised at this album. I have owned several of Michael W. Smith's other cd's but have gotten rid of them because they tend to be on the rocky side of Christian music. My friend bought this cd, and I listened to it several times over the last two days, and I absolutely loved. It is praise music all the way. The cd's give glory to God and although some of the songs may seem like they were a little staged, the whole cd is very moving and for anyone that likes praise music and Michael W. Smith, I would definitely recommend it. It is one of my favorite cds."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of his best ever","review":"I was fortunate enough to be in Lakeland, FL for the recording of this album and I think it's one of his best yet.

Live worship CDs are obviously the current bandwagon and it's too bad MWS jumped on...this is a really mediocre effort that falls short of what we've come to expect from him. The pieces themselves ARE powerful, if you consider the lyrics of praise to the Lord. But, musically, this CD really isn't anything to write home about...it's lacking real punch that makes it sound different from the Maranatha/Hosanna worship CDs with which we're all familiar. Too bad, because he is such a talented musician and lyricist...he should have considered expending his efforts into developing more original worship works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you kidding?","review":"I can't believe Michael W. Smith would allow something like this out with his name on it. If you are a devoted fan, the last 2 songs are worth having--the rest of the album is poorly recorded background music. This could be any singer. \\"Michael, what happened?!\\" Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"As dissapointing as winning the $3 jackpot","review":"I was so depressed after one listening of this that I put a hammer through my stereo. An unwise move in retrospect, but I did it, and I'm not looking back! You hear me? NEVER!As a Christian album, it fails at every turn. As an exercise in psychological torture, kudos Mr.Smith, you've pithed me beyond repair."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a joke!","review":"This alumb is stupid! MWS has no right to make this alumb! On this album he is using his religion to get to richer than he already is, he already has enough money to get that manison he lives in. He also made it because he knows his fans are like sheep that they will follow him to the ends of the earth and buy anything that has his name attached to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The BEST Worship Album","review":"Wow! What an album - if you're looking for worship that gives you goose-bumps all over, then this is the album.People who've heard it when I've been listening all want to buy the album - without exception. I listen to it wherever I can, in my car, at home, and even at work - it's a great way to start your day by putting you in touch with God.I certainly didn't go wrong with buying this album !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Was there a mistake?","review":"I finally decided to enjoy the Michael W Smith - Worship album I purchased last February. The disk SAYS it is the same album as the cover but it is not. The jacket says there are 13 songs. The actual disk has 5 tracks - it has three of those songs and maybe a fourth but I don't recognize it. The fifth and last track on the disk is a chapter of a BOOK!! \\"Chapter 16, Unfailing Love - Love Never Fails\\"I tried a couple different players to be sure my computer wasn't doing something strange. I even tried different parts of the tracks to make sure the songs weren't in a medley format. Nope.This is supposed to be \\"Used Like New\\" Someone ripped someone off somewhere. I suppose it's too late to return and I only paid $3.99 for it but what a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"package looks correct but content wrong","review":"They sent me the wrong cd. the cover & front of the disc look correct but the disc is different. It only has only 5 tracks and only 2 songs are even Michael W Smith. I spent $7.98 to ship 2 day to have the product arrive in time to use for my worship event. Learned my lesson...buyer beware. Seller is listed on receipt as HUAHAI MA but has \\"Master DVD\\" as storefront on website."},{"rating":"1","title":"My first disappointment, what happened?","review":"It was as if my cd was completely erased and then burnt over with only five songs vs. 12 and the fifth song was somebody talking, he sounded like the president. This was my first and so far only disappointment. The songs were not even by the musician. Sad situation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I ordered!","review":"I ordered this CD on Amazon and when I received it, there were only 5 out of the 14 songs shown on the back cover. When I loaded the CD into my iTunes - the title shows up as Come together and worship not Worship. One of the 4 songs that are actually on the CD is actually a spiritual talk rather than a song. I think Amazon sent me the right cover but the wrong CD inside. Since I ordered it in November and had a friend bring it to China for me, I can't return the item. I wish Amazon would send me the correct CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Joyful and uplifting!","review":"Simply said, Michael W.

I received Worship as a Christmas gift from my mum. From early Christmas morning I was making this music snort. It has some of the best worship music I have heard and I thrive on this type of music. Michael W. Smith draws you in with him as he abandons himself in total worship which is so contagious. I was moved to tears by most of the songs but I loved especially, \\"Above All.\\"I would like to invite all Christians who might be having a hard start in their worship lives to buy Michael W Smith's CD, and move along with the flow. He makes it easy for you.May God continue to bless him and his family and of course his music. Well done!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A WONDERFUL CD","review":"this is one of the best compilations of worship songs i have ever heard, i couldnt believe how one artiste could bring these songs so alive, if it wasnt for michael w smith i would never known that someone had recorded these songs before, saints i must tell you this cd MUST BE apart of your collection and might i add that on purchasing this cd ensure that you invest in a really good component set or radio of the highest quality to get the tremendous effects these songs have got to offer, take this cd whereever you go, listen to it on the way to work, back from work, when doing the laundry, washing the dishes, when your feeling low when your feeling great, ITS THAT GOOD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome inexpensive gadget!","review":"I tested these out shortly after ordering them and man, I don't know why I never knew of these before! I use a large knockoff dg bag as a diaper bag,it has metal circles at the ends of the strap, I slide these so conveniently through those and snap onto my stroller. I keep em attached to my bag as opposed to the stroller; in case I'm using a shopping cart instead of the stroller, I already have them on my bag so I can easily attach to the cart.I think these are a must have item for any new mom..it def lightens the weight off your shoulders a bit!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Why aren't these available everywhere?","review":"These little things are fantastic!

Songs were stage edited a bit which I don't really like it. And most of the songs in 'In Blue' were to pop for my taste. It doesn't sound too natural to me. The show could have done better with another approach. But it's already in the past, so there's no need to argue.Nonetheless this is a successful for most of the fans. The sisters dressed pretty.

Like listening with two paper cups over your ears.The levels are all wrong. The sound engineers need to remix. Maybe you can tweek your sound system and get better performance.

Of course Amazon is sending a replacement, so that issue is solved. If you wonder why I didn't get a refund, well once on it fits exactly and ALL of the cut outs match the phone perfectly.I wanted an inexpensive pink cover to support breast cancer awareness.

With a typical Celtic mix of joyful praise and reflective worship this album is fun to listen to and entertains the presence of God. This blend is hard to find and so should be considered a treasure both to those who love Celtic music and those who love Christ."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite celtic worship cd!!","review":"I give this an AAA++++ !!! I have a good number of Celtic and worship music cd's in my collection, but this is my absolute favorite; it is a good blend of both, with wonderful musicians and singers!

I wish I could find more music this great!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Problems with this paper","review":"I've used this paper before with success, and it's often the least expensive paper option for A3+ prints. All good. But some some major flaws with it became apparent recently when printing night shots and reproducing blacks. Dark, black hues come out with a very odd metallic sheen to them, with a noticeable yellow/bronze color when the print is viewed at even a slight angle, which ruins the print. Thought at first it might be a bad batch of ink, or a printer/software issue, but the same photos, same settings, come out fine on 13x19 paper from other suppliers, and fine on even other HP paper (11x17). Very odd, but I'd be careful with this paper when using it for prints with lots of blacks."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst movie I've ever seen.","review":"I belong to a bad cinema club (only 4 members) and we have, without reserve voted this the worst movie ever. Wayne Crawford makes Pauly Shore look like Sir Lawarence Oliver! The script is horrible, the acting is awful... It just plain stinks. If you only have 2 hours left to live watch \\"Jake Speed\\", it will seem like 10!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining Action Flick","review":"Being a big fan of both 80s movies and adventure series like The Destroyer, I'm surprised I only recently discovered this movie.Wayne Crawford is Jake Speed, the hero in a series of action novels. Unlike Remo Williams and Mack Bolan, Jake Speed's books are based on his real adventures. If there's an easy way to solve a problem, Jake will look for a more exciting alternative. Makes for a better story.It seems the story and locations may have been affected by a limited budget, but this is a well-written and fun story. Mark Snow did the soundtrack - finally on CD!If you've ever enjoyed The Executioner, The Destroyer, or any of the action-adventure serials, buy this DVD. You'll find yourself watching it more than once."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of their better eps","review":"I'm Waking Up to Us is a fantastic ep if only for the last song, Marx and Engels. Marx and Engels sounds as if the song was written in their glory days. Longtime fans will love the reference to \\"a thousand meals being made on Saturday\\". This song has Stuart Murdoch's genius phrasing of the vocals much like past classics. I'm Waking Up to Us takes some getting used to but proves to be very good as well. I Love My Car is crap - sounds like one of those Stuart David songs when he was with the group. Cheers to Belle & Sebastian for another great gift to the music world."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Belles Have a Ball","review":"I love Belle and Sebastian when they are wistfully cynical. Then again, I love them when they are fun-poppy-retro. Here, they are a little of both. Good stuff. I'd buy it, if I were you."},{"rating":"1","title":"The slow-motion decline of B&S continues","review":"Once again, as with \\"Jonathan David,\\" we hear the band going through the motions. The first two songs show a newfound and inexplicable affection for brassy George Formby English dancehall songs. The music is a poor fit with B&S, and the lyrics are not worthy of them; the songs tell no story, set no mood... in fact, they don't do much of anything, other than show the dangers of misguided experimentation.On the third song, \\"Marx and Engels,\\" as on \\"Jonathan David\\"'s \\"Take This Carriage Clock...\\" we get a hint of the old, pre-compromise B&S: literate lyrics melded with a catchy melody and sterling musicianship. It's a shame this isn't enough for them anymore. Apparently, Stuart is bored; perhaps he, and the band, should call it a day."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book","review":"I have to give a lot of respect to the Dr. for having written this book. I was no where close to understanding the life of this wonder amazing prophet may God bless him and may peace be upon him.

I bought this CD for the song \\"Halo\\" which is the best song on the album, but I'm pleasantly surprised with the rest. Obviously, being nu metal, you're not going to hear Kirk Hammett-style solos, but the riffs are heavy and straight-forward. The vocals are strong, can't really compare the singer to anyone, maybe Phil Anselmo from Pantera but more throaty. One good aspect of SOiL is that they don't fall victim to the \\"every song sounds the same\\" syndrome. No song sounds the same, though only a couple are as strong as \\"Halo\\". Nu metal fans should pick this up immediately!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Underrated","review":"This CD is one of the most underrated rock outputs of the last 5 years. After seeing the band live and actually feeling the strengh in songs such as \\"Halo\\", \\"Breaking me Down\\", and \\"Unreal\\" you gain a whole new appreciation for the band. I can sum it all up in s short words: Buy this CD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Soil?","review":"...All it took was for me to see the video for \\"Halo\\"...

It is worth your money to get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soil is amazing","review":"Ive see this band live when they played with Ozzy and I was so impessed I bought there album. \\"Halo\\" is easily one of the best tongue in cheek anthems but it doesnt just stop there. There isnt one filler song on this album. Each song after the next just rock brutally. The standout songs to me are \\"need to feel\\",\\"wide open\\", and my personal fav \\"black 7\\". Soil and Audiovent are easily the 2 best metal bands in this otherwise talent-less scene. Buy this album you wont be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Old style rock in a new style band.","review":"In today's rock world, it seems every new band is either nu-metal or angst-ridden grungish metal, but Soil are bucking that trend and creating a refreshing brew of heavy riffs and infectious lyrics. \\"Halo\\" is a song that you'll swear you've heard before, but despite its catchiness retains a garage-metal feel to it. Their tracks flow well from one to another, but alone sound like they could be from several bands. This will be their calling on future albums, it seems, and I can't wait until they're able to harness all of their amazing talents...I've already been blown away with this release. Rock/metal fan? Pick this one up right away."},{"rating":"2","title":"great sound!","review":"i must confess, when i bought this record, i was expecting some boring wannabe nu-metal band who doesn't have any unique sound. as i have learned from past experience, i'm wrong about a lot of things, and this is one to add to the list. this band has the best sound i've heard in a very long time. it's not nu-metal (thank god) and it's actually MELODIC, which is something that i look for in modern hard rock bands, not just mindless screaming which, believe me, gets VERY old VERY fast. all in all, good job guys, you proved me wrong, keep up the good work, i'm hungry so i'm gonna say C YA"},{"rating":"2","title":"just plain awesome!","review":"Ok so I heard Halo on the TV and I though it was pretty good and I went out and purchased the album thinking I would regret it. Then I listened to it and it was unbelievable! The songs are all heavy and catchy as halo is. Some of the other good songs are breaking me down and new faith. IF you like mudvayne or slipknot get this cd soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best disks in the last few years","review":"Soil have managed to break the barrier that the \\"rap-metal\\" and screaming morons of typical rock bands have set up over the last few years. This album resembles a combination of pure metal, death metal, and hard rock, with hints of grunge thrown in for good taste. The lyrics aren't the typical \\"I hate you, die and leave me alone\\" kind either, as Soil's lyrics tend to get more emotional in songs like \\"The One\\" and \\"Unreal\\". And of corse, there is the amazing single \\"Halo\\", which will satasify any rocker, regardless of what kind you listen to. Even nu-metalheads will enjoy this disk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Even more of the same","review":"Just another band that couldn't write an original song if their life depended on it. STAY AWAY! Very far away if you like diversity in your music."},{"rating":"1","title":"THEY RUINED THEMSELVES","review":"Whether you know it or not Soil used to have possibly the best vocal/guitar combo ever. They originally had Serj Tankien & Daron Malakian both of which are now with System of a Down. I've heard some of their underground stuff that featured Serj and Daron and it was about 500% better than what they put out now. Without Serj and Daron Soil is ungroovy and seing them...just proved that point even more."},{"rating":"1","title":"enough!","review":"I think I heard this CD in 1989!

Although, he is very straight forward,witty, and entertaining, I had already read most of what hehad to say. Dunne has wonderful commentaries on the American Justice System and how it relates to the American Society, but,again, all rehash. And why was so much of this book dedicated toOJ? Haven't we heard enough of OJ already? After reading selected chapters, I put this book down and am now reading another wonderful book, A Reason To Live, by Billy Hills andDale Hudson. It, too, is about victims and the faults of the American Justice System, and written as well as Dunne's book, only it is new, creative and fresh material. Sorry, Mr. Dunne,you are a good writer, and one of my favorite authors, but youdespearately need some new material."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the read even if you don't hold his views","review":"I gave this four stars due to the entertaining readability of the book. However, I take many exception to his views on the O.J. Simpson case. He believes that the criminal verdict was a race-based decision. As one who watched the trial from beginning to end, someone not of the same race as the defendant or the majority of the jury, I was offended as I came to the same conclusions as the jury (although I agree the deliberations should probably have gone on longer.) Also, for someone who was very offended by anonymous letters to Judge Ito, it seems to border on hypocrisy when every other page seems to have a reference to someone whom he quotes, yet says he can't or won't name. Other than that, I found this book to be very interesting. As a true crime fan, I can highly recommend the book as a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivating Reading","review":"As always reading anything by DOMINICK DUNNE, one is left with many feelings, some settling and some unsettling, but you always feel something. His passion for what he does is evident on every page. As a long time follower of the author's work going back to the sequel to \\"The Users\\", \\"The Winners\\" I have come to see so much of the author in many of his characters and stories. This is a man who has had not the easiest life, but is someone who, in the twlight of his life has made one of his greatest successes. I for one, feel that I am enhanced and enlightened by the author, and I suspect there are many of us out there!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Same Material Bound Up In A Book","review":"From my rating you would never think that I actually enjoyed the writing in this book and thought it was a good read. However, it was almost all rehashed material from the work he writes for Vanity Fair.Reading this, I felt like I was watching a TV show where the writers couldn't come up with enough new material for the show so they do a flashback episode where about 10% is new material and the remainder is previously shown material. Dunne did the same thing here. No new crimes or material to work with, need a book, so crank out the old with a few updates on where the cases have progressed to.In addition, much of the material was very dated. I don't think there is much left to say or know about the OJ trial, yet about 1/2 the book was related to that case. Yawn!Save the money and take it out of the library if your a Dunne fan, otherwise skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Name Dropping and Fame Seeker","review":"If you're looking for a fluffy read about celebrities and true crime at it's most shallow, this is an interesting read. But there are no insights, and no deep revelations. The author was painful to listen to for his shameless name dropping. He gave me the impression that his career has been spent trying to cozy up to the rich and famous to bask in their glow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book - Great Read","review":"Dunne's new book is fascinating and difficult to put down. It is a collection of stories he wrote for Vanity Fair, covering the trials of O.J. Simpson, the Menendez brothers, and other cases.My only complaint -maybe \\"suggestion\\" is a better word since the book was so good- is that he should have included a timeline and synopsis of each case. The stories make sense only if you really followed the case.I think everyone would not have a problem with the OJ chapters, but I got lost on some of the other cases while reading his stories. He should have put the dates his stories appeared, so the reader can see where in the timeline of events the story fits.Other than that, I thought it was a great book. Dominick Dunne is eminently interesting, and I love the way he writes. He would be a great dinner guest!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cautiously enraptured","review":"If you've read anything else by Mr Dunne (books, magazine articles, etc), this book will definitely match your expectations. There are clear insights into the machinations of the justice system and the information given to us as potential \\"jurors.\\" Detail run aplenty, however, some of the cases run through four or five chapters....just a tad excessive. The reader needs to remember that the bulk of this book is taken from letters/articles written for another medium, consequently the book often doesn't read like a \\"novel\\", but as something much more intimate. If you've never read Dunne before, don't start with this book....try one of the earlier ones and then return here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reads a little too gossipy...","review":"Briefly interesting, but after awhile it begins to read like a syrupy tabloid. Also, as the narrative went through the murder account and trial of Dominick Dunne's daughter, I couldn't help but think, why didn't the author do more to keep his daughter away from this convicted criminal? Maybe I missed something, but he was in the know that his daughter was involved with a convicted abuser: why didn't he do everything in his power to bring his daughter back away from this creep?Anyhow, as for the rest of the book, I really couldn't care less about individuals like Claus von Bülow, so the text tended to drag."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dropping names and opinions","review":"Dunne is a hack when he tries to discuss the criminal justice system. His opinions are obviously not always incorrect, but he reveals a lot of misconceptions about the law and trials. His biggest asset seems to be that he knows and is known to many wealthy, famous or whatever individuals. One gets the impression that he is a groupie of both criminal trials and the rich and famous and inflates his own status. This collection of articles varies from really poor to average in intelligence and content."},{"rating":"1","title":"Names galore","review":"The man cannot string two words together without name dropping. It is disgusting and so is he."},{"rating":"1","title":"repeat stories","review":"Ok, I am aware that this is a compilation of previously published material but at least a hundred pages of this book were also published as Fatal Charms in the late 80's. His daughter's story, von Bulow, and the Bloomingdale mistress- all great stories and that magical Dunne prose but it's a bit thick the second or third time around. So for example the von Bulow story was in VF, then Fatal Charms and now in Justice. I read VF each month only for Dunnes wonderful column but I was disappointed at the repeat material."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing book","review":"This books is very disjointed and never caught my attention, despite my devotion to true crime accounts (and a Dominick Dunne fan usually). Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"BIG DISAPPOINTMENT","review":"I am a fan of Mr. Dunne. Now that has been established, I gave this book one star because approximately half of it is about O.J. Simpson, and I've heard it all before, watched the trial....old news!There are fantastic stories in this book, but I kept getting the feeling that Mr. Dunne was grandstanding a bit. He mentioned every expensive restaurant in LA and NYC where he'd dined with this person and that person. Who cares?When I heard Larry King talk about this book, I thought it was for the most part a book about the Menendez brothers. I have not read much about their story, so I ordered it on that assumption. Well, we all know what ASSUME will do to us. So I will take my share of the blame. I ended up skipping the last half of the O.J. extravaganza because of boredom, and went onto a great story from much earlier that I liked. It was new news!I hate to give any author one star, especially one of Mr. Dunne's ability. There was just too much O.J."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ego Trip for the author","review":"This is a very boring book replete with many references of the famous people the author knows, references to his many exclusive trendy restaurants that he habituates, and the MGM airline that only famous people like him can travel. As far as the crime material it's the same old stuff that he's churned out time and again for Vanity Fair articles. I wish I could get my money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much OJ; just rehash of Vanity Fair articles","review":"I read anything by Dominick Dunne. I find his novels (usually based on real crimes) to be fast paced and interesting. This book is just a rehash of previously written Vanity Fair articles; which I didn't know when I got it. I enjoyed reading the stories of his daughter and the Menendez brothers, but living in LA, I was really tired of how much OJ there was. I also got tired of reading about Michael Viner and Dove Books. Too many names listed and all of their connections, which took away from the storyline."},{"rating":"2","title":"A factual account of the major trials","review":"This is a MUST read for any law student.It is also great reading for all the trial watchers.Too bad Dominick Dunne is no longer with us to continue his excellent work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dunne","review":"Yes, he is gossipy but in many ways that raises him above others. Any one who likes true crime will love his work. I think that he has experienced such things he speaks with the a personal insight that only the person who has experienced the pain knows ho to convey that in written form"},{"rating":"1","title":"Name-Dropping at its best......","review":"I've admired Dunne's work in VANITY FAIR, so I was really looking forward to a true crime work by him.As far as I could tell, the entire purpose of this book was for Dunne to name drop, from Betsy Bloomingdale to La Comtesse de la Farge (I made that last one up). No crime or investigation was complete without Dunne letting the reader know whom HE knew who had a big name, and how much that person admired him. I am a huge fan of true crime, and I found so little of that in this book that I was surprised it was listed as such. If you love true crime, I would recommend you NOT buy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting and Entertaining","review":"This is a collection of articles that appeared in Vanity Fair on some of the biggest crime stories of the rich and famous. This is not a series of \\"whodonits..\\" Instead Dunne weaves the tales of the people and personalities involved in each case. From the Menendez Brothers, to OJ, Claus Van Bulow, and Michael Skakel, we see the people behind the facades. Very, very entertaining pieces.Much of the book centers on the OJ Simpson trial. I am sick of the OJ trail, but I found these articles interesting. Especially worth reading is how Dunne describes the culture of Los Angeles and its elite through these revealing articles. So even if you're tired of OJ, you'll likely find these pieces relevant and interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too much O.J.","review":"Mr. Dunne devotes way too much energy and space to OJ Simpson. I paid for a 337 page book, yet only read less than half of it. I just flipped through the middle part about the OJ trial. I will admit that I was glued to the tv during the trial, and yes-I bought two of the better written OJ books-I didn't want a third, and that is what I got. The Von Bulow trial, and the Martha Moxley case were much more compelling yet they seemed to be a minor part of this book.I do like Dominick Dunne's writing, but I wish that he had given equal time of some of the other trials."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Stale Helping of His Previous Work","review":"I have never read Mr. Dunne and thought that I would enjoy his fresh and unique perspective on recent criminal trials. Unfortunately, all of the vignettes have been previously published in Vanity Fair and little or no effort has been made to update them for subsequent developments. As such, anyone with more than a casual interest in the subjects (Menendez, OJ, Safra, etc.) will have already heard 99% of what he has to say. His prose is somewhat cumbersome and the celebrity gossip and relationship details where he has genuine insight and access are often presented in a confusing manner. Mr. Dunne could have written a much better book had he updated and critiqued his previous work, accounting for new events or noting where his original opinion had changed. Unless you are fortunate enough run in his social cricles, or else your name appers in print on its pages, you are better to leave it on the shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"I bought two, one worked well for several days then no amount of shaking produces any light.

Like most soap opera plots, it's corny and ridiculous and has many holes, flaws, impossibilities, etc. The acting is also horrendous as is the script, loaded with corny and laughably bad dialogue horribly delivered by the actors.

Mr. Quarta is one of the few people in the world who can play Paganini as Paganini should be played: powerfully sublime yet delicately refined. This recording is a must for any serious classical music collector. My only slight complaint is that \\"Il Cannone\\" (Paganini's violin) was not used on this recording since Mr. Quarta has used it on his other marvelous recordings of Paganini Concertos. The violin he does use on this recording is without exception a beautiful Stadivari \\"Marcechal Bertier-ex Vecsey\\" from 1716 which has impeccable timbre and is a great contender to the \\"Il Cannone\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Game Ever","review":"When I bought yhis game I was not impressed it was hard, but after I got the hang of it it rocked.

I think that's one the stong points of the plot, the search for a home, the return to their true land and all of the hardships that must be endured to accomplish this task.

I feel like I'm taking part in a movie with the great music, voice overs, and cut scenes. The engine graphics are just amazing! I'm finally seeing the true power my of pc!With that said, I do believe I will be playing Homeworld for quite some time. There's so much to do and explore, it really is a great game. If your one to try new games without all the hype, give Homeworld a try. It will change your whole attitude towards RTS games. Starcraft just doesn't seem to have any feel now after playing Homeworld.Game of the Year bundle: The music CD is great! As for the Prima guide, it's as bad as all their other guides.

The reviews are usually too long and don't spend enough time covering the disadvantages of games. Plus,there's a bias in that many of the folks who write a review are those who seem to have had a positive experience. I played the first six missions of Homeworld. The game is interesting and has potential, but I found the user interface to be terribly awkward and cumbersome. I played the game \\"Starcraft\\" and loved it. As for Homeworld, I learned the rules and all, but it didn't seem like much strategy was involved -- just seemed like a matter of building more ships to kill the enemy, and then working the controls to get your ships to go where you want. My advice is to play a demo of this game before forking over the cash. If you like this stuff, then great. If the user interface becomes less cumbersome, then I'll probably buy future versions.

I've heard of starting young but that is unbelievable. This collection of different sexual encounters wasn't erotic. It was just plain sex.

While the awful fishy smell from the bag does attract a number of flies and trap them, there are still a whole lot of other flies buzzing around outside of it. There don't seem to be LESS flies around because of the trap, but MORE because of the trap.Yes, it's kind of fun to see the captured flies crawling around inside, but when you think about it, there are billions of flies out there. Trapping 100 of them isn't going to make much of a difference. Personally, I'm going to try to find a way to repel them, rather than attract them!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"This product smells bad, so you should place it upwind of where you will be. Within a month the fly trap was full. I bought more bags after that. There were far fewer fly problems after we started using these."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would give it zero stars if I could","review":"I overnighted two of these to deal with a crazy fly situation in my apartment. They didn't catch one fly. Not one. What solved the problem? Good old fashioned fly tape.

After a week, nothing but the stench of the unit. It was disappointing. The sticky hanging traps worked 1000x better than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stinking good product","review":"This product really does the job well. I have never seen so many flies congregate around something. It kills thousands of flies. The only drawback is the odor. I can never leave it up the maximum 30 days that it says because of the smell. So, when I can't stand it any more I take it down and put a fresh one up which doesn't smell that bad until about a week. This fly trap is easy to set up and take down. The odor is the only reason I took away one star. This product really does kill flies!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Attracts the Flies","review":"We live near dairies so the fly problem is quite the challenge. Even these bags can't keep up but I'm not sure anything would. The smell isn't bad if you place them down wind and away from doors / windows. Have found these to be most effective when placed in areas that attract flies anyway: garbage cans, yard area where pets, etc. Because the fly population is overwhelming, these can't keep them all away but without them, the problem is much worse. Handle carefully, fill and place according to instructions, and they will fill with flies...nasty!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome fly catcher","review":"The product does what it suppose to do, catch flies. Our neighbors our quite dirty, they leave their dogs waste just out for dayssss, monthssss, its quite disgusting so the flies goes to us and we have our backdoor open of our three little dogs throughout the whole day because yea know they have to go outside too. With the use of this fly catcher it significantly reduce the flies that goes to our side. Just for a warning it does smell bad, so just hang it somewhere far and where you usually don't walk too around your backyard. So the smell shouldn't really be a problem, you can't smell it unless your super close which you shouldn't be anyways unless its time to put water and throw it away. hope this helps someone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not get the Horse Fly","review":"I bought this specifically try to trap and kill a horse fly that hangs around our deck and boat. The thing stinks like a very poor outhouse. I did see many small black flies inside, but I never saw the horse fly. Little rascal can't figure out how to get rid of this nasty horse fly. So, I guess if you want to catch little black flies this might be OK."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unclear directions","review":"For 7.63, this product is overpriced for a plastic bag with some sugar water in it.

Like rotting flesh, to be exact. But that's what flies are drawn to. If you have a location that's fairly close to an area you want to clear of flies, yet downwind, you're in luck!

It's simple, powerful information that not only helps you to realize that you deserve happiness but shows you a fool-proof way to develop the habit of feeling joyful despite whoever or whatever. Rather than merely giving readers a pep talk, Mills gives an easy formula. It sounds too easy and like it takes up too little time to be effective, but it actually works!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Mellow, But a Bit Thin","review":"I'm embarrassed to reveal that until now I thought that all the recordings I have that feature a group named Gamelan Semar Pegulingan were played by the same ensemble, and I attributed perceived differences to changes in personnel over an extended period. But this disc, missing the sometimes clangorous climaxes of the discs I own, led me discover that Semar Pegulingan is a style not a moniker.For the benefit of neophytes, a gamelan is an orchestra of metallophones, sometimes abetted by flute, percussion or voice, that performs as a single instrument. Javanese gamelan is more ethereal, but those from Bali like this one are generally more aggressive and percussive. This group is an exception to the rule; more mellow and relaxed. This is most expert and enjoyable playing nonetheless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huh?","review":"\\"Huh?\\" about sums up this rather silly book. The extremely brief summaries of the more notable Celtic saints is plush with legends that no critical, modern mind could put on a level above fairy tale.

I didn't mind but was a little taken back I should have known that this was just the start of my disappointment. The story is really bad edited.

The people who criticize it have no clue what they are talking about. They probably cant even make a gmae half as good as this. Better yet, they probably cant even make a game. Believe me! This is a great game. I'm purchasing it from Amazon because i played it alot at others homes but I never owned one. When ever I get a chance I play it. So, now i'm gonna buy one just for me and i'll end up playing it 24/7, but my family will also most definitley buy it. THEREFORE, THIS IS A GREAT GAME THAT EVERYONE WILL ENJOY. AND IF ANYONE TELLS YOU OTHERWISE TELL THEM THAT IT REALLY AND TRULY IS GREAT. AND BY THE WAY.....THERE IS LIKE NO GLITCHES AT ALL.

My sister and I play it constantly, it's a little (okay maybe a lot) addictive. We also wonder how they came up with these families, its a lot more fun to make your own customized family, you can even make yourself one of the players. Also, who did they survey, all they say is 100 people, but boy some of the answers (and questions for that matter) they come up with are well, to say the least, a little strange.

When the teams are tied at the end of a round, the \\"virtual Louie Anderson\\" still gives a message that indicates one of the teams is winning. This game needed a little more debugging before it was released to the public."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as bad","review":"I agree with the other comments, but still find the game good to play. PC versions of TV game shows translate well, and like Wheel of Fortune, Millionaire, and Jeopardy which I own, I find the PC versions much more challenging.I have yet to see the real TV show with Louie Anderson, but he does a good job on the PC. I remember the original TV version with Richard Dawson. I think that would be a hoot if they put him on the computer, especially when he kisses the women."},{"rating":"2","title":"Survey says...superb!","review":"Family Feud, just like the Wheel of Fortune and Jeopardy! games from Hasbro Interactive, is simply excellent. The gameplay and sound effects are just like the current incarnation of the TV show. The animations are flawless. The option to create your own family is unique and produces reasonably good results. Louie Anderson is tolerable on this game, unlike the TV show where it sounds like he is close to screaming. Overall, it's a game I thoroughly enjoy and would recommend to anybody interested in purchasing it.I will offer these 2 caveats to anybody thinking of purchasing Family Feud: 1. If you have a slower computer, the game can act sluggishly. It was slow at times on my laptop (366 MHz, 32 MB RAM, 2 MB video card) while it ran flawlessly on my desktop (600 MHz, 64 MB RAM, 8 MB video card). 2. The full install is a gargantuan 600+ MB. While this shouldn't be an issue for consumers with newer computers, it is still worth noting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Family Feud","review":"Family feud has good graphics, and it almost matches the game show exactly. I like how you can create your own family right down to every feature on their face. The game itself is fun to play by yourself or with someone else. One downside is that much of the time you use playing the game is waiting for the next question to come on. It takes too much time playing videos of louie anderson talking. It would be more fun if the game went faster."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"The greatest songwriter you've never heard\\"","review":"The title is not an exaggeration. Townes Van Zandt's work has been cruelly overlooked. He has written some of the most starkly beautiful songs you are likely to hear. This UK compilation features all of the major songs from the first phase of his career, including the relatively well known \\"Pancho and Lefty\\" and \\"If I needed You\\" Townes was a classic Texan songwriter, you can hear echoes of Hank Williams in his lyrics (although Townes does it better) and Lightnin' Hopkins in his guitar playing.

This is very much in the same style as Gary Larson's The Far Side except with a bit of wishful violence.If you like this genre of comics, you must get the classic \\"The Official I Hate Cats Book\\" and \\"The Second Official I Hate Cats Book\\" by Skip Morrow. They're even more like The Far Side style, with a lot less (or no) words, and a lot funnier and more creative. Another book called \\"101 Uses for a Dead Cat\\" by Simon Bond.

This one is particularly aggravating as the book is interupted every third or fourth page with editor's notes which were apparently intended to be removed before publication and weren't. Also, when are these editors going to learn how to edit and not rely on spell-checkers. Lastly, someone should teach these editors the difference between \\"then\\" and \\"than\\". I thought they taught this gramar rule in grade school, but most eBook editors seem to have missed this class!I hate to give this book a one star rating, but the editing errors in this book were the last straw.The book, without errors, deserves a five star rating, and yes I will continue to buy and read Mr. Bidulka.If you correct the editing errors in this book, I will gladly adjust or delete this review."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my kind of book.","review":"It was intended for college used and was not my kind of book personality.

What keeps this CD from being rated 5 stars is that there is not much variation in tempi. Otherwise, Scott's ability to get inside a ballad and make it his own is exemplary. The title cut, for example, is the most moving version of this song I have ever heard and I think is the strongest cut. Charles' piano complements and, in fact, comments a bit on the lyrics and there is some great byplay between the vocalist and pianist. The stereo mix is a bit extreme (The mono mix might present a more coherent image, but you might lose Charles' piano, by himself, out in the left channel).This is thoroughly enjoyable and it's great to see it re-released."},{"rating":"1","title":"sad, sad, sad","review":"This ...!! The new song is terrible. The band was and will always be the line-up on 'Voracious Contempt' and the godly 'Extinction of Benevolence'.

This is terrible!!! The new singer is awful and they just got another new singer to replace the guy who sings on this 1 new song. They were the gods of Long Island back when Hobbie, Miola and their amazing singer Frank Rini was in the band. How anyone would want to stay in a band w/egomaniac and poster boy for narcissism guitarist, Chris Pervelis, is beyond me. I saw them at the Roxy all the time and this guy thought he was the coolest and turned out to be a backstabber and talked crap about other bands and even band members, Rini and Hobbie when they left to pursue better things in life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please end the band!!","review":"I bought this recently and rated their disappointing third cd recently.

This is the book I bought for my father to help get him started. With it's many photo's and step by step instructions, you'll be creating your own masterpiece in no time. Aside from being a great how-to book there is also wonderful information on: the history of decoys, how to use them effectively, and the love and enjoyment of spending a day on the marsh hunting over your own decoys. No contemporary carver can rely on one source of instruction or reference material, but this book ought to be in your arsenal if you are serious about carving hunting decoys. This book does lack somewhat, in full color reference material. There are other books with this information available. All in all a great book, especially for the beginner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kiroro excites!","review":"One of my best friends is a foreign exchange student from Japan, and when her parents sent her the newest Kiroro CD, I was unsure about listening to music in which I had no idea what they were saying.

There are both beautiful ballads and dance songs. I promise, Kiroro does not disappoint!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unrepentent fornicating priest as hero, could it get worse?Y","review":"Don't waste your time.

The book is simplistic, predictable, and boring. Do not waste your money or time on this read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Richard Paul Evans at his best!","review":"This is a tale that is classic Evans. It is an inspiring story of life, love and loss. It is a story that makes you look at the perceived obstacles in life. Are they really obstacles and stumbling blocks, or are they really building blocks. The Carousel begins with a decision of a couple to marry secretly, at a very young age as they both begin their journey towards their own goals. The secrets they are forced to keep and the feelings they hide work against everything they thought that they wanted. This story wraps itself around every emotional chord and touches your heart with truth and honesty. Although Evans creates a very simple tale, it is by no means simplistic. It is probably the simplicity of his writing that makes The Carousel so wonderful and inspirational without being \\"preachy\\". It remains in your heart long after this book has been tucked back onto it's shelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful book!!!","review":"I am a single man soon to be married to a woman with three children.

Soliva had the misfortune of being a contemporary of Rossini, Donizetti and Bellini. In my opinion this opera is the equal of any of their works. Both the individual voices and the choral voices are absolutely superb by any standard. Since I am partial to female voices I will single out for particular praise Elisabetta Scano. But all of the others are equally good. Anyone who loves opera of the early 19th century will love this work."},{"rating":"2","title":"mc solaar is unbelievable the way he just hypnotizes you","review":"Mc Solaar is the first rap artist out of France to really make people take notice. the cd is out of this world."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite rap albums of all time","review":"This album, along withJazzmatazz(which MC Solaar starred in), is the closest thing that will come to hip-hop perfection. The best tracks are \\"Obsolete\\", \\"Dévotion\\", \\"Séquelles\\", and in my opinion, \\"Temps Mort\\". Many of the songs blend jazz elements and early hip hop-style beats, which creates a unique and pleasant listening experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gotta looove MC Solar","review":"MC Solaar is one of the best French rappers and this record is awesome. In general, Solaar's lyrics are critical without being self-centered whining, too often the case with rappers. This keeps it interesting. Also, the lines are so smooth that you will enjoy it even if you don't speak French. Apart from the musical qualities, Solaar uses a big vocabulary, making his catalogue good passive language training.This early disc is a little less cerebral, and a little less produced than his later efforts, for example the great Chapitre 7. It has a certain intensity to it that really moves. I recommend this disc in addition to chapitre 7, his latest, and Paradisiaque."},{"rating":"2","title":"MC Solaar is ILL","review":"I had heard Solaar a few times as a kid while travelling in France and remembered liking his music. So recently, on a whim, I picked up Prose Combat. I was hooked after just listening to it once and had to share my excitement for this album with all of my friends. Solaar flows like no one else and the music has a smooth, sexy tone to it. It passes over the harder beats and powerful hooks of much American hip hop for a slicker, jazzy nightclub feel. It conjures images of a smokey Parisian dancehall with a sultry crowd. It is the first album that I've bought in a while that I just can't stop listening to. Solaar's mellow flow makes him perhaps one of the best MC's I've ever heard (although I can't comment on the lyrical content as my French is poor). Check out Solaar if you get the chance..."},{"rating":"1","title":"PURE TRASH","review":"Anyone who invests money is this CD needs to be admitted to a MENTAL WARD...the only reason I gave this WACK project 1 star was because that was my last option...he conveys in french, and I can see why, because he's not saying anything worth listening to...SOLAR NEEDS SOME SUN...when TRASH day comes, make sure Solar is a part of it...once you go WACK, you neva come back, lol....this CD is a REAL SLEEPER (ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best ever rap album!","review":"This CD by MC Solaar, which I discovered accidentally, is my favourite rap album ever made. The poetry in rap is definitely more intelligent than that of most American rap artists. If you take the time to understand it, you too will be impressed by the beauty of French rap. MC Solaar is, in my opinion, the greatest French rap artist and was copied many times."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Important Reflection On Life","review":"This modest book is the light at the end of the tunnel on an issue rarely addressed. Dr. Thomas describes the force of shame and its place in the makeup of our bundle of emotions. Judging from the text style one may assume a lack of erudition on the author's part, but this is put to rest once you digest the substance of this neglected issue. To put it simply, this book was not intended for the Mental Health establishment,-where issues gain or lose credence by forced criteria alien to promotion of true Human needs and interests - rather, a sympothetic recognition of this topic to the public at large is the readership-target. Aquaintance with the author's humility attests to the sacrifice of scientific fame for the sake of knooledge for all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting!","review":"I like this DVD because the assertions it makes are refreshingly different (to me at least), while still making sense. Some of the stock footage they used while telling stories was either cheesy or didn't fit the story as well as could be, but the stories and theories themselves were interesting enough to make up for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Short and to the point","review":"I recommend this DVD. I disagree with only a few small points, but overall, that we are being visited by aliens, and that they have evil intent, I agree.

I'm no closer to understanding the film after reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a memorable effort.","review":"The author attempts some clever story-telling devices with his life-as-imagined-on-video technique,but the gimmics get in the way of the narrative.

From that amazing opening sequence with the Addagio for Strings music throughout the rest of the game. Everything about the game was revolutionary. Game play and intense storyline. Which is why I was greatly disappointed with Cataclysm. Cataclysm didn't invoke any sentiment and failed to completely draw me into the story as did the original. The Catacysm story is a complete waterdown compared to the original. The possibilities in ship building and technologies becomes limited compared to Homeworld. The game is a complete step in about every aspect from the original, except for some nice surrounding graphics. I was very very very very very very disappointed with this. A definitive second rate sequel. I wish I had never heard of this sequel, worse yet played it. I recommend sticking to the original Homeworld. This one will only mar the memory of the original."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Strategy game since starcraft","review":"Best Strategy game since starcraft!

The storyline definately needed improving along with the horribly robotic sounding voices. The additions to this game (like support modules and science modules) were the worst. A word to the wise get the original, it is one of the best games I've played. Sierra, I know you guys can come out with more levels and stuff for the original come on!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad...","review":"I purchased this game with thought that it might have a wider ship diversity, and was totally right. There are tons of new ships and different weapons/upgrades. This is a slightly better game compared to Homeworld. Some things that are worse is that if your gl link(I'm computer literate and don't have a clue what this means) is non-compatable and you aren't using a windows 95/98 computer you have to download a patch from the sierra website, do this anyway because it took me about 4 hours of messing around with the game before I found this!! Another thing is if you like using the multiplayer and are using the Beast ships you are totally outgunned. I've gone into a battle with 12 ion ships and 2 heavy cruisers against a Dreadnought and lost every thing but the cruisers. Other than that, it is a great game and I can't wait for Homeworld 2 to come out."},{"rating":"2","title":"The absolute best","review":"Don't be fooled by the fact its older.

Get this game!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo","review":"I loved the origanal so I had high exspectations. The graphics are phenominal, but the gameplay sucked. I finished it in a week. Unlike the original that took me the whole summer.

Shouldn't have done that.)And so far, I can't even get the game to play. I installed and uninstalled twice. I have downloaded updated drivers for NVIDIA GEFORCE FX 5200 128meg video card. I have changed all of the settings over and over again. And still can't play. I see the beginning story in the aftermath that follows the end of Homeworld, of them rebuilding. But as soon as I see the ship fly in on the first cutscene, I get kicked back to Windows.My recommedation is if you have XP, don't get this game. So far, it's more trouble than it's worth. So now I guess I will try Homeworld 2."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun?","review":"I just have one thing to say: this game is as fun as you can throw it underwater with your wrists chained to some wall. Also, the interface and mere gameplay feels like an act of congress (looking up how to do things in the manual!) To be frank, don't by this game even if they would give you money in return!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Insanely Addictive!","review":"What do you get when you combine flawless real-time strategy, gorgeous graphics, a wonderfully intuitive interface, perfect balances, and insanely addictive gameplay? Well, my friends- The answer is simple- Homeworld: Cataclysm. The strategical depth of this game is so intense, that the experience is far more than the sum of it's parts. 17 Single Player missions force you to use different tactics in every mission. You can't just waltz in and blow everything up. You MUST use the proper mix of ships to ensure victory. The Multiplayer is practically a game on it's own. I've spent many hours playing online day and night. I've even joined a clan to maximize my playing pleasure. :-)Please, buy this game if your between the ages of -infinty to infinity. Trust me. You won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"good....","review":"It's easy to slip it into the rod and the magnets at the bottom comes in real handy. Moreover easy to wash.

I hated taking a shower in the dark before so this is great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Shower Curtain Ever","review":"This is the best shower curtain I have ever had. Super easy to hang and looks great. I love the net window at the top for letting in light. I would highly recommend this purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth Every Bit of the Price!","review":"I have had both of my hands, pretty much rebuilt, and as a result, I have limitations with regards to pinching and torquing capabilities, so as you can imagine, every time I had to bring down a shower curtain for cleaning or even putting up a new one,taking off and re-attaching the rings for the curtain became the chore from Hades! I did not look forward to that chore. So along comes the hookless curtain and OH MY GOODNESS! This curtain's design is a total wish come true for me!The color out of the packaging is actually lighter than what is shown on the picture here, a very light sage green. I love the color! The see-through panel is a wonderful touch, as it lets in more light and still allows for privacy. The curtain is so silky & flowing, it is hard to believe that the fabric was treated for water proofing, but the proof is in the pudding, as they say. Very pleased with my purchase!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I stayed at a Holiday Inn Express and really liked the shower curtain there, so I found out how to obtain one for my home. I was pleasantly surprised at the color options. The \\"hooks\\" are giant grommets to slide right over the bar. They don't look like the silver finish will hold up over repeated washings, BUT I am very happy to have a shower curtain I can wash.The magnets are strong at the bottom. Without needing a plastic lining, I feel less confined in the shower, and the best part is the mesh \\"window.\\" Water doesn't get out except perhaps a fine mist with a hard water pressure shower. You can see out very well, but it's more difficult to see in. This is great when my kids sneak in and interrupt my shower to ask me a question or 30. I can see them, but they can mostly only hear me. It feels more open-airy than a plastic lined shower. Love it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Product!","review":"This is a wonderful product and has some great advantages:1. Eliminates the need for a plastic liner;2. does not have that horrible plastic odor upon unpackaging;3. the see thru top area lets light in and you can see out;4. the liner shakes out nicely and dries quickly;5. we got the sage color and it is very nice looking especially with no hooks it slides easy.Anyone using the traditional type shower curtain will never go back once they switch to this product...it's great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not have snap on liner like the video shows","review":"The video showed that you could use a snap on liner with this curtain...which you cannot do. That was the only reason I wanted this curtain. So you basically don't use a liner with this curtain, it just sits inside your tub...which I think looks kind of funny. That being said...it seemed like it was made of good materials and the hooks seemed pretty strong. I did return it though so I could get a curtain with a snap in liner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Recommended!","review":"I love this shower curtain! it goes on so easily and looks nice and I especially like the sheer panel at the top so you can see out and it feels much more open and less claustrophobic."},{"rating":"2","title":"I WAS IMPRESSED","review":"I am hesitant when I order anything online but I was very impressed at this product. It is absolutely beautiful!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good curtain","review":"The color is right on and the curtain-window is nice because it allows more light from my bathroom window into the rest of the bathroom. The curtain window is high enough to maintain privacy but in a case like mine where having the window open and using the shower curtain for privacy while going to the bathroom: I feel like the rest of the curtain might be a little too close to transparent. It looks and feels good enough that I don't want to bother with a liner; I will just give it a gentle wash once in awhile.The hookless design is the best idea ever, in most cases. My rods fucntion fine for this & the rings slide about as well as my cheap old hooks did, maybe better.I suppose I almost want to comment that it's still a little expensive; but I don't think it is. I think, so far, it's a great buy at ~$25."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is exactly what I had been searching for!","review":"I have looked all over for a shower curtain that looks nice, and will allow me to see my kids - without allowing full view of the person in the shower.

When he finally got it in, the motor makes a very loud hum. He took it down and checked it carefully and put it back up and the noise is still there. I went to Lowes and bought another fan for him to put up and I'm trying to decide if I should return this. I thought it would be a better quality fan because it is a Hunter and I have ceiling fans all over my house - all but one of them a \\"Hunter\\" and none of them makes a noise like this one.Laura"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet","review":"This fan was easy to install and it is incredibly quiet. I would recommend it to any one who needs a good quiet fan It also has a balancing kit that came with it, we did not have to use the kit but it was nice to have it available. We purchased it for the kitchen where we needed it to be some what invisible and it blends in beautifully."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enough cooling breeze","review":"I bought this fan in 2011 for a 10'x12' bedroom in the southwest corner of the house. It replaced a 25+ year old four blade fan of the same size, but the new fan just didn't push enough air to keep the room comfortable in warm weather. The top speed on this fan matched the medium speed on the Hunter Quiet Breeze 44\\" fan I installed in another bedroom in 2012. I decided to upgrade to the 52\\" Low Profile fan, and its motor and five larger blades cool the room more efficiently."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very quiet, base does not meet the ceiling","review":"I breeze to install. Very quiet operation. You can barely hear it on medium or slow. The breeze it creates is just right for a sleeping on hot night.My one complaint is that the bracket which holds the base of the fan left about 5/8th of an inch gap from the ceiling all the way around. Why did they do this? It seems like it was designed this way on purpose, yet the bottom of the base has this netting to keep dust from getting in on the motor, so when it collects in the top it will be inside this base! And to get at it, will require removal of the switch connector and the blades. Not a huge deal but not trivial either.Also the wood what ever it is, has a vinnear of something that is not wood to give it the proper color/grain, actual walnut wood it's not. But it's up on the ceiling and once it was up there I can't tell.Anyway I'm keeping it but be forewarned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as advertised","review":"Purchased this item for four-season patio, based on it having \\"plastic\\" fan blades. It says this right it the product name as shown on Amazon. The fan blades are in-fact MDF, and will not work in an environment where any moisture or dew may form.I usually find Amazon's items to be as-advertised, so this is not typical of them. Unfortunately, this item is not and amounted to a waste of my time and money."},{"rating":"2","title":"GAP but quiet","review":"Just like the other reviewers said, there is a gap at the top of the cover and the ceiling if you do not have a huge hole. I may change this fan as the room evolves so I opted to get rid of the big bracket because I placed the proper box in the trusses while doing the remodel, so I was not worried abot the stregth of the mount. This means my gap is only a 1/4\\" but it is still there. I will find something to cover the gap and report back. Other wise its a Hunter, the name sells it, the fan is quiet and moves air. I am going to be putting more fans in over the next couple of monthes and will be buying more Hunters, maybe not this small though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hunter fans are the best","review":"I have a bedroom at home that I've converted into an office and I needed a small, low-profile fan. I bought another brand at one of the big box stores and used it for awhile, but it was way too noisy.

Unless you can cut an 8\\" hole in your ceiling dry wall and recess the ceiling mounting bracket 1/2\\" into the drywall you are going to have a 1/2\\" space between the top of the fan housing and the finished ceiling. This is caused by a poorly designed mounting bracket. The only other way to get around cutting a larger hole in your drywall is to purchase or make a decorative ceiling circle to fill in this 1/2\\" void between the finished ceiling and the top of the fan housing. I made my own, but that turned a 2 hour job into a 4 day event. Sometimes I wonder if the people who design these products have ever tried installing them. By the way, this fan is advertised as having plastic blades-actually the blades are made of MDF (medium density fiberboard). 4 stars instead of 5 because of the installation difficulties."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for Florida lanai.","review":"Lightweight and smooth running perfect for lanai ceiling that can't take much weight.

Her discursions are thought provoking, enlightening and diverse. It is almost as if the author invites you to join her on a walk, sharing with you her insights on human condition.

Perhaps some 60 yr old retired business man may enjoy this, but definately not the general public.However, it still has a good side.... starting shops, apartments, ect.. but that becomes boring and repetitive after about 1-2 hours. Definately not worth more than $5"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun for about 5 minutes","review":"The game is basically just no fun. You do these scenarios and then the computer gives you more scenarios to choose from. (similiar to RollerCoaster Tycoon, but that game was great) I bought it because I liked Monopoly and SimCity, however the game was not like either one. The buildings all look similiar, so it is not exactly eye catching. Plus, there is no way to play a game against the computer, unless you playing a scenario. There is no way to play the game that can be played over the internet, with the computer. The only reason I gave this game two stars is because of the internet play, which really isn't too bad.

If you do this DVD at least 4 times a week YOU WILL SEE IMPROVEMENT within 30 days, hands down. I give it 4 stars because of the off beat counting at times, but with Blanks new DVD Tae-Bo Cardio, much of this has been addressed and cleared up. You will workout and feel it, but at the end it is worth it. Also, KNOW THE TECHNIQUE before purchasing this DVD. If you do not, I advise to get the original Tae-Bo or Tae-Bo Live DVD's. These DVD's have the instructional section which will walk you through the technique. Many have complained of knee injury etc., remember when you kick you raise your thigh and extend your leg, do not just throw it out there, this is where injuries occur. And again, it is important to know the technique before jumping into any of the workouts, including the basic format."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just like most of the Billy Blanks lovers say","review":"These workouts are not as great as the original advanced workout (which eventually came out on DVD, I believe), but they're pretty good and much better than the ones on the boot camp Tae Bo DVD.

I still love him and find him charming."},{"rating":"2","title":"great! great! great! tough workout!","review":"First off, I fell in love with Tae bo years ago, but got into the gym. Now, I'm back into working out at home, and I love this dvd. As far as Tae-bo, this is classic Tae-bo, and its TOUGH!The 2 advanced workouts are about an hour a piece, and Billy is teaching you class style. It's live, and he gets carried away sometimes, but that's because of all the energy!I just love these DVDs. And they are definately for the advanced, not beginner. And if you've done the basic and think you're ready, do the basics back to back so its closer to an hour before you even begin these.Still some of my favorite at home cardio!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If you want to sweat and really feel the burn get this DVD!","review":"Kudos to Billy Blanks and crew. There really is no excuse to not work out to this dvd. The 8-minute work out is jammed packed with exercises to really get your blood flowing and muscles burning. Now I can get an effective workout in the morning for just 8 minutes and can do either one of the hour long exercises in the evening. I'm sure it will allow me to form a routine and see immediate results. Actually, after just one round, I feel empowered and encouraged to continue. I totally recommend this program to anyone who's pressed for time. I also recommend that you purchase the instructional and/or basic exercises to get familiar with the form before trying this advanced level.

I'm 34 and in pretty good shape (with the exception of the the small layer of fat around my waist)and this video makes me sweat. It's a great all around workout, combining cardio exercises to get your heart pumping and strength training to build muscle. One nice thing is that in the video he has real people with all different types of bodies. Not everybody in the video has a body like a model so it doesn't make you feel that out of shape and ashamed of your body.

This was aimless, unbelievable, and really not about LAPD or Rampart (superficially, yes), but about an unlikable character in a totally implausible story. Far better would be watch the series \\"The Shield\\" (amazing) or the Frontline PBS documentary \\"LAPD Blues,\\" all about the Rampart scandal.

No action really.I am just watching it and waiting and waiting and waiting for some action or thrill. But no. It is just about a copwho got hated probably by some guys and they pulled a lil accident just to get him in rage and kicking the guy in his guts. Just to tape that kind of cop brutality. Now whats happening? nothing really. Maybe I will see Woody in court real soon.Just seeing a cop walking around, talking and fxxxing around. Nothing else really.Not worth really to buy it.

E's writing has a style of its own, with a cynical wisdom that can penetrate your soul. Soul Jacker digs into the shadows and brings to light a series of songs that are sexy and provocative.Some highlights: Woman Driving Man Sleeping (Excellent!), Friendly Ghost (Fav), Bus Stop BoxerSome songs like That's Not Really Funny, World of S#it, and Jungle Telegraph are lush with experimentalism -- concoctions of overlapping sounds and quirky instrumentation that reveal a certain creative genius, something we've come to expect from the songwriter called E.A few of the songs veer into tedium (Teenage Witch, Soul Jacker partII ), but not at the expense of an innovation that sets E's work apart from the masses.A worthy addition to the Eels discography and must buy for his fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crazy sweet.","review":"Souljacker is a great addition to anyone's CD collection. The CD starts out with an interesting sound that seems as though it's gonna be a hard-rockin cd.

Take \\"Fresh Feeling,\\" for example, with the opening line, \\"You don't have a clue/What it is like/To be next to you.\\" Or the brilliant couplet in the disc's opener, \\"Dog Faced Boy,\\" where frontman E chants, \\"Ma won't shave me/Jesus can't save me.\\"\\"Souljacker\\" is exactly where rock music should be headed today.

Wanting a change, Eels changes their tune. And in turn, bores their audience.Rather than build upon their past intricate-pop success, Eels decide to amp up and rock out. Unfortunetly, Eels doesn't realize they are no good at rocking out. Here, they bring aboard some guy named Kool G. Murder and the result is limp and lazy. In fact, one of the few decent songs on the album (Fresh Feeling) actually samples from a song their OWN last album. How pathetic is that?Kudos to a band for trying out a new sound. But on Souljacker, they entered a musical arena where they simply don't belong. Neither satisfying to fans of heavier rock or fans of Eels. Souljacker is stale and starved."},{"rating":"1","title":"How does the author live with herself after writing stuff like this .....","review":"This book is about fooling someone you think is too good for you that you're better than you think you are.

In the end, as I saw it, it is about identity, the masks we create, the lies we tell ourselves and each other. In a way it isn't really about the internet.

I plan to use it almost daily to assist in my further weight loss, & I recommend it to anyone who is already on the road to fitness but needs that extra motivating boost.

Billy is supportive but can be a little repetitive in his \\"come on\\"s and \\"work it\\"s (which I find kind of funny :D).

So when they perform on stage they basically sound the same as our CD's we have of them. The only performance that they actually rap in this DVD is the 1996 MTV Awards and you can clearly tell the difference. But to Bone's credit that performance was hot because they actually did rap. If it wasn't for that great performance this would've got 1 star. And the backstage seens were short and worthless basically.

The dvd has nothing to do with bone (as in editing producing ect..) I think ruthless had made a great dvd , the clips are abit unbalanced because most clips are imported by fans across the world. Bizzy deliver's a stunning performance as long as lay and wish , though krayzie is abit quite while performing (if u have checked out there last video's u can tell his a quite person) Although there isn't much of flesh-n-bone (hes on the stage with them at times) but they never showed clips of him doing his thing like the other bone memebers.

The producers did a great job, Virtue did a great job, and GOD did a great job. These women did a great job on showing how beautiful God is.The songs I REALLY liked were: He's Been Good [original and remix], Great is thy Faithfulness, I am God [read the lyrics!!], Can't Believe, Gotta Worship, Till You Believe, Down on My Knees, and Something About the Way [a great song that turned a wordly message into a message about the love of God!].

However, I did find myself fast-forwarding through a few of the songs. Most notably, the ones toward the end-\\"I Am God\\". \\"Can't Believe\\" and \\"Down on My Knees\\"have to grow on me, so the jury is still out on these two songs. The rest of the album is bangin'. Virtue shows that the name of Jesus and tight beats do go together. \\"Till You Believe\\" is an excellent tune and inspires you to believe in the power of Jesus. \\"He's Been Good\\" and \\"Gotta Worship\\" are sizzling hot. I love these two cuts. Virtue did a wonderful job, the harmony is not as tight as it usually is, but they lost two members and picked up one. It will take a while for them to form the same chemistry they had on the former albums. Their harmonic blend is still something to smile about though.

Both of those songs featured the vocals of the late Terry Kath. Robert Lamm's \\"25 or 6 to 4\\" was an even bigger hit that featured a very strong horn arrangement, strong vocals from Peter Cetera, and one of the best guitar solo's of all time by Terry Kath. Other favorites include \\"Poem For the People\\", \\"Wake up Sunshine\\", and \\"Fancy Colours\\" which were all written by Robert Lamm. \\"It Better End Soon\\" I think was a strong political portion of the album that brings a message to the rest of the world.

It sounds like a copy of a really bad copy that was copied from a really bad copy. I urge anyone who is sincerely interested in owning this amazing album to get their hands on the DVD-A version. You will be amazed at how good the DVD-A sounds. It sounds like a fresh recording. This is because the CD was made from a really worn out tape, and the DVD-A is made from the original, better preserved master tapes. The fact that this CD and the DVD-A were released by the same company is one of the biggest anomalies I have come across in all my years of collecting music.Just to clarify based on some replies to my review; The sound quality comparisons I made go far, far beyond the expected differences in sound quality between the CD and DVD-A formats.

After that, maybe a couple of singles are up to snuff, but not much else.Chicago II represents the band when they were musically ambitious, daring, all over the map stylistically, and incredibly TIGHT. I still marvel at this record. The horn section is just too good, the drumming is just THERE, and the songwriting was never equalled by Chicago since.Too bad they finally decided to just let Cetera take center stage and sing mushy, sappy MOR ballads. I guess it paid the bills, but it was sure disappointing to those of us that remembered the band's early efforts.Forget about what Chicago eventually became.

When the album came out in 1970 I asked people: \\"\\"Why did they make this album sound like it's being played on an AM radio station through a cheap transistor radio?\\"\\" The problem is the two-track stereo album master of this great album is perhaps the worst album master in rock history. In 2003, the DVD-A of Chicago II was released and that DVD-A comes from the original 16 track multitrack studio tapes...... not the horrible stereo album master. The 16 track multitracks sound absloutely fantastic. They should just destroy the 2-track stereo of this album and release a new remix straight off the 16-track.

They aren't going to make any major musical statements or blow you away, but they make well crafted pop songs that are spiked with jazz influences. Chicago II is one of their best efforts. \\"Colour My World\\" is a sweet ballad with a beautiful, lilting melody and on the other side \\"25 or 6 to 4\\" is a rocker with a buzzing guitar. The most impressive part of the album is the musical suite from \\"Make Me Smile\\" to \\"Now More Than Ever\\" (which was side two of disc one on the original album). Songs slide into one another and the playing is effortless. The band combined the above two songs for a single release that hit the top ten as did \\"25 or 6 to 4\\". Chicago had a run in the 70's of five consecutive number one albums, but II which is arguably their best album, only managed to reach number four."},{"rating":"2","title":"Active Learning in the Foreign Language Classroom","review":"This book is an excellent tool for foreign language teachers looking to make the learning process an active one.

Although one wouldn't want it to linger much further beyond 72 minutes, the character development and plot resolution do seem rushed. In fact, quite a bit of the acting and interacting seems to be ritualistic, like the players are aware that they're making a noir picture, so that they must strike a certain stance or pose in keeping with the genre. Self-conscious noir doesn't work.I will say that the scenes in the vault itself are pretty tense. The final scenes in the bowling alley are just lame and ill-conceived.And again, everything gets sewn up in a tidy little package at the end - gangsters knock off other gangsters and get caught by the police.

This book corrects the situation and will certainly be the definitive work for years to come."},{"rating":"1","title":"Contrived Melodrama","review":"I had such high hopes for this novel and so was terribly disappointed when it turned out to be poorly written, over-the-top, soapy melodrama. As a women's college grad (and lesbian, as it happens), I thought the plot sounded marvelous. Then I actually read the thing and was horrified by the thin characterizations, the cartoonish nature of the characters, the gratuituous violence against women, and the unrealistic tone of the dialogue. Guess I'll have to write my college love story and see if I can make a better job of it! Avoid this book at all costs!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Other Girls Rules!","review":"Other Girls by Diane Ayres is brilliantly provocative. The pages flow like fine poetry and the content is absolutely titillating. This is not a book for the weak-kneed and our naive mothers but most definitely a must for everyone else. The authors style of writing is most engaging. I say, \\"Dare to be bold and let yourself get caught in Ms. Ayres's web!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Other Girls","review":"Perhaps I'm biased because I am a \\"Willard\\" graduate myself. I graduated almost 30 years after this book is set but a lot of the settings/campus attitudes are the same. The first time I read this book I was 19 and young and dumb and in love (not unlike the lead character, Elizabeth) and reading this book always takes me back there. I don't know if I would like this book if I had not been a \\"Willard\\" woman. I'd probably find it a bit ridiculous. Having attended WCW though, I can say without a doubt, women go crazy when there are no men and it is both wonderful and horrifying. I love this book, I find it interesting, nostalgic, emotionally compelling and generally a great fluff read for summer vacation. Is this a great work of literature? No. I think it's a funny, charming, and quick way to spend a few hours."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is unintentionally hilarious!","review":"Ayers is writing about her alma mater-- which also happens to be my alma mater. The college, its buildings, and even a few of its professors are quite thinly disguised, so for anyone familiar with the college, it's a hilarious read. It's badly written and the plot is a contrived romance novel, but good lord, it's really funny."},{"rating":"2","title":"give this CD a try","review":"I know this CD doesn't come from a big label and you've probably never heard of the artist, but give it a try.

Even though I don't like Bratz I still think it is harsh that parents bash Bratz. They also bash Myscene some-times too. Stick up for your dolls.

The story is entertaining without being gruesumely violent and the message the book delievers is hopeful and a true inspiration without being \\"preachy\\" or baised.

He provides a helpful overview of some of the core problems in our country and, unlike so many others, he offers creative and well-reasoned solutions to those problems.If Representative Gephardt's commitment to going to the source to learn the real story about problems in the U.S. and around the world were shared by others, our world would be much better off."},{"rating":"1","title":"A poor excuse for a political entreaty","review":"I guess you can't expect a fair review of a political book--you are either for or against the author's viewpoint, literary merits notwithstanding.I read most of this book in the bookstore as I waited for my wife to finish shopping. His politics notwithstanding, Gebhardt has to be one of the most uninspiring candidate-in-waiting writers with a book out. The prose is preachy and drags in many places...And his political viewpoint is tired and obsolete.It is quite transparent to me that the first two reviews below were either written by Gebhardt's wife, his aide, or perhaps himself.

How about some FRESH ideas?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Gephardt's \\"Better America\\" and Hitlerian thinking","review":"Sorry, but I cannot swallow this nonsense.In this book Gephardt brags about using guerilla techniques to win races. His idea is that if a candidate can't find anything good to say about what he is doing, invent some dirt about the other guy and spend your campaign dollars lying about the other person. Gephardt has recently hired a video photographer to harass Bill Federer. This creep goes around cramming his camera into Federer's face and trying to provoke altercations (or anything that looks like one).We need leaders with guts and wisdom, not 3-year-olds acting like babies running this country.This book is ideologically suited for those who wish to follow in the footsteps of Mussolini, not America.

I highly recommend this book to anyone who is trying to save for retirement. The book clearly maps out a course to follow to retirement wealth. I also liked that it wasn't all just numbers, the authors discussed the need for old fashioned values like honesty, determination and a good marriage. The examples that even people at the bottom rungs of the economic ladder can retire wealthy really hit home. I work with temp workers at my job from time to time and let me tell you, being poor is definitely a state of mind. None of them have a plan, all of them blame circumstance and all think winning the lottery is their only hope. I think this book is a must read whether you are scraping by as a temp or if you are making a bundle. Buy it, read it, live it! See you at the top!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Advice for the fearful!","review":"This book was terrible, maybe the worst book I have read on investing.

There is even a section warning you not to use drugs. Come on..... Don't waste your money.........."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique, effective approach showing how anyone can get rich.","review":"Most get rich books for popular consumption are based on gimmicks and raise false hopes among the gullible. Lee & McKenzie are different. They show how anyone, even low-income people, can gradually build a fortune without luck and without expert advice. They show how getting rich in America is a choice that anyone can make. It takes discipline, resolve, perserverance, and patience. It doesn't require any financial expertise or knowledge of the stock market. Every young person should read this book and follow its simple rules. It gives the lie to the widespread belief that you have to be rich to make money. It will build confidence in the free-market system."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Game!!!","review":"I bought this game beacuase my son wanted to play his Battleship game all the time but he always had trouble keeping track of his shots and either he or the person that he was playing with always got angry because things werent going the way they thought they were, LOL.

I also found the characters not very true to human behavior. In fact, all but one woman (and she was helpless) in this book was a total be-atch. The plot was very transparent and predictable. The best part of this novel was that it took place in Washington, D.C. and I knew of all the places he wrote about.

The first day of his new school does not go so well, Mr. Maxwell just thinks he is a spoiled lazy kid with bad posture but when Mr. Maxwell tells him about a Week in the Woods he starts to act good.

The cover looked great but the book was barely about the week in the woods. I read the whole thing to him and was bored to tears but finished it anyway.

I really liked this book because it shows how hard it is for kids to move to a new place."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good book","review":"I would recommend this book to a fourth, fifth, or maybe even a sixth grader, because firstly, it was a page turner, where you were left wondering what was going to happen next, because Mark is a very unpredictable character. I did enjoy this genre; a suspenseful, adventure, but it got a bit corny for me, being a 7th grader, because often times, I wondered if Mark was a stupid kid, in a very fake way. This is because you would think that he would have the common sense to do the right thing, but he does something so ridiculous, its fake. Such as not checking his compass at the worst time, even though in every other part of the story, he remembers. But, for some people, this incident might not bother them, and they may enjoy the story very much. Besides that, I thought that it was a very enjoyable story."},{"rating":"2","title":"i liked the book","review":"a week in the woods is based on a kid and his classmates going on a field trip called the week in the woods."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great story for the whole family","review":"Our family listened to this book on tape in the car.

I know my children were especially intrigued by how the main character dealt with his fears. It was a terrific way to pass the time on a long car trip."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Week In the Woods","review":"If you like adventure you will not be able to put this book down. A Week in the Woods is by Andrew Clements. The main characters are Mr.Maxwell and Mark. The setting is in New Hampshire and Mark's problem is that he is being accused of bringing a knife on a camping trip and in the process gets lost in the woods.In the beginning of the story Mark has to move to New Hampshire and goes to school thinking he was better than every one else. Next the whole 5th grade class goes to spend a week in the woods and Nick's teacher is not liking him very much. To see if Mark changes during the field trip, go get this book from your library.This book would be for 6-12 year olds boys who like camping.

We all know that gays have contributed much to ballet, but Nureyev danced with Fonteyn in the pas de deux from Le Corsaire. A gay agenda should not trump artistic integrity.

Although this was not my first Dylan CD, it is my favourite. As always the Byrds chopped out a few of the original verses, so on this CD you get to hear the entire songs.

The brooding mood escapes typical electronica lounge clichés and enters darkerterritories, driven by mid-tempo hip-hop breaks and haunting minor chords bass lines.Occasional vocals, whether dialogue or sung melody, play as the nostalgic protagonists on an abandoned movie set. The production quality is tasteful and slick and leaves enough free space between the listeners ears,to let the film play in your head."},{"rating":"1","title":"it is not the book about Winterhalter ! be careful, it is not this item.","review":"I thought it was a book about this painter (Franz-Xaver Winterhalter), a book with 240 pages.

They are not diapers and don't hold much at all so you need to change them constantly or they will leak all over the place.

Believe me, my son is 50 plus pounds and my daughter is 30lbs, not even factoring the little guy in. If I can pull them up and down hills...anyone can.

Happy kids = Happy Mommy! They can climb in and out themselves and are very content in it. I like that it folds up very compactly and quickly. It does seem sturdy and rides pretty well.Now for the drawbacks, it can be hard to pull in rough terrian (but strollers can be hard too). The sunshades are awkard to install and there is no place to store them. It can be a little hard to steer, but I've noticed that the more we use it the better it maneuvers. It is quite heavy, but it does fold fast and compactly.People often stop us and ask us about the wagon. My twins are 18 months old now and I anticipate we'll get many more years of use for it.

There was nothing that needed to be reworked about that: pace Laredo and Ward, it's still fresh and relevant.Further, Gilbert's rendering has the kind of spare grace that conveys the flavor of the original much better than Joseph Laredo's, arguably conveying, by means of its overall icy tone, Mersault's remote demeanor much more convincingly.

The Bostitch brad nailer combo did not receive very good ratings, but others had good experience with the Bostitch 2 1/2 finish nailer.

This is the first Bostitch compressor I have used, and I find it is quieter and smoother than our Porter-Cable and Devilbis compressors of the same horse power and capacity. This is the only small sized compressor I have seen with wheels. Although, they are small, I find they are very useful since I do not have to carry it.

Suor Angelica is my favorite of these three, and it was OK (not great), but Rosalind Plowright is NOT the ideal Angelica: VERY short on top (sounds like a mezzo, and Angelica needs a solid C) and one dynamic - LOUD.Gianni Schicchi was just embarassing. None of the singers were good (the young tenor was OK but, again, just LOUD all the time) and the acting was execrable. I've done this show a couple of times myself, so know where the humor should be, etc., and there was just. . .NOTHING. You'd think with Italian singers (this was recorded at La Scala, by the way) singing in Italian, the humor would come through loud and clear, but they might as well have been singing Swahili (and not understanding a word of it!).A clear disppointment to me - I'm glad to finally have a video of Trittico, but it could have been SO much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ditto JWALKER - What were you guys watching?","review":"I agree almost completely with JWALKER019. This ugle 1983 production looks like it was from the 1950's and Gianni S. is downright embarrassing. The costuming there makes everyone look absurd. Tabarro has little passion most of the time but the singing is good. Angelica is okay but it is not a part for Plowright and I definitely did not like Dunja Vejzovic as the Princess. It is great to have this opera on DVD but otherwise it was a big disappointment. No goosebumps here. I just finished watching my old tape from 1981 of the Met broadcast with Scotto in all three of the 1 acters. What a delight -- some weak points here and there but it has passion in spades and that's what these need. Scotto was incredible in Suor Angelica. We should be so lucky to have these performances released on DVD but that is highly unlikely.

The Pegasus Players mounted a production in a swimming pool at a local college. The production, with swimming singers and floating stages,was fascinating but hard to understand. It is a treat to be able to listen to these talented performers bring it to life on the CD and yes, the packaging is great. It's nice to be able to truly appreciate the lyrics by seeing them as well as hearing them. Nathan Lane is funny and over the top as always and the chorus is excellent. I think Fear No More is TERRIBLE, however. There's so much breathy, enormous vibrato going on that you can't even understand what he is saying!I had no prior knowledge of Evening Primrose and enjoy this music, too. Another reviewer used the word \\"haunting\\" and I would agree. I would like to see this video to better appreciate it.Overall, a very interesting CD and one that I find myself listening to repeatedly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definately Needed","review":"There are two reasons why I label this CD \\"Definately Needed\\"First of all it is the first time that \\"The Frogs\\" and \\"Evenign Primrose\\" have been presented in their entirety. Serveral of the songs have been swiped and used in other albums, but not all of them together.Secondly because this is one darn great album. You have the exquisite talents of Nathan Lane and Brain Stolkes Mitchel, along with Neil Patrick Harris ... . The way they perform the music is like it was written for them (like Sweeney Todd for Angela Lansbury).However, it is early and special Sondheim. If you haven't listened to something of his that is a little more excessable you may not have the stomach for this particular set of songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Evening Primrose","review":"I find the Evening Primrose here much better than that on \\"Dress Casual.\\" Firstly, because the two performers--Neil Patrick Harris and Theresa McCarthy--are both amazing singers. Also, because both of these performers are younger and thus, their voices are more \\"youthful\\". For this musical, in particular, \\"youthfulness\\" is important; Bernadette Peters and Mandy Patinkin are simply to mature to effectively do these parts. I find Neil Patrick Harris, in particular, absolutely superb, and his version of \\"Not While I'm Around\\" (on the NYP Sweeney Todd recording) is far and away the best I have ever heard (except for LuPone's dismal British accent). This Evening Primrose alone is worth the price of the CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmm...Not so sure on this one.","review":"I am a huge Sondheim fan. Don't get me wrong, but this is not what you think of when you think of Sondheim.The performers are fine. The musicians are fine. But \\"Frogs\\" is an amateurish, uninspired, and uninteresting piece of theater. Maybe it's just because I'm just listening to it on disc, but on this CD, it's not good. \\"Hymnos:Evoe\\" was a good song though, I must say, if only for the \\"Evoe...Alalai Alalai\\" section, which stuck in my head for days.The reason I give this even two stars is that the songs from \\"Evening Primrose\\" are decent and got me going at the end of the CD and that there are some moments in \\"The Frogs\\" that shine.If you're a Sondheim fan, I highly suggest you go with \\"Into the Woods,\\" \\"Company,\\" or \\"Follies,\\" which happen to be my favorites. The new recording of \\"Into the Woods\\" is especially enjoyable with Vanessa Williams as the Witch, as is the original recording with Bernadette Peters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can I sell it On Ebay!!!!","review":"Contrary to other reviwes posted I will tell you that the Evening Primrose on the Mandy Patinkin Cd \\"Dress Casual\\" IS the \\"Primrose\\" to own. This one was in my opinion under acted and undersung. While Mandy Patinkin is always over the tip, Ms Peters is one of the best Interpreters of Sondheim's works and the orchestration on this is much darker and deep, like the subject matter of the piece. I found this whole CD lacking, given that just like the \\"Dress Casual\\" I bought it only for the \\"Evening Primrose\\" selections. Thank the GODS for CD Burners so I can compile my own best of Sondheim CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"De Gustibus Non Disputandum Est - Re \\"Evening Primrose\\"","review":"I'd encourage the purchase of this CD just for the 'Evening Primrose' section alone. While there is naturally room for differences on the matter, the versions of the four songs from \\"Evening Primrose\\" on this CD are, in my opinion, the best. The versions that are mentioned by other reviewers are each wonderful and unique and it's usually pretty difficult to favor anyone over Bernadette Peters and Mandy Patinkin. But this version was done under Sondheim's supervision and Theresa McCarthy in particular is simply magnificent. So I simply propose this: get everything. Listen to them all. Compare and contrast. Enjoy them all. In order of preference, I recommend this CD - \\"The Frogs/Evening Primrose\\" (Theresa McCarthy & Neil Patrick Harris), \\"Sondheim At The Movies\\" (Liz Callaway & Gary Beach) and \\"Dress Casual\\" (Bernadette Peters & Mandy Patinkin). And, oh yes, ... nearly forgot ... I also recommend having the more recent CD, \\"The Frogs.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"The Frogs","review":"I truly enjoy this recording of The Frogs.

Look elsewhere for viable advice on protecting yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yikes","review":"An interesting way to review the careers of Scacchi and D'Onofrio, but otherwise, it's a no go. Long term adultery is not a sympathetic love story. It's hard to empathize with Georges (Scacchi), a woman who doesn't want to be the wife of a fisherman, but wants to bang him annually, for old time's sake. Gavin (D'Onofrio) portrays the traditionally female role of the seduced partner who then feels awfully, awfully bad about betraying the spouse. They are supposed to age from late teens to late middle age, but mostly D'Onofrio grows more and more and more facial hair. One becomes frightened of how he will appear at their next assignation. Of the two, he is nevertheless more convincing in the aging process, and in his final scene the beard is at last under control and practically believable. D'Onofrio looks very fine in his introductory scene, and Scacchi is lovely, but the story is unconvincing, overwrought and overlong."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great break from the \\"heavies\\"","review":"Spillane novels are a great diversion from the heavy history and political philosophy books that form the greater part of my reading list.

In a theatre world where the composers are losing interest in what musical theatre is, true a story with music, but GOOD music, not just music put to a tuneless tune, you have to have a tune. Larson remembered that, he wrote music that advanced stories and characters at the same time as making you tap your toe or close your eyes to feel the music. There are precious few of his stamina left in the world. We have the classic ones, SONDHEIM, KANDER AND EBB, CY COLEMAN, WEBBER, but no one today that will lead us to the future of American Musical Theatre. This CD, lets you know who was and is boss.

All of the songs just match with the Bohemian feeling so well. The song Therapy is probably my favorite because it is so confusing. I've been looking around on the net for lyrics to the CD and I was very disappointed that I couldn't find any. So I decided that I'd try to make my own. You should be able to find them by searching if you are interested. Anyway, the songs \\"Why\\" just makes me want to live the Bohemian life so badly. I think that any fan of RENT, or musicals for that matter, will definitely love this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spectacularly intelligent show","review":"The cast recording of Tick, Tick... Boom! is absolutely a standout. With the current status of Broadway shows, you would be hard pressed to find another show with as much wit, heart, intelligence, and talent as this one. Overshadowed by it's brash brother \\"The Producers\\", Tick, Tick... Boom! doesn't hit you over the head with humor. It's an experience more reminiscent of a long talk with your funniest but most angst-ridden friend. The recording is lovely and well performed and does as much justice to the show as is possible on a CD. Like Rent, this is a rock-inspired musical with tributes to pop culture, Stephen Sondheim, and the importance of doing what is most important to you. But even more than Rent, this show will remind you of how talented Jonathon Larson really was-- and make you wish he was still around to compose."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible","review":"I bought this CD because I needed some inspiration. I love Jonathan's music in Rent, I love the composition, the lyrics, the \\"score\\" of the entire show. It excited me to remember that another piece of Jonathan's creation was being published. Inspiration I found. \\"Louder than Words\\" cannot be any better, especially right now. The harmonies and vocals on this song are gorgeous, the instrumentals are amazing, the lyrics are beautiful and the song as a whole is inspiration. This song is not the only standout, however. \\"30/90\\" is a great, catchy song that proved to me I would love this recording after one minute. \\"Therapy\\" is a cute showtune and \\"No More\\" sounds like it comes straight from RENT. Raul Esparza has the perfect voice for these songs, and Amy Spanger sounds beautiful. I think I am in love with this."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Jonathan Larson's lesser-known works","review":"Tick, Tick... BOOM! Has many of the same themes and life lessons that you will hear in RENT. It takes place in Soho, and illustrates the life of Johnny, a playright struggling to find meaning in his life (hmm.. sound familiar). The music is great, a blend of musical comedy style and hard rock, and many of the tunes are dangerously similar to RENT's. But thats alright.. its great."},{"rating":"2","title":"truely amazing","review":"I'm a big \\"Rent-head\\" and I can't get over this show. Sadly, I have to say it's BETTER than RENT! I saw it in Boston a few days ago with Joey McIntire (not expecting it to be that wonderful).. but how could I doubt Johnny? This play was absolutly wonderful, and I had to buy the soundtrack. It's just as wonderful. I DEFINATLY RECCOMEND. It sums up life in this 90 minute, intermission-less play :)ENJOY!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Exquisite, Marvelous, and a little weird","review":"Usually when someone dies you don't expect to see new CDs popping up out of nowhere, but that is exactly what happened in this case. Jonathan Larson, the famed composer/lyrisit of RENT, wrote this musical long before RENT and you can see the concepts of RENT are right there. The musical, however, does stand on its own despite its larger, more publicised counterpart. The story is on the common side, but the music is indeering. In addition, Mr. Larson created a marvelous spoof of Stephen Sondheim's Sunday, Larson looked up to Sondheim and his works for insperation. You also get to hear Jonathan Larson perform one of his songs, and, at least with me, it'll make you cry; his voice is so pure and full of power and then you realize that the voice no longer exists."},{"rating":"2","title":"Uplifting and energetic songs you'll sing along to","review":"The actors on this recording have such unique, interesting, and listenable voices, especially Amy Spanger and Raul Esparza.My favourites that never seem to get old are: Why, 30/90, Come to your senses, Louder than words, Green Green Dress, and Johnny Can't Decide.I can't seem to tire of this recording."},{"rating":"2","title":"Precursor To \\"Rent\\"","review":"Though most people only know Jonathan Larson for his spectacular Tony & Pulitizer-winning \\"Rent\\", his lesser-known effort, \\"tick, tick...Boom\\" displays Larson's amazing & evolving talent. Like \\"Rent\\", \\"Boom\\" is personal - though the score is not nearly as strong.This 2001 Off-Broadway production (almost five years after Mr. Larson's death), starring Raul Esparza (\\"Company\\", \\"Taboo\\", \\"Rocky Horror\\") & Amy Spanger (\\"Kiss Me Kate\\", \\"The Wedding Singer\\"), sounds terrific and has several highlights:30/90Johnny Can't DecideWhyLouder Than Words"},{"rating":"2","title":"Larson Lives","review":"I love Tick, Tick... Boom! The show is quite refreshing. The show works so well with three actors. I LOVE \\"30/90\\" and \\"Louder Than Words.\\" Both speak really strongly to the audience because they both are really relatable to anyone's life. Admittedly the middle of the show drags a little, and Spangler's voice can be chipmunkish at times. However those are minor detractions when it comes to this show. It is especially moving if you know Jonathan's story. It is no Rent, but the short piece is really moving"},{"rating":"2","title":"enjoyable for non-renters, beautiful for renters","review":"If you know Rent, this is a fascinating CD, as it is obviously a musical step before the widely-known Rent. The forward by Larson's father is touching and explanatory. The two bonus tracks are also great, but the recording of the selection from Larson's one-man show is worth the cost of the CD alone. To hear his voice with his lyrics, which preceded both Tick, Tick Boom! and RENT, nearly completes the comprehension of this musical visionary that died too early."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great work by the creator of RENT","review":"I recently bought this CD, and have listened to it over and over. Its similar to RENT in the style and in the singing. You could almost hear Adam Pascal singing Jonathon Larson's part throughout the songs. I love this CD and the bonus track of Jonathon Larson singing Boho Days. I would definitely get this CD if your a big Jonathon Larson fan or just into Broadway Musicals. The songs are great, upbeat, and funny as you listen to the lyrics. This is a must have!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tick...tick...dud","review":"It's just not that good, people. Calm down. Far too derivitive -- all these songs sound like things I've heard elsewhere. Some of them, of course, I have. Larson mimics Sondheim's \\"Sunday in the Park with George\\" and even the theme song from \\"The Jeffersons.\\" BO-ring. Here are some lyrics: \\"I feel bad / that you feeling bad / about me feeling bad / about you feeling bad...\\" Gee, isn't that witty and clever? It's like, it goes around and then comes back and stuff. Like that.Here's my version:It's time that people in SoHo / Realize that people outside SoHo / Aren't that interested in SoHo / As are people in SoHo.Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"COME ON","review":"Okay, I must say I love RENT in all it's rock-opera-with-a-message glory. But I, unlike the other reviewers here, actually realize that just because Jonathan Larson is dead, doesn't mean I have to like this other attempt at musical theatre. The story isn't bad, but WOW are the voices shrill and awful. I can barely stand that let alone the truly lack-luster music. These songs aren't anywhere NEAR as catchy or inspiring as some of those in \\"Rent\\" and you all know it! Anyway, I do give credit to the late Larson for shaping his musical and lyrical tastes into something so brilliant as \\"Rent,\\" but in comparison, this show is just full of dramatical and musical flaws and, in my opinion, shouldn't have been put on stage until Larson could come back out of his grave and finish it the way he intended to."},{"rating":"1","title":"not received","review":"Unfortunately we are not in a position to review this product.

This movie could have been a good little low budget classic. So the script and movie in additon to not having enough money, was a huge factor.

There are little notches you have to then connect the bowl to which is surprisingly difficult. I had a system down after way too steep of a learning curve for a food dish... then I broke my leg. NO one that came to help me feed my pet could figure out how to do this even with my instruction.Then one of the \\"notches\\" in the dish broke and a week later the second one broke. Now I have to buy another dish but I will be avoiding this one.The only good thing is that it's a corner dish which saves room in the cage but it's not durable and ridiculous to put in. The little grip it has is also very flimsy even when installed correctly and my baby ferret was easily able to knock it down and over if he started playing with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hanging knobs break easy!!","review":"It's a great fit for the corner of my bunnies cage, BUT is not very durable at all! The little knobs on the hanging attachments wear and break off very easily, and all my bunnie does is rest her paws sometimes on the front while eating. I wish they sold replacement parts, or better yet made the attaching parts out of metal so they would'nt break off. Once the dish is down it's useless since it tips over easily, the only way to fix it is to buy a new dish and gauranteed it will do the same. I really like the way it saves space by being a corner feeder, but it's attaching design is the PITS and needs to be improved on!!! I am looking for another dish to replace it with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as sturdy as it looks.","review":"I bought two of these on Feb 15th 2011 for my new ferret kits. It was fine for a while, but as the male started to grow, he would stand in the water bowl and it would flip off of it's brackets under his weight. I ended up super-gluing the brackets to the bowl, which was a good fix for a couple more weeks.. eventually the plastic snapped beyond repair, and I had to toss the water bowl, and swap to a wide-mouth water bottle.The food bowl, however, is still alive and working well, four months later(after getting the super-glue treatment). So, I suppose it depends on what animal you have and how hard they are on the bowls."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lasted not even two weeks!","review":"I bought this bowl to use in my ferrets cage. I needed it to catch water from a slowly leaking water bottle. Not only could my ferret easily take it off its brackets, one of the brackets broke off completely within the first week. A few days later the other bracket broke off too. Now this bowl is useless since its so easily dumped over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Might work better in another cage","review":"I bought this thinking it would be perfect for my ferret and work well with my Ferret Nation cage. I was sadly mistaken. The little points of attachment seem to be suited better for a horizontal wire cage (Which the Ferret Nation cage is NOT)but it came with plastic brackets that are suppose to make the bowl work with vertical wire cages but it still didnt work well. It took considerable effort on my part to firmly secure it to the cage. And due to design flaws that are suppose to be convenient to you the ferret was able to loosen the bowl and tip it. Which lead to one of the attachment points breaking off after that the other point broke off 2 days later. In all it lasted 4 days! The bowl itself is a hard solid plastic but unattached it has only proven to provide fun for my ferret by being repeatedly flipped over and food scattered about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless in Kindle edition","review":"Why put this out in the kindle edition?

The author cites solid research to support the evidence that people learn in many different ways. For years people have been taught that learning is simply a cognitive activity. This book illustrates how other types of learning, such as emotional intelligence, compliment and interact with cognitive processes. Understanding, recognizing, and appreciating non-cognitive ways of learning is essential if we desire to empower people who are primarily non-cognitive learners."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pseudo-science","review":"When a religion book tries to be a science book, the result is torturous for thinking readers. This book is that. I happen to agree that we have multiple intelligences. Ms. DeBeauport does not pretend that any of them are unnecessary, yet she plays footloose with the rational intelligence when she traipses over logic and integrity. (In this I regard her book as common.) Her deductive reasoning is wonderful to follow in the introduction. To paraphrase, \\"I started with research, and I wanted to support my findings, and I found the usual rationalistic paradigm would not render them indisputable. So, I looked to the new physics and a lot of what follows is perceptible along non-rational pathways.\\" Sounds a lot like medieval deductive reasoning to me--just a different axe to grind.

This young Pharaoh and his mom-maybe 4 or 5 hundred years prior to the Exodus- took on the established and corrupted religiosity of his forebears(The Amon cult) to lead out in a monotheistic viewpoint in ancient Egypt. Did his beliefs, and original concepts lead to the theology of the Hebrews of Joseph and Moses? Perhaps. No one really knows, except possibly the God of Creation. The author espouses much of his own pieced together and most likely partial factual research, and creates a book which shares information and reaches some interesting and possibly groundbreaking conclusions. This is not the first book to come to these conclusions, but nevertheless, it is a tasty piece of perhaps eternal wisdom. \\"Aton\\" almighty!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An little known part of African American history","review":"I discovered this book while on vacation in St. Augustine.

The front and back covers round out the total number of 24 plates.The author provides instructions to iron the transfers to fabric and also a disclaimer stating that since most transfers are to be used more than once the ink will not readily wash out of the fabric and to cover all lines with stitches.Her stitch instructions are written to the more moderate to advanced stitcher because no how-to instruction is offered.This is a fabulous booklet to own; the designs are from authentic 17th wall hangings and not from one particular work.

Someone asked me to write a grant for them and I didn't know what I was doing. Robinson's easy writing style made what seemed like rocket science into something manageable. Most of all, he took the *fear* out of writing grants. Recognizing that the goal is to match funders' goals with the non-profit organizations' goals rather than the organizations begging and pleading at random made all the difference.

Even when my kids are having off days, I don't call them \\"Brats.\\" A lot of the responses to questions asked by people are curt and sometimes, I felt, harsh.Another question I wondered while reading this book is \\"If the author is so stable and had such a fabulous family, why did she seek out a shrink to begin with?\\" The fact that the shrink has ties to Freud is also a big caution sign to me.If you want a book on how to deal with kids and their crazy days, I recommend Supernanny.

What Marilu and Dr. Sharon consider to be \\"overindulgence\\", in many instances, I call \\"nuturing\\". They don't take into account that you can be a disciplinarian as well as respecting your children for who they are, even when they are young babies. It would be better to buy a comprehensive book on the different stages a child goes through by age since there is no one \\"right\\" way that guarantees good behavior in every child. Marilu doesn't have any real qualifications for writing a parenting book other than having two small children of her own. This is not a book to give as a gift to any parent, it is very subjective and could be offensive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous book","review":"The premise of this book belies common sense and leading research into what makes babies thrive. Henner and her therapist contend that responding immediately to a baby's needs will produce a \\"bratty\\" child, when in fact, a secure babyhood leads to a child who is more sensitive and open to gentle guidance from parents. Babies don't need discipline and they aren't \\"brats.\\"Additionally, the breastfeeding advice in this book is just plain misleading and will cause grief for a lot of families out there.A wonderful counterpoint to this book (and one that will also offer info on how to raise a well-behaved child) is Attachment Parenting by Katie Allison Granju/William Sears"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just another celeb pretending to be an expert","review":"First of all, i second the opinion NOT to supplement with formula to cure a low milk supply! This advice could ruin yuor attempt to breastfeed. The rest of this book is nothing more than the opinionated ramblings of a moter-nothing more. I found her opinions to be rather detached and very parent-centered, rarely taking into account the feelings of a child. What is seen as indulgent is actually just putting a child's needs first. Is that so awful to do sometimes?Finally, I found her \\"research\\" on the family bed to be one-sided and weak."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this book a parody?","review":"I honestly thought after reading the first couple of chapters that this book was a parody. It reminded me of some skit \\"Saturday Night Live\\" would do on parenting. The answers were short in words and substance. There were also a lot of contradictory statements. The book made me question the credentials of Dr. Sharon. If Marilu and Dr. Sharon felt they HAD to collaborate on a book, then perhaps the better approach would have been for Marilu to pen a book on her views of succesful acting, with Dr. Sharon offering asides to THAT topic."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Word Of Warning - some bad advice in this book!!!","review":"Although I agree with the idea that overindulgence can cause a child many problems, I found that Ms. Sharon and Ms. Henner often contradicted each other.

I read this book as a parent of two young girls under age 4 and was hoping to get some really helpful advice. Instead, I was under the impression that these two authors have children who are guilty until proven innocent, instead of the other way around. I found the advice to be rather shallow and not one bit of it something I hadn't actually heard before.

It is not deep. The treatment is superficial.HOWEVER! The main message is quite valid and there are a lot of moms and dads out there who may be wonderful, well-intentioned human beings and are unaware that permissive childraising can have some serious negative consequences.So if you are unsure if setting limits, enforcing consequences, and making demands on your children are \\"right\\", read this book.Bottom line: If you don't enforce limits on your children, if you don't clearly spell out your expectations, if you don't ALWAYS follow through with meaningful consequences, you run the risk of raising, not only a brat but in severe cases, a sociopath. At the very least, you'll have 18 years with an unhappy child who makes your life miserable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying","review":"This book is so irritating and annoying.

She is so concerned about being strict with rules that she seems to miss the joys of parenting.I wonder if she has changed her mind about any of her statements now that her children are older."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"PLEASE REFUSE TO READ THIS BOOK\\"","review":"Marilu Henner was a guest speaker at a recent women's conference I attended. I found her to be optimistic, energetic and funny. Based on this experience, I thought this book would be full of good advise on parenting. All through the first seven chapters I found myself constantly closing the book in disgust.In response to a question \\"when to stop breastfeeding,\\" Marilu responds as if she is a Le Lache League expert. A certified lactation consultant, not a celebrity who makes a mockery of the bond between a mother and a nursling, should address this question. I never finished the book.People who are interested in some of the best advise on parenting should consult one of the many books by Wm.Sears, M.D. and those recommended by the experts at Attachment Parenting International.

I was offended by almost every chapter in this book. I read the entire book, wanting to give it a chance - but the advice is awful. No one wants to raise a brat - and you do not need an actress or a psycho-analyst to tell you how to avoid raising one. You just use love and common sense!

The graphics are pretty (if too flashy) and the new characters add some interest, but it's a hollow effort. The game requires none of the skill that Hasbro's first Frogger did. The only challenge here is playing the game against a timer--personally, I'd rather be asked to do something well than to do it fast.One thing I cannot understand here is that the game lacks a save/restore option in Story mode. This would come in handy if you have more than one person in your household playing the game (i.e. more than one child.)

The controls are fairly easy for me, but I have the Microsoft Sidewinder Game Pad, which makes it seem like you're playing the game on your basic home game system. I tried it with the keyboard and it is awfully hard. The game is challenging enough with the controller. It takes split second reactions sometimes, and it's just to hard to do that with the keyboard.

The perfect mix tape of contemporary lullabies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frisell owes me 15 bucks","review":"I bought this sight unseen in Japan while on the road. \\"ooh!\\" I said, \\"Frisell with Holland and Jones. I'll take one!\\" Last time I do that.I've been reading the reviews from pro and con of this record and I side with the con most definitely. This sounds like a jazz album by country musicians. Or a country album by Jazz musicians, take your pick.I'm not a musical snob, I'm a player and lover of Jazz, but this is just boring, directionless, emotionless, mezzo-forte, medium tempo pablum.I feel conned honestly. Elvin and Dave... you've been used.Recommendation... buy Dave Holland's latest solo efforts, they are amazing. Inspired playing with truly progressive compositions. And for Elvin? Well, personally I'd stick to the classic Trane sides..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"I happened upon this at a local retailer and figured it was my lucky day. What a MAJOR dissapointment. Why hire ELVIN JONES to play quarter notes on his ride cymbal for an hour ?No cool melodies, definitely nothing even close to chops. This is not mellow, it's plain boring. What a waste of an opportunity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frisell with Elvin Holland on Bass and Dave Jones on Drums","review":"Who are Elvin Holland and Dave Jones you ask? I don't know either, but Bill Frisell might as well have hired them for this date. This CD is plain awful, and should have remained in the can. Virtually none of the personality of Holland and Jones comes through, and Frisell tries to adapt his old tunes to this ensemble but fails miserably. Likely he just played the heads or melodies for Holland and Jones, and said \\"Let's play, and see what happens.\\" Unfortunately, nothing happens. At all. To show how much heart was put into this, just listen to the last track where Elvin keeps playing after the song is done. Either he didn't know how the tune went, or he was just bored to tears playing vamps all day long. Since I was bored to tears, I assume the latter."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not Jazz!","review":"(...) No jazz musician would play \\"Moon River\\" as bland and lacking ANY hamonic creativity as he did on the recording. There is no jazz language in his playing anywhere. If it walks and sounds like a duck, then it is a duck, not a jazz musician. (...)"},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEAUTY OF ECONOMY","review":"I'm listening to the CD right now, and I am very pleased with it. Unfortunately, there are some music fans out there who think that great jazz should only appear in the form of high-speed licks. These folks sometimes forget that brilliant musical phrasing can come from a toned down pace. \\"Moon River\\" is an excellent example of this style. Great music also comes from integrating the styles of three great musicians to create a style unique to this ensemble. This CD is the outgrowth of that effort. Kudo to Bill, Dave and Elvin (RIP) for a memorable piece of work..."},{"rating":"1","title":"A mistake","review":"Nothing wrong with the 'supergroup' concept, and this same combination of bass-n-drums works beautifully on Joe Lovano's Trio Fascination Vol. 1. But this group simply does not gel. Holland seems to be spending the entire CD trying to reconcile the antithetical approaches of Frisell and Jones, and fails to do so. The guitarist's style emphasizes the timbral over the rhythmic, which is the main problem; Jones is the ideal accompanist for a player willing to push the rhythmic inflections. Here, the drummer slows down and smooths out his approach so much that, save for the free-floating shimmer of the cymbals, he's unrecognizable as the great Elvin Jones. Frisell flows along sweetly yet blithely, and Holland is left to provide an anchor for which there is no tether. Some pretty moments, but all-in-all a real, and highly disappointing, failure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flat, jaded, & uninspired.","review":"I am a huge fan of all 3 players, all of whom have had MANY shining moments, and thought * what a dream team *But, much to my disappointment, this one seems just this side of a snooze fest. Lacking were any standout solos; just reworked (overworked)tunes we all know and admire. Overall, I was left with a grey and flat feeling. I know there are many here who laud much critical acclaim on the disc. I just don't get it, especially knowing how capable these musicians are, both individually and in group settings. I'd love to see another attempt - this time with NEW material, more upbeat tunes, interesting Friz effects, and more compelling phrasing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enticing, easy-going alt-Jazz","review":"Another eccentrically languid offering from this great guitarist with an excellent supporting cast provides ample counterpoint to a majority of sunny-side Jazz-guitar output. Touching around a multitude of styles, Frisell and company usually add a darkened, though certainly not negative connotation to what in lesser hands would have reeked of bland retreads (case in point: the often abused and exploited cover of Moon River totally works). Between imaginative covers, impressionistic homages to traditional forms, and heavier, more personal experimentation, this may be as good a crash course as any for beginners into this eclectic, prolific, singular artist. It is not his greatest- a few dead spots here and there crop up amidst reliable interplay, and the sampler feel touching on many different styles may alienate certain specific fan expectations, but in an attempt to be all things to all people of the mildly experimental jazz guitar form, the disc is a bridge-builder."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moss eliminator","review":"It seems to work well. although, if overspray gets on concrete or bricks and is not washed off immediately, the high level of iron will oxidize to rust."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moss Out Works ok","review":"The product works ok.

This is easily their worst album ever, even worse than that last thing. It starts with several minutes of shockingly stupid penis jokes and goes downhill from there.The only marginally funny part is the short Nick Danger cut, which is still ruined by lame references to old jokes. They sound like Firesign nuts, throwing old one liners to each other.My advice, DON'T buy it. It's bloody AWFUL."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much better than Love Shelby","review":"I am Shelby Lynne was a hit. It had varying styles but it worked because there were a few great songs. She likes to try on different styles (blues, alt-country, boogie woogie, ballad). It can work if there are a few songs to hold it all together. Her stylistic diversity did not work in Love Shelby (sales were pathetic) and it does not work here.

The title would have been more apt for her over Glenn Ballard produced major label disappointment relased two years ago. Gone are the Daisy Dukes jammed up her crack, replaced instead by cover art that is less desperate and more representative of her integrity.

Apology accepted Miss Lynne -- our faith is restored."},{"rating":"2","title":"Treasure-Trove","review":"\\"Identity Crisis\\" is a good set from Shelby Lynne. The diversity of musical approaches makes the title appropriate. \\"Gotta Be Better\\" is an excellent track with some blazing electric lead that lashes the speakers & Lynne's infectious vocals, \\"And did you ever think you'd ever walk on hallow ground? Don't you like to think that things are lost & never found? Discover all the secrets & head out for the sound. Did you hear the voice that makes your fever?\\" \\"I'm Alive\\" also has a delightful rocking groove, \\"Oh if I don't get you back, I'll cover up my bloody tracks with sorrow, hopes & hide my dying pride.\\" The dreamy Shelby Lynne does Nick Drake track \\"If I Were Smart\\" communicates a soft gentle sadness that Shelby fills exquisitely. \\"Telephone,\\" \\"10 Rocks\\" & \\"Baby\\" are all great tracks. With \\"Suit Yourself\\" about to hit the market, \\"Identity Crisis\\" is still a treasure-trove. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great film, so adorable!","review":"This film does have a few flaws, but overall, it is very sweet and succint. Don't expect tricky plot twists or complicated entanglements. The speaking cast is less than 20 people in the whole film, I believe. However, this movie is so adorable in the way they have paired together these two \\"emotional\\" individuals. Both seem to find the other a sophisticated and functional human being despite that both have crippling social anxieties. The man is often shown at his therapist's office while the woman is often shown in her support group.Some scenes end without any sort of explanation about how a character managed to leave a situation without clarifying some absurdity. It is not a perfect film, and I wish they had left off the final scene.That said, I thoroughly enjoyed the movie, and I cracked up laughing when the two characters went \\"for a walk\\".

As are the supporting characters. It is beautifully made and it keeps a very 'light and bright' atmosphere throughout. The storyline is entertaining and different. Not your average 'meet and fall in love' movie.We found ourselves laughing several times throughout the movie.Since it is rated NR for now, I will let you know there is no nudity. There is one semi-sex scene in the movie when the lead character walks into her apartment and two visitors are using her apartment. No nudity, but a few seconds of sexual noise and action. Not enough that I didn't let my teen watch it. I say all that just in case there are parents who are wondering about the NR rating and allowing their children to see it.I was sad when the movie ended because it was such a happy carefree movie to watch. Very enjoyable!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Charming romantic comedy","review":"Quite cute romantic comedy that manages to overcome being predicable in the broad sense with lovely performances, and a quirkysensibility that allows for smaller surprises within the established rom-com format.Benoit Poelvorode (in a 180 degree turn from his famous, chilling performance in \\"Man Bites Dog\\") and Isabelle Carre are both, indifferent ways, suffering from terrible shyness and fear of emotions and attention. Yet, when she comes to work at his chocolatecompany personality and fate keep conspiring to force them together, in spite of their fears.This has a few laugh out loud moments, and lots of smile inducing ones.

I'm here to tell you it is NOT for everyone.A guy and his wife travel to the home of his ex-friend - her ex-lover - for the weekend. Their marriage is troubled. She is tempted by her ex, he is tempted by the ex's new fling, a silly-acting married woman who likes to run around naked.You see lots of dream sequences with water and several scenes around the lake. The symbolism is tired and nothing new. He's drowning in his wife, his obsession, his lack of confidence... The list goes on and on.I can do foreign films that are engaging, but this one was just too much for me. It is dull, the film is green throughout, and it was excruciating at times to watch.

Now I didn't have a huge amount of confidence in the grip factor of the handle but that's just me. So listen to this! I wrapped it in tennis racquet tape and sprayed it with canned rubber I got from Lowes. This is now the ultimate survival knife.

The blade is thick and has a menacing appearance, I'm not a trained knife professional but my novice eyes noticed that the bladed edge grind was uneven, not that it wasn't sharp because it was very sharp and this can be easily remedied with my Lansky knife sharpening kit. I really liked the simplicity of this knife has a full tang no bells and whistles. Just a little heavy but not to bad. this knife is going in a bug out bag. Would I recommend it?

I was surprised to actually hold it in my hand-the handle is really thick and I have large type hands but have no trouble holding it. I took it out in the desert for a walk to test it, and it chopped through a 3-inch cactus stalk like nothing. The weight (a little under a LB), makes swinging it a lot easier. I really like the G-10 handle too, even if it is a little thick. Overall, this knife is a HUGE value when you consider the craftsmanship and materials that were out into it. The blade is one thick, full tang that I can't imagine breaking. I am going to buy another one down the road. For the price, you can't beat it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Now this is a knife...","review":"Even after reading the reviews for this knife (model CKSURG), I was a bit surprised how large it actually was. The box it comes is measures 14.5\\" x 3.5\\" x 2\\" and the knife takes up most of the space in the box. The knife it self is well constructed. The one and only complaint I might have is with the sheath. The sheath is made up of a ballistic nylon strap and a plastic receptacle that the knife slides into. (There are some metal parts, such as the screws and the D-ring at the bottom). My problem is the plastic receptacle the blade fits into - it's form fitted to the shape of the blade. Which means the blade only fits in one way. That could be a problem depending on which side you want to wear the knife or if you're left handed. It also makes you have to pay a bit more attention when re-sheathing the knife. Minor issue I know, but I thought I would mention it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great quality chips","review":"Very nice quality chips, was a present and they enjoyed them and thought the pattern was great.

The only suggestion I can give is that if you are a serious player and could easily find yourself betting in the several hundreds of dollars at a time, then buy the 750 set (same brand/style) as that will come with the $1,000 and $5,000 chips. This one tops out at 50 of the $500 chips. Just depends on how much you play and how much cash you will be betting at a time. Totally discard the cards that come with this though. The material is too slick for ease of handling / shuffling. Best to just go buy some bicycle cards cheap from a local store and use them instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"solid chips.

My Chiropractor found nodule and sent me to an Endocrinologist who then diagnosed the cancer and found the Hashimoto's Disease. A friend suggeseted this book to me and I quickly bought it. I am glad to have it. I found the information in The Thyroid Sourcebook (5th Edition) up-to-date and right on.

Later, this turned into a hypOthyroid condition, as sometimes happens the author states. All of these symptoms are also clearly spelled out. The treatments and tests are clearly spelled-out. This is the best book possible for someone who has (or thinks they may have) thyroid problems. It's easy to read. Also, the author is careful about what she says, so you can trust her. She herself had thyroid disease. And she happens to be a PhD scientist. So you're not likely to find anybody more knowledgeable about the subject.

After all the music business has changed a lot since the last time that Tesla recorded a studio album and Classic Rock is not at the top of the charts anymore.This is a greatest hits live album as it presents every songs that was relevant to the band in the 80's.

They maintain there original sound and quality on this two cd album. And, giving back to the fans that supported them this tour shows how much playing and producing has to do with those fans.

There is simply no feeling of atmosphere, the sound quality seems to be too sheened and it is almost like they recorded the songs in a studio and then dubbed some crowd noise on at the end.

There are missing figures, but yet referenced in the text. The book lacks an index. Several words are abbreviated, but there is no apparent explanation for them. I get the feeling this book went from first draft directly to publication. The hefty price is not justified. I am glad I only borrowed it from a library. The one purpose of the book seems to be to promote Excel spreadsheets he has created to track the OEX; and their prices are equally inflated. Why must you, Mr. Schiller, sell them from Spain? Isn't trading the OEX sufficiently profitable by itself?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not too shabby.","review":"First, I would like to commend this stock on its sturdiness. It's rather solid, but remains very lightweight. The added length is also nice for people with a longer reach. I knew that it would require a small amount of trimming for a perfect fit, but even without trimming it it still fits pretty well. My only gripes about it would be that the grip could use a slightly larger opening, a plug for the hole at the bottom of the grip, and I would have also liked to see some texture on the sides of the grip. All in all a good buy though. I would also recommend throwing a rubber butt plate on. Not so much for the recoil, as the gun has little kick as is, but I just feel it makes it look a little nicer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a fits-all.","review":"Great product.

Ms. Taraporevala has captured the many facets of Parsis through their daily lives through essays and haunting photography. Her photo documentary weaves a loose story from training for the priesthood to the final passage of life. Her personal essays and photos of family members allow the reader to get a glimpse of what it means to grow up as a Parsi in Bombay.

She wants the record the songs that turn her on, but not necessary the songs that turn the fans on. She insists on recording songs that I wouldn't give a dime for. I can not and will not support any more of her recordings or concerts until she sings the songs that I like to hear.The songs that I would like to hear Barbra sing are the old standards.

I have read everything Sterling has ever published as well as most of his cyberpunk contempararys' work. This book falls well short of his usual high mark. It was not the subject or the characters... the delivery was abysmal. I feel bad that one of my favorite authors would fall down like this. cyberpunk authors seem to be dropping like flies. even the great Gibson's latest published work is about his love of watch collecting on e-bay. Thank god we still have Stephenson churning out great science fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"I couldn't put it down... fast enough.","review":"Nothing happened in the seventy pages I read. The author showed us around his hackneyed, dystopian future and introduced some characters with all the personality of storefront dummies who, like me, seemed to be waiting for something to happen (a.k.a., a plot).Science fiction is particularly vulnerable to having its storyline overpowered by concepts and gadgets. You see it in William Gibson's novels, a slow progression from storyline (\\"Neuromancer\\") to something more like an anthropologist's field study (\\"All Tomorrow's Parties\\").I am not partial to either \\"Islands in the Net\\" or \\"The Difference Engine\\"--two earlier Sterling efforts--but at least they were readable."},{"rating":"1","title":"So many good ideas, so little plot","review":"Distraction shows why fiction was really mostly a warm-up for Sterling's current career as non-fiction writer and design futurist agitator. Distraction is peppered with crazy asides: reputation servers, rogue arms of the military, cloth phones.But there is no plot here, none. There are hundreds of pages where the story simply veers from location to location with a cast of characters that seems to grow and shrink for no particular reason. I defy anyone to summarize the central narrative of Distraction in a sentence or two. It can't possibly seriously be categorized as a \\"thriller\\", right?"},{"rating":"1","title":"It Fizzles","review":"The book starts out with so many great concepts that it was really an easy choice for me to buy it on the basis on reading the first few chapters. And a lot of interesting things happen along the way to the end. But it strangely fizzles out before the conclusion, which is a major disappointment. In fact, there really didn't even quite seem to *be* an ending. I felt like someone must have chopped out the last hundred pages.Likewise, Oscar starts out as an intersting character but he never, ever changes and we never really seem to get inside of him or achieve any sort of understanding of him. For a character that seems so deep and interesting when you first assay him, you end up with the feeling that he's just an android spounting endless bits of dialogue to no real purpose.A shame. Read Schismatrix or Heavy Weather instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Walker Percy's Distraction","review":"I read Sterling's\\" Distraction\\" and though it was very clever until I read Walker Percy's \\"Love in the Ruins\\" published in 1971. I was shocked at the extensive borrowing from Percy that Sterling did to write\\" Distraction\\". The structure, plot, scenes, and the setting at the end of the world is just too similar to be coincidental. I recommend \\"Love in the Ruins\\". Percy is our american genius."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing and sketchy","review":"I'd expected more from Sterling. Distraction could have been a much better book, if the author had decided what exactly it was supposed to be about. Instead the book jumps from subject to subject, never spending enough time on any of them to convince, and none of the characters are well-enough drawn to make you care about them. Sure, Distraction is full of interesting ideas, but none of them are immediately, intuitively convincing, and because they're skipped over so rapidly, they just aren't supported. I've always found science-fiction to be most interesting when it deals with the results of scientific discovery or societal change, so Distraction should have been a bargain, since it includes about twenty times as many changes as most or SF novels. Instead, its very unsatisfying, because instead of exploring the effects of one idea, Sterling throws another one at you. I remain unconvinced."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunately very boring","review":"Fortunately I have read almost all other books by Bruce Sterling, \\"Zeitgeist\\" is already waiting on my bookshelf and I really hope it will be more entertaining than \\"Distraction\\" was. Distraction is somehow not a true Sterling novel. Too much is missing, to much is simply wrong. How can he imagine that cell phones and the Internet will work the same way in 2045 than they do now ! People still lugging laptops and phones hidding in their sleeves are truly 1999 stuff and feeling even already today outdated. The whole plot is constructed and does not feel right. Avoid this book !!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not A Distraction","review":"Full disclosure: I put the book down after 90 pages. I'd like to tour Bruce Sterling's mind sometime; it must be one hell of a ride. But Distraction, although chock full of Sterling's usual future visions, doesn't work. By the time Oscar got around to confessing his origin to Greta I knew I'd had enough -- it just wasn't working for me. If you're looking for a compelling distraction, look elsewhere. Great ideas or not, it's still the story that matters. If you must have this book opt for the paperback and save a few bucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"I wouldn't have thought it possible, but here is a sci-fi \\"Washington\\" novel. That said, most of it takes place in Louisiana, but nonetheless, the novel is concerned with examining the political future circa 2042 via a Senator's campaign manager cum spin doctor. Unfortunately, this character, though whose eyes the whole novel unfolds is completely uninteresting. He seems to exist solely to drift in and out of more interesting lives and situations which are never really fully realized or tied together. While Sterling's vision of a heavily fragmented America, with crazy technology, uberpowerful nets, and soforth is all very well-crafted, and intriguing, the story itself is rather boring. In fact, so boring, I won't recount it here, nor will I recommend investing any time in this 440 page monster."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy Entertainment","review":"Arguably not Sterling's best book, but still an easy, quick and entertaining read. It held my interest despite an end that was predictable.

You find very few ones in this book. The plot is slow, boring, concentrates too much on shallow characters and there are just a handful of somewhat original futuristic speculations.

Avoid it, better try Barne's \\"Mother of Storms\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Drivel","review":"Please understand that I thoroughly enjoy Sterling as a writer. but Distraction was a bomb.

Supposedly it's not really a real track - it's a hidden track. But that should make the 11th track 9:05 instead of the 4:48 that Amazon is listing.Can we have either a complete 11th track, including the hidden track, or else put \\"Black Jettas\\" up for download? Thanks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid, these guys rock","review":"Just to add my two cents, I saw these guys before ever hearing them and I was already humming songs after the show. They rock live, and their CD is great. I would describe it as the Sex Pistols jumped on an acid train and got derailed somewhere in 80's brit pop land. You want this CD, :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!!!!!!","review":"I first saw this band on Letterman. And WHOA!I haven't been this excited by new music since Cocteau Twins or Jane's Addiction!This is definately the shot in the arm (of adreneline) thatpopular music has needed for a very long time!We've lived with cookie cutter coldplays and Disneyland Orange County Surf/Ska punks for WAY too long!PAY ATTENTION!!!!!

This band is phenomenal though. I can't stop listening to it. Most of the time I listen to it while working out at the gym and it keeps you going like the energizer bunny.

I fell in love with the band and it has definitely become my favorite cd in my extensive collection. From the electronic twist to the vocals that will blow you away, every song on the cd leaves you hanging on for more. The only problem I can find with this album, now I compare everything else that is new to them, and thats a hard thing to beat. So why listen to something else when you can have IMA ROBOT?!

I placed Mr.Quick Wick at the entrance and it absorbed about as much water as a sponge of the equivalent size would, enough to make it soppy but not enough to prevent the water from creeping past it. After the rain, the product is slow to dry out and keep clean, and looks like a drowned worm while the water slowly seeps out. It also has a slimy feel when wet, making wringing it out unpleasant."},{"rating":"1","title":"It oozes!","review":"I recently had a chance to see these in action as we had a very heavy rain storn. While they did absorb some of the water in the basement, the storm was over a week ago and they are still not dried out - good thing we haven't had any more heavy rain. I hung them up to dry and they oozed some kind of slimey stuff all over the floor and my hands when I picked them up. Most of the \\"stuffing\\" has migrated to the ends I have hanging down & they are still wet & dripping slime!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Barely absorbs & yucky white stuff comes out","review":"I had maybe two cup's worth of water spill on my carpet. I put this item down on the carpet to absorb the water. It barely absorbed anything. I probably could have absorbed more with several good paper towels. Then these little white sticky things started coming out all over. Couldn't wait to wash them off my hands. I used this item once and it didn't do what it should have, and then I tossed it into the trash. I didn't want to deal with the white things again.

Any writer should know by now that to interest a child,or any reader for that matter, dialogue must be foremost on a writer'smind. This book was boring, offered little conflict and almost nodialogue.

In one single chapter!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Legend Comes to Life...","review":"I have read so many King Arthur books and can't keep track of which ones I read. But this one I remember being quite enjoyable. It includes numerous King Arthur tales some you may know others may be new to you. My personal favorite being \\"Sir Gawain and the Green Knight\\". All I have to say is this is an enjoyable and adventurous read weather you have ever read about King Arthur before or not. After reading this your bound to be captivated and find yourself searching for more King Arthur tales! I recommend not only this book ,but the many other ones that are out there also. After reading this one check out \\"The Squire's Tale\\" by:Gerald Morris - It's a fun book about a boy,Terence, and the famous Sir Gawain(in which you are or will become familiar with if you read \\"King Arthur and His Knight's of the Round Table\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good book.","review":"I'm a nine year old girl and in the third grade. I would recommend this for 8 and over. I started reading King Arthur And His Knights Of The Round Table when I was 8. It is a very good book. There was lots of adventure. Morgana le Fay kept trying to stop Arthur, but he kept surviviing!! At the end of King Arthur And His Knights Of The Round Table,Arthur is mortally wounded and nearly dies. Nobody knows what really happens to King Arthur Pendragon! Some say he went to the \\"Isle Of Avalon\\". Some say he died there. One part of the ending was pretty cheap! Throughout the book Morgana le Fay was bad, but at the end, she turned all nice and said to Arthur, \\"Ah,my dear brother,why have tarried so long from us? Alas,the wound in your your head has caught over-much cold\\" while she was crying. A person reading this will learns lots of information about King Arthur and his knights."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Knights of the Round Table","review":"The Knights of the Round TableBy: Roger Lancelyn GreenThe book King Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table include numerous interesting stories. The author, Roger Green, did not only set Arthur on quests, but his knights too. From the adventure of the Green knight to the quest for the Holy Grail, this book keeps you entertained. The king Arthur and his knights were well known for their bravery and honorability. For example, Sir. Gawain kept his promise to the green knight to look for him in one year.However, the old English and the number of characters in the many stories of this book become very confusing.I rate this book five out of ten, because I enjoy more descriptive action stories rather than so much talking. I recommend this Arthurian novel to whoever enjoys stories rich in characters and dialogs."},{"rating":"2","title":"my first \\"favorite book\\"","review":"My mother gave me this book when I was six years old, and I fell in love immediately. It covers just about every classic Arthurian story, so it's a good introduction to the legends. The formal language is evocative of both the medieval period from which the stories come and the magical realm in which they take place. The woodcut illustrations have a 'stained-glass' look, and add to the atmosphere of the tales. Reading it, you feel that you are getting at the 'original' stories rather than a modern retelling; Green allows the quests and adventures to stand on their own, much as they exist in Malory or the medieval romances, without forcing his voice and version of events onto them. For this reason, I prefer it to other introductory collections of the stories. It's a classic, one that I've reread probably hundreds of times over the last twelve years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect price!","review":"My son needed this quickly for a summer reading project from school...It arrived fast and in perfect condition. Very happy with the price for this product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A GOOD INTRODUCTION TO A CLASSIC","review":"I am currently reading this book, and it is very good. I read the reviews on many other editions of the Arthurian legends, as well as some of the reviews on this one. I was looking for an edition that was faithful to the original sources, yet accessible and enjoyable to read. I would say that this is a good modern edition for the general reader. I would recommend it. I subsequently ordered the hardbound edition of this book.It is beautiful, well-made and well-designed. I would also recommend this edition. As a final note, It would be helpful if the book descriptions and reviews all matched the book being sold. Sometimes they don't, and it can be confusing. I don't remember having this problem with this particular book, but I noticed it when trying to get information and reviews on some of the others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same Old Stuff","review":"Nothing new here....same old rah-rah. Basic and quite general motivational techniques that never change....same stuff, different author. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun while it lasted","review":"We bought this volleyball set for our pool. We enjoyed it after the initial set up, but were disappointed when the net actually began falling apart after only a couple of weeks. I am not sure if it was caused by being out in the sunlight or pool chemicals, but the net actually became so brittle that it actually would break into tiny pieces as we attempted to retie or tighten the net. I'd only purchase this if you had plans to remove it from the outdoor elements when not in use."},{"rating":"2","title":"MY FAVORITE KATHY SMITH OLDIE!!!","review":"YES, THIS VIDEO IS AN OLDIE ALRIGHT.it was done in the early 90's so you can surely expect \\"cheesiness\\" in terms of hairstyles, clothing, and even the sets. This was made over a decade ago. Take out a photo album of your own and you'd be embarrassed at your own cheesy hair style and clothes 10 years ago! Now on to the important part -- do you get a good work out from this tape -- YES. The upper body workout is around 10 minutes. Next, you get five aerobic segments that last around 35 mins. My faves were the Latin and 50's dance segments. Finally, you do around 15 mins of lower body toning. The weight segments are only easy if you're using too light of weights. I've used 3 and then 5 pound weights and what a difference that makes.The entire workout is around an hour! This is definitely for intermediate level. I had great fun doing the workouts but what matters most was that I lost 25 lbs in 2 months doing this video every single day. THIS WORKS!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great cardio with hand weights; hokey sets and outfits","review":"You will burn calories while simultaneously toning your arm and leg muscles, but don't buy this 60-minute video if you are bothered by dated sets (1990) or gross thong outfits. The shifting back and forth from black outfits to colorful ones, the changing camera angles, and the silly turquoise sheet waving around in the back to look like water can get pretty annoying after a while. But if you ignore those problems and focus on the workout, you will work up a good sweat, lose weight, and tone up the muscles of your upper and lower body with this fast-moving, dancy video. I do like Kathy Smith's \\"Functionally Fit Peak Fat Burning Workout,\\" \\"Step Workout,\\" \\"Power Step Workout,\\" and \\"Peak Fat Burning Breakthrough\\" better -- her tapes keep getting better as she gets older. If you want a shorter (half-hour) tape that combines cardio with hand weights, \\"Crunch - Cardio/Sculpt\\" is excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes you sweat and is fun","review":"I loved the tape simply because youre getting 45 minutes of action. Its got weights mixed with cardio. Kathy seems like she is having fun and I loved the rest of the cast. None of the cast look like supermodels there just average folk. The video has a lot of leg work like deep knee bends. I noticed some muscle in my legs as well. This video hasnt become boring at all. Highly deserves kudos on this one. BUY IT>"},{"rating":"1","title":"Please do not spending money purchasing this DVD","review":"I read the reviews about how cheesy the workout is and sadly did not listen. I could not believe how cheesy the movements are. And aerobic intructors do not use these movements today. It is definitely 80's everything. Don't be fooled into buying this dvd. If you are looking for a great workout please buy one of her newer dvd. Such as the timesaver one or two or rules of fat burning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheesy, bad cueing overshadow the workout","review":"This workout contains a few aerobic portions organized into songs and genre's, some weights and stretching.Here's my compliants:I know it's from the early 90's ... it can't help when it was made. However, being 2005 now you will certainly get a giggle and and some very bad memories of yourself wearing similar crimped hair and weird outfits. However, I found that it distracted from the workout (and I'm usually not easily distracted).Kathy also has really bad cue-ing (especially in the last 50's-style segment) which means I basically hopped in one place and watched, trying to figure out what was going on.If you can get past the outfits, the cheesy smiles (that man scares me) and the bad cue-ing you might get a decent workout.Despite hopping in place for the last segment, I got a pretty good workout and I'm in really good shape. However, I don't think I'll ever do this video again because of the distractability of its age."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kathy Smith Weightloss workout","review":"This is a great workout. I like it because you never stop moving with this one. The intensity is great, you can adjust to your needs. It is fun and before you know it your at the cool down.

I was able to work muscles that hadn't been worked in years and really felt the burn that I needed. I enjoy working out with this DVD everyday and I never get bored with it. She's really a joy to watch and workout with. She's a terrific motivator!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste ur money and time","review":"I found this tape to be the worst tape I have ever used. It's soooo boring, and it's soooo early 90s! Then they keep changing the scenery back and forth and if u ask me it's just [bad]! I own many of Kathy Smth videos and I love all of thm except for this one. But it's just my opinion but as soon as I watched this tape I was like Aw! I want my money back, if u really want a good and fun tape I suggest u get Kathy Smth's Great Buns and Thighs Workout."},{"rating":"2","title":"nostalgic for the 80s?","review":"it says this tape was produced in 1998 but it feels more like 1988. from the matching costumes to the cheesy music to the hairstyles. the workout is fast and sometimes confusing. i haven't given this one enough practice to decide a) whether i like it and b) if it actually is effective."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kath Smith Weight Loss Workout","review":"I have several of Kathy Smith's tapes, this is the only one I do not like. I have used it about 4 times now, and I improve with keeping up, but the tape doesn't get any better. I don't feel that I really work the muscles, it is more of an aroebic dance routine tape. I have knee and ankle problems and this tape could be damaging to both if I'm not careful. So, while I try to watch my moves, Kathy moves on to something else. I also think the editing could have been 1000 times better. Kathy's \\"Functionally Fit\\" and \\"Lift Weights to Lose Weight\\" are much better choices for the money. If you are into this for the weight loss and muscle toning go with one of those. If you just need to get your heart rate up and enjoy dance routines you might like this one. I didn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweat into the 90s","review":"I hesitated when I bought this dvd, because it did not get very good ratings. However, I LOVE IT!!!! I am a huge Kathy Smith fan and I would have to say it is one of my favorites. Before this dvd, I would do her cardio kickboxing 4 times a week. I think that this dvd is as good of a work out as her cardio kickboxing, which is saying a lot. I agree with the other reviewers that it is very out dated, but I think that makes it fun and it's still a hard work out. If you like Kathy Smith and were wondering what happened to go ol' aerobics; this is the dvd for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best Workout Videos Out There","review":"There is nothing bad I can say about this video. It is energising and an effective fat-burner. It is for intermediate exercisors, but can be made advanced by making the moves all high-impact. Great work, Kathy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good long workout","review":"I bought this DVD based on the other reviewers stars and ratings. What everyone else said is true..the clothes are campy, the music is okay, but the aerobic and strength training sessions really made me sweat!

I prefer Denise Austin's workouts over this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outdated","review":"I was very disappointed with my recent purchase of this tape. It is very outdated! It's OK if you're stuck in the 80's. The cover shows a recent photo of Kathy, which is misleading advertising as far as I'm concerned. I was hoping that this tape would motivate, but it is very similar to some of Kathy's older tapes that I do not use any longer."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst!","review":"I'm so dissapointed in this video! It talks about how beneficial, working with weights AND aerobics are TOGETHER, however, there may be a whole 5 minutes of using weights! Some cross training! Very outdated, some parts are just \\"silly\\", I think I'll stick to \\"The Firm\\" tapes, they haven't dissapointed me yet!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My all time favorite","review":"I love this video! 5 years ago, I lost 90 pounds and I attribute a lot of my success to this tape. It's tough, but it covers all the bases. The length is right for weight loss, since you have to work longer at a lower intensity to burn fat. It may not be the most exciting tape on the market, but it's a workhorse and I'd recommend it for anyone who truly wants to lose pounds and get in shape!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A little dissappointed","review":"Normally I love Kathy Smith Videos -- but I found this one hard to follow and a little to high impact for me. I much prefer Funtionally Fit and Fat Burners low-impact aerobics to burn fat."},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL!!!","review":"I thought, like the other person that commented, that this was a new workout, since there is a 2003 production date on the DVD. It is outdated, hard to follow, and generally a waste of time. I did give this review 2 stars because of the upper body workout, which is somewhat worthwhile, but it goes so fast and is so confusing due to the stupid camera angles that I didn't feel like I was really getting a good workout."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I love other Kathy Smith videos, but I'm really disappointed in this one. I find it hard to get past the cheesy props and big hair. The aerobics moves are OK, but I found myself watching the clock, hoping I wouldn't have to look at the big hair much longer. The weightlifting part is the redeeming part of this video. I'd suggest sticking with her time-savers series and the fat burning breakthroguh video."},{"rating":"1","title":"very outdated","review":"I read the other reviews and decided to buy this workout.

I have read her advice in Self magazine many times and it seemed she knew what she was talking about. This video was horrible! The sets were cheesy and they seemed to care more about special effects than exercising. It was distracting to see them exercising in one set of clothes and in one setting then flash mid step to another set up. I am completely angry that I wasted my hard earned money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"80\\"s Stuff - cover misleading","review":"I was very disappointed when I bought this tape. It seems like Kathy Smith compiled several clips of her workout tapes all of them in the 80's and made it into 1 hr tape.. I felt really disappointed since it is 2001 - why would I want old stuff give use something new to work with. I wish Kathy Smith would have been more honest to her consumers. I feel it's a waste of my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible to watch","review":"I usually love Kathy Smith workouts but this video is terrible to watch. It looks like they filmed it twice and then edited the two together - one moment you will see Kathy permforming a move and the next moment you see her messing up the move while the people behind her laugh and then it flips back to the regular workout. It just cuts in and out way too much. I think they were trying to make it more entertaining to watch but it ends up being harder to follow if you are trying to concentrate on permforming the moves correctly."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Thought Kathy Smith Could Do No Wrong But...","review":"I Thought Kathy Could Do No Wrong But...I am a huge Kathy Smith follower, but this video was a waste of money! It's not only because of the fact that the settings were extra cheesy, but the weight segments were way too easy and there were not enough of them. If you want a good aerobic workout this is the video for you (minus the horrible clothes and music), but for serious areo toning this is not a good workout. I think this video should have been discontinued in the late 1980s!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a beauiful song!","review":"I love that song it was my friends wedding song at there wedding.

I did'nt believe him. But here it is and here is my review. Though I have heard much worse, this is basically 80's metal rehashed. Cheesy songs with grandiose vocals. Obviously, there is a certain degree of musicianship. However, the musicians are not the problem, the songs are. Do these guys really take themselves seriously??? If they do not, then I give them 2-and-a-half stars. Guys-Don't quit your dayjobs!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This video disappoints... the footage of the actual eruption is missing entirely.

Although the subject is interesting, unless you have a specific interest in how it was covered by the ABC News, you'll find better material elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent Read, An Excellent Idea","review":"As with Dan Abnett's first in this series, the sequel does not fail to deliver. I highly enjoyed the flashback format of the book, wherein you get to know more about all of the top echelon of the Tanith's First and Only. It connects you to the characters and whether you love them or hate them, it makes you want to read more about them. I have read every book in the series so far and this was the one that cemented my newfound love for Abnett's writing style into me. Pick this up, but read First and Only first, otherwise you will be missing a lot of the flavor of this fine piece of writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"The continuing adventures of Guant's Ghosts.","review":"The second book in the Gaunt's Ghosts series loses a little of steam from where the first leaves off but still manages to finish strong. The first two-thirds of this book are comprised of short stories that further develop some of the more colorful characters of the Tannith First and Only. This fleshing out of the chacters seemed a little forced in some of the stories while others were quite good and I expect it will pay dividends down the road. The final third of the book picks up where the first book left off and leaves you hungry for more(thankfully Necropolis awaits). I did not enjoy it as much as I did the first book but it is written very well and definetly still worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get to know Gaunt's Ghosts","review":"This book is a in depth look into each of Gaunt's Ghosts main characters. The first book, First and Only, was mainly about Gaunt, his career, his past, and the events that lead to the battle on Epsilon. Nothing about the founding or any of his men in particular or the rivalry's with other company's. This second novel is about all of that. Each man has a short anecdote about a previous battle which tells you alot about their character. My only complaint is that book is simply too short. The overall story being told gets lost in the dozen or so accounts of the Ghosts. The ending lacks lustre and while gives more detail into the original Tanith I'm left thirsting for more."},{"rating":"1","title":"too much bad action","review":"I bought this book, because I think that I would get a lot of action and war fighting.......which I did get.But, most of them have very little of bad describtion of what's going on. The book is similar to a lot of short action novels that are put together into one junk.I have to say that I put 2 stars just because it's a warhammer story. I havn't read his other books yet, but if you're looking for a good story book to read, don't try this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst wh40k novel I ever read","review":"As much as I liked the 1st and 3d book in this series, this book just isn't what it should be. It is an attempt at fleshing out the different characters under Gaunt's command by having them live through a short story of their own. Perhaps a nice idea, but the end result is a lack of plot combined with a lot of stories that just didn't seem to grasp my attention. I had to push myself through the book to finish it. The only reason it gets a second star is because it is situated in the wh40k universe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Didn't notice the so called hyena sound","review":"This workout was great! Some reviews had me afraid of getting this tape b/c of her annoying sounds. I simply did not notice this. True every now and then she would let out a \\"WHEW\\" but so what. The same people that commented on this would have still been dissatisfied if she let out a grunt, a commonly done thing when you're lifting weights. There was no warm up and I didn't expect one nor am I going to make a big deal about it. All in all this video exceeded my expectations and I highly recommend it to those familiar with weight lifting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good home workout","review":"This is a great video for someone who prefers to workout at home with free weights. It tones up your muscle enough so fat doesn't jiggle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too flashy, not good for home.","review":"This DVD requires you to have weights, which is fine. But it also expects you to have a gym bench! (Not a step, a bench.) If there were no other way to work out with weights, I would say OK, but there are zillions of weight-lifting exercises that don't require a bench. To see them, just go to a body sculpting class at any decent gym anywhere in America. Also, the exercises are done way too fast (making injury highly likely), and there's little or no explanation of the exercises. I guess this was originally a video, because it doesn't have any DVD-style features. I bought this for somebody because it was the only weight workout I could find on DVD. It's adequate, but somebody should make a better one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for Beginners","review":"I had this one years ago and repurchased it on DVD.

THE WORKOUT IS DONE IN 20 MINUTES AND MOST OF THE UPPER, LOWER, AND MIDDLE BODY IS COVERED. KATHY MAY BE A LITTLE HYPER IN THIS WORKOUT BUT I THINK IT'S FUNNY AND IT REMINDS ME THAT SHE'S JUST HAVING A GOOD TIME. I FIND MYSELF SMILING WHEN SHE LETS OUT HER WHOOAS! I SEEN RESULTS FAIRLY QUICK."},{"rating":"2","title":"Timesaver-Lift Weights to lose Weights","review":"Very pleased with these \\"timesaver\\" videos. I am a novice to exercise, and 50. The \\"cardio timesaver\\" is a great place to start, and I then add a 20 minute upper OR lower w/o w/weights from this video. Sure beats the price of a gym! The only issue I have is the pushup portion which, for me, is kinda tough on us wimps. I'll keep at it though!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I have used Volume 1 for two years and have been very pleased with the weight program presented. Volume 2 is very short on exercises using weights so I feel that the video is misnamed and misrepresented. The few exercises that utilized weights are excellent, but they are very scarce."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kathy does it again","review":"I recently began to incorporate weight training into my exercise program and I decided to go with the tried and true - Kathy Smith. Kathy helped me lose weight with her aerobic videos and I felt that she would be just as effective with the weight training. The workout is divided into two 20 minute sections for upper and lower body workouts. Kathy gets right to the point and doesn't talk you to death. I could do without all the fake smiling by the video participant's, but the workout itself is great. The workout is applicable to first timers as well as those more advanced. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of My Favorite Workouts","review":"I have had this tape for a few years now, and I haven't outgrown it yet! I just keep buying heavier hand and leg weights. Kathy systematically works you top to bottom using hand weights, leg weights (optional), and a step or weight bench (I use a step). Both the upper and lower body segments (she works on your balance some during the lower body segment, it's great!) are 20 minutes, and if you want to warm up, you will have to do that on your own because she does not include it. Overall, this is an excellent, well thought out tape."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for beginners!","review":"I'm just beginning a strength-building program, although I've been in several over the years. Smith's \\"Lift Weights to Lose Weight\\" is NOT for novices: correct posture is not shown--even she arches her back when she shouldn't. The repetitions are too fast and done from downright dangerous positions. About warm-up (an absolute necessity for anyone), she only says that you should do one (??????). Finally, I don't like her shouting at me the whole way through; it becomes annoying. Perhaps the tape is useful in picking up some ideas--and then going to a professional for the right method. So it's not a total waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"I won't be using this video again.","review":"I was dissappointed in the presentation. Switching from one position to the next was far too fast and the presenter did not stay long enough in any one position to gain benefit. Also, the exercises did not follow the basic rules for gaining maximum benefits and maintaining safety - for either the aerobic part or the weight lifting part. I wish I could return an opened video. Also, the video emphasized that only a set of weights was necessary. Actually 2 different weights were needed and an \\"exercise bench\\" which was almost a necessity."},{"rating":"1","title":"no instruction for proper form for safety, reps too fast","review":"DO NOT BUY THIS VIDEO!!! It is poorly presented both in instruction and video format. There are no guidelines as to form for safety or as to speed of repetitions. Everything is done too fast and in a very annoying manner - jumping from one bench to another - etc. I was so annoyed that I didn't even finish watching it. Also, three sizes of weights and a weight bench ARE required. If possible, I would give it NO stars!"},{"rating":"1","title":"okay workout but....","review":"The workout in this video is done well enough, but one of the reason I purchased this video was for the stability ball workout on it. My DVD did not include such a workout. Do I have a bootleg copy? I wrote the KathySmith.com to ask them what to do about my 'bad' DVD. That is also why I gave it one star. I like to depend on product quality consistantly, and not worry about returns and such."},{"rating":"1","title":"You will lose more weight walking","review":"I found the time-saver cardio-fat burner horrible. 1. The movements are not sharp and not clean, and they are boring. 2. The instructions are sometimes too fast and not clear 3. Neither the first 20 minutes (low Aerobic) or the last 20 minutes (high entensity Aerobic) made me feel satisfied with my work out If you want to do cardio why don't you try NAC System Interval Challenge, or Beyond 2000."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Fast Weights Workout","review":"Quick, easy, effective video - both the upper and lower body workouts are only 20 mins each - great for busy people. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finding Incomplete Menu","review":"A couple of reviews noted that there was no stability ball workout and an incomplete menu. I had the same issue and then finally figured it out. What appears to be the main menu is actually just the first of 2 main menus. To get to the second you need to select the triangle at the bottom. This takes you to the second menu and allows you to access the stability ball workout ( which is fun)."},{"rating":"1","title":"too much explaining","review":"I was disappointed. I normally really like Kathy Smith, but I found the abs segment to be over the top instruction-wise. Once you get the moves down, you would either have to just do them on your own, or spend a whole lot of time waiting for the next excercise. I feel the same about most of the other routines.Also, the description on the \\"sleeve\\" does not point out that you need varying weights and a bench or step, etc.If you are looking for a time saving spot workout, try \\"I want that body\\" w/ Tammilee."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly Good!","review":"Over the years I have occasionally tried a Kathy workout and just never liked it. Her workouts always lacked something, mostly not challenging or interesting enough, I'm not quite sure, but they always left me dissappointed. One of those was Lifting Weights to Loose Weight 2 - not good at all. Because of this, I never tried this one, assuming it would be about the same, until I recently discovered it at my local video store and I can't believe how much I like it. This one is REALLY good including her advice! I'm mean I love it!It is a total body weight workout that allows you to either do it Jari-style (lighter weights, lots of reps and pulses), or Cathe-style (heavy weights, rest, multiple sets) all in the same workout. How clever. It kept my interest throughout and I felt it the next day. I guess it's worth weeding through the bad to find the few good workouts Kathy does have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Short, to the point strength training","review":"This is exactly what I was looking for, straitforward workout that I can do at home to tone.

If you go to the bottom of the first menu, there are two buttons. Click on the one to the right and you will enter the second screen. Here you will find the options for building your own workout (you can sequence the different sections any way you want), the ball workout and other extras. The ball workout is great as is the rest of the work out. It's not a super challenging work out but nice for those \\"I don't want to kill myself days.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Kathy Smith-Lift Weights to Lose Weight","review":"This is a great workout for people who want to strengthen muscles and tone up. I would say it's for beginning - intermediate levels. Kathy Smith sets a great example for everyone.

Would not recommend"},{"rating":"1","title":"WHERE IS MY \\"BONUS\\" STABILITY BALL WORKOUT!!!!!","review":"I must say, I am very disappointed with this DVD - I especially wanted the \\"BONUS\\" 20 Minute Stability Ball Workout. I use Kathy Smith's Lift Weights to Lose Weight #1, which I love. I have a wonderful stability ball which I couldn't wait to use with my new $27.75 (incl taxes) DVD.I just read that one cannot return an 'opened' item. So, obviously, I'm stuck. If anyone can tell me if this DVD can be exchanged, please let me know.Good luck to all others who order it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too annoying","review":"I exercised to this tape a few times and finally stopped because Kathy is just too annoying, all that shouting and screeching is just too much. If she wasn't so noisy, maybe I could have enjoyed the video more"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good workout.........","review":"Enjoy the workout, but I would have liked a bit more on the abs routine. Finally found out how to program the DVD and the stability ball routine (tho I have not used it as yet), thanks to Elisa's, NY, review of the DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is tough but you get good results","review":"This is not going to be one of your boring toning exercises. Kathy Smith added real interesting more efficient moves to toning.I really like this DVD. You got lower body, upper body and mid section divided into sections. I don't do the whole DVD in one workout; I select which muscle group I want to work on that day after my cardio. There is no cardio in this DVD, you still need cardio to burn calories. I am a swimmer so I complement this work out with swimming. It is relatively tough but you really get a good muscle toning exercise. I recommend this to anyone who wants to improve their toning and bored with the same weight lifting moves."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT TOTAL BODY WORKOUT WITH WEIGHTS","review":"I have been doing Kathy Smith's workouts for about 5 years and the results are great. I have been doing Litf Weights to Loose Weights for about two years (off-and-on) and this workout really works. I don't mind the yelling as much. If you want motivation and want to have fun, then the yelling is for you. I yell and repeat the same words she uses, because it makes my workout fun. If you want to workout and you're not having fun, then why bother. I know that the yelling keeps me motivated.This workout is great for beginners and advance strength trainers. I recommend it to anyone who likes to enjoy a really fun workout."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great video from Kathy Smith","review":"This is a really great video for people who want to get strong and fit and use weigts and not have to spend a day in the gym every day. Its about 48 mins for both workouts and abs and its really great. I felt better after the first week and I do this tape every other day with 3, 5 and 10lb weights. Kathy Smith is the greatest. I dont agree with one bad review she got she is very motivating and who wants to watch a video where someone isnt enthusiastic?? Shes #1 in my book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hate it","review":"Not only does she annoy me with her wailing, but my entire family complains about it. And where's the music? I could deal with her noises but she is terrible at counting, (she even loses count several times)keeping tempo, her transition is so bad I've nearly hurt myself and she uses the term 'pump it' for every move, which can be confusing. This is my first and last Kathy Smith tape. I'm moving on to Tamilee."},{"rating":"2","title":"You will see results","review":"I love it. Is real and is great.I lost weight like I HOPPED and the results were great and fast."},{"rating":"2","title":"Challenging but do-able, well-paced exercise workout.","review":"The pacing is good, fast enough that you don't get bored but each exercise is a challenge. Very efficient. Assumes the viewer does a warm-up prior to the tape.Suggestions for workout at variable levels. Good form tips. Includes a 7 min ab and butt workout and posture tips. Good selection of exercises. With the use of heavier weights as the viewer progresses, this video will be useful for a prolonged program of getting in shape."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lift Weights moves to fast","review":"I enjoy Kathy Smith's videos. I like the aerobic workouts and her voice doesn't annoy me, like it does some people. However, from what I have read on weight lifting, it is more effective if you do the reps slowly. This workout moved way to fast, without a lot of resting in between, if you were doing Track 1 of her system. Also, she cheats too much, running around the room, and not really doing the moves with everyone else. I think they did not show the Track 2 people enough, but the notes to the side of the screen were helpful.I disagree that you need a bench. I used a chair, and a pillow between my shoulder blades as the notes in the video recommended, and I had no problems. However, even with transition time, I felt the lifting should be done slower.After doing the workout, I am more interested in the book she wrote of the same title. I also think I will continue with using the Strong Women books and the Get on the Ball book I own for my weights workout."},{"rating":"2","title":"Do something good for yourself...","review":"buy this video! Do 20 minutes of arms one day, and 20 minutes of legs the next. You can also do the bonus ab section every day if you have time. All you have to do is use lighter or heavier weights for modification.I don't find Kathy annoying at all;she seems to be just a normal person."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything I wanted; nothing I didn't.","review":"Kathy Smith's Dual Track system is very adaptable! I started out with Track One using 12-oz. soup cans for weights. When I got stronger I bought dumb-bells and ankle weights and graduated to Track Two. After a few weeks I felt stronger. After a few months my husband complimented my \\"buff\\" figure and my clothes fit better.This tape has no warm-up. I start with a cardio workout including stretching exercises, so another warm-up and stretch would be a waste of time for me. However, the tape does include post-exercise stretching. There are no \\"dancey\\" maneuvers to follow. What a relief! This tape is suitable for coordination-challenged people like me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Over 50 years of age","review":"Good workout for the over 50 years of age crowd. Just enough to keep you hanging in there. Not too difficult to keep up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great video","review":"I have tried several weight training videos, and this is the best one I've used. I've seen great results in 6 weeks. The tracks are not at all difficult to follow -- I wouldn't recommend for a true beginner, though. The super-setting technique gives you a real burn and I like the flexibility with using different sized weights. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall great workout","review":"I am a exercise DVD junkie and this is a great addition to my library. It is a challenging workout and the perfect addition to Lift Weights Volume 1 - this time around you will hone the muscles you have built from using the first DVD. For those who say there is very little weight lifting, well, you can always pick up some dumbells during the squat segment...there you go!! The warm-up is great but the cool downs are a little weak, and like someone else said, the bonus stability ball workout is totally impossible!! But it's nice to have something you can work up to eventually. The standing upper arm routine is totally comprehensive and you will see results after a couple of workouts."},{"rating":"2","title":"The DVD extras are there!!","review":"If anyone is having trouble finding the DVD extras - including the ball workout - hit the right hand arrow on the bottom right of the first menu screen. That brings you to the 2nd page of the main menu, which contains the rest of the main workout chapters, the abs workout, and the bonus features. The ball workout is a bonus feature - it's not part of the main workout.It's a great workout!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Weight Training With New Intensity","review":"I have been enjoying Kathy Smith's Volume 1 Lift Weights to Lose Weight for more than 2 years. Volume 2 has all of the same elements in a slower more intense format that has given me a new challenge. I was up to 8, 10 and 12 pound weights with the original workout and now have dropped back to 5, 8 and 10 pounds with the intensity of the new routines. The pace is relaxed but the results are great. This workout begins with a warm-up, which was missing from Volume 1 and continues with the lower body routines, the upper body, and finally the abdominals. Lots of stretching in between keeps you limber. I still love the 7 minute bonus abs from Volume 1, and will alternate between both routines. Each DVD is nearly an hour, but can be broken down into smaller increments and done on different days. It's great to have a new workout to enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, but where's the warmup?","review":"This video has a lot going for it. For one thing, you don't need any equipment other than hand weights and a chair to get started. (Those familiar with videos by \\"the Firm\\" will especially appreciate this.) Additionally, the video provides lots of flexibililty. Do upper body, lower body or both at varying levels of intensity. This is all to the good. My problem with the video is this: don't call it a \\"timesaver\\" workout and say it can be done in 20 minutes when you don't include a warmup/cooldown. The TAPE takes 20 minutes, but if you're warming up on your own, you need to add that to your exercise time. This may sound picky, but I think it matters when the tape is specifically titled to appeal to the time-crunched. It's somewhat misleading. Kathy Smith is a wonderful instructor and in great shape, although I'm not sure her chest is God-given, (a minor point, and probably none of my business, but I WAS thinking about it during some of the reps.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Kathy = Confusion","review":"I found this tape to be very confusing. Kathy has about twenty people doing the workout with her and she is constantly jumping around. She is also very annoying, always shouting and hooting.If you want a good wieght workout that also includes cardio try Jari Love's Get Ripped! program. Kathy's workout is also not long enough to get a really effective weight session in."},{"rating":"1","title":"The ball workout was ridiculous and dangerous","review":"I have a stability ball, and have been doing various workouts with it for several years. Her workouts demanded the equivalent of balancing with one toe on the ball and all other limbs in the air doing a unicycle. I fell several times and ended up turning off the tape and moving to my Pilates on the Ball tape, which is challenging but much better-designed. Boo to Kathy for making the ball seem hard to use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why is this woman yelling?","review":"Who is she screaming at? Not me anymore. This tape so annoyed me I tried to contact her company and get my money back - no luck. The actual exercises look pretty good so I went to the trouble of writing them time thinking I could watch and do without the sound, but that grew old very fast. The bottom line: don't buy unless you think shrill, loud yelling is motivating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying","review":"I have tried and tried to use her video but her voice is so annoying that after a few minutes I have to turn it off. Would never buy a tape from her again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Effective, yet annoying","review":"My first Kathy Smith video, and definitely my last.

It is not only for linguists, educational workers and politicians, for any peoples, who interested in the future of humankind, it is also a significant reference. Because, If the language is not longer in the existence, the endangering not only is the linguists, and the whole human beings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Entertaining but Not Nearly Worth it","review":"The DVD is 60 minutes (one hour for you retards out there) and it barely shows anything.

If you wanted to see porn, buy a porno, this is really pointless. the only reason i gave it 2 stars is because it had ICP in it.

Seeing the Gold Edition was out there made me get it again. With the new nations and new campaigns, it's as much fun as I remember. The most trouble for me was as Alexander the Great. Trying to take over the boot of Italy was my downfall.My favorite campaign was the American Revolution. You hone your skills fighting the French, then turn on England and the Spanish, conquer the Indian tribes, which are fun to play themselves as a world campaign, then go to South America to beat the Dutch and Portuguese.All in all, this is a fun one if you like strategy and tactics.

I am a strategy game fan. This game fell way below my expectations. The technologies you can research and create are nowhere near as good as Empire Earths's. The game is slow to load, and slow to unload compared to other PC games. I'm guessing that the organizations that picked this dog for PC game of the year were paid off. The one and only feature that this game has that I liked is that there are no priests, or wizards, to create disasters that wreak havoc on your forces.

Fibers from the inside lining clung to every item I placed in the bag. This was the worst problem. I would have sent it back but weighing the cost & the aggravation factor I decided to see if I could fix it. At first I took a damp sponge & wiped the inside out over & over but there was no end to the small black fibers clinging to the sponge. Then I went all out intending to fix it or destroy it. I filled it with water & scrubbed it with the rough side of the sponge. The outer layer of the lining, which was sort of felt-like, came off almost like paper.

It is well made and has plenty of room for everything I need to carry. Several pockets so I can separate items into needs (ie. cell, note pad, pens, diabetic supplies, medications, even some tools & tape measure). Some reviewers have made negative comments on the smell, I don't have that problem. Yes there is an initial smell, but it's just a new leather smell that any new leather has whether it's a new jacket, wallet, or even leather seats.

Good luck to him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compelling first-rate novel of endurance; hope and reality","review":"With the plethora of novels on today's market, it is indeed a rare experience to read a novel with characters you feel an instant connection to and who cause you to feel that gut-wrenching desire to see them do well as their story unfolds. Mr. Fury jolts his reader onto the scene experiencing, seeing and feeling his characters' story from the very first page. Knowing the story was about boys living in an orphanage run by Catholic brothers in the 1960's, I fully expected to be depressed and saddened after the read. Nothing could have been further from my stereotypical expectation. You'll laugh, cry and ultimately feel uplifted by the spirit of belonging and family that is so eloquently woven into the realities, good, bad and indifferent, of the lives of these orphan boys whose spirit and story stay with you long after you put the book down. Bravo Mr. Furey!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Athens revisted","review":"I used to live in Athens around this time and it was interesting to see the footage again, the Pylon shoots are really cool. The BBQ Killers also steal the show, thanks to the infamous Laura Carter. REM fans will enjoy the footage of the band shot in the Lucy Cobb chapel performing acoustic songs. I don't know if someone who hasn't spend time in Athens would appreciate the movie as much as former residents. As some other reviewers have noted, the 5.1 audio is unplayable, it comes out super distorted. The extras are pretty amateurish and some of the menu items don't work correctly. I would say this is worth renting or borrowing but not buying unless they can fix these glitches.

The creativity is def. still there around town today I feel just the times have changed. Just an incredible little piece that shows what life was like listening to deep alt southern rock back in the days before REM went global.

For someone who now knows she is an intuitive empath, it was a revelation and a confirmation of life to have my own life experiences not only validated but shared by someone else who expressed my own thoughts and feelings as if I had written them myself. It only supports even further, that we are all one in the universe, it is only a lack of awareness that keeps us isolated.I would say that for anyone who is exploring their energetic selves, Positive Energy will give them validation, confirmation, education and exploration of the soul.

We don't know why or how to get going again. We spend too much time trying to recuperate or get back on track. \\"Positive Energy\\" is about getting back on track. When you've reached a plateau, often you need a boost to reach the next level. And sometimes that boost is a new perspective. Judith (forgive the informality, but I feel like friends) brings to light an understanding of the 'inside' us, and how to relate to the 'outside' world. Some of us are too sensitive, but (now I know) in a good way. Once you realize that being sensitive is a good thing, you begin to look at the world like your oyster and your newly discovered trait as the pearl. Thanks again Judith."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fabulous resource for those in the helping professions...","review":"Thank you Dr Orloff!!! I am a mental health nurse & counsellor, and have been a working nurse for 20+ years. This is the first time that I have ever seen any material that addresses burnout in a practical manner, and from an energy perspective. I had never before seen the concepts of \\"intuitive empath\\" and \\"energy vampires\\" articulated so well, and Dr Orloff's work helped me put a name to these phenomena that I had long experienced. There are specific skills & strategies outlined to assist us in developing our own self-care practice. I also very much appreciate that Dr Orloff's credentials are sound (she is a practicing Psychiatrist), and that she effectively marries the academic/professional perspective with spiritual/alternative approaches to healing.

I was rather skeptical at first, but read Chapter 9 on energy vampires. After finishing that chapter, I realized that the depression and exhaustion at work was a result of an energy drain and not regularly replenishing my own energy. The exercises in the book are helpful. You start seeing the world and the people who populate yours in a much different manner. I gained some perspective on the types of people and situations that drag me down and have made some changes in the week following my first read.

A VERY powerful andenergizing book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Terrible video, felt like I went back in time 30 years! Not what I was expecting, at all! I won't use it again, so it was a complete waste of my money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good cardio","review":"I have used this video a couple of times now. It is not super difficult but does give you a good cardio workout. I have another Sperniveral video that is rated as harder, it does take me more time to build up to doing that whole video at the intensity level that coach Troy wants you to be at."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good If you Own a Spinning Bike!","review":"I was mislead to believe this DVD was for spinning bike owners! It is not! If you own a spinning bike with a resistance knob, it is no good for you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"outdated","review":"This may have been a good workout video 15 years ago, I found it very outdated. They are not using spin bikes, they are using bicycles on trainers. Almost completely useless to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"The guy is a sweeb","review":"I just didn't like the instructor. Thought he was kind of annoying and not motivating at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Every Single Page is Stunning","review":"Actually, even every paragraph is stunning. This author, in a dynamic, sensual and sculpted first novel, manages to tell a page-turning story whose every sentence is beautiful. It's a book that should be read slowly and indulgently so that nothing is missed. The story's subject, among others, is art, and the prose almost reads as a series of tiny paintings, so vivid is the language and so powerful are the images. And in keeping with the tale's Japanese heritage, the prose sometimes reads as a series of haiku, so acute is the attention paid to singular moments and to essential objects and to the symbols that surround us in ordinary life. Especially as a first novel, the MCS overachieves, and I can't recommend it highly enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Got a response","review":"I gave a bad feedback for this product and the seller contacted me. I was very surprised. He stated he would refund me for the VHS that was broken. I will wait for the out come and put this into this feedback. I was very impressed with the response on his part, now I will wait for the action. I will keep all of you posted.The seller got a hold of me and gave me a refund and his apologized for the bad tape. I am sorry I did not contact him before my review was written. I see that he is an honest business person."},{"rating":"2","title":"Step workout by Kathy Smith","review":"This is a very good workout, especially if you have not had much diversity in your current routine. It will work your calf muscles to exhaustion and some pretty painful soreness, which is a sign you need to use it! The routine is not always easy to follow but you can always go to the basic step to keep up. It is outdated but the workout is current and envigorating."},{"rating":"2","title":"EASY TO FOLLOW","review":"A good, basic workout. Not too hard, not too easy. Very easy to follow, uncomplicated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fat blaster","review":"I bought this in VHS format back in early 90's. I worked out using this video for 2 yrs 5 x's per week, I just loved it. I looked so great, not an ounce of fat on my body and I developed great stamina. I did, however, do what Kathy recommended against. I did add little hand held1 Lb weights which were the sand wrist weights which I sewed into the tube part of a pair of socks and I just held them in my fist. Later I incorporated parts of Kathy's Lower step workout for more of a challenge. Kathy's videos have been my all time favorites starting way back in the eighty's. A little cheesy sometimes, but always professional and well informed. Love Kathy Smith"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated it","review":"I've done several step videos and enjoyed most of them very much. This one, however, was very difficult to follow and not any fun at all. I would not recommend it to anyone. My favorite step instructor is Gin Miller and her style is very different from Ms. Smith. Much more fun and much easier to follow. Kathy Smith seems to be all about promoting herself and not about helping people achieve better fitness."},{"rating":"1","title":"a different opinion....","review":"I found Kathy Smith to be difficult to follow, and just plain irritating. She makes up her own terminology for familiar steps which make the workout difficult to follow. Her cueing is inconsistent and there are even times in which she is off the beat. Of all of the step workout tapes that I have, I like this one the very least!"},{"rating":"1","title":". . . snore . . .","review":"While you might get a good workout doing this video, it'll only work if you can stick with it and finish it without being bored to tears. It's simple and repetitive, and I couldn't stick with it for more than a few days. Plus, the eighty's aerobic thongs are kind of a turn-off..."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not a work out!","review":"I purchased 2 of Kathy Smith's videos and they are now going to GoodWill. I cannot follow her work-outs. This girl is all over the map and the camera man is more interested in showing us her chest than what her arms and legs are doing. Also, the routines themselves are difficult to follow and extremely jerky. I have other work out videas that are smooth and easy to follow. I do not recommend Kathy Smith unless you feel the need to lose your balance and break an ankle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"I am a beginner stepper. I have attended classes at my gym, but often found myself lost with how quick they moved. This dvd is a wonderful starting point. I have found it easy to follow and I get an excellent workout. I'd recommend it to any beginning stepper!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best workout","review":"I actually love Kathy Smith... but definately this is not her best work!! Way too much dance movement and quick to change from one exercise to the next. I don't feel your body actually gets a good workout. I'm not impressed."},{"rating":"2","title":"2 thumbs up","review":"EXCELLENT video if you are a novice stepper or if you have not been physically active for a while. Step routine is very basic and does not contain a lot of fancy dance moves. This is ideal for the novice stepper who needs to learn or perfect the moves. I am extremely uncoordinated and found this video to be basic, yet effecient. Highly recommended to beginners and those that are out-of shape!!!!!!!!! I am going to try her Power Step video now!"}]`),M={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:E},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:x,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},C={class:"card-container"},O=["disabled"],B={key:0},H={key:1};function W(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=w("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your SNAP 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",C,[(a(!0),i(y,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(a(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",H,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",B,"See more"))],8,O)):b("",!0)])}const N=d(M,[["render",W],["__scopeId","data-v-5dac844b"]]),L=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"glossary/56.md","filePath":"glossary/56.md"}'),R={name:"glossary/56.md"},G=Object.assign(R,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(N)]))}});export{L as __pageData,G as default};
